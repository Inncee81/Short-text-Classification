if your a kid age how do you make money without a job im a kid age and im wondering how make money but im young to have a job so mcdonalds tell me so do u have ne ideas on how make money i had one idea where i went to the cent store bought cases of choclate and sell them for a dollar ne other ideas i know the feeling i'm a year old engineer but remember all too well the frustration of having to wait until i got my first job at mcdonalds the answer to this question is the same regardless of a persons age or ability it will be completely dictated by supply and demand in your area what works in my town may not work as well in yours so i'd suggest asking around to see what's been most profitable for other young adults in your area one thing that cannot be stressed enough is the importance of advertising yourself if you're good with animals then you might want to consider asking your local pet store if you can put up a flyer offering a dog walking service if you know anyone that plays golf then get them to teach you how to caddy over a game or two and then ask your local golf course if you can advertise there it can be a great way to meet local business people which will be invaluable when you're older if there are expensive houses in or near your neighborhood with tennis courts then you might want to try a letterbox drop offering services as a ball boy rich people love to impress others if you can help them do it then chances are they'll pay you more than if you were gardening regardless of what you do always use common sense and let someone you trust know your plans especially when dealing with strangers best of luck you're obviously resourceful and willing to work i'm sure you'll have no problems doing well in life no matter what you wind up doing Game show Supply and demand Caddy Animal Crossing Wal-Mart Wealth Neopets Monopoly (game) Hyperinflation Theory of conduct Social rule Grand Forks, North Dakota Trailer Park Boys Warren Buffett Live 8 Inflation Economics Poker jargon Keynesian economics Avenue Q Contract Education in the People's Republic of China Electronic commerce Tennis Wall Street The Apprentice 2 50 Cent Community emergency response team Pitaten Property (ownership right) Anarchism and capitalism Dot-com Graduate school George Costanza Divorce Knots Landing Externality PE ratio Privatization Professional golf tours Economy of Russia Life insurance Capital accumulation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) New Deal Mutual fund American individualist anarchism Trust (Law) USA Motivation Say's law Illegal drug trade Outsourcing Labor theory of value Motion picture rating system Paul Martin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Socrates The Adventures of Pete & Pete Survivor (novel) Babe Ruth Great Depression Ed, Edd n Eddy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cable television The Fairly OddParents Deflation (economics) Bank Aphasia Airline Flat tax SCO-Linux controversies Tariff Philip J.
