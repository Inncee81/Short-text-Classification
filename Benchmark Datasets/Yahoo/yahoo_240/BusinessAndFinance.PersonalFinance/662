if you filed for bankruptcy at least years already how could you start back to living a better life how could you go about getting loans and so on to start a better life if possible i not sure about credit cards and home loans but after the bankruptcy is discharged you should be eligible for an auto loan the first car you finance after bankruptcy will be at a higher rate than you are used to so i would recommend buying a car that meets you needs in the short term not your dream car i've seen allot of people buy expensive cars right after bankruptcy for a month loan term the problem with this is that after or months the borrower qualifies for a better interest rate but cannot trade or refinance the auto because of the loan to value is to high negative equity if you finance a car with payments that do not exceed of your income for months you should be able to trade in in months and qualify for a better rate whether its a credit card home loan or auto loan you have to get credit to re establish your credit and start living a better life Debt Bond Mortgage Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Insurance Bank Interest Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system United Kingdom corporation tax Real estate bubble Economy of Russia Security (finance) Credit union Finance Personal finance Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Government debt Arbitrage Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Small business Money Credit score 401(k) Taxation in the United States Savings and loan association Auto insurance Financial services Bankruptcy Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Futures contract Short selling Bankruptcy in the United States Asian financial crisis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Article One of the United States Constitution Federal National Mortgage Association Securitization Savings and Loan crisis Inflation Derivative (finance) Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Pakistan Tertiary education fees in Australia Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Refinancing Annuity Stock Federal Reserve Privatization Citigroup Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Mutual fund Financial markets Mergers and acquisitions Schabir Shaik Trial Gross domestic product Credit history Gold standard Capital accumulation History of post-Soviet Russia Food Stamp Program George W.
