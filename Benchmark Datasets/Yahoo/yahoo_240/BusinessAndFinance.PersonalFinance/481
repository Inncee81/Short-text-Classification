is it normal for your landlord to increase rent every year if not is there any thing that we can do about it is it against the law i know you would say buy a house instead of renting but i'm not ready to settle yet it's a normal part of renting each year you should expect your rent to go up some years might be more than others your landlord has to pay property and school taxes and generally those increase every year it's unrealistic to expect the owner to take that money out of his or her pocket so in turn the expense is passed on to you in addition any utilities that you aren't paying are being covered by the landlord and those costs increase each year as well if you owned a home your taxes and utilities would still increase each year Monopoly (game) Renting Taxation in the United States Leasehold estate Leasing Property tax Microeconomics Insurance Economic rent Life insurance Mortgage Rent control Harlem Estoppel Real estate bubble Annuity Irish Land Act Capitalism Tax Neoclassical economics Scottish clan Public housing Anarchism and capitalism Gentrification Warren Buffett Rental agreement Progressive tax Land reform Stuyvesant Town Health insurance Economics Squatting Social Security (United States) Solarquest Intermediate consumption Property (ownership right) Gross domestic product Inheritance tax Operating surplus Absentee landlord Real estate economics Public good Unreformed House of Commons Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) American individualist anarchism Inflation Corporation Value added Dividend Bruce Johnson Capital accumulation Education in the United States California Proposition 13 (1978) Value product Babylonian law Capital gains tax Inventory Privatization Serfdom Mutual fund FairTax Poker jargon Toyota Prius Parasite singles 401(k) Canadian and American health care systems compared Apartment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prostitution in Germany Marriage Publicly funded medicine Sharecropping Paintball Tithe Cerritos, California British residential property market Geolibertarianism Article One of the United States Constitution Profit Sport utility vehicle Social Security debate (United States) Betting (poker) Campaign finance reform Eviction Waste (law) Bond Keynesian economics First-sale doctrine Credit card Accounting methods Mount Sinai, New York Political economy Centrelink Economy of India Deflation (economics) Public policy Supply and demand Hyperinflation
