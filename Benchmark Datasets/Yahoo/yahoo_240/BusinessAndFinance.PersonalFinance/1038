lending money i bring money whenever i go out but i've always got friends asking me to lend them some money because they were too lazy to bring their own i usually have to wait weeks just to get my money back i'm talking about small money whats a good way to tell my friends that i'm not going to lend them money without looking so selfish go ahead and look selfish you can start early before you agree to go out so they won't eat first then can't pay when they say lets go out tell them you only have to spend or whatever and if they say well i don't have any and hoped you would loan me some say sorry i don't have that in my budget my budget is tight now days or if you invite them flat out ask you do you have money to go out i only have but want to go Poker jargon Marshall Plan Economy of Russia Ocean's Twelve Teen Girl Squad Fasting Undergrads Social rule Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Money Economy of Romania The Catcher in the Rye Breath of Fire III Money creation Usury Portsmouth F.C.
