finance question family of four soon to be five is this a sound plan we make a year in iowa we pay on our car loan a month still owe a month on a tsp loan still owe on a separate tsp loan we still owe and about a month to the army on a debt husband was deployed daughter got sick he had to come home and ran out of leave time and kept being paid with the knowledge we would pay back and i have absolutely no idea what we still owe they keep heaping fines on top of it as they dont feel we are paying it back quick enough goes into a retirement account every month into another retirement account every month we pay on our credit cards every month under total we also pay a month ins and a month for life ins we have about a dollar bill for phone cell and internet house is electric gas water we also took out a loan to pay part of our hvac system we have a closing cost refund of about coming in a few weeks and one of our tsp loans will be paid off in weeks with the i planned to pay off of the credit cards the other thousand wont accrue interest for another mo then pay off the hvac loan next in december i would take out a new tsp loan i have to wait days after the other is paid off at a low rate of something depending on the daily market i would take out and pay off everything except the army and use any left over for new beds for all kids and my husband and i if nothing is left over we will wait till tax time last year we got back about something all together then i would make the payments i would otherwise be making towards everything to the house loan to get it paid down quicker half and half into savings as buying the house depleted our savings to zilch we put down we still owe as in the last couple months about has went to capital we are on a fixed rate of and i am paying what i can extra then when taxes come back hopefully we can use them to buy a better vehicle as our mercury villager has seen better days am i crazy what would you suggest our bring home after everything is about a every two weeks sounds like a plan but instead of putting extra toward the house i would first replinish the savings account for emergency funds no sense in putting all of your extra money onto the house to save which isn't really what you are saving see more below and then having an emergency appliance failure car repair etc and having to take out a high interest loan to pay for that which sounds like is what happened when you had to replace the hvac after you get about months of income into the savings account invest the rest maybe start a college fund for each of the kids or add additional to your retirement fund the house is at a low interest rate which ends up being an even lower rate once you consider the tax deduction on the interest it reallly makes no sense to pay off a mortgage early unless you have an outrageous subprime interest rate after you consider the tax deduction your interest rate is really only about you can put your money in a savings account ing direct is currently almost i have several money markets that are and cd's right now can be over so don't earn on it by paying additional on the mortgage when you can and invest it and earn or more also in case you need emergency funds you don't want it tied up into the house where you don't have easy access to the equity by keeping the mortgage you are essentially using their money to make money for you and that is how one becomes rich in this country people don't get rich in this country because of their salary and people don't get rich by scraping pennies and shopping at walmart they get rich by investing wisely and there is nothing wiser than using someone else's money to make money for you Taxation in the United States Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Personal
