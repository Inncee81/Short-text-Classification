why are there higher interest rates on smaller loans i am studying business but i just don't understand this part it says there are statutes allowing higher interest rates on small loans to help borrowers who are in need of funds but can't get loans on interest rates below the normal lawful maximum can anyone explain thanks lol get those automated things out of here i have awesome credit and i am a business major studying to become an attorney just wondering high interest rates tend to mean high risk small loans are often higher risk than larger ones because they are often to individuals without the resources to earn the small amount they need above a certain amount the repayment rate is so low that no amount of interest makes it worth the risk so massive high risk loans are simply out of the question for banks anyway also high interest on a small loan is still not that much interest cash wise that's why there's legislation on how big the loan can be the idea is that the average borrower should be able to eventually pay off a loan even with high interest and get off the debt treadmill without undue hardship above a certain amount of principal that's impossible in theory even with the legally allowed rates generally a person can get into debt beyond their ability to get out but this at least reduces that likelihood hope this helps and thanks for the question it really challenged my brain owen Mortgage Debt Bond Insurance Bank Student loan Monetary policy Credit card Islamic banking Microcredit Finance Capital accumulation Inflation Money Usury Hyperinflation Government debt Collateralized debt obligation Tertiary education fees in Australia Corporate finance Predatory lending Federal Reserve Economy of Russia Savings and loan association Corporation U.S. public debt Bretton Woods system 401(k) Municipal bond Marshall Plan Life insurance Microeconomics Capitalism Financial markets Gold standard Betting (poker) Yield curve Mortgage-backed security Social Security (United States) Arbitrage Intellectual property Islamic economics Security (finance) Lender of last resort Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Developing countries' debt Social Security debate (United States) Money supply Citigroup Mergers and acquisitions Labor theory of value Primerica Financial Services Education in the United States Mutual fund Debt levels and flows Personal finance Tax Interest rate High-yield debt Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Modern portfolio theory Short selling American individualist anarchism Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Pakistan Moody's Great Depression Lend-Lease Publicly funded medicine Minimum wage Free trade Deficit spending Unemployment benefit Theory of conduct Financial services Debt consolidation Stock Wealth Fractional-reserve banking Extreme Programming Privatization Pound sterling School of Salamanca Cost of capital Venture capital Health insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Money creation Investment bank
