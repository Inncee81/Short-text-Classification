do you think i can get a mortgage with this debt my husband and i were really stupid over the last few years and we racked up about k in credit card debt i know it makes me sick to think about it at this point we are focused on paying off the debt so that we can buy a house i'm sick of paying all his high interest and i'm sick of living in this apartment can we get approved for a mortgage and include our credit card balance we are both first time homebuyers and we both have really good credit you should be able to qualify for a mortgage but the amount will depend on your monthly income banks will look at the ratio of your monthly payments to total income as a first time homebuyer you should be able to get an loan fixed rate st mortgage second mortgage or home equity line of credit will likely have a variable rate with little to no down payment saved up my suggestion would be to cancel and pay off those credit cards keep for emergencies as soon as you can even take a second job for a few months if need be then get pre approved for a mortgage determine the monthly payment you are comfortable with don't forget about escrow for real estate taxes and start looking for a house in your price range be wary of mortages with teaser rates that are fixed at a low rate for years and then jump up to a payment that you can't afford my wife and i were in a similar situation a few years ago we bought a house aggressively paid off our credit cards over k at one point and are now aggressively trying to pay off our home equity line proof positive that it can be done best of luck Credit card Real estate bubble Debt Student loan Personal finance Interest Bond Mortgage-backed security Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Annuity Mutual fund FairTax Primerica Financial Services Life insurance Government National Mortgage Association Insurance Islamic banking Predatory lending Derivative (finance) Money Futures contract Economy of Russia Federal National Mortgage Association Bank Taxation in the United States Housing cooperative Security (finance) Capital accumulation Refinancing Microeconomics Annual percentage rate Supply-side economics Collateralized mortgage obligation Great Depression Inflation Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Credit score History of the United States (1918-1945) Collateralized debt obligation Allodial title Finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Savings and loan association Toronto-Dominion Bank Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Cost of capital Gold standard Unemployment Leasing Flat tax Keynesian economics Debt levels and flows Microcredit Bretton Woods system Surplus value Supply and demand 401(k) United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of India Municipal bond Economy of Pakistan Donald Trump Corporate finance History of post-Soviet Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax National Insurance Mergers and acquisitions Debt consolidation Income trust Weighted average cost of capital Poker jargon Progressive tax Capitalism British residential property market Wells Fargo Subsidy British property bubble Money supply U.S. public debt Concurrent estate Tax cut Real estate broker Economy of El Salvador Estoppel ACORN Economy of Chile Title insurance Dividend Variable universal life insurance
