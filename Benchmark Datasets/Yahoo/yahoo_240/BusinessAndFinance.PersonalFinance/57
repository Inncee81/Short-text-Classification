money management and budget software i was wondering if anyone uses money management software to download all of their transactions from the different websites they carry their bank accounts and credit cards i've used both quicken and microsoft money in the past and have been pretty unhappy with both of them because they don't seem to download info from banks very accurately they always seem to have problems lining up with the online balance and their own i just need a reliable program that will allow me to import all of my finances balance my accounts and remind me of any bills that are due you have already named the one i use so i cannot help you from that regard if the downloads do not line up it must be the way you have your software setup rather than the program itself therefore just getting different software probably won't help either sorry Credit card Bank Automatic teller machine Money Personal finance Copyleft Debit card Microsoft Phishing Microsoft Windows Intuit, Inc.
