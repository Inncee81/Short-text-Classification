this is a two part question please answer seriously a what is the most likely way for someone age to become stinking rich b and say that person gets rich what s the most likely way for him to loose all his money every last cent of it and i m not talking about instant riches like winning the lottery but i am talking about instant bankruptcy i m not asking because i would like to become rich or anything i want to write a novel but i first want to figure out a believable storyline so answer seriously and please stay from answers that have to do with drugs or things like that thanks the most likely way is probably not the most creative way to grab reader's attention and interest like the most likely way is that they inherit it win a lottery or lawsuit or get a new idea business or become famous through acting sports or stock trading the most interesting way to tell a story is to grab the reader with something that they would not think about happening like recently someone found a shipwreck with untold fortunes in ancient gold silver and other precious metal coins and artifacts this is very compelling as it could happen to anyone that scubas in an unexpected place as far as losing the money there are the typical ways like gambling divorce liability suits paternity or other claims against the new found wealth but maybe you could work in a natural or terrorist disaster that consumes not only the wealth of the protagonist but those in a region or specific population like an earthquake in san francisco that devastated the market district and the guy's money was invested in a skycraper or something similar believability is a flexible thing depending on each reader most believe that two airplanes caused the twin towers at the world trade center to fall down i don't believe that for an instant now at the time i did also believability depends on how well you support the story line with 'the facts' of the incidents 'are there believable alternatives that cause disbelief common sense rules out a lot of things that sound good but as the plot gets thicker do the story facts play out then as well good luck on that novel which means 'new or unique charlie Insurance Capital accumulation Microeconomics Capitalism Commodity markets Gold standard Theory of conduct Ra (board game) Money Primitive accumulation of capital Deflation (economics) Neopets Wheel of Fortune Arthur Laffer Gambling Frank Herbert Economics FairTax A Course In Miracles Coercion Trade Great Depression September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Dot-com Intellectual property Scrooge McDuck Wealth Contract Anarchism and capitalism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Productive and unproductive labour Theodicy Supernatural Days of our Lives Fractional-reserve banking Goodness and value theory Ethical consumerism Tourism Political economy Species Game show Gross domestic product Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Joker's Wild Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Divorce Labor theory of value Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
