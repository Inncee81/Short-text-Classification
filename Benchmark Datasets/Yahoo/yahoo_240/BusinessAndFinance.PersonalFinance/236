is this wrong is it really so wrong for a married couple to have seperate bank accounts and go halfers on all the bills those kind of details are between you and your husband it's your marriage therefore your business every marriage is unique because the people in the marriage are unique and therefore their relationship does not need to fit some one else's mold i believe a marriage is between both spouses and god and of course the quality of the relationship also affects children if you have them but ultimately it's a decision for your husband and you when i first married i insisted on separate accounts because of my mom's bad experience with my dad re money for us separate accounts were the result of my mistrust but i needed that space in the beginning in order to feel safe after a year or so of marriage i decided i was ready to combine everything and he was too now my husband and i share all accounts and are completely open about all our money we like it this way because we feel more unified for us separate accounts felt like we were keeping ourselves separate from each other in a way that's our personal decision and that is what works for us you don't have to do things the way other people are doing them i think you should do whatever strengthens your marriage and works best for you as a couple if your hearts are not separated by keeping separate accounts and if you are managing your money well this way perhaps it gives you the space you feel you both need to function well then who cares what anyone else says you can't please everyone so please your spouse i think separate accounts are a problem primarily if they are used as secret keepers to hide irresponsible spending which will likely lead to debt and ultimately be a destructive force in your marriage you know yourselves what is the root of the separate accounts is it hiding a deeper issue or is this simply the best solution for how the two of you work Divorce Polyamory Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Polygamy W.I.T.C.H.
