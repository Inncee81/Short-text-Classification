optional liability damage waivers my boyfriend and me are currently renting a lap top from colortyme and we have been paying for the optional liability damage waiver well in june our home was broken into and the crooks stole my laptop and we are still being held responsible for it what i would like to know is what does the waiver cover i am so confused because the manager has lied to me about what i have been responsible for before we put a deposit on a tv but then changed our minds and called to tell him the next morning and he said he would not refund our deposit but then i called the corporate office on him and he was told to give it back to us so i'm not sure if he is just trying to get the money or if we are still responsible if we are then i want to know what the purpose of having the waiver and paying for it was for please help me if i find that i should not be responsible i will take as much legal action against him or the company as do you have a copy of your rental contract and the damage waiver read thru it very carefully it is entirely possible that theft is not included in the damage waiver or there might be certain requirements such as a police report to file a claim damage waivers are very profitable for the rental company they typically have lots of loopholes you probably could have purchased renter's insurance that covered all your belings for a little more than what you paid for the waiver Insurance Auto insurance Estoppel Taxation in the United States Life insurance Plame affair Rental agreement Annuity Lloyd's of London Corporation Public domain Tax Credit card Security (finance) Tort reform Medical malpractice Wal-Mart Intellectual property United Kingdom corporation tax Leasing United States Postal Service Poker jargon Blockbuster Video SCO-Linux controversies Business ethics Microeconomics Bank First-sale doctrine Renting Price discrimination Babylonian law Rental car Karl Rove Xerox Copyright infringement of software Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Islamic banking Enron Corporation Stock Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Warez Creative accounting Church of Scientology Bond Warranty Scientology beliefs and practices Octopus card Corporate finance Bank fraud SCO v.
