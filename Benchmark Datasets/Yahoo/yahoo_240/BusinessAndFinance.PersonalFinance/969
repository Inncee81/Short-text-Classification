can someone please tell me something about car repossessions i was told i could make partial payments just so my car wouldn't get repoed this was just last week well when i call and tell them how much money i have to wire to them they tell me that i have been turned over to a collection agency and that my partial payment may not count is that true i have made arrangements with one person and getting told something else by another also i was told that the arrangments i made with this one lady are not posted into their database what can i do to save my car this car is actually in my husbands name and i didn't realize that we were so far behind he has been deployed and it is my only transportation you are going thru the standard run around what they are trying to do is force you into getting the catch up money any way you can they don't care about anything but getting that full payment they will lie to you cheat you or whatever it takes to get their money that includes lots of threats of legal action and all sorts of things intimidation is their business here's the bottom line they don't want your car they want your money once you make a deal with someone make sure a supervisor is present to the deal and you get a written copy of said deal how long did you wait to call with your estimated payment odds are they don't like the amount and are trying to force you to raise it up also the collections they are referring to is most likely just another department in the same company just send them the payment you have and keep negotiating chances are that eventually you will be able to go back to the original payment but until then don't be intimidated by what they say remember repossession is the very last thing they want to happen no matter what they tell you Poker jargon Insurance Estoppel Internet fraud Theory of conduct Microeconomics Time Out of Mind Bank fraud Surveillance Craps Annuity Plame affair Betting (poker) The Wall Enron Corporation FairTax Polyamory United States Postal Service Islamic banking Gross domestic product Knots Landing Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Social rule Ocean's Twelve Health insurance Child support Plame affair timeline Screenplay Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Blackjack Ben Johnson (athlete) Security (finance) Deflation (economics) Tax Debt Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Credit card Eddie Guerrero Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse The Death Gate Cycle Jon Secada Trade union Divorce She Loves You EastEnders Cheating in poker St. Elmo's Fire (film) Appeal Gold standard 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Copyleft Repo Man A Canticle for Leibowitz Make money fast Money Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Unemployment CPU cache Keynesian economics The Amber Spyglass Armstrong Williams Ashton-Tate IBM PC compatible Donald Neilson Contract Anarchism and capitalism Trailer Park Boys Lottery Jumpstart 3rd Grade Great Depression Bond God Emperor of Dune Transport in Hong Kong Dead Like Me Bank Infantilism Sant Thakar Singh Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Back to the Future Fixed income Dial M for Murder Bretton Woods system Satchel Paige Identity theft The Inside Garth Brooks Rosa Parks Scientology beliefs and practices Futurama (TV series - season 2) James Hanratty Philosophical skepticism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Leasing Life insurance TLC Objective-C Tunisia Campaign Police
