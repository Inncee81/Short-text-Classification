does anyone actually like their bank i hate my bank i don't go overdrawn often only occasionally always accidentally i was running a little tight last week and i forgot about a payment i had made but it had no posted i didn't write it down and i ended up going over everything i had purchased previously had already gone through with no problems i viewed the evidence of this online my bill pay went through last and put the account over the limit the next day i realized what had happened and i deposited some to cover the over the limit and to pay some bills i came straight home and logged onto my acount as soon as i had deposited the money the account showed that the order of payments had been changed so that of the last four payments the bill pay was first and the next four which i had seen process before the bill pay had been listed last so that now all of them had put my account over i went from one legitimate overdraft fee to four of them illegitimate in like five minutes do all banks pull this i mean this is theft the part that really gets me is that they didn't try to get away with adding on these other charges until after i had deposited enough money to cover it anyway the point is i hate my bank the whole thing strikes me as unethical and lacks integrity a bank should be high in quantities of both so far they have refused to help me with this situation so they lack customer service as well does anyone have a decent bank is there such a thing do they all steal from their customers i suppose i can't say the name but this is a nationwide bank with an implication about being of america for the record when i said i don't go overdrawn often i mean that in years of having a checking account i have made an error maybe five or six times over all of those years for those that are implying that i am in some way an irresponsible person i would like to state for the record i work two jobs and generally only get a day off every couple weeks i recently left an emotionally abusive man and it cost me a lot of money to do so i tapped out most of my resources to get away from him which is why things were tight on top of that at the time i made this particular error in judgement i was emotionally distressed due to the fact my new roommate let my indoor only cat out that i've had for six years and he has been missing for the last week so while it is not my habit to run my finances dangerously low it happened so be it so please keep your patronization to yourselves i don't need it and i refuse acceptance of it yea banks are nasty mo fo's this is how they are able to give free checking accounts by harshly dinging the few folks who get caught with little cash flow you have chase huh the stories i could tell Credit card Bank Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Divorce Microeconomics Debit card Cheque Insurance Bank fraud Mutual fund Monetary policy EFTPOS Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate finance Inflation Gold standard Surveillance Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Tax Mortgage Money Money supply Password New York Giants Octopus card Plame affair Extreme Programming Life insurance Short selling Identity theft United States Postal Service Deflation (economics) Contract Finance Health insurance Electronic commerce Personal finance Annuity Publicly funded medicine Procrastination Schabir Shaik Trial FairTax Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Ethics Supply and demand Child support Electronic money Mail fraud Economy of Russia Economics Billboard Hot 100 E-mail spam Student loan Captain Thunderbolt Euro Gross domestic product Satchel Paige Spam (electronic) Debugging Charles Ponzi 1957 World Series Unemployment benefit Detroit Tigers Baseball Postage stamp Citigroup Non-aggression principle Arthur Laffer America Online Article One of the United States Constitution Anarchism and capitalism Neopets School of Salamanca Oil-for-Food Programme Cable television MMORPG Inventory Bond Frank Abagnale EastEnders United Kingdom corporation tax Predatory lending Days of our Lives Taxation in the United States Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Credit card fraud Privatization Theory of conduct Strategic management Fractional-reserve banking Make money fast Betting (poker)
