is there someone who can help my roommate is having serious money issues late on bills alot car repossessed etc is there someone she could see for free that could help her get her life back in order she is only and in way over her head also i don't think she thinks she needs the help but it is so obvious i know a lot more then she thinks i know how could i talk to her about seeing someone without sounding judgmental i agree with going to daveramsey com for common sense advice there are financial peace university classes in just about every town nowadays these classes are very imformative informal and absolutely no pressure she wouldn't have to tell anyone her financial situation or anything like that just show up and learn the classes run depending on where you take the class i promise there is no better advice on having a healthy financial plan as for talking with her you might sound judgmental but sometimes things just need to be said calmly and nicely mention to her that you have noticed her financial problems and that since you care for her as a friend you would like to help her many people are embarrassed by money problems so she may get mad about it let her know that whenever she is ready you are willing to help her get her finances straight do not offer to help her pay her bills though if you do you will probably end up being her cash cow all of this does not matter unless she realizes she has a problem i bet she does but if she truly doesn't you won't be able to help her she has to buy into this or she won't have the discipline necessary to follow through with the budgeting process and debt repayment if she is willing to go to a financial peace class you should join her i promise that no matter how much you personally have it together you will learn more than you can imagine Theory of conduct Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Money Theodicy Debt Supply and demand Friends Philosophical skepticism Government debt Contract Avenue Q Neville Chamberlain Bretton Woods system Personal finance Credit card Mortgage Deflation (economics) Capitalism Craps Stock The Amazing Race Life insurance Enron Corporation The nature of God in Western theology Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Appeal The Ashlee Simpson Show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mad Money Great Depression Piccolo Junior Saga Gold standard Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) About a Boy Health insurance Ocean's Twelve Cheating in poker Ethics Institutional fund management U.S. public debt Student loan Poker jargon Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rent (musical) Publicly funded medicine Finance Pok__mon Live!
