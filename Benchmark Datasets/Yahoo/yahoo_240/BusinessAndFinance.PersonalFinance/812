i rent a room off a friend i've just gone bankrupt and i'm now worried it is going to effect him he owns hou se i'm not his partner nor have any joint finacial commitments will my bankruptcy at his address effect him obtaining credit please help very worried if so any solutions x am in uk or is that how they do it here with n s no i understand what you guys mean by it not being on his file but if he was to try to get a loan say and they do a search would it show up that there is an bankrupt person living there therefor making it look like he keeps bad company or would his current lenders know someone in the house has gone bankrupt there for try to make him pay his debts more promptly see quite complicated cheers guys if you have no financial connection to him ie don't hold joint account your name isn't on any of the bills then it will have no effect so theres no need to worry although years ago a property could get on a blacklist because someone living there had bad credit it was so unfair that the system was changed now debts are registered against a person and not a property however people still believe a property can be blacklisted and the myth continues i can state that properties cannot get blacklisted so you bankruptcy will have no effect on your friend what so over Bond Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debt Government debt Bankruptcy in the United States Credit score Bank Mortgage Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Money Enron Corporation Donald Trump Debt consolidation Predatory lending Interest Temasek Holdings Corporation Finance Annuity Student loan Real estate broker America Online Credit repair SCO-Linux controversies Credit card Estoppel Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Article One of the United States Constitution Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Capitalism Personal finance Monetary policy Insolvency Bank fraud Allodial title Boston and Lowell Railroad Taxation in the United States Unemployment Social Security (United States) Gold standard Financial markets Security (finance) Assignment (law) FairTax U.S. public debt Economy of Pakistan United Kingdom corporation tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tort reform Concurrent estate Citigroup Avenue Q Divorce Great Depression Fraud Neopets Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Economy of Argentina Goodness and value theory MCI Derivative (finance) Credit history Economy of India Real estate Conrail Dave Ramsey Frequent flyer program Schabir Shaik Trial Money supply Asian financial crisis Financial services Theory of conduct Health insurance Rose Garden Arena Canadian Senate Cross site scripting Economy of Russia Credit risk SEPTA Regional Rail Gross domestic product Leasing Federal National Mortgage Association Property tax Tom DeLay Public ownership Tax Debt levels and flows Daewoo Capital accumulation Lionel, LLC Phishing Bretton Woods system Debt bondage Small business Airline Bank of China (Hong Kong) Property (ownership right)
