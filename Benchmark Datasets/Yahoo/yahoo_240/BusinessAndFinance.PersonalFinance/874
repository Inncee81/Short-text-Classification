help to prevent garnishment of children's college savings i have credit cards judgments against me all purchased by an aggressive collection agency legal firm after divorce i live paycheck to paycheck and have checking accounts and keep less than in each they have the sheriff collect on bofa about once per month my question is there somewhere i can save money for my two children in my current marriage so i can build college savings i don't care about money for me i just need to get them through college ages and i do not have money to speak to a professional but maybe some help here and a pointer to the best book on how to protect assets against garnishments i do not have a house no longer own anything of value i cannot pay off all the debt interest and fees required of the collector and cannot afford any payments i must remain under their radar until i can save for college small cashier checks hidden at work will not grow until i can invest them i hope someone can help thank you in advance you can open a college plan in your child's name the iowa one has vanguard as their accounts and is probably the best one you do not have to go to a school in iowa to use it either you can set it up in their name and you should be good to go but you have profound financial problems and you do need some professional help i would start with negotiating the balance the problem though is it sounds like you ignored them long enough to take legal action the truth is most debt agencies buy debt meaning they buy someone else's debt for cents on the dollar so as long as they collect of the debt they are happy this often means you can cut your debt by at least if you challenge the amount but it is likely too late for that if you really want to accumulate money you need to generate cash that can be put into a cashiers check or money order and sent to the plan the iowa plan accepts as low as and it doesn't have to be regular payments either way you need some damage control i see it over and over again parents with lots of debt raise kids who generate tons of debt you need to pay up and show your kids how to pay off debt and save for the future they will learn by your example the best thing you can do ask for contributions from family in leiu of birthday and christmas presents they can write checks that get deposited into the kids accounts this also helps protect kids in case of divorce its sad to see kids drop out of college because parents fight over who pays and the college fund had been raided years before you'll never see a kid more bitter towards their parents Divorce Social Security (United States) Bank Bond Mortgage Money Child support FairTax Personal finance Annuity Bretton Woods system Microeconomics Debt Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Insurance Mutual fund Cheque Hyperinflation Security (finance) Capital accumulation Money supply Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Life insurance Mergers and acquisitions Internet fraud Gold standard Student loan Poker jargon Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Corporate finance Social Security debate (United States) Government debt Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Publicly funded medicine Economy of the United States Derivative (finance) Euro Pension Tax Arthur Laffer Temasek Holdings Interest History of the United States (1918-1945) Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Finance Fiat money Estoppel Bank fraud Legal tender Citigroup Gross domestic product Short selling U.S. public debt Donald Trump Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surveillance Marshall Plan Advance fee fraud Payroll Hillary Rodham Clinton Contract Capitalism Primerica Financial Services Variable universal life insurance Financial services Warren Buffett Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Food Stamp Program Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation The Amazing Race Developing countries' debt Asian financial crisis Betting (poker) Article One of the United States Constitution Kyoto Protocol PE ratio MMORPG Stock Asset National Football League Tom DeLay SCO-Linux controversies Enron Corporation Great Depression Octopus card Babylonian law Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment
