if you are years old what jobs are available like a cashier does anybody know a place i dont think any large establishment is allowed to put a yo on the till its too much responsibility and there is always a real dangerous risk of being held up for the money by theives which at you are not old enough to cope with and are not covered by the company insurance either usually cashiers are staff who started off loading up the shelves and then worked their way up to being a cashier through trust and reliability if thats what you want to do then apply for a saturday job in the storeroom packing things into order and tidying up and see where you go from there good luck ps i also would like to say i think at years old it is very comendable indeed that you are showing such great self initiative and self motivation in finding yourself a part time job well done you Wal-Mart Insurance Mutual fund Life insurance Argos (retailer) Bank Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Aldi Social rule Unemployment 2000 Australian Grand Prix Betting (poker) Unemployment benefit Freeters Lloyd's of London Commodity markets Outsourcing Health insurance Risk management Social Security (United States) Final Fantasy XI Baseball United Kingdom corporation tax Public-key cryptography EastEnders Pitaten Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Rugby union positions Octopus card Labour economics Agent handling W.
