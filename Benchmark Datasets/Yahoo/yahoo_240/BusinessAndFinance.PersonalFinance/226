closing one part of a joint bank account i recently opened a joint bank account with a friend and now my parent disapproves of it i was wondering if i can take my name off the account without actually closing the entire account and do i have to be there when they take my name off of it thanks btw the bank is wamu if that helps he's the primary holde r im just a minor underhis account and i want my own name removed from it you can remove yourself from the account at any time but you must do it in person and provide id etc the reason is that anyone could remove you and the bank could not prove who they were they need to verify your signature etc and you have to provide proof that you are the person named on the account it's simply a matter of signing a form relinquishing your rights to the account the other person on the account will have to go in and sign a new signature card especially if the account had specific signing requirements such as both people must sign cheques and withdrawal slips etc accounts can have either party or both parties just to be certain read your account terms you should have gotten a copy when the account was opened it will tell you if the account must be closed completely to remove you as a joint owner they will also restrict access via atm until a new access code is submitted by the remaining account holder Octopus card Password Automatic teller machine Bank fraud Public domain Public-key cryptography Identity theft Cheque Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Credit card fraud Pretty Good Privacy Euro Trademark Debit card Digital rights management Freedom of information legislation Bank of China (Hong Kong) Concurrent estate Driver's license Bank Surveillance Chip and PIN Life insurance Gmail Cyprus dispute Digital signature Identity document Contract Phishing Copyright Intellectual property GNU General Public License MAME Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 E-mail spam Israeli settlement Patent Polyamory Israeli West Bank barrier Schabir Shaik Trial Traveler's cheque Gold standard Mortgage Enterprise content management Administrative law of the United States Trusted computing Indian nationality law RFID Copyright law of the United Kingdom Australian electoral system Abortion debate 2003 California recall Act of Parliament Plame affair Computer virus Cryptography Copyright infringement of software Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Divorce Forum moderator British monarchy History of British nationality law EFTPOS Corporate personhood Copyleft Estoppel Article One of the United States Constitution Government of France Article Five of the United States Constitution Congress of the United States United States House of Representatives Corporate governance Legal tender Annuity Trust (Law) USA SmartRider Playing card Theory of conduct Constitution of Ireland West Bank Property (ownership right) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Software license Consensus decision-making Fractional-reserve banking Easement Yu-Gi-Oh!
