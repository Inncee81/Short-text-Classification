what can i do to make money to pay my rent being unemployed i'm unemployed and really pressed for money to pay my rent which is already past due what can i do to make up the difference i've tried asking family and organizations but i don't qualify or either the family can't assist me i don't know what else to do i was a victim of katrina and i've tried the catholic charaties but to no avail hi i my heart goes out to you i would suggest that you speak to your landlord and explain your situation perhaps your landlord will be willing to work something out with you to pay the remaining balance of your rent also your landlord would probally rather you be open and forward about not having the total amount at this time and more likely to help you out in the long run you may be avoiding other possible issues such as eviction tarnishing your credit and even a lawsuit i don't have an answer pertaining to what you can do to get the extra money but i hope that what i've posted is of some help and can at least buy you some time until you can get the money take care and good luck scott Leasehold estate Eviction Economics Capitalism Unemployment Estoppel Anarchism and capitalism Great Depression Inflation Insurance Health insurance Labor theory of value Monopoly (game) Microeconomics Harlem Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Public policy Unemployment benefit Betting (poker) Poker jargon Mutual fund Money Deflation (economics) Say's law Bretton Woods system Press Your Luck Abortion debate Babylonian law Capital accumulation CPU cache Surplus value Leasing Wal-Mart Unreformed House of Commons Karl Rove Marshall Plan Barack Obama Prostitution in Germany Famine American individualist anarchism Economy of the United States Walter Scott Surveillance New Deal Debt Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Student loan Michael D.
