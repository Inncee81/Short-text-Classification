my voice well i think i have quite a good voice for singing but the problem is i cant sing too high notes or too low notes i'm in the middle and its really annoying me because most female voices i hear are high so i can't really sing along to some songs without sounding like i'm screaming really badly anyone have any advice on how i can train my voice to go higher at home in my spare time thanks alot i really appreciate it d also why does it crack usually i'm by the way cracking comes from lack of air support if you sound like you are screaming it could be that you are not a true soprano or that you are singing in what is called the chest voice everyday do some kind of vocal exercise extend your range step each week support your voice with lots of air controlled by the diaphram muscle Human voice Equine conformation Trumpet Vocal weight Singing Clarinet The Ashlee Simpson Show Minnie Riperton Saxophone Rod Stewart Coloratura Time Out of Mind Stuttering Joan Sutherland Weight training Vocal range Loudspeaker Countertenor Soprano Vowel Songwriter I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Harp Musical terminology Bohemian Rhapsody Slow Train Coming Shaggy dog story Initiation (phonetics) Girls Aloud Tenor Throat singing Bee Gees Therion (band) Phonation Sheryl Crow Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Freddie Mercury Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Blonde on Blonde Transposing instrument Quarashi Hansel und Gretel International Phonetic Alphabet Clef Bing Crosby The Chemical Brothers Pink Floyd Alto (voice) Trombone Urinary incontinence Boy soprano Street-Legal Timpani The Basement Tapes Rent (musical) The Empty Child The Emancipation of Mimi Stop consonant Reservoir Dogs English grammar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) A-ha Liam Gallagher Bluetooth Christina Aguilera Blackfoot music Musical Instrument Digital Interface Flute Highway 61 Revisited Carpenters Alto horn Tonality Please Please Me Guqin Roxette Formant Traumatic brain injury Basso Mike Watt Baritone Castrato Whale song Voice-tracking Philadelphia Eagles Jim Steinman Whistle register Garth Brooks Jon Secada Tom Waits Blood on the Tracks Caller (dance) Music Marching band Marvin Gaye David Lee Roth Judas Priest Ashanti (singer) Pet Sounds
