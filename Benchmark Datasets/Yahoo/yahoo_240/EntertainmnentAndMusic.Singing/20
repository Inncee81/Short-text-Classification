i would like to sing but i think i am too young and i am scared to sing in front of anyone but my family i can sing infront of my family and sometimes my friends but i am too scared what can i do to get rid of my fear i am also only years old too young pfft there's no such thing as too young to sing think about that one girl that one america's got talent she was only i think most professional singers say they've been singing as long as they can remember just go for it as for being scared to sing there's nothing to be scared about believe it or not when your voice changes tones when you ask a question or imitate somebody or whatever you're singing singing is pretty much just changing tones and notes and stuff while you're talking there are plenty of techniques you can google or get from a teacher to help with stage fright don't worry about it it is very common think of it this way if everyone would be scared to sing where would the world be right now it is said that music helps you through hard times and has gotten people through events and it's inspired so many people if every body was afraid to sing where would that inspiration or help be and would it be as effective if people like beyonce or mary j blige etc etc was too scared to ever put their amazing talent out there i would be missing somethin in my life there was this woman i knew that had an amazing voice and her son died and she then didn't want to sing because it would remind her of her son she eventually had a few things happen medically that made it so she could hardly talk let alone sing singing is an amazing gift and if you don't use it god will want it back haha put it out there who knows what will happen good luck Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Milton H.
