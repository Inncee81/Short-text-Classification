what are some good songs that i can sing too im good at singing to like kelly clarkson and rihanna songs that you are comfortable singing are what will impress your audience but if you go too far it could just end up corny believe me experience try songs by mariah carey kelly clarkson and maybe even whitney houston if you have the vocal range also try looking up a singer named nina she's from the philippines but all her songs are in english she has a style like kelly clarkson too it always depends on your vocal range you want to make your performance sound pleasing to the ear and you don't want to try hard a few facts don't ever try and clear your throat before singing unless it's mandatory drink lukewarm water not cold and try a menthol mint before going up on stage just make sure you finish it before you sing figure out what song suits each occasion and choose your singer it also depends on the mood of your voice if you're looking for lower vocal range then aim for songs by rihanna but by the way you said that you sing like kelly clarkson i'm guessing you do have the range look up some country singers too like faith hill or carrie underwood also if i ain't got you by alicia keys is a good song i hope this was helpful karina Mariah Carey Billboard Hot 100 We Belong Together Whitney Houston Rhythm and blues Single certification Emotions (album) Sales and charts achievements for Mariah Carey Christina Aguilera Mariah Carey (album) Kelly Clarkson Remix Adult contemporary music American Idol Marvin Gaye Boyz II Men C__line Dion Whose Line Is It Anyway?
