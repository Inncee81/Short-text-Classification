abeka vs theme curriculum for pre k my daughter has been in preschool since age with the theme curriculum and has done well for this upcoming school year the preschool her pre k year is offering either abeka or theme curriculum what are your thoughts on either what type child does well in each curriculum any help would be great thanks lb my son is going to take abeka course this year at a private preschool ironically i teach public preschool with a thematic curriculum i think it would be good for him in either environment he cannot come to my school b c he does not qualify financially through the state i work alongside a teacher who taught abeka in the private schools she said it is an excellent course up until about st grade because it is really strong in the phonics and focuses on getting the children to learn to read quickly after that she would recommend going to a more standard curriculum in nd abeka focuses on core curriculum recognizing letters and sounds led by teacher guidance and working out of a workbook but the children learn to blend letters and read quickly and at their own pace my son's class will also have center time and recess and other fun things but sections of the day are disjoint from other sections ie worktime from playtime thematic is more integrated learning it can be good but there is also a downside i have noticed many parents of smarter kids wanting me to push the reading and some children in class just aren't ready yet and it is harder to individualize learning with this type of curriculum we mainly focus on coloring cutting gluing learning letters and colors and shapes and numbers within the context of the theme we may have bear week and the children learn about bear habits and hibernation and get to bring their teddy bears all while learning about the letter b and the number for three bears they may play bear games and get to do bear crafts cutting coloring and gluing thematic learning is entertaining for the children but the advanced ones get held back if they already know the basics it is really up to you i would base it on where my kid was academically and pick the environment which you think is best so they have pros and cons i hope that helps Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Education in the United States Homeschooling No Child Left Behind Act Education in Taiwan Education Kindergarten A Course In Miracles Phonics Education in Germany Bah__'__ Faith and Education Sesame Street Education in Singapore Waldorf Education Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Secondary education in Japan Intelligent design movement Education in England Teach the Controversy Early childhood education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Law school Education in Albania JumpStart Education in Portugal Education in Australia Teacher Education in Romania Alexander Technique Education in Hong Kong Danish Folkeskole Education GED Dyslexia Independent school (UK) Miami-Dade County Public Schools Literacy Master's degree Experiential education Medical school McGuffey Readers Extreme Programming Suzuki method Separation of church and state Motion picture rating system Public education Far Eastern University Tripartite System Franklin W.
