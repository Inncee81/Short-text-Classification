my son starts preschool my son should start preschool in sept but i am curious see he is really smart he turned three in april he knows his abc's and can count to almost he can recognize letters and number when they are written he spell his names has a few books memorized and can read a few words he sees regurly he can draw the circle and square and straight line and stuff like that he can sing every kids song ever word for word he knows alot but see i don't know what else to teach him i don't know where he need to go next will the preschool teach him new things or are the things he already knows standard we haven't tried to force him i think he just really likes to learn he does interact with kids he has lots of cousins and my friends all have kids but not large groups like at preschool he loves to get me to read aloud to him when i am readin myself and i don't try to presurre him to learn anything when we are practicing things if he gets frustrated or starts pretending not to know things that i know he does i stop immediatly because i understand he is tired of doing it your boy seems to be quite a guy it really does teach children more than you think preschool is more for life than for education or at least that's how i remember it it taches your boy a lot of cool new stuf like crafting and other fun things your son is very intelligent but i suggest you send him to preschool just in case The Electric Company Friends Mnemonic Sesame Street Rich Mullins Education in the United States About a Boy Our Gang Milton H.
