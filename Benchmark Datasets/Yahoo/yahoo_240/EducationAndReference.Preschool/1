what can i do concerning my yr old son's school here in ontario he was diagnosed almost a year ago of diabetes insulin depandant but doesn't need insulin during school so far my yr old daughter is starting kindergarten half days last yr went to his school daily at his lunchtime to give him his lunchtime blood sugar test which is only a prick in the finger of course i was willing to do it anyways the school does not want to do his blood sugar test and my daughter will be starting junior kindergarten which is half days so it will be pretty busy any good suggestions of how i can get the school to do an easy blood sugar test to my son any help would be very much appreciated thanku i'm going to assume that like many schools his school does not have a nurse who have you talked to principal his new teacher the school secretary i'll assume you've talked to all of them if not ask to have a meeting before school starts to discuss the blood sugar test they probably don't want to take on the responsibility what if they misread the test cause an infection do it wrong probably all kinds of scenarios running through their minds i don't see how it would be any different than giving prescription medication maybe if you have a letter from the doctor and tell them you will train your child and school personnel in how to administer the test it's possible there's something in your school or school district policies that forbids it but i don't know have you ever gone to www todaysparent com try asking in the parenting forums there i know there are parents there who have children with diabetes and are also from ontario or at least from canada they might've run into the same situation i'd try posting in general ed and families with special needs maybe even kids health and safety introduce yourself in community chat and ask people to check out your post in the appropriate forum good luck Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Insulin resistance Hyperglycemia Medicine Prostate cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Insulin Education in the United States Growth hormone treatment Medical prescription Nurse Glucose meter Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kindergarten Gastroparesis Education in the People's Republic of China Childbirth Alzheimer's disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physician Atkins Nutritional Approach Ben Johnson (athlete) Terri Schiavo Clinical depression Polycystic ovary syndrome Medicare (Canada) Ferret National Institutes of Health Intensive insulinotherapy Breastfeeding First aid Blood donation Obstetrics Social rule Dentistry Glycogen storage disease type I HIV test Folic acid Soft drink Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Autism Urinary incontinence Frederick Banting Food and Drug Administration Post-traumatic stress disorder Milton H.
