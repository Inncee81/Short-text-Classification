why won't my year old potty train she just turned july th i bought her underwear i did the happy dance i did the treats they don't work she'll tell me that she's wet or poopy after the fact but never before the fact she has gone potty a few times but only if her older sister goes with her stupid comments don't need to be left thanks well my daughter is three and a half now she has been completely potty trained for three weeks she too would tell me after the fact that she had used the bathroom on herself you've said that you have done all the treats happy dances etc i'm not sure what else to suggest sometimes they just do it in their own time a few things that worked for my daughter were to actually let her pick out her own underwear and i promised her i would throw her a party with balloons and cake if she would use the potty when she had to go that was all it took for her unfortunately my son was four before he was trained eventually i had to tell him that he could not go to preschool unless he started using the potty that's all it took for him good luck Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet humour The Fairly OddParents Elimination communication Phoebe Buffay's songs Shit The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bloody Stupid Johnson Knots Landing Social rule Ron Weasley SpongeBob SquarePants Sharon Tate The Catcher in the Rye Pittsburgh Steelers Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Ranma __ characters Rocko's Modern Life Paul Is Dead Negima Mario Cincinnati Bengals Samuel Goldwyn Peanuts Garfield Toilet training Dancing at Lughnasa Japanese toilet Craps Avenue Q Birthday Little Britain Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Dead Like Me Pok__mon Live!
