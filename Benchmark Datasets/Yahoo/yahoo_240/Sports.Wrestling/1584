if you need on ly one ac recource and ground why there is in electrical plug ok so there are three prongs if the ground is toward the bottom then the positive is to the left and the negative is to the right for electricity to work you need a positive and a negative in the electric world positive electrons goes to negative like a magnet so the negative prong draws the positive electrons from the outlet via through the device the movement of the electrons is called current without one of the prongs the device would not work because there would be nothing to draw the electrons that give the power Vacuum tube Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electricity Current (electricity) Oscilloscope Diode Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Magnetism Dirac equation Fuse (electrical) Electronics Electron Capacitor Double layer Anode Spark gap Hall effect Peltier-Seebeck effect Volt Circuit design Dipole Langmuir probe Universal Serial Bus Electric motor Seismometer Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Three-phase electric power Residual-current device Antimatter Electromagnetic field RS-232 Electric charge Transistor Corona discharge Semiconductor device Thermal power station Kristian Birkeland Superconductivity Jack plug Electrical element Electrode R-Type High-voltage direct current Battery (electricity) Binary numeral system Magnet Ignition system Cathode ray tube Flux STS-61 Electrical resistance Bass guitar Lightning Graphics tablet Phonograph Power line communication Solar cell Electronic amplifier Alternating current Resistor Plasma (physics) Solar wind Transformer Universal Century Technology Transmission line Carbon nanotube Magnetic field Electrical engineering X-ray tube Semiconductor Operational amplifier Linear particle accelerator Photoelectric effect Impedance Gas tungsten arc welding Fusor Spark plug Permittivity Electronic power supply Extension Cord Broadcast television system Electric power Silicon Electronic music Cyclotron Muon Electrical conduction Feedback Ohm's law P-n junction Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Nickel-cadmium battery Amplifier Effects pedal Antenna (radio) Fluorescent lamp
