has jim ross ever been such a hypocrite like he was lately or does he think cena fans are stupid here is what jr had to say cena haters adults especially but any one dropping f bombs at john cena or anyone else at a wrestling event is a classless gutless jerk using profane language in the presence of women and children is unacceptable in my view violators should be tossed if they are heard spewing such garbage if parents allow their kids to have dirty mouths because they think their kids are cute when they curse are not good parents i feel fans should be able to boo who in the heck they want and even write posters indicating such as i think that makes for good organic tv but overt profanity in a public gathering dotted with families is not the place to use foul language so he thinks it ok that cena has finishers called fu and stfu comes to the ring and uses terms like cameltoe or back in the day when he used to encourage the crowd to finish his little raps with the rhyming foul word of choice maybe its even ok for wwe to have cena shirts that say ruck fules does he think people are stupid enough to not know what these are essentially saying yes another good example from rocco jr is a very old fashioned conservative guy i happen to agree that profane language in the presence of women and children is despicable but nowadays it's pretty common to see women and children who do it themselves i think jr is living in a fantasy world where that doesn't happen and it's different when the stars do it because they're all on the payroll together John Cena Eddie Guerrero Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling slang John Layfield WrestleMania XX Carly Colon Kurt Angle Profanity Taboo Tuesday Hulk Hogan Extreme Championship Wrestling Professional wrestling throws Jason Reso WWE Draft Chris Jericho WWE Vengeance Paul Levesque Paul Wight Motion picture rating system Trailer Park Boys World Wrestling Entertainment Stone Cold Steve Austin Montreal Screwjob About a Boy WrestleMania 21 The Marshall Mathers LP WWE Championship Euphemism Professional wrestling World Championship Wrestling WWE RAW Royal Rumble The Jim Rome Show Ric Flair Television rating system Survivor Series Suplex Kylie Minogue The Rock (entertainer) WWE United States Championship Professional wrestling aerial techniques Shit Laura Schlessinger Leon White Hell Michael Hayes (wrestler) ECW One Night Stand Professional wrestling attacks WWE Judgment Day Powerbomb Kodocha WWE Unforgiven Rugby union Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Brian Kendrick Mark Copani Fuck Babe Ruth SummerSlam Sean Coulthard The Lord of the Rings NWo Time Out of Mind Ren and Stimpy Ranma __ characters Ren__ Goguen WWE Homecoming WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
