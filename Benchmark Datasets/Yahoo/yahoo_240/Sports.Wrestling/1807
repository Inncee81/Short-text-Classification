ugh my account got deleted wich tottaly sux but ne way my question is what happened to armando estrada my bad typo totally lol they took him off of umaga saying he was injured by lashley during the vince trump feud only because there were too many people involved i'd guess vince didn't want estrada outshining him i'd always heard that the plan was to bring him back after it ended but with umaga turning face now who knows what armando'll be up to i'd put him with a heel lashley so we wouldnt have to hear the lashhole talk anymore but thats just me d Mark Calaway Virgil Runnels III Vince McMahon 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Shawn Michaels Bret Hart Paul Levesque Kurt Angle World Championship Wrestling Page Falkenberg A.J.
