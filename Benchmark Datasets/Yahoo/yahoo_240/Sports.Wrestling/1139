shot despite being cud stars you are getting a shot tonight on beatdown but to get that shot you will have to face ronald mcdonald grimace the hamburgler in a handicapped match if you win that you will face pooh piglet on cud and you re match is now as jong garfield got out of the ring ronald s team attacked king big mac from behind ron s team was dominating the whole time grimace had mac in the corner and charged at him with a spear but mac jumped up right onto grimace s head to set up a big mac smackdown pedigree on him brb he pinned grimace but ronald came in king came in and hit a crowning moment rko on him to allow their team to get the win as they were celebrating pooh piglet came out and hit them with their titles ronald s team joined them in an all out attack as we go to break daffy lancelot faced marvin in champ chavez it was a great match marvin chavez were dominating the whole match chavez had lancelot in the corner and was beating on him relentlessly until the ref pulled him away as the ref was distracted marvin took out his gun and tried to hit lancelot with it but instead lancelot grabbed it and hit marvin with it multiple times until he fell off the ring in a pool of blood he sprinted towards daffy to get the tag daffy charged chavez and beat him until he was virtually helpless he then locked in the duck bill until he faded the ref gave daffy lancelot the win we go to han solo vs casper after that it was a great match brb han solo was dominating the whole match with a message to send to hugo chavez he had casper down and was on the top rope about to hit the aerial assault just as he was about to jump an angry hugo chavez came out and pushed him off this got casper dq d but they didn t care as they double teamed him hugo got a window pane from
