tna craze how to improve it what is with this whole tna craze i mean they do have kurt angle and samoa joe but that doesnt make up for a crappy show i've tried to watch it twice beacause they were highly hype it is just a mess and the matches are very boring and alot of stubid gimmicks no offense but sharkboy i dont know what evey one is saying about it being the future it is strange i live in orlando and went to a free show the paid me and my brother to wear a tna shirt they guy behind me got paid to cheer john cena that is pathetic ecw is even better than it but thats anough bagging howabut yuor thoughts of tna and what you would do to improve it hey im not saying that wwe is perfect but it has a little more class than tna that doesn't drug test for example test got fired due to steriod use and then flocks to tna please stick to the question though comparing tna to wcw is a huge thing wcw had real wrestlers like bret chris eddie jericho and so many others and as far as i remember wcw went bankrupt and got bought out by thier dreaded rival what tna should do is make the impact shows hours instead of tna shows a lot of promise and since wwe is getting kinda boring tna is shining a lot more on the other hand tna can be lame at times the tna chants from the crowd are total knock off of the ecw chants i'll never forget the one show when one of the commentators called the ultimate x match the most dangerous match in professional wrestling i think just about any wrestling fan in this section could name many matches that are far more dangerous Professional wrestling slang Kurt Angle World Championship Wrestling Extreme Championship Wrestling John Cena Professional wrestling match types John Layfield Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Hulk Hogan Eddie Guerrero Chris Jericho Scott Levy Chris Benoit Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling Page Falkenberg A.J.
