am i the only person who thinks wwe having three world champions is ludicrous i can understand maybe having three respective champions on the shows but i think there should be only one world champion it makes no sense to me for wwe to have three i think they should have this setup with the titles one world champion one tag team championship women's title cruiserweight title three mid card champions aka the champions of the three shows does anyone agree i think having three world champions is fine i mean the wwe is packed with superstars who should get their first or more world title reigns if there were one world champion there wouldn't be much accomplishments amongst superstars in the wwe the average feud is months maybe if the feud is good enough that would mean with world title that we would get probably or world champions per year if it changes with each feud it would be crazy to see person have the only world title in the wwe after ever feud ie cena if whc ecw champ didnt exist i think it will also be crazy to have the titles change hands every months i like change but that would be a bit too much so in conclusion having three world titles keeps the excitement flowing even if one title stays with a champion for months cena and it gives many other superstars their chance to shine Eddie Guerrero John Cena Chris Jericho John Layfield Kurt Angle Scott Levy WWE Draft WWE Championship Yoshihiro Tajiri Shawn Michaels Stone Cold Steve Austin World Heavyweight Championship World Wrestling Entertainment WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
