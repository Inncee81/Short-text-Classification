what is the point of carlito involving into orton cena feud it looks like that carlito is involving into the main ecent of summerslam why doesn't vince have a sense i know carlito is cool but he is too much involved into orton cena feud he should feud with umaga for ic title at summerslam what do you think the short version umaga was a heel until this monday night raw in order for him to turn face he had to help a face wrestler cena tag match next monday leads to umaga vs carlito at ss which was probably supposed to be umaga vs hardy carlito getting involved was just a basic wrestling storyline where a face wrestler is outnumbered plus it would give reason for a umaga vs carlito match since they wouldn't do a heel vs heel match there is only two more raws before summer slam plus all the major face single wrestlers are out except cena carlito getting involved added to the cheating heel for orton as well as of now we only have the two title matches and two return matches and probably mvp vs matt hardy since jeff messed the other match up they needed a way to get a ic match and this quick storyline was it guess not so short Ric Flair Paul Levesque Mark Calaway Carly Colon Glen Jacobs Hulk Hogan Chris Jericho Paul Wight Stone Cold Steve Austin Adam Copeland Amy Dumas WWE RAW David Bautista Roddy Piper Matt Hardy Randy Orton Mick Foley Chris Benoit Jason Reso John Layfield Randy Savage The Rock (entertainer) Professional wrestling slang Bret Hart A.J.
