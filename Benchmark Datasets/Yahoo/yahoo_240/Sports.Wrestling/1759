who do you guys think will win at summerslam randy orton or john cena p s im going to summerslam thats a hard one because if orton wins triple h will come in and step up to him maybe but if cena wins then it could be triple h and cena taking it out but cena should lose because he might make movie and if he does he will have no choice but to lose his title because he can't wrestle and be a movie star at the same time but he made the marine but was diffrent to now right now i am going to vote orton even though i don't like him there some time that i like him like when kicked those guys in the face i got off on that John Cena Eddie Guerrero Evolution (professional wrestling) Randy Orton David Bautista Paul Levesque Mark Calaway WrestleMania XX Kurt Angle SummerSlam John Layfield WWE No Mercy Taboo Tuesday Adam Copeland The Rock (entertainer) Hulk Hogan Carly Colon WWE Unforgiven WrestleMania 21 Chris Jericho World Heavyweight Championship WWE Championship WrestleMania Chris Benoit WWE RAW Bob Orton, Jr. Glen Jacobs Ric Flair Booker Huffman Stone Cold Steve Austin Brock Lesnar Mick Foley Professional wrestling attacks Jason Reso Survivor Series Orlando Jordan Suplex Roddy Piper Music in professional wrestling Paul Wight WWE Armageddon Professional wrestling throws WWE Homecoming Greg Valentine Stacy Keibler Rodney Anoai Leon White WWE Draft Neckbreaker Professional wrestling slang Randy Savage Rob Conway Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Rock 'N' Sock Connection WWE Intercontinental Championship Elimination Chamber Jimmy Hart Solofa Fatu Ricky Steamboat WWE Judgment Day WWE United States Championship Bret Hart Ohio Valley Wrestling Royal Rumble Mark Copani Brothers of Destruction NWo Virgil Runnels III WWE Backlash Chris Kanyon WCW World Heavyweight Championship Professional wrestling match types Peter Senerca Matt Hardy Bill Goldberg Shelton Benjamin A.J.
