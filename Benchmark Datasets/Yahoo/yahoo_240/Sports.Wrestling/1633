anybody that u used to be a fan of but u are not anymore if who who is it why did u stop being a fan why were u a fan of him her in the st place and when did u stop being his her fan i got a few john cena because he always over comes the odds and holds on the title for too long because he was a underdog he had a cool gimmick then wrestlemania batista because he gets title shot after title shot and is always in the whc title picture and never lets anybody else have a chance at the top and when i learned he treats his fans like crap because he was a good face he is a powerhouse and is a great performer backlash and there are others but im running out of room for details and please dont choose benoit because of what he did remember tell me which person your not a fan of anymore the reason u are not a fan anymore reason u were a fan of them in the st place when did u start hating thating this person well your not getting a thumbs down from me i gave u a thumbs up yes orton is in my top favorites but atleast u gave good reasons to hating him if u just give great thoughts u get a thumbs up its not by my opinion it's so weird saying this but when cena debuted in the wwe i was a pretty big fan of his because he got his new gimmick and he always overcomes all the odds and he's held the title for waaaaay too long well i usually love heels so when i saw cena in ovw prototype i really liked his gimmick and his attitude and you know whats weird when randy was accepted into wwe his last match in ovw was against cena and the funny thing that i do regret now is that i had no idea who i wanted to win cena won the match though at the time i was happy for him but now i think differently of him i stopped being a cena fan after wrestlemania when cena won the title i was hoping for cena to win the title from j b l because j b l had held it for so long but if i knew that cena would be the one to break j b l's title reign i wouldn't have cared who won batista this i was a big fan of his when he turned face and then went on to getting all these title shots that made me think twice about batista when he was in evolution i loved him he was the animal he had a bad ss attitude i found him more entertaining and he was going for titles like the intercontinental championship and the tag team championships instead of the world championships also in ovw he had this great gimmick and he was in the stable disciples of synn he was then known as leviathan near summerslam because that was batista's title reign that went on for awhile great question yeah i've got others aswell but these are the main ones starred The Rock (entertainer) WrestleMania 21 Hulk Hogan WrestleMania XX Adam Copeland Ric Flair World Wrestling Entertainment SummerSlam Paul Wight Booker Huffman Mick Foley WWE No Mercy WWE Championship Bret Hart Page Falkenberg WWE Judgment Day WrestleMania Survivor Series Taboo Tuesday Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) WWE Armageddon Brock Lesnar NWo WWE Unforgiven World Championship Wrestling Virgil Runnels III WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
