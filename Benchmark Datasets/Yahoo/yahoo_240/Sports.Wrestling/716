what was i r s irwin r scheister doing on raw i dont usually ask q's in this section and dont always catch raw but what was irs mike ratundo doing on raw in one of the scenes i understand vince was talking about the irs i guess my question was will he have a role in any of this obviously it was a joke based on vince being audited by the irs really he is a road agent for wwe a road agent basically travels with the wrestlers to shows and acts as a rd party between the wrestler and management they also are in charge of making sure that everything is running smoothly backstage they may have input on storylines and may also help out with the training of wrestlers that's why you see so many former wrestlers on the shows they are most likely road agents there are several for each brand dave WWE RAW Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Trish Stratus Eric Bischoff Shawn Michaels Hulk Hogan Vince McMahon Kurt Angle World Wrestling Entertainment WWE Draft Paul Levesque Montreal Screwjob Adam Copeland Professional wrestling slang Diva (professional wrestling) Paul Wight World Championship Wrestling Chris Jericho Bill Goldberg John Cena Royal Rumble Shoot (professional wrestling) Bret Hart David Bautista Ric Flair Extreme Championship Wrestling Jim Ross Carly Colon The Invasion Randy Orton Nelson Frazier, Jr. NWo WWE Championship WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
