what if since cena is suppose to lose the title at summerslam to make a movie i was just wondering do you think they would make cena a heel when he came back people are booing him as a face it would be more interesting for him to come back as a heel and why would they ever want umaga to be a face it was cool that he turned on carlito and randy orton because it was unexpected but now that he's turned face he's gonna get boring just my opinions not trying to bash any wrestlers oh and how long do u think umaga will last as a face for umaga not as long this might be a link for a heavier heel feud cena in my opinion may be a heel there might be a chance and without a doubt it will get interesting i'd prefer cena to be a face than orton no offense though but orton is not convincing as a face as for cena convincing to the point he's hated already Eddie Guerrero John Cena Carly Colon Hulk Hogan Ric Flair Shawn Michaels Stone Cold Steve Austin Mark Calaway Kurt Angle Evolution (professional wrestling) Paul Wight Randy Orton John Layfield Roddy Piper Chris Jericho David Bautista Randy Savage Booker Huffman Professional wrestling attacks WWE RAW Adam Copeland Jason Reso Professional wrestling slang WrestleMania WrestleMania XX WWE No Mercy WWE Vengeance Chris Benoit Glen Jacobs Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Heel (professional wrestling) World Championship Wrestling Neckbreaker Mick Foley WWE Homecoming Matt Hardy WrestleMania 21 Page Falkenberg Leon White Taboo Tuesday Suplex Rodney Anoai 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Kayfabe Nikita Koloff SummerSlam Greg Valentine Paul Orndorff Professional wrestling throws Montreal Screwjob Bret Hart Aurelian Smith, Jr. Orlando Jordan Music in professional wrestling Jon Heidenreich WWE Championship Rob Conway Survivor Series NWo Michael Hayes (wrestler) Professional wrestling match types Shelton Benjamin Mark Copani Ted DiBiase World Heavyweight Championship El Hijo del Santo Professional wrestling holds WWE Unforgiven Turn (professional wrestling) Kevin Sullivan (wrestler) Charles Ashenoff Solofa Fatu World Wrestling Entertainment Bob Orton, Jr. Ron Garvin Ricky Morton Debra Miceli Harley Race Ernie Roth A.J.
