what does everyone think of umaga turning full face finally i thought it was funny him kicking the crap out of carlito but what do you think i used to be a huge wrestle head up until like a year ago out of sheer boredom i watched it the last weeks umaga has grown into one of the most important people in that company he's agile for a big man and he can carry a match if needed now understand that people are going to cheer for who they want i don't believe in faces and heels anymore i personally look for entertainment value and skills in a wrestler face or not it seems to me that wwe is lacking talent in the main event face department right now could be why he's turning face but if that's the case i have to agree with the other guy he's a monster face monsters grow stale fast Shawn Michaels Paul Wight John Cena Hulk Hogan World Wrestling Entertainment Carly Colon World Championship Wrestling Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling slang Ric Flair Paul Levesque Glen Jacobs Chris Benoit Professional wrestling Roddy Piper Leon White Kurt Angle Vince McMahon Bret Hart WWE RAW The Rock (entertainer) Stone Cold Steve Austin Professional wrestling holds Yoshihiro Tajiri Professional wrestling attacks Brock Lesnar NWo Mark Calaway Gregory Helms Professional wrestling match types ECW One Night Stand WCW Monday Nitro Mick Foley Extreme Championship Wrestling Tag team Randy Orton Heel (professional wrestling) Lance Storm Matt Hardy Chris Jericho Jim Ross Amy Dumas Sting (wrestler) Taboo Tuesday Shelton Benjamin Darren Matthews Trish Stratus Suplex WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
