why do you all hate cena for things that are not in his control you all hate him because hes holding the title too long you all hate him because he talks to much you all hate him because he has no wrestling skills he cant help it that the wwe script writers are making him worse or is it better to ron s he does not spazz thats what the wwe made him do well his wrestling ability is just up to him i mean if he wrestles like rey mysterio it wouldnt match up with his character right and same with orton u could say he is good or bad but he is just wrestling to fit in with his character a cheating style where as john cena is like brawler style i believe that i am the only one left that respects john cena he doesn't have a problem with injurys he's respectful and he's charismatic oh and the same people that boo cena cheer hogan even though hogan has less moves than cena it's blind hate wrestling fans nowdays are too damn impatient i myself would like to see a title change though because the raw main event scene is loaded John Cena John Layfield Eddie Guerrero Hulk Hogan Kurt Angle Shawn Michaels Carly Colon WWE Vengeance WrestleMania XX Survivor Series Paul Levesque Booker Huffman WWE Championship WrestleMania 21 WWE RAW World Championship Wrestling Jason Reso Taboo Tuesday World Heavyweight Championship Roddy Piper Stone Cold Steve Austin Mark Calaway Adam Copeland The Rock (entertainer) Chris Jericho WWE No Mercy WWE Draft Paul Wight The Great American Bash WWE Unforgiven Amy Dumas David Bautista Matt Hardy Page Falkenberg Randy Orton World Tag-Team Championship Ren__ Goguen WrestleMania Bret Hart WWE No Way Out Glen Jacobs Professional wrestling attacks WWE Tag Team Championship Harley Race Ric Flair WWE Backlash Trish Stratus WWE Armageddon Warrior (wrestler) Evolution (professional wrestling) Royal Rumble World Wrestling Entertainment Mark Copani NWo Chris Benoit Music in professional wrestling Montreal Screwjob Leon White Bill Goldberg Rob Conway Andr__ the Giant Ernie Roth Professional wrestling match types WrestleMania X8 Vince McMahon Scott Levy Professional wrestling throws Oscar Gutierrez Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Chris Mordetsky Shoot (professional wrestling) StarrCade Bob Backlund Paul Orndorff Yoshihiro Tajiri Nick Dinsmore Eric Bischoff Bobby Heenan Randy Savage WWE Cruiserweight Championship Ohio Valley Wrestling Richard Vigneault Ted DiBiase Sting (wrestler) Gimmick (professional wrestling) WCW World Heavyweight Championship WCW Monday Nitro Charles Ashenoff Jon Heidenreich Solofa Fatu WWE United States Championship Greg Valentine Extreme Championship Wrestling
