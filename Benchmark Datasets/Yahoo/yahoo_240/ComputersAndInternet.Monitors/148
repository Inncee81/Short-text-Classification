fixing driver issues i was having this freaky problem with my monitor where every now and then like every hour of so it would turn off and then turn back on again and a couple times a day it would make this weird click pop sound when it did that and it would just turn off for good and i'd have to restart the computer i got advice from someone that i should uninstall my nvidia drivers and then reset to the via chipset that came with the computer and download the latest drivers for that apply directx updates and corrected drivers for the monitor and then reinstalling the nvidia card i uninstalled the nvidia drivers but when i run dxdiag it doesn't say anything about my chip it just says i'm using nothing how do i reset back to the chip and also does anyone think the solution i was given will work i know that the drivers were the problem because the monitor no longer turns off now that nvidia is uninstalled and also i never uninstalled the via chip i just installed the nvidia card when i got it and that was that so i figured that when i uninstalled it that the chip would just take over but its not even showing that i have one how do i get the computer to detect it after u uninstall u need to reinstall everything u uninstalled i think it will probably work if the problem is indeed driver related u need to eliminate that anyway before u start troubleshooting hardware ATI Technologies NVIDIA Radeon 3dfx DirectX Windows XP Spyware GeForce 4 Modem AmigaOS IBM PC compatible Graphics card PlayStation 3 SoundStorm IMac GeForce Blue screen of death GeForce 6 Series Graphics processing unit Game programming Commodore 64 OpenBSD Uninstaller IPod Vertex and pixel shaders OpenGL GeForce 7 Series Embedded system Original Amiga chipset GeForce FX Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Anti-virus software DDR2 SDRAM Xbox NForce4 GeForce 256 NForce Apple IIGS Counter-Strike Steam (content delivery) Microsoft Windows Knoppix Windows 2000 CPU design Copy protection Debugging Apple Macintosh Daylight saving time Booting VIA Technologies Rootkit Doom 3 AMD Atari 8-bit family Internet Explorer Commodore International RFID Indianapolis 500 Rendering (computer graphics) Commodore 128 Windows Me GeForce 2 Ethernet PlayStation 2 ZX Spectrum S3 Savage Linux Nintendo Entertainment System Radeon X Series History of Microsoft Windows Screenshot Device driver Shader Sound card Scalable Link Interface PCI Express Floppy disk USB flash drive GeForce 3 Cheating in Counter-Strike SUSE Linux Computer virus Common Unix Printing System BIOS RISC Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Surveillance Dawn (demo) World of Warcraft NForce2 The Sims 2 CPU cache 64-bit Digital photography MAME Motorola 68000 Trusted computing
