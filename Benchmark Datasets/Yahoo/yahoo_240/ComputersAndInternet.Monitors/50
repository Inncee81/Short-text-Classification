error no input signal hd go to power save i change everything in power option but no effect why my monitor gets black and it has message no input signal hd go to power save i tried to change in power options but it does not work i want to know if it has problem in hardware hiya geff i would do a simple test before buying or doing anything take the monitor to a different computer swap it with the existing one power up and i bet you get a picture what probably happened is that you have slightly moved the video card in your computer and it is not displaying because of this if the monitor works on a different computer then you will need to open your computer loosen the screw that secures the video card and remove the video card then replace it make sure the connectors are all the way in the slot before tightening boot up and that should do it also check the cable end for bent pins if the monitor does not work on a different computer then you may want to return it good luck Universal Serial Bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family Ethernet Oscilloscope IPod Commodore 64 Computer bus Bluetooth Television Embedded system Computer hardware Modem RS-232 S-Video Debugging Personal computer Secure Digital card Slot machine ZX Spectrum D-subminiature Digital Visual Interface DVD Windows 2000 Graphics card Floppy disk Apple II family SCART Apple IIGS PC Engine Power Macintosh G3 Betting (poker) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sinclair ZX81 Computer display Pirate decryption Data General Nova Amiga Advanced Technology Attachment Computer and video games Atari ST Blackjack Federal Standard 1037C SGI Indy IBook IMac System/34 Sound card Analog-to-digital converter PlayStation Portable Screw Computer virus Overclocking Digital photography Color Graphics Adapter Sega Saturn IBM PC compatible Nintendo GameCube Mouse (computing) PDP-11 XLR connector High-definition television Blue screen of death STS-61 KIM-1 Desktop computer Laptop Amstrad CPC Hello world program Punch card Musical Instrument Digital Interface Operational amplifier OpenGL RGB color model TRS-80 NTSC IBM PC Stereoscopy IBM 1401 Digital circuit Neopets Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PC motherboard Nintendo DS ATI Technologies Xbox
