can you do this to a computer monitor answer please is it possible to customize the computer frame to what you want i mean like are you able to take the monitor all apart and replace the frame with something else or do i have to put something over it monitors contain high voltage capacitors that can hold a charge even after being unplugged that could possibly kill you so unless you really know your way around with electronics i would advise that you keep from opening it also do not cover the air vents up on the monitor it can cause the components to overheat and monitor to fail over time Capacitor plague Capacitor Tesla coil Overclocking Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Computer Impedance Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Circuit design RC circuit Cathode ray tube Operational amplifier Dynamic random access memory Radiation hardening High-voltage direct current Loudspeaker Transistor Switched-mode power supply Liquid crystal display Electronics Rebreather Arcade cabinet PC motherboard Battery (electricity) Diving regulator Electronic amplifier Commodore 64 Electrostatic discharge Service life Membrane potential Low-pass filter Analog computer Floppy disk Hall effect Analog-to-digital converter STS-61 Action potential Volt Embedded system Electric motor Transmitter The Long Game CPU design Phase-locked loop Ford Ranger EV Logic gate Frame rate Voltage source X10 (industry standard) Directed-energy weapon Digital-to-analog converter Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical element Electric power transmission Thermal power station Ethernet Diode Call centre Electrophysiology Geomagnetic storm VFO Nickel-cadmium battery Apollo 8 Computer display Digital cinematography Laptop Carburetor Corona discharge Power factor correction Microphone Nintendo GameCube Personal computer Dielectric Lithium ion battery KISS (band) Epson Seiko Corporation SCADA Hubble Space Telescope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Page table Electrolytic capacitor Van de Graaff generator Distributor M16 (rifle) Acorn Electron Spark gap Capacitance Fluorescent lamp Video camera tube G-Man (Half-Life) Airbag Charge-coupled device Nonconductor The Covenant Television Power factor Magnet Amstrad CPC Electrical network
