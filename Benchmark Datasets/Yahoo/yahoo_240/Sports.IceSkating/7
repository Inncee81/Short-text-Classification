age vs levels figure skating levels what i am interested in is about what age did you start skating at what age did you hit the big mile marks first freestyle level axel doubles etc and at what age and level are you at now the reason i ask is that i want to compare my daughter's progress to others her coach tells us she has a lot of potential but with the costs are going up i would like more than just a coaches say so on the other hand a coach isn't really going to waste time on a kid that is a flop additionally let me reassure you that even if she is behind the norm on her progress we wouldn't make her quite she loves it too much we just wont have another summer where she is doing eight classes three privates at the rink four days a week and still begging for more i started skating when i was years old but didn't start getting private lessons until i was i went through a couple of coaches that weren't my style and eventually found the coach for me around i stayed with her until i had to leave for college hours away from my home rink and credit hours later meant i had to quit i had learned my waltz jump around the age of got my loop at and landed my first axel a month after being with my coach at skated in my first competition at pre preliminary months after being with my coach landed my first double at after that when i was i got my first major injury a herniated l s disc in my back that took a while to recover then a year later i got lace bite a common figure skater hockey player injury where the nerves in the front of your foot become damaged and make your foot go numb and a fractured ankle eventually i got back into skating landed all of my doubles but never attempted a double axel or any triples you never mentioned your daughters age but let me reassure you that she will progress and probably surprise you by learning and landing jumps at a crazy rate she seems to love it and that passion is something that not everyone has figure skating is such an expensive sport but when you see the joy it brings to her i hope it makes it all worth it i know that put my parents' mind to ease hope this helps i wish her the best of luck happy skating Axel jump Ice hockey Winter Olympic Games Michelle Kwan Tonya Harding Roller skating Compulsory figures The Contender (television series) Kurt Angle Bryan Robson Skateboarding trick National Hockey League All-Star Game Stanley Cup Volleyball Skateboarding Lu Chen Roller hockey Quarashi Poker jargon Parachuting EastEnders Sports timeline Ben Johnson (athlete) New York Giants Salchow jump Baseball Pump It Up Swingout Owen figure-skating family Tara Lipinski Traumatic brain injury Kodocha Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Janet Lynn Minor league baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Wayne Gretzky Rink hockey Blonde on Blonde Equine conformation Snowboarding Mario Lemieux Evel Knievel Toronto Blue Jays Lottie Dod Brian Boitano Paragliding One Tree Hill (TV series) Flip jump Cross-country skiing Inline speed skating Aerial (dance move) Major League Baseball television contracts Peter Shilton ESPN25 Shawn Michaels The Chemical Brothers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eddie Guerrero 1988 Winter Olympics Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shaggy dog story John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Friends Education in the United States Lutz jump Spice Girls New York Knicks Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Yuka Sato Football (soccer) 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Blackburn Hawks Miracle on Ice Rocket Power Piccolo Junior Saga Detroit Red Wings Babe Ruth Kristi Yamaguchi Professional wrestling holds Donald Neilson Speed skating Softball Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Norway national football team Kimi Finster Fanny Blankers-Koen Lou Gehrig Midori Ito Neighbours
