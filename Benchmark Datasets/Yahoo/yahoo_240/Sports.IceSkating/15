figure skating how long will it take to start triples hey i'm and have been skating for about years i can do all of the single jumps i'm learning axel and combinations also i can do all my spins except biellman and i can sorta do camel i'm also really flexible i was wondering how many more years it will take me to start doing triples ex i'm starting doubles next year maybe even at the very end of this year and also jumps come really natural for me my coach said that also i have a private lesson once a week with my coach but i'm gonna start doing lessons a week with her so i skate about times a week for about hours each during school year and for the summer i skate about times a week it's really hard to say because every skater is so different i bet it will be another year or two until you get to your triples but again with every skater being so different it could be longer or shorter good luck Figure skating Axel jump Michelle Kwan Artistic roller skating Tonya Harding Roller skating Winter Olympic Games Cross-country skiing Kristi Yamaguchi Brian Boitano Speed skating Carol Heiss Toe loop jump Janet Lynn Owen figure-skating family Loop jump Yuka Sato Inline speed skating Skateboarding Salchow jump Swingout Midori Ito Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sasha Cohen Skateboarding trick Compulsory figures Linda Fratianne Karen Magnussen Lutz jump Snowboarding John Curry Short track speed skating Flip jump Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics Ice dancing Baseball Sports timeline Katarina Witt Fanny Blankers-Koen 1924 Winter Olympics Tony Hawk's American Wasteland Streets of Rage Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Sport Olympic Flame Skateboard Inline skates Irina Slutskaya 1988 Winter Olympics Eva Pawlik Aggressive skating Surya Bonaly The Chemical Brothers Synchronized skating Ice skating Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics 1994 Winter Olympics Volleyball Paul Levesque Roger Federer Professional wrestling holds Tori Amos Lottie Dod Timothy Goebel Catriona LeMay Doan 1957 World Series Otto Jelinek Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Ravi Shastri Roller hockey Van Halen Jaap Eden Seishun Academy Middle School Craps Playoff Ice hockey United States at the 1900 Summer Olympics Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Carlo Fassi Extreme Programming Pittsburgh Steelers ESPN25 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 China at the 2004 Summer Olympics James E.
