how do i turn brick cheese into dip how do i turn brick cheese into about a half a cup of dip from my experience some block cheese can be greasy when you melt it and doesn't always make the best dip velveeta has always worked best for me i suggest melting the cheese slowly and adding milk to make it creamier try cutting it into small pieces about inch or smaller and melting in the microwave only microwave the cheese for about minutes and then stir keep repeating until it starts to melt smoothly and add milk then adding rotel tomatoes or salsa is good or you can also cook some sausage make sure you drain it and pat off the excess grease with paper towels and add that for chunky dip Cheese Kraft Dinner Hot dog Milk Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Chili con carne Fondue Casting In-N-Out Burger Dairy Tofu French fries Sandwich Pizza D__ner kebab Quesadilla Jewish cuisine Barbecue French cuisine MRE Cuisine of the Philippines Halva Processed cheese Japanese cuisine Pottery Cheesesteak Fecal incontinence Poker jargon Vegetarian cuisine Curry Ice cream Dairy product Cha chaan teng German cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Gorgonzola cheese Cuisine of Argentina Pot Noodle Brazing Paneer Yoghurt Idli Cosmic microwave background radiation McDonald's Cantonese cuisine Steel Peanut butter Scrambled eggs Greasy spoon Salad Brick Swiss cheese Bacon Kosher foods Risotto Roman eating and drinking Haggis Kitchen Wok Fish and chips Bengali cuisine Tortilla Agar plate Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Vietnam Textile manufacturing Cajun cuisine Butter Bread Deep frying Peruvian cuisine Mantou Cheesecake Sauce Little Britain Table tennis Pancake Mayonnaise Paper Grilled cheese sandwich Soldering Ricotta cheese Dim sum Soy milk Vitamin D Drill bit Potato Rigging Italian cuisine Hong Kong-style milk tea Cuisine of Singapore Sausage Manicure Microwave oven Mozzarella cheese Mexican cuisine Macaroni
