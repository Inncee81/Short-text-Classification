how long is a jar of spagetti sauce good for once it has been open and put in the refrigerator my boyfriend constantly says that we are wasting money when i make a self serving of pasta and put the jar of sauce in the fridge he says that once you open the jar you only have days to finish it or it goes bad i disagree i believe it is good for a lot longer than that since there are a ton of perservatives in it i'm not sure on the specifics but i know that someone out there knows for sure thanks in advance for the advice if the expiration date is for example does that mean open it before that date or use it before that date if it looks and smells ok then it should be fine as long as there is no mould a tip is to turn the jar upside down once it is opened and this will help it to not grow mould hope this has helped xx k Cuisine of Denmark Pasta Mayonnaise Tofu Refrigerator Dairy Domesticated turkey Casting Norway national football team Social rule Poker jargon Pottery Yoghurt MRE Kitchen Teen Girl Squad Rum Equine conformation Vitasoy Wood carving Sonic the Hedgehog Sauce Brewery Meat Loaf Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Laos Soy sauce Tenshinhan Girls Aloud Supertask Hamburger Make money fast Basil Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pandora Jute Super Bowl XX Phoebe Halliwell Whiskey in the Jar Cannabis cultivation Air conditioning Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hiberno-English Asiago cheese Satay Plastic Boston Public Jars of Clay Hot dog Hemp Bolognese sauce Condom Charmed One Tree Hill (TV series) Deus Ex characters Neighbours Internet troll 1957 World Series XTC Blow molding Plain of Jars President of Ireland Refrigerator car Avenue Q The Bell Jar Ozone depletion Injection moulding Wasabi Dates in Star Wars Washington Monument Garfield The Smoking Room Salsa (sauce) Wonton Fish and chips Cajun cuisine Baseball Erymanthian Boar Drill bit Baroque chess Elis Prefecture Cuisine of Singapore Aerial (dance move) Champagne (beverage) Wine Paul W.
