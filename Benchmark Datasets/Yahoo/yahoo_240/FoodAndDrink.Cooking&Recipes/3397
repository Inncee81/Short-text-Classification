i need a fun and different dinner idea with fish im tired of making the same thing for dinner i want to make something other than grilled fish with two sides i had tacos for lunch so fish tacos are out and had pasta last night so any pasta ideas are out please help no salmon though thx my personal favorite is blackened fish blackened redish is what got th crave of balckening started it is excellent i especially like blackened ribeye or prime rib it is fairly easy to make but does require some things you may not have you will need a cast iron skillet and an outdoor heat source preferrably an outdoor stove or burner reason being is blackening any food creates a lot of smoke more than most home exhaust fans can eliminate to blacken fish and this can be almost any type of fish orange roughy is excellent as is red snapper even talapia providing it is a decent sized filet but any filet or steak cut style fish works well you will need a good blackening seasoning i prefer paul prudhommes blackened redfish magic available at most grocery stores in the spice aisle you will also need unsalted butter to blacken get cast iron skillet white hot melt butter and dip in fish filet lay butter filet on a plate or pan and season liberally both sides of fish with blackening seasoning and place in skillet top side down first this method of cooking goes really fast so depnding upon what cut of fish you are using filet only about minute on top side then flip and about minutes on back side steak cut add about more minute to both sides once flipped you can drizzle a little of the melted butter on top of fish remove from skillet and enjoy this is not a spicy hot dish like most people believe this is primarily a creole dish but it is spicy as in the flavor of the spices and herbs in the seasoning realy come out suring this process it is a quick cooking process and you can accompany this with some dirty rice or red beans and rice and a nice cucumber salad it is unique and different and a must for eveyone to try at least once hope this helps Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Steak Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia Soul food Jewish cuisine French cuisine German cuisine MRE Cookware and bakeware Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Hamburger Korean cuisine Curry Cuisine of Laos Kebab D__ner kebab Chili con carne Hot pot Cuisine of Argentina Recipe Bengali cuisine Bread Wok Sandwich Ramen Food Pancake Rum Cha chaan teng Peruvian cuisine Kraft Dinner Gumbo Cuisine of Vietnam Vegetarian cuisine Sushi Stove Hell's Kitchen (television) Salad French fries Bacon Portable stove Soup Casting Kelantan Butter Cuisine of Greece Steak n Shake Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of Brazil Fast-food restaurant Chinese cuisine Potato Cheese Miso Fishing Dairy McDonald's Wine Sauce Ketchup Tea Japanese tea ceremony Veganism Roman eating and drinking Rice RuneScape skills Idli T-bone steak Chicken soup Welding Sauerkraut Tomato Food preservation Chopsticks Pork Black pepper Chocolate Schlock Mercenary
