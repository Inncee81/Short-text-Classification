what is sodium what is it what does it do what is it good and bad for my diet has tons of sodium and if it's bad how can i neutralize it so drinking water may neutralize the effects of sodium i drink tons of liquids i work a fairly intense job and i drink gallons of water a day on days i work and days a week i'm sure that flushes my system pretty well as i am able to eat several meals and drink a couple gallons of water and still lose lbs in a single shift sodium is an element pure sodium is a very soft shiny metal that has to be kept under kerosene or other oily liquid expose sodium to air and it will react with the humidity generating great heat expose it to water and it will react with the water producing sodium hydroxide lye and hydrogen gas but the reaction is so heated that the hydrogen catches fire and explodes they ship sodium in tanker cars on the railroad just fill it up with molten metal and let it solidify when it gets to the other end they heat it up again but can you imagine what would happen if the car were to derail and fall off a bridge into the river it would be far more serious than three mile island was i live in lancaster county and tmi is on the county line believe me a sodium car would be far more serious sodium is an electrolyte like potassium and your body depends on having the correct electrolyte balance or the electricity that tells your heart to pump doesn't get the job done the sodium in your body is already neutralized and excesses are dangerous anyway if you take a loop diuretic such as most water pills or certain blood pressure pills your doctor tells you to eat bananas and tomatoes and possibly even has you take a potassium supplement that's because your body tends to get rid of sodium and potassium in a fixed ratio when you urinate if you already have an electrolyte imbalance it gets even worse on the other hand you can treat a sodium excess by creating a potassium excess that restores the sodium potassium ratio to something far less hazardous of course it's better not to have the excess in the first place your kidneys will flush other important chemicals out of your system at the same time if you're short on calcium and most people are you lose calcium that way and you end up with charley horses in your legs one thing you can do is to switch from table salt to sea salt both on the table and in cooking our blood and the fluid in our cells is chemically very similar to sea water by using table salt we increase sodium by using sea salt we don't create nearly the same problem as a side note a medical examiner told me thirty years ago that if you want to poison someone it's extremely difficult for an autopsy to keep track of sodium and potassium levels and it looks like a regular heart attack just in case you want to write a murder mystery you might want to use that information i'm not sure how you'd introduce the electrolytes into the body of your victim though he surely would object and then you'd have to explain the struggle Edible salt Sulfuric acid Chlorine Lithium Water (molecule) Nutrition Iron Hydrogen Action potential Water Sulfur Alcohol Sodium chloride Hard water Solar power Fire fighting Insulin Hypertension Sodium hydroxide Cold fusion Nuclear power Sewage treatment Battery (electricity) Caffeine Hydrogen peroxide Magnesium Intravenous therapy Gasoline Helium Rebreather Alcohol fuel Electrolysis Strontium Titanium Energy development Acetic acid Fuel cell Dieting Uranium Solar cell Sodium hypochlorite Hyperthermia Three Mile Island Drowning Airbag Thermal power station Pneumonia Carburetor Renal physiology Soap Fuel injection Sun Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Potassium chloride Calcium Hypomagnesemia Nickel-cadmium battery Fluorine Corrosion Omega-3 fatty acid Tantalum Blood Iodine Ultraviolet Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Methamphetamine Dialysis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rocket fuel Nitroglycerin Decompression sickness E number Hyperkalemia Nephron Nuclear reactor Urine Kidney Desert Nuclear weapon design Milk Nuclear fusion Base (chemistry) Sodium sulfate
