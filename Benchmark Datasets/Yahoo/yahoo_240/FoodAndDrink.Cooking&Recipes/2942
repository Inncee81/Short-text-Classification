making ice cream it came out very loose followed the directions exactly but it never set up it was like whipped cream what went wrong maybe didnt cook long enough on the stove does it have to completely cool before putting it in the ice cream maker and if anyone has some tried and true vanilla ice cream recipies please respond ty yes it needs to cool completely before it goes into the maker also when you're making ice cream with a home maker it's not going to be completely firm when the maker is done with it it'll be soft like soft serve ice cream you need to scoop it out and put it in the freezer and let it firm up my tried and true recipe i used to be a pastry chef this was the vanilla bean ice cream recipe i used for several restaurants cups half and half cup sugar vanilla bean egg yolks put half half in a saucepan turn heat on low split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds inside and add to half half and then add the vanilla bean bring the half half to a low simmer then turn the heat off so the cream can steep with the vanilla bean for minutes remove the bean and set aside for another use bring the half and half back up to a low simmer and add sugar and whisk until sugar is dissolved in a seperate bowl have egg yolks and whisk slightly pour about a cup of the hot cream into the yolks and whisk then add another cup of hot cream into that mixture and whisk until the egg yolks are completely mixed in then pour this into the saucepan of hot cream then whisk while bringing the mixture to a simmer again cook until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon pour mixture into a bowl cover and refrigerate until completely cool overnight is best pour into ice cream maker and make as per machine's instructions don't throw away your vanilla beans add it to a few cups of sugar in an air tight container and let sit for weeks you'll have yummy vanilla sugar Tea Japanese cuisine Mayonnaise Tofu Custard Chili con carne Baked Alaska Vanilla Pancake Chocolate Dairy Soup Cuisine of Brazil Jewish cuisine Turkish coffee Cocoa Idli Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Philippines German cuisine Carbon dioxide Milkshake Barbecue Casting Cantonese cuisine French toast Bread Recipe Halva Japanese tea ceremony Espresso Bearnaise sauce Brewery Cookware and bakeware Souffl__ French fries Sushi Soft drink Cajun cuisine Milk Mooncake Cake Mango Yoghurt Peruvian cuisine Horehound Turkish Delight Textile manufacturing B__chamel sauce Scrambled eggs Refrigerator Cider Cookie Egg (food) Ice cream cone Oreo Rum Cooking Russian cuisine Apple pie Ice Cuisine of the Southern United States Bengali cuisine Pottery Hot chocolate Cheesecake Cuisine of Malaysia Beer Cheese Pizza Thermal power station In-N-Out Burger Food preservation Vanilla Ninja Sento Puff pastry Repouss__ and chasing Egg white French cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Sake Microwave oven Bacon Wine Bagel Tempera The Apprentice 2 Internal ballistics Plastic Professional wrestling throws
