what should i bake for my friend's birthday tomorrow since i don't really have money i'm going to bake her something what should i make for a year old girl something very pretty and creative i was thinking something different like not just your regular chocolate cake or something i'm willing to spend as much time as i need to on it something complicated i like a good challenge if you want something challenging make a layer cake with all her favorite toppings and flavors all you have to do is take boxes of cake mix and bake them in different sized circle baking pans and then stack them on top of each other when they're cool make sure they are baked perfectly though otherwise they will fall apart its soo yummy too Cookie Bread Chocolate Cookware and bakeware Cold Stone Creamery Cheesecake Pancake Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Bagel Mooncake Spidey Super Stories Baking Pizza Maple syrup Flour The Beach Boys Brewery Twinkie Jewish cuisine Teapot Ice cream Homer Simpson Girl Scout cookies Cuisine of the Philippines Birthday Muffin McDonald's Chinese New Year Wok Baked Alaska Coffee Chinese tea Emergence Baking powder Fried dough foods Potato chips Chicago-style pizza The Emancipation of Mimi Cocoa Jennifer Lopez Humphrey Bogart Cliff Richard Hello Kitty Oreo Test Match Special Casting Dim sum Kodocha Garfield Bengali cuisine XML Jaffa cake Cuisine of Singapore Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Characters in the Smurfs Souffl__ Rum Culture of Argentina Good Times Breadmaker Yakitate!!
