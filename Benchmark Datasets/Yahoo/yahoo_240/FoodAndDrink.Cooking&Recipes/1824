i have large artichokes i mean large how long should i steam them for depends on whether you are steaming them in a traditional steamer water at the bottom with artichokes suspended over it or the way i learned in a pot starting with the water half way up the artichokes your flame should be turned down to medium high after the water starts to boil cover and check the tenderness of the center with a fork after about minutes or so some artichokes become tender extremely fast while others can seem to take forever you can also check by pulling out an inside leaf if it comes out easily it should be done very large ones might take up to minutes but it is better to constantly check them than to over cook them also did you know that you can should cook and eat the stem after cutting it off remove any dried up or discolored leaves remove any tough skin with a vegetable peeler or knife stand the stems up in the pot between the artichokes serve each one with a stem next to it they are delicious and taste like the tender heart of the artichoke be sure to add salt to your water if you want a traditional italian style add minced fresh garlic salt black pepper and olive oil to your pot with the water make sure some of the garlic goes down into the leaves sprinkle on a small amount of grated parmesan or romano cheese i like a bit of crushed red pepper added also always cook covered Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Cantonese cuisine Idli Globe artichoke French fries Dumpling Garlic Jewish cuisine German cuisine Risotto Bengali cuisine Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Ramen Korean cuisine Haggis Common bean Tamale Cajun cuisine Peruvian cuisine Bong Pasta Cuisine of Denmark Russian cuisine Cheese Italian cuisine French cuisine Recipe Asparagus Cuisine of Laos Coffee Pizza In-N-Out Burger Japanese tea ceremony Cookware and bakeware Poker jargon Couscous Oregano Hamster Roman eating and drinking Paella Curry Mayonnaise Bread Fondue Chicago-style pizza Mango Basil Cuisine of Singapore Hamburger Textile manufacturing Hop (plant) Wood Dim sum Tea Chicken soup Cuisine of Malaysia Soul food Fish and chips Halva Food preservation Potato Hydroponics Catalan cuisine Fishing Kosher foods Domesticated turkey Steak Black pepper Plantain Drill bit Steam engine Pickling Roast beef Comanche Potassium Stir frying Kelantan Nabemono Comfrey Rum Fugu Banana Carbon dioxide Onion Team Fortress Classic Rice Steaming Sichuan Pepper Meatball Knife
