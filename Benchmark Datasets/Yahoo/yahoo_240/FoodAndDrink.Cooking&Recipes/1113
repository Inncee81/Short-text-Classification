fried chicken i have a problem whenever i fry chicken i do a basic double coated buttermilk style and everytime it comes out way too crispy almost hard i was wondering what i could do to make it so its a crispy peice of chicken without being tooth shattering more of a crumbly coating i guess thanks ok i use regular all purpose flour that i season regualr buttermilk with a bit of hot sauce for marinating and coating and vegetable oil for frying i cant exactly explain the texture but its almost as if the chicken is now wearing armor and its hard to bite into and when you chew it you could probably hear it on the other side of the house cast iron is the best for frying chicken it is the only pan i will use i also use a double crust and mine came out like yours at first especially in a nonstick pan i also have found that that if you use crisco and about a stick of margarine the oil doesnt burn off as quick it will look kinda of frothy but it allows my coating to keep its texture without getting to hard fry your dark meat first it will take longer to cook then put in your white meat i use buttermilk egg and flour to coat but i double it up so it will have plenty of coating hope this helps Cookware and bakeware Pizza Soul food Cantonese cuisine Japanese cuisine Fried chicken Wok Bread Hamburger Tofu Plastic Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of the Philippines American Chinese cuisine Barbecue McDonald's Cuisine of Denmark Dumpling French fries Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Singapore Cajun cuisine Pancake German cuisine Korean cuisine Ramen Deep frying Teflon Roux Jewish cuisine Fish and chips Sandwich Dim sum Bacon Breakfast Dosa Kebab Hot dog Pizza Hut Mayonnaise In-N-Out Burger Bengali cuisine Cooking Stir frying Meat analogue Curry Drill bit Canadian Chinese cuisine Polish cuisine Flour Sauce Cuisine of Vietnam D__ner kebab Chewing gum Biscuit Domesticated turkey Hot pot Cuisine of Laos RuneScape skills Taco Soup Scrambled eggs Chicken French cuisine Risotto Kit Kat Puff pastry Chili con carne Veganism Cuisine of Africa Chicken soup Cookie Satay Stock (food) Fried rice Jiaozi Gumbo Kosher foods Fried egg Cuisine of Thailand Fondue Wiener schnitzel Taiwanese cuisine Salad Chinese cuisine Peanut butter Caribbean Chinese cuisine Halaal Udon Tooth Cha chaan teng Strap-on dildo Fried dough foods RuneScape weapons
