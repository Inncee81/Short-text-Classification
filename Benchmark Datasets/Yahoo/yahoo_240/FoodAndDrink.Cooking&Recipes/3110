i can make any fancy kind of dessert but my chocolate chip cookies always fall flat any pointers i have tried substituting crisco for the butter and or a combination of butter and crisco everything you can imagine all other cookies i make come out great nice and puffy chewy in the centers but my chocolate chip cookies practically run off the sides of the pan i've even had my oven adjusted and tested for the correct temp help haha i don't get it i found this secrets of really good chocolate chip cookies updated december the recipe on the back of the nestle toll house morsels tm bag makes fine cookies and if you were to follow it precisely you couldn't go too far wrong however based upon my own experience and that of others i advise a few minor modifications and refinements first always use real butter don't let anyone convince you that butter vs margarine doesn't make any difference it does another reason to use real butter instead of margarine or crisco trans fats as in margarine and crisco are teeming with them while butter is a natural product and contains no trans fats second triple the amount of vanilla extract recommended this means to use a tablespoon where a teaspoon is specified also always use real vanilla extract and not vanillin which is bogus although cheaper and sold next to the genuine article in many grocery stores feh incidentally vanilla is a wondrous and versatile substance click here to find out everything you ever wanted to know about vanilla and some things you never suspected third and this can make a big difference don't just let the butter sit out at room temperature to become soft instead melt it very carefully so that it doesn't burn you can use a double boiler if anyone out there still has one or else a microwave oven that is set very low and which you are watching like a hawk a microwave can burn the butter in a second if you turn your back at an inopportune moment use a pyrex or other microwave safe transparent container if you do this so you can watch the butter closely melted butter because it is both warm and liquid does a much better job of dissolving and melting the sugar than a room temperature creamed butter can do improving the consistency of the dough as you are working with it and also improving the texture of the cookies after they are baked my friend lizabeth says that she gets much better results using melted butter and superfine granulated sugar and i believe her however i have never had a problem with the texture of cookies made with ordinary granulated sugar also if you're like me you have often had a problem with your brown sugar clumping together into giant bricks which you are then banging on the edge of the kitchen counter in order to break them up enough to use the stuff still big lumps of brown sugar survive even into the baked cookies well if you take the big solid mass of brown sugar roughly the volume you desire put it into the microwave with the melting butter in the pyrex cup and let it melt on a very low setting for a few minutes you will find that the brown sugar will liquefy very nicely it will help it along if you stir the contents for a few seconds after removing the cup from the microwave it will then pour smoothly into the mixing bowl let it cool briefly before adding the eggs so they don't poach before you can mix them into the other wet ingredients many correspondents have written to tell me that a slice of white bread placed into the sealed plastic bag with the bricklike mass of brown sugar will soften it within a day my mother likes to use a slice of apple in either case put it into the plastic bag with the brown sugar and seal it up and check it again in hours fourth add a little milk maybe just a tablespoon or two when you are mixing the dough this will make it less stiff and the cookies will be less hard and crunchy when they are done if you do this though make sure the dough is nice and cold as you drop it onto the cookie sheet and also make sure the cookie sheet is room temperature or cooler when you put the dough on it and put it into the oven if the dough melts around the edges before it starts to bake sometimes the edges will burn or get too brown fifth if you like try leaving out part of the sugar i find sometimes that these cookies are easier to take if even cup two tablespoons of the sugar white or brown is omitted don't leave out more than that though if you like try adding a ounce bag of reese's peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips this makes a great cookie but if you do this it is probably best to omit the nuts or try adding a bag of butterscotch chips and substituting oatmeal for the nuts a lot of people have written to tell me that they love to add a package of instant vanilla pudding mix this does sound good and it makes sense for a lot of reasons i will try it sometime soon you can also experiment with untraditional mixes of white and brown sugar until you achieve the version you like best in addition although i have not yet tried this myself i am told that it is possible to substitute honey on a one to one basis for the brown sugar resulting in nice chewy cookies with a longer shelf life i recently received mail from someone who likes to use almond extract in equal parts with vanilla and who also tells me that the honey trick didn't work for her but she does recommend substituting bran for a small part of the flour i would make it not more than a tablespoon or two to make the cookies chewier she sometimes adds cinnamon to taste i'd say not more than a teaspoon total and perhaps less and observes that stirring chopped up heath bars into the dough can create a great cookie she didn't say this specifically but i'd advise against using the cinnamon and heath bars in the same batch note that toll house dough without chips but with a fair amount of cinnamon might be a nice variation on the traditional american cookie called the snickerdoodle so many people write to me to ask about problems they run into making toll house cookies and the problem i hear about is my cookies come out flat what can i do this is such a common problem here are the first few things you should check make sure your cookie dough is cold when you put it on the cookie sheet if you have to chill it in between batches that's what you should do make sure your cookie sheet is cooled to room temperature between batches i usually rinse mine under the tap to clean off the crumbs and cool it down mix the dough thoroughly but don't over mix it don't overbake some people experiment with adding baking powder instead of or in addition to the baking soda which is part of the recipe i haven't tried this yet other people swear that if you use butter flavored crisco instead of real butter this problem goes away again i am a butter loyalist and so i haven't tried that although in the interests of science someday i should however because of all those trans fats i mentioned above you or i might not want to use crisco or any other form of shortening in our cookies how then to achieve the desired appearance texture and consistency here's one trick instead of using all butter in your cookies you can use half butter and half liquid vegetable oil like corn canola or safflower oil or even peanut oil this results in a nice chewy cookie with a pleasing appearance and flavor and a longer shelf life than one baked with butter alone a correspondent in canada urges that real maple syrup emphasis on the real no mrs butterworth's please also makes a fine substitute for the brown sugar i think i'd also advise against using heath bars and maple syrup together maple syrup and cinnamon might be ok another correspondent says that adding a dollop of sour cream improves the texture of the cookies making them chewier and increasing their shelf life she swears that the sour cream can't be tasted and i'm sure that's true sour cream assimilates well into other foods and these cookies have enough other strong flavors in them that some sour cream shouldn't be noticeable the k question of course is how much is a dollop i'd say take a soupspoon and spoon out a heaping scoop of sour cream maybe an inch or so above the top of the bowl of the spoon at its highest point that's a dollop ydmv your dollop may vary experiment and see what you like whether or not you use heath bars cinnamon maple syrup or other non standard ingredients the nuts are optional many people prefer chocolate chip cookies without nuts alternatively you can try adding oatmeal even if you don't add butterscotch chips in the same volume as the nuts called for by the recipe but if you do this be sure to add more liquid my friend susan says that she doesn't bother adding more liquid and her cookies turn out fine but i prefer always to add that extra tablespoon or two of milk also if you add the reese's peanut butter morsels as discussed above they melt and create some additional moistness in the cookies the morsels don't have to be nestle however in my experience nestle morsels do melt in a most satisfactory way during the baking process ghirardelli and guittard morsels are very good i also like the hershey mini morsels for this the standard size hershey morsels however do not melt properly at least not in the eight to ten minute baking time of cookies and i do not recommend them for use in cookies although they are terrific in brownies which bake for a much longer period the morsels must however be semisweet i e dark chocolate milk chocolate morsels which are sold in similar bags to the undiscerning are massively too sweet to put into these cookies i do feel obligated to point out for that matter that both the morsels and the baking itself can be optional those of us who make chocolate chip cookies know how important it is to sample the dough before baking and i'd have to confess that sometimes the raw dough i prefer my raw dough chipless is even better than the cookies if you do like to eat raw dough though be careful any foodstuff containing raw eggs can harbor salmonella and or other nasty little bacteria don't use eggs that were cracked before you opened them wash the eggshells in warm soapy water and rinse them well before cracking the eggs and using them alternatively use one of the pasteurized egg substitutes and remember that raw dough can be risky it is especially risky for anyone with a susceptibility to infections or a compromised immune system so be cautious but also have fun
