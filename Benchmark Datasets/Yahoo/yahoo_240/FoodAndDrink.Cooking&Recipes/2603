please help me with this this is a recipe for a pie and i'm slightly confused about something it says to do my husband found this in a cookbook and wants it really badly so please help now it says in a heavy saucepan to cook various ingredients together such as water marshmallows and butter then it says to set saucepan in ice and whisk mixture constantly until cooled what is the best and easiest way to accomplish this and why does this need to be done i think i understand about why the only other ingredient you put in is whipping cream and its for a coffee mallow pie so purhaps its so the whipping cream will do what its suppose to and not melt thanks all for the answers fill a large bowl half way with ice cubes making sure its big enough to take your pan when you take it off the heat doing this will cool it quickly a heavy based pan retains heat longer but you need this because you are using sugary ingredients or they will burn and if the pan retains the heat once removed your ingredients will continue to cook till the temp drops its easy to do and you should have no problems Ice cream Coffee Cold Stone Creamery Cookware and bakeware Recipe Tofu Pizza Sushi Bread Tea Barbecue Idli Pancake Breakfast Mayonnaise Chocolate Apple pie Dairy French cuisine Turkish Delight Bacon Pie Butter Cajun cuisine Oreo Cuisine of the Philippines French toast Scrambled eggs Cuisine of the Southern United States Roux Fire fighting Potato Ice B__chamel sauce Rum Cream (food) Bearnaise sauce Cheesecake Sandwich Plastic Cake Peruvian cuisine Custard Milkshake Maple syrup Vegetarian cuisine Curry Halva Internal ballistics Chili con carne Confectionery Bagel Bong Cookie Cheese Peanut butter Campfire Milk Pecan pie Heinkel He 100 Puff pastry Entropy Welding Marshmallow French fries Salad Wok Cuisine of Denmark Rice Krispies Muffin Soldering Water (molecule) Italian cuisine Alice B.
