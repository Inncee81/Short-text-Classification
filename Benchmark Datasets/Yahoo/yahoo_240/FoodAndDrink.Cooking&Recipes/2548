does it realy matter if we use butter or margarine honestly no it doesn't matter many recipes will say 'butter no substitutions ' but you can one of my favorite childhood goodies was homemade toffee that is one of those 'butter only' things except margarine was cheaper and that is what mom used to make it my grandmother used the same recipe only she did use butter maybe it was what i was used to but to this day i still like it better with margarine they do taste different and some things might have a slightly different texture when made with one or the other but i am a great cook and i might use butter one time per year just use what you like because some doctors say one is better for you some say the other Margarine Chocolate Butter Halva Recipe Apple pie Peanut butter Chili con carne Meat analogue Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Cake Curry Toffee Mayonnaise Vegetarian cuisine Pancake Soul food Hot dog Risotto Breakfast Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Trans fat Gumbo Ice cream Microeconomics Cheese Bread Muffin Cooking weights and measures Veganism Baklava Alfredo Heath bar Cuisine of the Philippines Cookie Rice Croquet (food) Bacon Baking Cuisine of Brazil Emulsion Eric Cartman Alice B.
