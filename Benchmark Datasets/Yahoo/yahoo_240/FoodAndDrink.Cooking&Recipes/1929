a weird dish that you ate as a child that you now serve to your family my mom made so many crazy things but she was a good cook so somehow it managed to taste good she used to make this dish where she browned ground beef in a pot with onions and then she added a can of baked beans she always put a few spoons of mustard in this mixture and it was soooo good when i was little i made it for my nieces and nephews the other day and they loved it did your mom or another family member make weird dishes too hello actually my neighbor had four kids and she used to babysit me so needless to say i grew up with her kids lol anyway this may sound really revolting but i promise you it is really good my neighbor used to take campbells cream of mushroom soup pour it into a pot on the stove and then add milk to it and whisk the soup and milk together she would get the soup nice and hot and while the soup was cooking she would toast pieces of white bread in the toaster right before the soup was done she would take the toast out of the toaster and tear it up into little pieces on a plate or in a bowl and then she would pour the hot soup over the top of the toast i am telling you this may sound really nasty but it is a very cheap and easy meal and it really does fill you up believe it or not my daughter loves this dish and so do i my neighbors also used to toast some white bread and then put cheez whiz on the top of it and before microwave ovens came out they would stick their toast with cheez whiz on it back into the toaster for a minute or two i know it probably isn't the safest thing to do but my neighbor's kids loved to eat their toast this way but i could never stomach it lol Japanese cuisine Breakfast Hot dog Jewish cuisine Soup Russian cuisine German cuisine Barbecue Bengali cuisine Hamburger Pizza Dumpling Pea soup Cuisine of Laos Dim sum Cuisine of Brazil Pancake Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Malaysia Tea Sandwich Korean cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Chinese cuisine Curry Toast Ramen Cha chaan teng Porridge Cantonese cuisine D__ner kebab Cookware and bakeware Hot pot Coffee Idli Chicken soup Chopsticks Rice pudding Cajun cuisine MRE French toast Treehouse of Horror V Risotto French fries Red Dwarf characters Nabemono Haggis Futurama (TV series - season 4) Roman eating and drinking Polish cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Soul food Vegetarian cuisine Tamale Beef noodle soup Full English breakfast Cheesesteak Japanese tea ceremony Pasta Sushi Cuisine of Austria Comanche Cuisine of Argentina Cheese McDonald's Gumbo Kitchen Cuisine of Thailand Yum cha Sauerkraut Fondue "Weird Al" Yankovic American Chinese cuisine Food Sauce Cuisine of Vietnam Fish and chips Campbell Soup Company Bacon Ice cream Goulash Donburi Hakka cuisine Cuisine of Cambodia Meal Udon British cuisine Soba Yoghurt Cuisine of Finland
