is it okay to use baking soda that has been in the fridge to absorb odors okay i've heard that people use baking soda to absorb the odors from their fridge but today i wanted to make pancakes for my family and i asked my mom if they had baking soda b c that's the only thing that i didnt have for the recipe and she said use the one in the fridge anyway i was just wondering if it would be okay to use that baking soda like will it make the oancakes taste weird b c of all the odors it absorbed thanks jimmy d oh o so i shouldn't use baking soda in anything for cooking baking the recipe called for it though so then would it be okay to just not use baking soda in the pancake batter it is not good to use it first because it will contain molecules from the odors absorbed even if you smell it and you dont feel them they will be transfered to the preparation afterwards and ruin your work secondly because most probably it will also have absorbed humidity from the fridge this humidity comes from the air inside the fridge even if you have a dry cold fridge and from the foods everytime you open the fridge some humid air from the environment gets into the fridge and also along with the odor molecules from the food some oxygen and hidrogen molecules are released too molecules of hidrogen with one of oxygen makes one molecule of water so in any case the baking soda will have absorbed humidity and will not work if you dont have any extra baking soda you can substitute it for any other leaving ingredient for instance self raising flour use this instead of normal flour yeast use about tsp of dry yeast instead of baking powder or baking soda good luck Pancake Bread Carbon dioxide Chocolate Baking Biscuit Baking powder Brewery Flour Ice cream Muffin Pizza Tofu Ammonia Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cake Rebreather Japanese cuisine Dumpling Egg (food) Potato Soy protein Experiment Ozone Pasta Compost Milkshake Acetic acid Sourdough Cheese Sauna Ginger Sugar substitute Solar power Cuisine of Brazil Ramen Curry Breakfast Cantonese cuisine Hydrogen chloride Explosive material American Chinese cuisine Irish breakfast Alcohol Cocaine Alkane Case-based reasoning Photosynthesis Russian cuisine Garlic Vinegar Water Cajun cuisine Toothpaste Sodium hydroxide Chinese New Year Hot dog Plastic Gumbo Rum Soul food Bengali cuisine Rice Cooking Cocoa Food preservation Paint Cookie XML Potato pancakes Bagel Naan Illegal drug trade Food additive Soy milk Ozone hole Humidity Meat analogue Coca Mouth ulcer Cookware and bakeware Hydrochloric acid Polyethylene terephthalate Recipe Water (molecule) Puff pastry Coconut crab Soft drink Fungus Vacuum
