what's a better way i made homemade ice cream with out any type of machine i just put the ingredients together then put it in a bowl and froze it but i used fat free cream and fat free condensed milk as an experiement and i made two kinds peppermint and vanilla with chocolate chips i put dye in both and i let each of them sit in the freezer over night because they didn't freeze in the time span the recipe said it would anyway they turned out to melt really fast and they didn't really feeze the entire way that ice cream is supposed to the one that froze properly but still melted really fast was the vanilla with chocolate chips colored green what happened was it the ingredients the coloring or what ok two things here you can make the ice cream with the fat free alternatives but because they have a much higher water content than fat content they freeze differently and have much bigger crystals because they simply freeze like water they will also melt like ice secondly the reason ice cream has that lovely smooth texture is because a machine continuously beats the mixture as it freezes this breaks down the ice crystals as they form and makes it soft to scoop without a machine you need to freeze your mixture in a flat shallow container so that it freezes more quickly and more evenly for a few hours at a time so that you can take the container out and beat it stir it hard with a wooden spoon the mixture should be slushy not super hard this method will work as well as a machine but you need to keep checking on your mixture every few hours depending on how fast your freezer works i don't think the colourings or chocolate chips will make much difference unless you used a pint of colouring i use an ice cream machine which has a pre freezable bowl and an electric paddle that keeps churning the mixture while it freezes it makes lovely soft ice cream but if i put it in the freezer to store i do have to soften it a little in the fridge for maybe minutes before serving as it's inclined to be harder than shop bought ice cream i use fat free yoghurt and fresh fruit try it again but stir it hard every hour or good luck Chocolate Milkshake Coffee Gelato Tea In-N-Out Burger Breakfast Refrigerator Carbon dioxide Milk Mayonnaise Japanese cuisine Cheese Idli Mango Bong Organic food Soft drink Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese tea ceremony Vanilla Bread Cold Stone Creamery Sherbet Sento Plastic Pottery Wood Baked Alaska Sea ice Textile manufacturing Ice Cheesecake Food Cookie Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Phase (matter) Pizza Butter Cream (food) House music Recipe Tlingit Dairy product Freezing Oreo Soup Kit Kat Drill bit Apple pie Casting Fire extinguisher Paint Glass D__ner kebab Brewery Fast bowling Welding Characters in the Smurfs French fries Light-emitting diode McDonald's Avalanche Steel Beer Microwave oven Amorphous ice Sushi Muesli Confectionery Mattress Veganism Bubble tea Cuisine of the Philippines Color Ice core Gatorade Sour cream Cider Ice cream cone Nuclear reactor
