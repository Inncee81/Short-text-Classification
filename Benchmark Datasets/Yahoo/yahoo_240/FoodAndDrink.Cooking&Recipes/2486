chemistry of cooking when you double a recipe why don't you double the salt everybody knows that if you double a recipe it's unwise to double the amount of salt this is also true of other spices but it's not true of the main ingredients you double the amount of flour eggs etc but not the amount of salt you're advised to reduce the relative amount and then add to taste i have always thought this was strange because when your guests eat the final product aren't they each getting one portion of an evenly mixed recipe how can their tongues know that this is one half of a doubled recipe and not the whole of a single portion recipe does anyone understand the science chemistry of this i've asked a dietitian no insight and looked at some websites all i have been able to find out so far is yes you use less than double the amount of salt and no one gives any explanation as to why some cookbooks recommend x instead of x the amount of salt could this be an approximation to square root of but can you explain it weight mass vs volume compound vs ionic form sensory thresholds i will not go deep into to this as you know science and can do your own work in a recipe's rheology the constituents are mutually dependent on another for the properties of chemistry physical sensory chemical physiology the latter being subject to individual tastes in the physical measurements a relation is established to reactions producing the physical result i e amount of yeast required to leaven bread dough in small batches the volume measurement is only an approximate of the mass ratios for perfect recipe development when recipes are doubled the ratios are also doubled and in some cases increased salt and the interactions of ingredients are effectived therefore an adjustment is required to compensate for the increased disparity of ratios when seasonings salt are used they ionize in solutions and are more readily detectable to the physiological perception of taste therefore they are scaled back for this purpose the more the recipe is mutiplied the more certain ingreidents are scaled back to compensate for the ratio balance or imbalance enjoy Chemistry Explosive material Carbon dioxide Ammonia Chocolate Microeconomics Pizza Water (molecule) Tofu Gravity Beer Idli Solar variation Hydrochloric acid Brewery Law of value Jewish cuisine Scientific method Electrophysiology Russian cuisine Emergence Rum Vegetarianism Biochemistry Cheese Plutonium Japanese cuisine Uranium Cold fusion Omega-3 fatty acid Experiment Hydrogen Alcoholic beverage Mass spectrometry LSD Enzyme Cannabis (drug) Decibel Healthy eating Sulfuric acid Titanium Iron Recipe Nuclear fusion Labor theory of value Pasta Quantum mechanics Plasma (physics) Chili con carne French fries Corrosion Normal distribution Egg (food) Raw food diet Supply and demand Nutrition Internal ballistics Helium Chlorine Surplus value Francis Crick Philosophy of science Sushi Salt Single Transferable Vote XML Acid Concentration Cooking weights and measures Isotope separation Organic food Cajun cuisine Carburetor Roman eating and drinking Energy Bayesian inference Technetium Sodium chloride Economic inequality Fuel injection Food Dumpling Muffin Rice pudding Atom
