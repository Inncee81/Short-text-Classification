i need a great recipie for flapjacks with no fruits or nuts i love them but everytime i make them the never turn out the way the pros make them any ideas well now that couldn't be any simpler i will start off by giving you a very basic flapjack recipe and then explain a few principles that will allow you to expand upon and create your own personal recipe ingredients cup all purpose flour cup whole milk large egg tsp salt cup sugar tblsp cooking oil tsp baking powder cap full vanilla substitute with tsp vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl go ahead and combine your dry ingredients put the flour salt sugar and baking powder into your mixing bowl using a whisk a fork will due to stir these ingredients be sure to mix the dry stuff as thoroughly as possible you especially want to make sure you get the baking powder mixed in well do not overdue this procedure as the dry ingredients will be taking on moisture from the atmosphere and you don't want this dry mix to take on any more water than absolutely necessary once you've mixed it well make a little bowl in the dry ingredients for your wet ingredients to be added to and place it aside at this point gather and prep your wet ingredients once we start to mix some things together here time is of the essence be well prepared to move swiftly through the steps now in a separate mixing bowl go ahead and break your egg the egg will need to be beaten this is very important you want to beat the egg and immediately add the oil milk and vanilla don't beat the egg with these other ingredients but rather beat the egg and as quickly as you can get your other wet ingredients into this second bowl it is not necessary to mix your wet ingredients together just get them all in the same bowl again being as quick as possible add your bowl full of wet ingredients to the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients from the earlier step add the wet ingredients to the bowl you made in your dry mix now the clock is ticking your whole batch is right in the palm of your hand right now if anything is going to ruin or just lower the quality of your flapjacks it will be this mixing together of the wet and the dry ingredients a whisk works well for this but i personally use the 'ol large wooden spoon you must be gentle now do not beat your pancake batter ever it will make your cakes a little tough stir gently with one hand while turning the mixing bowl with the other be careful to use the first half of the mixing process to scrape the sides and bottom of your mixing bowl this will get all of your dry ingredients into the game and prevent lumps once all of the dry ingredients are dislodged from the sides of the bowl and your whisk you can stir in earnest do not exceed or strokes here the more you handle this batter the less the flapjack will rise and they will also lose that tender fluffy yummy consistency your batter will probably look very thick viscous and maybe even a little lumpy when you are done mixing it it will actually look kind of like a failure it aint pretty but you are okay nonetheless it will look a little goopy for a bit after the batter is prepared it is a good idea to let it stand until it is back up to room temp your milk and eggs were likely refrigerated and will lower the temp of your batter not optimum for baking powder so let it warm up a bit before cooking to cook your flapjacks you'll need about what's considered medium high heat on an electric range this will be just under the halfway point on the temperature selector but ranges vary widely so experiment a good rule of thumb is to set the burner to the temp you feel is closest to my direction and then up a tiny more you'll need a pretty hot grill for good flapjacks keeping in mind of course that they will burn very easily the temp should rapidly burn butter but not just send it up in a poof of steam and carbon smoke margarine will violently dissipate on a properly warm cooking surface i use a half cup measuring cup for sizing my flapjacks the batter is so thick and goopy that if you use smaller amounts size becomes difficult to control and uniform pancake size makes it look like you know what you are doing now with all of that said the above recipe will produce thick cake like flapjacks many people do not like their pancakes this way some like them to have more substance this is the property of the number of eggs you put into your batter you can add another egg or even two total of for above recipe and the cakes will not rise as much and take on a more firm chewy consistency the important thing i'm trying to convey is less egg light and fluffy more egg thin and chewy that's the opposite effect eggs have on brownies by the way if you add egg to the above recipe and omit the egg yolk you essentially have a crepe additionally you can substitute part or all of the milk with yogurt that's right yogurt this will work against light and fluffy regardless of your egg content so be careful also i use quite a bit more baking powder in my cakes i list tsp for the recipe above personally i use tblsp that is a huge difference be careful baking powder is not tasteless and your mother in law can taste baking powder and cornstarch approximately years after their use and likely give you crud about it when she catches you did you notice the cooking oil in that recipe that is a bit of a trick i like to use for batters in general cooking oil is great to use when you must combine wet and dry ingredients but have limited mixing available the oil helps these two elements combine well additionally the oil will add a no stick effect once you are cooking your flapjacks this recipe is easy to double and triple it is a rule of thumb recipe i'm hoping just gives you a starting point to perfect your very own
