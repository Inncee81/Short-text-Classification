isn't there a way to chemically determine the ingredients of the secret kfc recipe i can't believe that the real recipe is still unknown after so many years sure there are a lot of real recipes out there but they are just guesses isn't it just something you can test in a lab i am a former chef and when i was in high school back in 's i worked at one in canada the thing is that the ingredients are not really a secret they are common food stuffs it is not the ingredients themself it is the proportions and the frying method used since colonel sander's start making it back in the 's at the gas station in corbin ky it has been either deep fried or pressure fried it is sealed in a pressure cooker fryer and cooks in minutes if you try to do that with a home pressure cooker it will either burn you with hot oil or explode the best ways is to use a home fryer and cook it at for minutes it is just a flour based coating so make one you like or try one of the so called recipes from the net it is still going to be a good meal Kentucky Fried Chicken Colonel Sanders Japanese cuisine Bread Slow cooker Pancake Ramen French fries Fried chicken Wok Kitchen Pizza Deep frying Stir frying Hamburger Cooking Cajun cuisine Tofu Barbecue Cantonese cuisine Cookware and bakeware Explosive material Ice cream Food preservation Potato Plastic D__ner kebab Soul food In-N-Out Burger French cuisine Bengali cuisine Curry Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Laos Korean cuisine Mayonnaise Food Risotto Fried dough foods Egg (food) Fire fighting Cuisine of the Southern United States Rice cooker Common bean Pasta Jiaozi Vegetarian cuisine Flour Stove Roux Carbon dioxide Chinese cuisine Internal ballistics Cuisine of Thailand Sandwich Idli Bacon Brewery Solar power Rice Breakfast Trans fat Russian cuisine Gumbo RuneScape skills Cuisine of Denmark Fire extinguisher Fish and chips French toast Pressure cooking Szechuan cuisine Fuel injection Fugu Biscuit Halva Apple pie British cuisine Potato chips Cuisine of the Philippines Peruvian cuisine Potato pancakes Chile pepper Welding Two-stroke cycle German cuisine Dumpling Cuisine of Malaysia Spacecraft propulsion Motor oil Tempura Dim sum Rice congee Fast food Soup Cuisine of Vietnam Chocolate Quesadilla
