what's for dinner tonight i'm making pizza with boboli wheat crust turkey bacon and feta cheese debating if i should do a red sauce or go with just e v o o extra virgin olive oil what do you think if you go with the olive oil try crushing up a garlic clove and letting it sit in the oil you will use for at least and hour if you are a real garlic fan just chop up a couple cloves and put it on the pizza no matter what sauce you use both ideas sound really great the red sauce a little more traditional but if you want your topping flavors to stand out more go with that olive oil Pizza Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Denmark Pizza Hut Tofu Breakfast Chili con carne Chicago-style pizza D__ner kebab Barbecue Hamburger Cuisine of Brazil Japanese cuisine Garlic Salad French cuisine Hot dog Bagel Pasta Curry Olive oil Jewish cuisine Bengali cuisine German cuisine Korean cuisine French fries Mayonnaise Domesticated turkey Cheese Cajun cuisine Fondue Cuisine of the Philippines Catalan cuisine Chicken soup Tapas Caesar salad Polish cuisine Soul food Italian cuisine Cantonese cuisine Kraft Dinner Oregano McDonald's Bread Culture of Turkey Cuisine of Africa Tabasco sauce Yoghurt Sauce Soy sauce Street food Ketchup Gyros Porridge Fish sauce Sandwich Roman eating and drinking Fish and chips Dumpling Roux Last meal Ice cream Cuisine of Norway Ramen Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Laos Kosher foods Clove In-N-Out Burger MRE Naples Idli Cincinnati chili Worcestershire sauce Cuisine of Canada Pancake Coffee Cuisine of Singapore Dim sum Cuisine of Argentina Rum Invader Zim Pot Noodle Fermentation Risotto Empanada Salsa (sauce) New Haven, Connecticut Food Okonomiyaki Essential oil Persian cuisine Wiener schnitzel Cuisine of the United States Kimchi Cuisine of Austria Soy milk
