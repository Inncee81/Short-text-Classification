i am making my first two tiered cake and i need some hints i decorate cakes all the time but this is the first time i have tried to make a stacked cake it is a castle cake and i have a top for the round which is plastic for turrets and then a goes on top of that do i frost the whole top of the first layer i am pretty sure the frosting will stick to the plastic turret round so would it be a good idea to have some spare frosting to sort of refrost the top once we take off the top layer i have never done this so i have no idea thanks i would probably frost the inch with a very thin layer of frosting just to make sure the plastic doesn't take half the cake out with it when you remove it i would have spare frosting available to redo the inch once the plastic turret is off Cake Violin Floppy disk Christmas tree Poker jargon Plastic Paper size Cuisine of Denmark Mooncake Wedding cake Cookie Knife Tank Iowa class battleship Pop-Tarts Casting Screw Japanese cuisine Early IBM disk storage Ammunition M16 (rifle) Twin Peaks Cookware and bakeware B-47 Stratojet Beehive (beekeeping) Woodworking Apple Glacier Reinforced concrete B-24 Liberator Bread Panzer I Riot control Punch card Table saw Pottery P-61 Black Widow Pancake Mach kernel Coffee Nunchaku Tire Robert Frost Turret Tofu Campfire Panzer II OV-10 Bronco Bullet Pizza Billiards Milk Printed circuit board Curling Cider Refrigerator Combine (Half-Life 2) Masonry Opportunity rover Gramophone record Nine Inch Nails Drill bit Cuisine of Singapore Sub-Zero Ammolite Turok: Rage Wars Chicago-style pizza The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Solar cell Weathering M4 Sherman Timpani M551 Sheridan Boat building Shotgun Flax Quicksort Textile manufacturing terminology Spatula The 7th Guest Dim sum Draw poker Mouse (computing) Hey Jude Chair Thermal power station Armoured warfare Terminal ballistics Tobacco The Fairly OddParents Cinderella Castle Knitting Brush Compact audio cassette Leather Baked Alaska Hair EXpanded MultiPlayer
