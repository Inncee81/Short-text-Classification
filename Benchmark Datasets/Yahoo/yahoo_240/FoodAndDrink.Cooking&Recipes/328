what can i use to substitute vanilla for cookies do i even need it i'm making chocolate chip cookies and i don't know what to substitute i looked on other answers and using juice would be weird for this recipe could i sub maple syrup the best thing would be to avoid the vanilla if you're making choco chip cookies because chocolate in itself is a natural flavour why add vanilla to it and if you are making plain cookies then add things like nuts or milk powder substitute the vanilla by adding rose syrup mango syrup in place of the maple syrup not only will they smell good but also will taste good and you can have an assortment of different flavoured cookies making it rich sans the artificial vanilla flavour Chocolate Vanilla Cookie Ice cream Cake Oreo Cheesecake Soy milk Yoghurt Mango Milkshake French toast Coffee Sugar Kit Kat Soft drink Cocoa Cuisine of the Philippines Lemonade Honey Biscuit Maple syrup Genericized trademark Gelato Peruvian cuisine Fenugreek Tea Coca-Cola Bubble tea Vodka Food preservation Muesli In-N-Out Burger Rum Pecan pie Breakfast Twix Cold Stone Creamery Bacon Flavouring Patent medicine Hot chocolate Apple pie Golden syrup Cuisine of Denmark Marshmallow Gatorade Mooncake Sundae Bread George Burns Yoplait Corn syrup Bayesian inference Bayes' theorem Russian cuisine Oatmeal Milk Food additive Baklava American Chinese cuisine Food Fish and chips Girl Scout cookies Snack food Bagel Cuisine of Canada Vinegar The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Diet soda Polish cuisine German cuisine Cookie Monster Potato chips Nestl__ Nesquik Risotto Vanilla Coke Ginger Cadbury Schweppes Cuisine of Argentina Bengali cuisine Worcestershire sauce Neiman Marcus Custard Single malt Scotch Drink Vanilla Ninja Japanese cuisine Veganism Soy sauce Chili con carne Frappuccino Ruth Graves Wakefield Sugarcane Pattern language Meat analogue
