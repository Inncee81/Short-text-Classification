how do u do to avoid your lasagna get burnt when you cook it well this depends upon what is getting burnt if it's the bottom layer only would recommend moving up it up level in the oven so not so close to the bottom another trick is to place the lasagna pan onto a sheet pan with at least a lip in the over and pour water in sheet pan till water reaches top edges of sheet pan the water will help control the heat on bottom of pan and heat more evenly if it's your top getting burned then make sure you are covering the top of you lasagna with foil completely where air can't get to it i also spray the foil side that is going on the actually lasagna with pan release spray they make them flavored and i like the garlic ones this ensures it won't stick to the cheese when it melts if you are burning on on both top and bottom then your cooking it to long or at to high a temperature hope this helps Cookware and bakeware Brewery Bong Fire fighting Lasagna Coffee Barbecue Bread Casting Cheese Pasta Fire extinguisher Printed circuit board Glacier Microwave oven Sea ice Mattress Chicago-style pizza Two-stroke cycle Idli Bacon Motor oil Tofu Japanese cuisine Thermal power station Plastic Drill bit Yoghurt Pizza Solar power Aluminium Solar box cooker Roux Solar cell Campfire Steam engine Opportunity rover Apollo Command/Service Module Ricotta cheese Pottery Sailing Boat building Gas metal arc welding Stove Turbocharger Internal ballistics Houseplant Hangi Air conditioning Refrigerator Water (molecule) Pancake Agar plate Schlock Mercenary Jewish cuisine Radon Roast beef Pop-Tarts Swimming Powder metallurgy Iron Stir frying Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Steel Saturn Disc brake Butter Seismic retrofit Ice core Hot dog Cuisine of Brazil Spark plug Heat Cookie Glossary of nautical terms Glass Curling Traditional animation Risotto Amateur telescope making Garlic Hot air balloon Pizza Hut Tooth Vermicompost Slow cooker Hiking Bagel Fondue Mooney M20 Recipe Laser engraving In-N-Out Burger Hand grenade Tin
