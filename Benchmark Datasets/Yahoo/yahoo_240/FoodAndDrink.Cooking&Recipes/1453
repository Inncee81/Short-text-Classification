hawaiin sweetbread i saw a box of hawaiin sweetbread mix and am wondering if it is something worth making i am assuming it is a bread like zucchini bread or banana bread that you might eat alone with a cup of coffee and not a bread like white wheat or rye that you use to make sandwiches or for dinner etc am i right yes it is a regular bread the recipe is probably adapted from a portuguese sweetbread recipe as that was what most of the people in hawaii are familiar with it is called pao doce or pan dos or something similar to that in portuguese Bread Japanese cuisine Breakfast German cuisine Flour Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Muffin Cuisine of Argentina Serbian cuisine Hamburger French toast Cuisine of Turkey Russian cuisine Pancake Jewish cuisine Polish cuisine Rice pudding Potato chips Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of Brazil Passover Pumpernickel bread Minas Gerais Swedish cuisine Beer Pita Bagel Biscuit Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Africa Hot dog Cuisine of the Philippines Milkshake Offal Cuisine of the Southern United States Kosher foods Sandwich Vegetarian cuisine Food Hawaii Bengali cuisine Coffee Pasta Toast Portugal McDonald's Alcoholic beverage Taboo food and drink British cuisine Yakitate!!
