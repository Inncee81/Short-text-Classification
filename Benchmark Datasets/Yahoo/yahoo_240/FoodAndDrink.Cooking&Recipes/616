love buffalo chicken wings want a better recipe so when i make buffalo wings i simply spice up the chicken bake or fry and toss in some room temp sauce such as frank's here is the problem when i go to restaurants and order wings they are never super runny and the sauce seems to be more of a thick coating i have feeling what i'm missing is some type of breading or perhaps marination but as much as i love the sauce itself i hate that it just runs of the chicken any suggestions for how to make my sauce thicken and stick the reason wing sauces in restaurants stick on the wings better is this there's butter mixed in with the hot sauce and portion control use cup of sauce for wings they toss the wings in a big mixing bowl and then slide them or use tongs to put them on the plate Buffalo wings Pizza Japanese cuisine Barbecue D__ner kebab Cuisine of Denmark French fries Pancake Cuisine of the Philippines Hot dog Curry Bread Ramen Cantonese cuisine Tofu Cajun cuisine Bengali cuisine Cha chaan teng Fried chicken Kebab Canadian Chinese cuisine McDonald's Pizza Hut Cuisine of Singapore French cuisine Jewish cuisine MRE Fish and chips Fish sauce Cookware and bakeware Korean cuisine Gumbo Dumpling Porridge Chicken Peruvian cuisine Potato chips Sandwich Burger B__chamel sauce Mayonnaise Cuisine of Laos Maple syrup Dairy Cuisine of Brazil French toast Ketchup Satay Soy sauce Domesticated turkey Taiwanese cuisine Fast-food restaurant Caribbean Chinese cuisine Empanada Cuisine of Greece Jiaozi Hot sauce Croquet (food) Milkshake Polish cuisine Cuisine of Cambodia Cookie Alfredo Wiener schnitzel American Chinese cuisine Roux Pasta Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo British cuisine Kung pao chicken Cincinnati chili Beef noodle soup Cuisine of Africa Roman eating and drinking Kentucky Fried Chicken Nabemono Hot pot Meatloaf Tea Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of India Donburi Sushi Bearnaise sauce Shawarma Customs and etiquette of Japan Hip hop collaborations Puff pastry Super Bowl XXV Tabasco sauce
