why do people use measurements when you get a recipe for making a meal cake cookies etc why do they put specific measurements when the person who actuall came up with the concosion they did not say tsp of salt tbsp butter etc what they did was mixed it together cooked it the way they wanted with their taste buds and tried it out the way i make my concosions is the same i look in my cabinet see what i have see what my taste good together see what seasonings i have that could possibly flavor it to my taste buds then cook it i do no measuring when you watch racheal ray she does the exact same thing she gets everything she needs for the recipe then begins making it but uses no measuring so why do recipes come with measurements recipes come with measurements to assure the same results each time for some recipes especially in baking it is very important to follow the recipe exactly or it will not turn out right Bread French cuisine Alice B.
