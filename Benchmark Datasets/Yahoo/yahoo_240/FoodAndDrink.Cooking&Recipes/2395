i'm canadian and i need an answer from an american who knows a little about cooking ok i have a question i'm sure it will sound like a stupid one to you americans but i'm willing to risk sounding stupid i need to know when ever i get a recipe from an american site i have to do some conversions i don't mind that but will someone please tell me what stick of butter is is it a cup cup and what is a cube of butter i really don't know thanks a bunch ok i see that even some of you aren't sure some say it's a cup some say it's a cup that makes me feel better at least i'm not the only person who needed this cleared up i'm going to go with most of you who say it's a cup the cube thing is still a mystery though that's ok i'll go with ilene w and take the recipe into context good advice thanks to all of you i appreciate your help you don't sound stupid i understand that conversions can be a pain in the neck one stick of butter is equivalent to cup or tablespoons i'm pretty sure that a cube of butter is referring to the same thing you see in america butter and margarine are sold in a box that holds sticks or in other words cups americans can be very sloppy with language so if you have a recipe that says cube take it into context for example if you are making cookies and it says to use one cube of butter it is far more reasonable to assume that it would be cup rather than tablespoon however if you are going to sautee an onion in a cube of butter it would be ridiculous to use cup but reasonable to use tablespoon sticks i know cubes that's just sloppy english Cooking weights and measures Volume Chili con carne Butter Joke Hiberno-English Curry Margarine Social rule Haggis Dualism (philosophy of mind) U.S. customary units Shit Tofu Peanut butter Soup Theory of conduct Singlish Mayonnaise Paul Is Dead Alice B.
