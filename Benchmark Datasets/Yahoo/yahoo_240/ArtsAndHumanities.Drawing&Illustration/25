i want to drop out of college and become an artist how can i not end up a bum i don't want to go to college any more i'm sick of the crap money spent classes dropped bullshit grades i want to make art but that sounds like a hit or miss sort of thing we all know it if your art sucks that means no money i do have a day job but with my spare time i really want to make paintings for enjoyment and sale how do i do this the professional way how do i make money to support myself and my family with my art work if you want to be a good artist stay in school get an education you will probably be happier going to an art school where you can focus your time on your art art school is important because it offers the environment that will help improve your art by having others critique your ideas and skill art school offers opportunities to meet other artists and develop connections that will last you a lifetime most successful artists not only have an undergraduate degree but a graduate degree stay in school Graduate school Master's degree Education in the People's Republic of China College No Child Left Behind Act Art Education in Germany Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Johns Hopkins University Avenue Q University of Central Florida Harvard University Grade (education) Babson College Medical school University of Alabama Law school GED Northeastern University, Boston Georgetown University Live 8 Art school Harvard Division of Continuing Education Clark Atlanta University Carnegie Mellon University Education in Taiwan Billboard Hot 100 Affirmative action Bachelor of Arts Education in Japan University of Pennsylvania Shit Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism University of Maryland Baltimore County Tufts University Economic inequality Otterbein College American University Juris Doctor College admissions Software engineering Academia Florida Institute of Technology Trinity College, Dublin York University Homeschooling Air Education and Training Command Electronic Arts University of Houston Baruch College Western Kentucky University Capitalism Drew University Florida State University Modernism Chinese University of Hong Kong University of California, San Diego Cornell University Bilkent University Pennsylvania State University Columbia University The College of New Jersey Seneca College Trinity University (Washington, DC) Anarchism and society Australian National University Teacher Liberal arts Brown University Community college Emerson College University of Hawaii at Manoa Cooper Union Virginia Commonwealth University Regent University University of Notre Dame Education in Australia Franklin W.
