what is good software for logo design i heard adobe illustrator is good but has anyone tried it to any success what are the pros cons to it any others thanks i personally like macromedia fireworks for fast logos it is very easy to pick up various pieces and move them around without clicking on layers i can bring it into flash and create some movement then i can save it as a gif for a moving logo on a website here is an example of a logo i created some while back using fireworks and flash http www coblercorp com i created the image of all the computer pieces on the side in photoshop on the other hand adobe illustrator is the pro when you just can't settle for anything less than the best because it is so compatible with adobe photoshop the effects are endless the tricky thing is learning to use the pen tool once you have that mastered you need to master how to make lines go under and over each other it's best to take a college class if you've never worked with this type of software as it can be a bit difficult a good professor can teach you a lot of shortcuts well worth the investment if this is your career Adobe Photoshop Macromedia Flash Graphic design PNG Macromedia Fireworks Drawing Adobe Systems GIMP 2D computer graphics Adobe Illustrator Web page Opera (web browser) Screenshot IBM PC compatible IPod Adobe InDesign Portable Document Format GIF Game programmer ASCII art Scalable Vector Graphics Trademark ColdFusion Web design Stereoscopy Apple typography Traditional animation Paint Shop Pro Web browser Finale notation program Tagged Image File Format Graphics Product activation Goatse.cx Ajax (programming) Software engineering JavaScript Final Cut Pro B3ta Photoshopping MP3 Nextoons: the Nicktoons Film Festival Adobe Acrobat Desktop publishing Website AmigaOS Extreme Programming Computer virus Web template Apple Computer Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Office Mac OS X Plugin Software documentation Apple Macintosh Python programming language Vector graphics editor Floppy disk Rich Internet Application Logo programming language Computer graphics BitTorrent HTML PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Ebook Casting Version Quake III Arena HyperCard E-mail Wallpaper group Java programming language WordPerfect Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 Drill bit QuickTime Endgame Read-only memory Free software Motorola 68000 Unicode VJ Embedded system Internet Relay Chat DVD Computer CPU design Secure Digital card University of San Francisco
