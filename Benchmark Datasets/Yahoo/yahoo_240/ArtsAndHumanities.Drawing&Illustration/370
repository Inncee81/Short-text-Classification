drawing question please help i am good at drawing but i havent practiced in years it is the only talent i have and i am worried that if i let it go too long i will lose it please help how often should i practice and stuff if its not too late i love to draw and paint as well sometimes you may go through artist block or be pulled away because of circumstances don't give up you won't lose your talent talents are a gift you are born with and will always have it's like riding a bike you never forget i have gone for a couple of years dry spell and still been able to draw and paint as always fortunately that hasn't happened much so just dont be nervous and pick it up again start with something you are comfortable drawing and ease back into it you will be back where you were if not better i tend to draw for a least an hour a day to keep in practise to me that is what works sometimes all i do is draw all day long even if you draw just a few minutes a day working it into your schedule that will always help but a good rule of thumb i hear alot of artists say is to practice an hour each day if you can Milton H.
