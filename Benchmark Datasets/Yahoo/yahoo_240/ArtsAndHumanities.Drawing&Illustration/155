get inspired to draw again so i've been having a drawers block for awhile i really don't know how to snap out of it and get back into the game any advice i know how you feel and i hate the feeling my advice to you is to take a class no matter how skilled you are you can always learn something new your art teacher will give you different assignments depending on what kind of class you take you could do it through a recreation department or through your local community college this may help to get your mind going again if you travel then use that as your inspiration draw the people places and experiences you come across this sounds a bit silly but when i am stuck in the house and i need an idea i will stare at the stucco plaster on the ceiling until i see something and i will draw that do you have friends who are artists as well you could do a collaborative piece together if you can't get together with them have them email you a bunch of weird rules for a painting i e you can only use primary colors you must have three straight lines stretching from one side of the canvas to the other it must be in mixed media it has to be a comment on current political or social situations etc and you do the same for them then e mail pictures of the paintings to each other to see how they turned out i hope this helps Drawing Stucco Art John Cage Martial art Skinny Puppy Transactional analysis Georges-Pierre Seurat Piet Mondrian Wassily Kandinsky Shaggy dog story Social rule Billiards W.I.T.C.H.
