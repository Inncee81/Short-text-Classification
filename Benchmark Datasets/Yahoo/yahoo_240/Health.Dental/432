swelling after root canal i had a broken lower molar that started to act up the past couple weeks a dull aching pain i went to the dentist and he recommended i save the tooth get a root canal and crown the tooth he is not able to finish the root canal and puts a temp seal on my tooth and has scheduled me to come back in to complete the root canal on monday about hours after the root canal my cheek and lower jaw started to swell up it now is almost a golf ball size swelling the dentist did not indicate there was an infection but did provide me motrin and antibiotics i've been taking both and icing the swelling which is pretty tender so far it hasn't gotten any bigger but not any smaller either should i be worried so it is getting a bit worse now i called my dentist and he said to wait overnight and let the antibiotics kick in he said he really doesn't want to open it up to expose it i demanded he see me today and i have an appointment in hours it seems as though it is progressing towards me eye what a day dentist opened it up cleaned it out recapped it went to the er they did a ct scan of me and found that i had no absess caused by the tooth i only had swelling and most likely the root of the infection may have been at the injection sites they put me on an iv and pumped antibiotics clindamycin and prescribed me some i don't have a fever my jawbone is fine and i don't have an elevated white blood cell count so they let me go and said the antibiotics should do the trink oh and they pumped me with morphine times for the pain i'm feeling a bit better now and the swelling is starting to slowly subside yay absolutely get he tooth opened up immediately i am a dentist the bacteria is causing a huge infection and unless you treat it now the infection will travel farther the dentist should have left the toot open to drain and by not cleaning it all out an infection has presented itself the only reason you are not in huge pain is because of the antibiotics the swelling is not a good sign and you need care asap if not sooner call and go now this can not wait if you have any other questions please ask marie Group A streptococcal infection Wisdom teeth Tooth Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Tuberculosis Dental caries AIDS Mouth ulcer Gonorrhoea Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Cellulitis Radiation therapy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intravenous therapy Electrophysiology Acne Infectious mononucleosis Psoriasis Babe Ruth Conjunctivitis Root canal Dentistry Breastfeeding Maxilla Anthrax Hip fracture Diarrhea Common cold Antibiotic Fancy rat Multiple sclerosis Medical prescription Obstetrics Bubonic plague Weight training Pharyngitis Cocaine Penicillin Carpal tunnel syndrome Stomach cancer Mandible Malaria Abortion Gout Syphilis Domestic rabbit Myocardial infarction Rheumatic fever Virus Tooth enamel Guinea pig Herpes simplex virus Tenshinhan Needle aspiration biopsy Sickle-cell disease Diabetes mellitus Intraocular lens Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Body piercing Paget's disease of bone Chlorpromazine Helicobacter pylori Cephalexin Diabetic retinopathy The Dentist Ehrlichiosis Hepatitis Methamphetamine Shark Intracranial pressure Allergy Social rule Urinary incontinence HIV test Asthma Cystoscopy Lymphogranuloma venereum Shock Rosacea Ebola Clindamycin Leukemia Lupus erythematosus
