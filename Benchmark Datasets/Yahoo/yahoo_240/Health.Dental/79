cavity problem i think i have a really bad cavity in the back of my mouth on one of the top molars since it hurts but how can i see my tooth it would have a dark spot if i had a cavity can you give me ideas on how to look at my tooth up and back there if you go to a large pharmacy like boots or superdrug they sell those little mirrors that the dentist uses to look at your upper teeth they cost a few pounds not much otherwise look around the house for a small mirror and use that look in a normal mirror and stick the small one in your mouth so that you can see the affected tooth but whether or not you can see anything if your tooth hurts you need to see a dentist Tooth Dental caries The Dentist Dentistry Tooth enamel Dental brace Mandible Oral hygiene Wisdom teeth Dental fillings Laser Radula Crocodilia Methamphetamine Dentures Root canal Tyrannosaurus rex Fluoride therapy Gingivitis Halitosis Bruxism Tutankhamun Gear Medical prescription Domestic rabbit Gray Wolf Eryops Glen Jacobs Trapping Laminal consonant Wood Fancy rat Pneumonia Crown (dentistry) Elephant Tetrapod Gastrointestinal tract Ulna Embouchure Vowel Tooth development Evolution of the Horse Fangtooth Horse tack Netsuke The Shining (film) Face Cephalic disorder Esophagus Piezoelectricity Dentition Sea star Items in the Metroid series Casting The Legend of Zelda series enemies Erogenous zone Amateur telescope making Shen Gong Wu Saw First aid Orthodontics Dental floss Raisin Modelocking Dental hygienist Sphenoid bone Temporal bone Kurt Angle Doom enemies Punisher Cat Manner of articulation Computer virus The Fairly OddParents Siphon Cavity magnetron Speed of light Place of articulation Physical characteristics of the Buddha Hangul Babe Ruth Gag (BDSM) Equine conformation Normal distribution Jaw Macropod Mirror Universe (Star Trek) Redundant array of independent disks Advertising Michelson-Morley experiment Hell in a Cell Zipper Externality Ivory Smash Mouth Optical cavity Sir John Randall Kirby Grover Cleveland
