question about retainers hey people i had my braces a year ago then my dentist told me to wear retainers for around months i wore them may be even for a little more than months and then for a few weeks only in the night they broke a few months ago so i just wanna ask that for how long do u need to wear retainers only at night and yes do tight retainers cause any serious damage thanks in anticipation mistake my first sentence is supposed to be 'i had my braces removed a year ago ' hi there i'm a registered dental assistant and have had extensive orthodontic work myself so i've been there go get your retainers fixed a s a p teeth shift very fast especially in the first year or so after braces the movement may not be noticeable until you pop back in your retainer that explains the tightness you feel your retainer is pushing the teeth back in position all to retain that hard work you and your braces did you shouldn't shove or have to push hard to put your retainer on your orthodontist will need to do adjustments to your retainer from time to time after dropping or not wearing for too long retainers are a life long commitment sorry but true some people wear them every night some a couple nights a week so i suggest you get a appointment to fix and or adjust your retainers it's worth it the worst is already behind you hope it made sense good luck smiles Dental brace Orthodontics Dentistry Carpal tunnel syndrome Kurt Angle Equine conformation Tooth The Dentist Mattress New York Giants Crown (dentistry) Dentures Tooth enamel Avenue Q Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Plame affair Aerial (dance move) The Ashlee Simpson Show Eddie Guerrero Rugby union positions Knife Strap-on dildo Rod Stewart Skateboarding trick Dog training 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Citadel (Military College) Non-native pronunciations of English Battle of the Bulge Swingout View camera Theory of conduct Spice Girls Dental caries Year of the Spider Extreme Programming Undergarment EastEnders The Chemical Brothers Cliff Richard Donald Neilson Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hall & Oates Paul Levesque Keynesian economics Diving Glossary of American football Bicycle brake systems Pitaten Menstrual cup Jon Secada Floyd Rose Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Piccolo Junior Saga Singlish Enigma machine Milton H.
