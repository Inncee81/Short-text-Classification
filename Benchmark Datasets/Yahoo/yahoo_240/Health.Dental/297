can i sue my dentist for not letting me know the cons of porcelain veneers i feel cheated i had porcelain veneers done to my front teeth in dec and my teeth are still sensitive after months i can't sleep at night because i feel that i made a big mistake by getting them done in the first place my dentist never warned me that the sensitivity would last this long or that my tooth would have to be shaved down dramatically i found all this out after i got it done i've been doing a lot of research lately and found out that if you have more of your tooth shaved down there would be more trauma to the tooth so more sensitivity i feel that my dentist was not looking out for my best interest because if he were then he would have warned me of the after math and what i would have to go through i don't know what to do in response to the certified dentist above so you are saying that the dentist was at no fault when he obviously knew that by shaving her teeth which were protuding would cause trauma and prolonged sensitivity whether or not this person has a case or not i am not sure but to put all the blame on the patient is absolutely ridiculous who said that she wanted her hand held like a st grader that is a very insensitive and rude response on your part to answer your question julie i am not completely sure about the legal ramifications but i hope you have a case because bastards like these have no right to practice best of luck to you EastEnders Social rule Dentistry Abortion Plame affair Dental caries Tooth enamel Slander and libel Methamphetamine Chronic fatigue syndrome 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Infantilism Divorce Characters in the Smurfs Autism Baldness Crown (dentistry) Tooth General practitioner Hypnosis False memory Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dentures Dental brace Russian joke AIDS reappraisal Narcissism Bruxism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Abortion debate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Karl Rove Stuttering Friends Kurt Cobain Rape Sampling (music) Post-traumatic stress disorder 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Radio Yerevan Ocean's Twelve Wisdom teeth Scientology beliefs and practices Carpal tunnel syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Dissociative identity disorder Jon Secada Terri Schiavo Transsexuality Coeliac disease Knots Landing Tai Chi Chuan Milton H.
