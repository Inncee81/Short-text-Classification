dental bridge i have having one put in tomorrow however i read that the st appt they prepare the teeth and then take a cast of the teeth but my dentist took the cast before any prep on the teeth supportin the false tooth is this still ok or will there be a problem now also why do they have to grind your good teeth down cant they just fit something over them that wont eventually cause damage to the teeth well he showed me what the bridge would look like and it was caps on each side of a tooth made in the lab i am assuming he is puttin the other teeth over my exsiting teeth since i only have one tooth missing the cost is not my concerne the insurance is picking up the tab on this one he made sure before even suggestin to have it put in i just kinda feel like its a waste of time cuase its in the back and it doesnt really affect my confidence or anything since no one sees it anyways i just cant find much reserch out there about them and ppl told me they hurt for days after first off there are several kinds of possible bridges you're having put in the treatment of each depends on what kind you're having i have a marilyn bridge which was inserted almost years ago which is a miracle they usually fall out after or less the imprint of my teeth was made prior to my bridge being implanted they did this so the prostetics company the people who made my porcelin teeth knew what size and shape to make my teeth then when my prostetic was inserted the dentist drilled two 'grooves' down the side of each supporting tooth and slid the bridge into the tracks grooves he made some adhesive was used to ensure the bridge was secure in the grooves i have had not one problem with my marilyn bridge the space in between my 'real' teeth is too small for an implant so this is the only option for me both my 'fake' teeth and my 'real' teeth are fine my 'real' teeth have a layer of adhesive holding the prostetic into the grooves so there is no risk of cavity there or no risk more than anywhere else fitting something over your real teeth would be a porcelin veneer type cosmetic dentistry which costs much more and has the same risks as a marilyn bridge they both can be stained they both can come loose they both can affect the neighboring teeth if you're having a bridge installed make sure that your dentist has done this many times or is working with a dentist that is make sure you're prostetic company is experience and has a warranty on their prostetic the last thing you need is a manufacturer problem causing your bridge to break insurance may not cover that you'll do fine make sure you floss under and around the bridge and you'll do fine congrats on yoru new teeth Dentistry Tooth enamel Dental brace Tooth Drill bit Dental caries Crown (dentistry) Dentures Plastic Prostate cancer Cosmetic dentistry Insurance Methamphetamine Oral hygiene Floppy disk Seismic retrofit Screw Gramophone record Urinary incontinence The Dentist Menstrual cup Domestic rabbit Key (lock) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Dental fillings Mattress Internal ballistics Bruxism Dental floss Casting Stem cell Equine conformation Mandible Knife Nine Inch Nails Pneumonia Tire Orthodontics Bullet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Printed circuit board Scientology beliefs and practices Humphrey Bogart Life insurance Woodworking Medicine Bluetooth Health insurance Acupuncture Marilyn Monroe Halitosis Citigroup Procrastination Fluoride therapy Electrical wiring Table saw Hand grenade Nuclear power Epistemology Mercury (element) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asbestos Ethernet Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Solar cell Radiation therapy Capital accumulation Extreme Programming Trapping Glacier De Lorean DMC-12 Cephalic disorder The Fairly OddParents Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Publicly funded medicine Portsmouth Block Mills USB flash drive Laserdisc USS Yorktown (CV-5) Computer virus Tank Gingivitis Breast implant Humerus Option Car handling Coeliac disease Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Stroke Risk management Wire Condom Enigma machine Traumatic brain injury
