molar problem i have a horrible dental problem that i need advice on about seven years ago i know i was on vacation with my family i was chewing some gum and a good chunk of my right upper molar fell out into the gum i was chewing i guess i had a cavity and the tooth was so weak the piece just broke off anyway i haven't gotten it fixed yet i didn't really have the money for oral surgery the tooth has become grayish in color and the hole is still there with the gum exposed i can't chew on that side because whenever i do the exposed gum swells up and sometimes bleeds it feels like it might be filled with some sort of fluid i saw a dentist a year or so ago and he said i'd definitely need a root canal i should be getting this problem fixed soon but my question is what can i expect what is the basic procedure and will they put a crown or something in so that i can use that side of my mouth again any advice would be greatly appreciated also it hurts when anything touches the gum that's exposed it's incredibly sensitive the nerve in the tooth is dead causing the tooth to appear blackened the root canal procedure is basically simple and when it is done by an endodontists is virtually painless you will probably be prescribed an antibiotic first and teeth cleaning along with xrays root canals are done in visits they will clean out the old decay and dead nerve and place a temporary filling to make sure it is not bothering you later on meanwhile you will be checked for a accurate tooth color on your molar cap your next visit will be to grind down the molar enough to glue cap on and as usual will have to bite down on a special carbon paper to see if there is a part of the molar needing to be filed down to fit the grooves of your bite if this is not done properly you can have pain and have to go back for the cap to be properly fitted Dentistry Tooth enamel Root canal Dental brace First aid Gingivitis Wisdom teeth Maxilla Halitosis Dentures Chronic fatigue syndrome Fecal incontinence Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Pneumonia Dialysis Bruxism Cocaine Oral hygiene Mouth ulcer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Fancy rat Poker jargon Explosive material Domestic rabbit Fluoride therapy Prostate cancer Traumatic incident reduction Oral cancer Hamster Breastfeeding Electrophysiology Knife Hand grenade Wood Radiation therapy Condom Mojave people Bong Oral sex Internal ballistics Dental fillings CPU cache Medical prescription Dental implant Certified Nursing Assistant Cat Evidence of evolution Equine conformation Violin Dental floss Local anesthesia Surgery Medicine Hip fracture Chess terminology Babe Ruth Gramophone record Ferret The Dentist Kryptonite Erogenous zone Sawfiler Vernon Schillinger Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
