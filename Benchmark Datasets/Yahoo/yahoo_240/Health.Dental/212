can this be done by a dentist wisedom tooth extr before any of you click the reply button for this question please keep in mind that this question is primary directed towards licensed dentists only so if you are not a dentist i appreciate the time you took to read my question but i can't really accept advice from you so no hard feelings now for the dentists i have a wisedom tooth which is impacted horizontally i went to see a dentist but she referred me to a maxillofacial surgen the nearest appointment for the maxillofacial surgen is in the mid of september more than a month away i am afraid that by that time my wisedom tooth will crack the nd molar tooth i'll live the next month in agony and pain and i will lose molar teeth instead of one here is how my wisedom tooth looks like and its position http www animated teeth com wisdom teeth impacted wisdom tooth an gif can this be removed by a private dentist or does this procedure require a maxillofacial surgen not only a dentist needs to give you advice on this because lots of people have gone through the same thing and probably have asked the same questions as you like me both of my bottom wisdom teeth were impacted horizontally my family dentist is the one that discovered them through x rays but referred me to an oral surgeon too he said that it was something that he didn't do in his office because oral surgeons actually specialize in stuff like that and the surgery was a little more complicated than a normal extraction your dentist is doing this for your own good don't worry mine were discovered in june i didn't get an appointment with the surgeon until september and then i ended up having the surgery in november nothing happened to my other teeth during all those months so you have nothing to worry about the most that they said would happen is that the wisdom teeth would just push my other teeth out of alignment but they moved right back into place after the surgery i ended up having all out at once my top ones were fine my oral surgeon insisted on doing my surgery under general anaesthetic at a hospital because of the horizontal teeth so if they suggest that it's not such a bad idea trust me they give you a local one too so you can't feel your jaw area plus they knock you out so you can't feel a thing during the whole surgery Dentistry Tooth Oral and maxillofacial surgery Dental brace Surgery Dental caries Orthodontics Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Medicine Transsexuality Grover Cleveland National Health Service Milton H.
