what does the shot feel like when they have to numb your tooth to prepare for dental work i have to get fillings on monday and a root canal sometime after that i just want to know what it feels like because i'm petrified ok i just had that exact same thing done like hours ago the numbing medicine isn't bad because first they put a q tip on the area where the numbing needle goes with this numbing liquid so you can't even feel the needle go in they tend to do shot on the outer part of the teeth and one on the inner fillings aren't bad at all after you're numbed you just close your eyes and they go to work drilling and filling i only had to get done today and it took about a half in hour so you'll probably take a couple hors the root canal is a different story i had only root canal and it took almost and a half hours now you definitely don't want to look while they're doing the root canal either ask for some headphones and music or bring you're ipod like i did that way you don't hear the drill they use or the needle that they use to clear the root you'll want to keep your eyes closed because they stick inch long needles in there and then leave them there for x rays and stuff if you feel anything after they numb you just raise your hand or give a little moan and they'll add more after all they are dealing with the nerve of your tooth and the very roots of it there's going to be lots of pushing and pulling but it doesn't hurt you just feel the pressure honestly the worst part for me was the assistant who was going to town with the thing that suck the saliva out of your mouth with the vacuum honestly just bring your ipod clothes your eyes and it will be over before you know it i was freaking out too and it wasn't half as bad as my mind made it out to be Tooth Textile manufacturing Drill bit Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Naruto jutsu Dental caries The Inside Carpal tunnel syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Carburetor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina EastEnders Strap-on dildo Campfire Milton H.
