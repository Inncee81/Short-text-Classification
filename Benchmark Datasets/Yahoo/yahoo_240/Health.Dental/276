getting cavities filled during pregnancy i have quite a few cavities that i need to get filled and i'm months pregnant i got two filled the other day and the dentist told me that nothing they gave me would affect the baby i called my doctor a few days later just to make sure and they said it was fine but that it's best to wait until after i have the baby to do it if at all possible but she repeatedly told me that if my teeth were bothering me i should go ahead and do it so then i researched it a little online and found that the epinephrine that is combined with the local anesthesia can cause minor birth defects should i wait as far as my insurance goes it would be much better for me to get it done this year but my baby's not due until dec do dentists ever offer to give local anesthesia without epinephrine and what are the minor birth defects that it can cause also will the cavity fillings hurt a lot more without the epinephrine as long as you are out of the first trimester you should be just fine and yes there are anesthetics without epi they do not get you as profoundly numb and do not keep you numb as long but they are definitely an option if you are out of the st trimester and the dentist is aware of the situation and confident i would not worry about it Pregnancy Local anesthesia Abortion Breastfeeding Miscarriage Dentistry Dental caries Intact dilation and extraction Childbirth Epidural Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation EastEnders Tooth Congenital disorder Spina bifida Cephalic disorder Melanie Wilkes Abortion in the United States Prenatal diagnosis Diabetic retinopathy Dental fillings Caesarean section Tooth enamel Syringomyelia Folic acid Psoriasis Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Brachial plexus Multiple sclerosis Claire Littleton Acupuncture Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roe v.
