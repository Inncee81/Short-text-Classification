how do you win a musician's heart hi guys i completely fall for a musician plays in a jazz band we became friends but i have a different background and have no idea about how to get to his heart could you please help me out i will appreciate it very much thanks hi i'm a male jazz musician and i think i could tell you a few things that could win his heart over although we are all different lol i think we have the same approach and feelings towards the love of our music now yes i'm about to explain but i think there are a few simple but important things that you totally need to consider firstly although these ways may work you have to mean them secondly you have to know whether or not he has his heart on someone else if he does that's another question and will make things a little more difficult but i'll assume he doesn't definatley try and go see him play as often as possible ask him when he's playing and he will know you're interested in his music and eventually he will know you're also interested in him in intimate settings like an acoustic session or club try to sit at the front as close as possible to him here you can either be alone sitting and admiring smiling with a fancy drink or you can bring a girl friend who you can talk to if he looks at you perhaps you can look at your friend and smile or say something small that will probably make him see that you have some feeling for him i would prefer either but the first will make him feel as though you have come just for him great give him attention dress up for him and laugh at his jokes not too loud and smile when you're with him people love to think know that they're important and appreciated another way to give him attention is to take interest in what he does playing jazz i'm not sure what instrument he plays piano but perhaps you could do a small amount of research and listening to popular jazz artists try the following or ask him to suggest some to you oscar peterson duke ellington erroll garner bill evans although these are piano players they are essential to listen to songs blue bossa take the a train spain by chick corea in a sentimental mood tell him that you listened to these or other ones you've found and talk about it what's your favourite have your opinion as well as his one good jazz conversation starter which may get him started is about the album 'kind of blue' by miles davis apparently this is the must have jazz album that everyone should have does he agree all of the songs on the album are pretty popular and are also essential listening i love it when people appreciate my music and tell me how it makes them feel tell him that one of the slow songs was really romantic when you are alone tell him that it was really sweet but give honest appreciation be sincere it may also be a good idea to make him talk about a large aspect of his music improvising tell him you like the way the musician can work and play at that moment how he can make music at that time or that it's spontaneous but sounds great if you can make him talk about his feelings and his work again it will make sure that he knows you are interested in him don't do the following not that i think you would but many people believe that one way would be to start chatting and doing the above to another member of the band to make him jelous or pay more attention to you this will definatley hurt his feelings especially if he has already thought of you as a potential love us jazz musicians come in a variety of sensitive forms try to talk to him after the gig perhaps you can get a drink together as well as the relationship being about music you may also talk about and do other general things in life this may relieve him from the music just be yourself be true and do the things you want that's more important these are just suggestions this is all i can think of right now email me if you would like anymore info or any song mp 's you need i'll be happy to send them you can message me on the
