new karaoke tv show weird al yankovic's parody genius ok i'm already tired of the karaoke shows like don't forget the lyrics and that other one see i can't even remember the name they just aren't interesting enough but how about this one hosted by weird al yankovic contestants compete to be each week's parody genius then they go head to head with last week's winner to hold the overall crown at the beginning of the show each contestant picks from the same list of popular songs in multiple genres and then they have to pick from topics that the audience came up with before the show they each have minutes to write a song parody for the topic and that music then they have to perform it live w a band they get a teleprompter with their lyrics edited to show highlights of writing sessions and the performances the audience votes winner gets for each point only the top wins it vs the previous week's champ winner gets k bonus and continues on would you watch it that's a good idea the only thing is the show would have to get all the names of the songs the contestants would use and then get the permission of the singers or groups "Weird Al" Yankovic American Idol ABBA Eurovision Song Contest Whose Line Is It Anyway?
