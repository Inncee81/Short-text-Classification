dueling dragons or hulk in islands of adventure pick one and say why both are great although if i had to pick one ot would be dueling dragons they are actually two rides in one as you can either ride the red dragon or the blue dragon and both rides have differetn drops and loops and twists i love the idea of sitting on the air with my feet dangling i prefer the red dragon it is more intense than the blue one Universal Orlando Resort Waking the Dragons Bubble Bobble Roller coaster Yu-Gi-Oh!
