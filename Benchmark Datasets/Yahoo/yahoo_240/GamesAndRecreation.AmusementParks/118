what are your best memories my best amusement park memory was being on the matahorn with my dad at disneyland i was terrified as we went up and he told me it was no time to be scared and i told him it was as good a time as any as we started down but even as he thought i was being silly i was six he tightened his arms around me to make me feel safer i've ridden it since as an adult and you know he was right of course it's not scary at all compared to some coaster out there now but i'll never forget that ride with him Roller coaster Amusement park Disney's California Adventure Cedar Point Knott's Berry Farm Disneyland Disneyland Resort Paris Dorney Park Magic Kingdom Coney Island Amusement ride Kennywood Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Wooden roller coaster Father's Day (Doctor Who) Efteling Paramount's Kings Island Walt Disney Shaggy dog story Knoebels Valleyfair!
