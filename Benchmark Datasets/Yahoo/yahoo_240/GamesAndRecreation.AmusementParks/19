asking about six flags st louis i was wondering if i am wearing a cast that goes right below my knee can i ride any of the rides and if i rent a wheel chair how much is it and where do you put the wheel chair while you are on the rides i'm not sure about wearing a cast and riding all the rides although i don't see why you couldn't it seems like i've seen kids in the past wearing casts that rode rides but i haven't been there this year so things may have changed all of the rides at flags st louis have a wheelchair handicap accessible entrance where you and your group will get moved to the front of the line pretty nice benefit if you ask me and your group should thank you for not having to wait in the long lines when you get up to each ride there is usually a place to leave your wheelchair i've attached the national link for flags you can select flags st louis to get a contact number i would call guest services to get the details have fun http www sixflags com national index aspx Wheelchair Disneyland Milton H.
