what are some ways i can secure my digital camera during a roller coaster ride i want to record footage of da ride wat are some ideas on how to secure it most operators will ask or insist that you put your camera away they don't care if it breaks they care about it flying out of your hand and hitting another passenger or a person on the ground below my suggestion is do not try to do this it is dangerous for the other people around you if you are holding the camera up to your eye during the ride you also run the risk of injuring yourself just enjoy the ride you'll see more looking around with your eyes than your camera will capture Roller coaster Knoebels Jessica Lynch Camera Closed-circuit television Escalator Kingda Ka Wooden roller coaster Delta Goodrem Bolliger and Mabillard Professional wrestling throws Flying roller coaster Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Quentin Tarantino Surveillance Paramount Canada's Wonderland Aerosmith Baseball Vekoma Shen Gong Wu Digital photography Intamin AG Disney-MGM Studios Kennywood Camcorder Movie projector Ocean's Twelve Magic Kingdom Sport utility vehicle Burning Man Three Stooges Stunt Motion capture Airport security Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Privacy 8 mm video format Paramount's Carowinds John F.
