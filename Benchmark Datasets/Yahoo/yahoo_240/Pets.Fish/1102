nematodes in fishtank i'm assuming they are nematodes from what i've researced on the internet i own a gallon freshwater fishtank with mystery snail guppies sailfin molly noticed little white worm like things swimming around they stick to the glass they're making the tank look horrible i've cut back on how much i feed them but after a week of doing that they are still there do these hurt the fish at all and is there anything i can do our buy to get rid of them actually i have the same problem in my gallon i think what you're looking at are larvae of some sort of fly if they are staying close to the gravel and swim with a squirming snake like motion that's probably the case my fish have been living with them in the tank for a few days now and none of my fish are sick i never see them going after my fish and my fish never have them hanging off of them and when i stir up the gravel they eat them if you want to get rid of them i'm sure any sort of parasitic medication would do the trick but since they are harmless just vacumming them up when you clean your gravel and letting the fish eat them would be fine edit after doing a little research i found that these could well be nematodes after all i now believe that's what i have in my tank too don't worry they are still harmless unless you have fish eggs in the tank and all your fish are livebearers i got a link for you to read up on them http www kokosgoldfish com nematodesandplanaria html Roundworm Marine aquarium Snake Sailfin Molly Live-bearing aquarium fish Aquarium Fish farming Animal Atlantic herring Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Snail Schistosomiasis Animals in space Discus (fish) Spyware Biological pest control Halfbeak Salmon Eel life history HyperText Transfer Protocol Cantonese cuisine The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Computer virus Coconut crab Hematophagy Chicken StarCraft: Uprising Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Krill Lamprey Caenorhabditis elegans Foodborne illness Conker's Bad Fur Day Camp Lazlo Gar Conspiracy (TNG episode) Myxobolus cerebralis Danio Fly fishing Insulin Diphyllobothriasis Aerial (dance move) Aspidogastrea Killifish Goldfish Mosquito Happy Tree Friends The Adventures of Pete & Pete RuneScape economy Cruising (maritime) Ascariasis Digenea Oily fish Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Egg (biology) Diving Sea serpent Tag Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pysanka The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases The Life and Times of Juniper Lee World Wide Web Clownfish Rocky Mountain spotted fever Aquaculture Fauna of Australia Cobia Moon Jelly Brewery Frog Russian joke Goby Characters of Naruto Spidey Super Stories Platypus The Subtle Knife Tlingit Bat Anopheles Infantilism Zebra Danio Little Shop of Horrors Dracunculiasis Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Timon and Pumbaa Tick Leech Advance fee fraud Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Taboo food and drink Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Wildhearts Axolotl
