serious fish injustice what do i do my moronic office manager just days ago set up tiny tanks for his desk one's gallon the other gallon today i arrived at work to find the gallon with two inch long malawi cichlids and a pleco in it and get this the gallon with two and a half inch long oscars and a pleco in it he informed my concerned face that 'he knows what he's doing' 'they'll be okay in there for a year before they get too big' blah blah blah he claims he worked at a pet shop for years i managed a pet shop for but i don't know what i'm talking about so here's the question do i try to help this jackass take care of these poor doomed fish or do i wait 'till he leaves and kidnap them my office is dreary enough without a bunch of floaters to look forward to what would you do unfortunately he isn't doing anything illegal they're his fish and there are no cruelty laws that i know of in regards to how he's keeping them he is free to do what he wants with them and it's legally none of your business so it depends which do you value more the fish or your job if the latter do whatever talk to him steal his fish whatever else you'll get fired before long so do whatever if you value your job leave him be and let him learn his mistake the hard way yes i know this way is harder for the fish but he obviously isn't going to listen to you you gave him your advice continuing in that vein will only piss him off his ego is more important to him than these fish when the fish start getting sick simply raise an eyebrow at him and say nothing the only thing i can think of that might let you help these fish and keep your job is to buy him new tanks me i'd ignore him and his floaters if i worked closely with someone with that sort of ego i'd have to go find different work if it was just an office and i didn't have to deal with his ego daily in the course of my job to where it effected my work i'd just let it go if you have a family that depends on your income their interests in regards to your level of income should be a priority over a few fish and a mgr with an ego Plame affair Discus (fish) Little Britain Poker jargon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Social rule Theory of conduct Marine aquarium The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Fox hunting Donald Rumsfeld Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wal-Mart Drag racing Trade union Shaggy dog story Sin City A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina God Emperor of Dune Economics Phoebe Halliwell Make money fast Kim Possible Free trade YuYu Hakusho Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dilbert Great Teacher Onizuka Fancy Crane The Inside Funny Farm (comic) Samuel Goldwyn Beavis and Butt-head Miss Saigon Jackass: The Movie Ocean's Twelve Trailer Park Boys Pet Sounds Ethics Protoss Cichlid Kodocha MapleStory EastEnders Insurance Creatures in Bionicle Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs Tilapia Time Out of Mind Grand Theft Auto (game) Euphemism Extreme Programming Call centre Economic inequality The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Transactional analysis The Invisibles The Critic W.I.T.C.H.
