blue dolphin cichlids i am looking to start another large tank and recently i saw blu dolphin cichlids they caught my eye i have always had red devils and have now but he lives by himself i want to get a second tank and was thinking about having blue dolphins as my centerpiece i heard they are not very aggressive does anyone have any experiences with theese fish thanx moorii a very nice fish but a little different then the new worlds you may be used to they do best in groups rather than pairs and as adults the aim is to have one or two males with a bunch of females so it's always helpful to start off with extra juvi's to ensure you get a good ratio as slow growers you can't buy small fish and expect large fish a year from now growing these guys out takes long term commitment but on the bright side they can be started off in a smaller tank as long as there are plans for at least a gallon in the future they aren't very aggressive and are actually pretty timid for a cichlid they'll do best kept in species tanks but can be mixed with mild carefully selected malawi haps or non cichlids like synodontis catfish that won't bother them as a centerpiece for a mix n' match malawi tank though going with something tougher would expand your options for tankmates and keeping them singly means missing a lot on what they are about but then that goes for any cichlid in the end a colony of moorii is way nicer then those random mix n match tanks anyway Discus (fish) Lake Malawi Poker jargon Tilapia Cichlid Live-bearing aquarium fish Oscar (fish) Hydrogen economy Sexual selection Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fish farming Color Ecco the Dolphin Norway national football team Freshwater angelfish Aquarium Badminton Zambezi Bottlenose Dolphin Sea-Monkey Miami Dolphins Time Out of Mind Unreal Biodiesel Cetacea Gameplay of StarCraft Whale Cetacean intelligence Internal ballistics E85 BZFlag Fast bowling Albatross Illegal drug trade Avenue Q Chicken Catfish Whaling Intelligent design Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gar Pittsburgh Steelers CPU cache Orca Jack Dempsey (fish) Team Fortress Classic Snooker Fish Stereoscopy Extreme Programming Zerg W.
