can fish mix breed with each other like dogs for example like for example can a red zebra cichlid breed with an electric yellow cichlid it might be impossible for a say cichlid to breed with a gourami but what about the same kinds but different groups thanks all it depends on the species and how far apart they are if you want to know if two different types of fish can cross breed your best bet is to look up the latin names of the fish if the first part of their latin name is the same then they can cross breed if they are different then probably not for example guppies and mollies which are both freshwater livebearers can cross breed although the fry are not always viable this is because they are both members of the poecilia family guppies poecilia reticulata mollies poecilia latipinna but neither guppies or mollies can cross breed with platys or swordtails even though those are also freshwater livebearers however platys and swordtails can cross breed with each other platys xiphophorus maculatus swordtail xiphophorus helleri below is a site that lists a lot of the latin names of fish along with their common names and will help you see what fish can cross breed with other fish Live-bearing aquarium fish Green swordtail Guppy Southern platyfish Sailfin Molly Poeciliidae Cichlid Xiphophorus Discus (fish) Hybrid Tilapia Freshwater angelfish Oscar (fish) Gourami Halfbeak Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Salmon Mixed-breed dog Jack Dempsey (fish) Dwarf gourami Perciformes Dog breed Zebra Danio Brackish water Fish farming Shrimp farm Kissing gourami Killifish Piranha Fish Lake Burley Griffin F1 hybrid Yellow Seabird Aquarium Cod Rift Valley lakes Mosquitofish Lake Tanganyika Livestock Lake Malawi Golden Retriever Goby Species German cuisine Perch Louis Agassiz Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Zambezi Monster Rancher monsters Great Cormorant Working animal Marine angelfish Fish migration Fly fishing Animals in space Batoidea Gar Galaxiid Domestication Jack Russell Terrier Common Tern Gray Wolf Parthenogenesis Roseate Tern Tung Chung Cattle Chocobo Sandwich Tern Border Collie Fishery Double-crested Cormorant Fish and chips Roman eating and drinking Nile perch Chicken Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Murray Cod Sexual selection Fisheries in Hong Kong Australian Shepherd Shark Plant breeding Sex-determination system Peruvian cuisine Fishing Platypus Horse Dobermann Lion Mussel Bird migration Pocket cruiser Australian Kelpie Goldfish Marine aquarium Macquarie Perch German Shepherd Dog Breakfast Dr. Seuss
