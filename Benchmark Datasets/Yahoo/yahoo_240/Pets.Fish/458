how did my betta run away i remember reading that betta can commute from one body of water to another but can't imagine it being anything but an emergency measure the weather outside yesterday was up to but his cubic foot bowl is in the shade we try to entertain him all the time but he quickly bores of that if there is not food included we gave him pellets in the morning and in the evening i have looked in every nook and cranny in rooms of the house and i can't find my friend anywhere i drained the tank and rinsed out all his shells the only thing i can think is some kid came in looking for trouble and decided the fish was it but my wife is sure nobody got in while she was working her apple tree i'm sure no cats got in he most likely jumped out of his tank bettas are terrific jumpers and yes in the wild they are able to jump from one rice paddy field to another do you have a lid on your tank if not that's probably the reason it's not your fault for mistreating him or anything bettas will almost always jump it's a natural instinct and if there's nothing over their tanks they will probably end up on the floor you probably should remember to keep a lid on next time sorry Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Show jumping Rice Dog agility Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Domestic rabbit Fire fighting Japanese toilet Tea Sea-Monkey Goldfish Car washing techniques Animal Crossing E85 Garfield The Catcher in the Rye Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 John Cage Fish farming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Hamster John F.
