how can i make my tetras less timid i have three black phantom tetras in a gallon tank but everytime i approach the tank they all hide in a corner behind a ceramic ornament i've had one of the tetras for three years and the others for they will come out if i feed them but they eat better if i walk away from the tank and watch them at a distance is there anyway i can gradually make the less timid yup to above most species are schoolers but you've already had them for a few years so i don't think thats the issue i think the issue is the noise and this huge object they see huge compared to them and they aren't secure enough to just come out for all they know that's a predator comming after them i wouldn't stress it much as fish are not like a dog and cat where you can directly train them to do things as long as they are growing not fighting or sick they happy just sneak back away walk slow so they don't feel the vibrations as much and smile if you need further help and advanced answers check out fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv Tank Neon tetra Discus (fish) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Sin City Gray Wolf The Catcher in the Rye Kender Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Princess Zelda Kodocha Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Biological pest control Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sealab 2021 Cat Dog Chicken Goldfish Ron Weasley Characters in the Smurfs Brown Bear Battle of the Bulge Eastern Front (World War II) Spider The Death Gate Cycle Species Ecology Marine aquarium Link (Legend of Zelda) Hydrogen economy Friends German grammar Hunting Aquarium Traumatic incident reduction Equine conformation Kakapo Blonde on Blonde IBM PC compatible The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures Erwin Rommel Tetra Pak Shrimp farm Humphrey Bogart Diesel engine Taikyoku shogi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe English grammar RuneScape quests Tank classification Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys American Alligator Characters of Naruto Livestock Fish farming Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bottlenose Dolphin The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Drama Transformer Ceramics Zerg Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hamster Utility cycling The Beach Boys Orca Theory of conduct Religion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Internet fraud Mercury 4 AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra 2000 Australian Grand Prix Immortality Baroque chess F-16 Fighting Falcon The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Stomach cancer Combine (Half-Life 2) Sea-Monkey Time Out of Mind USS Yorktown (CV-5) Jet engine Dai dai shogi Futurama (TV series - season 2) African American Vernacular English YuYu Hakusho Socialization Characiformes The Strangerhood White Cloud Mountain Minnow Jackass: The Movie Dualism (philosophy of mind) Out-of-body experience
