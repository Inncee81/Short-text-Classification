emaciated fish tiger barb gets thinner and thinner my roommate has a gallon aquarium set up at home as do i she has had some tiger barbs for about months to a year a few of them have died of common things like ick and fin rot but the last two have been alive for quite some time recently we noticed one of the barbs i believe a male was getting rather thin he ate properly and was quite active as the weeks went by he got thinner and thinner up to the point where his head and gill area were wider and higher than the 'meat' of his body he was essentially wasting away to nothing he died the other day sadly we were rooting for him my two questions what do you think happened i'm guessing internal parasite are the other fish safe tiger barbs are schooling fish and need to be in schools of or more if a few die and you wind up with less than the strongest one will pester the others and fight them til they die your other barb was probably constantly battling him of course there is always a chance he could have died from a disease or parasites i doubt you will ever know better luck in the future Shark Fugu Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fishing Sushi Tlingit Aquarium Marine aquarium Danio Equine conformation Salmon Tilapia Elephant Fish Pikmin Fish farming Stingray Anorexia nervosa Goldfish Whaling Foodborne illness Sin City Physical attractiveness Tank Clownfish Meat Game show Agricultural fencing Knife Dead Like Me Vegetarianism Myxobolus cerebralis Angling Atlantic herring Malaria Gar Gill Angler Japanese tea ceremony Oceanic Whitetip Shark Garfield Kashrut Avalanche Dog Calvin and Hobbes Orca Wheel of Fortune Biology Taboo food and drink Unclean animals The Doctor Dances Abortion debate Barbed wire Fangtooth River Out Of Eden Luck Toxoplasmosis Spanish verbs Fish anatomy Future energy development RuneScape skills The Unquiet Dead Tiger Woods Xenomorph Textile manufacturing Shrimp farm Hiberno-English Battle of the Bulge Cantonese cuisine Discus (fish) Sperm Whale Circulatory system Burke and Wills expedition Creatures in Bionicle Honey fungus Dairy Bowl Championship Series Hamburger Ecology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Seahorse Snake AIDS Battle of Kursk Scorpion Mussel Finding Nemo Tasmanian Devil Tooth Pufferfish Buddhism Zero (Mega Man) Hair Amiga Power Bat Species Naruto jutsu Veganism Insulin Pitaten
