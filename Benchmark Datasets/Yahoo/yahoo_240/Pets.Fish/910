why does my betta flare at me when i look at him when i go near my betta's tank he flares at me not just with his fins but he also puffs up behind his gills which looks really scary does this mean he doesn't like me i'd love him to be tame and let me hand feed him even pat him as i've heard some betta's do that is perfectly normal depending on how long you've had him he may stop eventually right now he sees you as a threat to his territory if you take some frozen bloodworms and let them sit on your fingers he will probably swim up to you and eat the bloodworms off of your hand it is not good to pet fish even if you are careful you risk removing their slime coats and leaving them susceptible to infections nosoop u for more info on bettas and fish in general check out the site in my profile edit bettas don't learn peoples' faces they learn that people mean they get fed by putting your face right up to his tank you will likely scare him because you are so much larger than him thus you appear threatening also don't make loud noises around the tank that will confuse him and he may learn to associate humans with loud noises closing a door is fine just don't slam it things like that edit bettas don't care what color you are wearing just like it has been proven that bulls don't get angry when they see red they are actually colorblind they just don't like the waving motion Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cat Dwarf gourami Prank flash Shark Shaggy dog story Blood (computer game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hearing impairment Salad Fingers Chicken Combine (Half-Life 2) Prostate cancer Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) YuYu Hakusho Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dog training Domestic rabbit Tag The Time Machine Discus (fish) Customs and etiquette of Japan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Covenant Kim Possible Trademark Stereoscopy Friends Creatures in Bionicle Swimming Characters in the Smurfs Grandview, U.S.A.
