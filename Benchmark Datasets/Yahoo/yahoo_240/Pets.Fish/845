cant seem to lower ammonia levels s i have one of the in tank monitors for ammonia level in my new uncycled gallon i had figured that if the ammonia got too high i could just do a partial water change to maintain good levles when the ammonia got just slightly high we did a like water change with a siphon the next day the ammonia had only gotten higher after it still hadnt evened out after like two days we did another water change still we saw no difference in the ammonia level even if our filter wasnt working it should have lowered the levels a bit simply by diluting the concentration of ammonia in the water we are using the live nh ammonia monitor in tank by mardel we had thought that maybe it just doesnt reset after the ammonia levels elevate and have put the test in clean water in a glass to see if it resets does anyone have any experience with this after a few water changes within maybe a week we are still seeing the test read only higher and higher levels help btw there is only one fish in it atm and it is a tiny ryukin it may also be important to note that judging by our test the water should be full of ammonia but he is swimming happlily his breathing is normal he is eating eagerly and stays near the middle of the tank where he should be the only strange behavior we have noticed is his habit of swimming upstream in the current created by the filter dumping the water back in the tank but even this is brief and then he goes back to exploring his gravel and plants it seems like he could even just be playing so judging by his patterns it seems like the water is perfectly fine since the test says its nearly toxic i have no clue what to think s ok as usual i am going to have to add an incredible amount of details first off stop with the you shouldnt have the fish in a gallon trip plz because he was a rescue and it was an uncycled gal or a gallon bowl while the tank cycled believe me his prior circumstances were worse i know the gal per '' of fish rule he is a baby and under '' when he exceeds '' he will get a larger tank right now i am testing the test to see if it lowers i would really like to know if anyone has used this test before and had good results not only with it increasing in ammonia level but also reading a decrease it has been sitting in treated tap water in a cup for about mins with no change in the reading this causes me some suspicion but we are just waiting still i should also have elaborated more on the fact that i am not seeing a change in ammonia even immediately after a water change the level has constantly increased despite all the water changes never dropped any advice also my primary question isnt an expression of concern over the existing levels its confusion as to why the levels have never dropped even after a water change i am wondering if the meter is flaky hopefully someone can tell me wether it is normal to see no change in the ammonia level a constant increase even after a signifigant water change seems fishy to me ditto to ghost i'm really liking this lady she's giving on target analysis on water chemistry i've seen in other answers and it's refreshing to see written out explanations kudos to you gf i can say that what she is saying about that live monitor is right on basically that live monitor is nothing more then a fancy test strip that wears out and needs replacement over time the best thing you can do for yourself to get a reliable accurate reading is get a liquid testing kit and while your tank is cycling out take readings from that ok so we'll not go into your population tank issues enough said i can read and comprehend lol i think the ammonia is lowering actually and you are just getting false readings from that live reader fish behavior will be another indicator if the ammonia was excessivly high you'd most likely see the fish near the top of the water breathing rapidly as this is the onset of ammonia poisoning if you are not seeing that in conjunction with your live reader i'm inclined to say your reading is false i'd reccomend getting the liquid drop testers and reduce your feedings to once a day only as much as the fish can eat entirely in minutes that will suffice and your goldfish is not going to die from starvation i promise you fish do not use food in the same manners you and i do being a cold blooded animal they do not have to internally heat themselves nor use the food as a source of energy to fight off disease excess food in the water is a strong source of ammonia and excess feedings directly means excess waste which ultimately means more ammonia as well stay on top of the water changes and do not give up on it just for the hell of it too run a check on your tap water source ones you get the testing kit and see if it's reading ammonia in there because like you said it should be lowering just rule that possibility out if you need further help feel free to email me direct via my profile jv Sewage treatment Ammonia E85 Fish
