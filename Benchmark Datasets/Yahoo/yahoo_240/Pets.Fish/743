baby mollies i recently moved my fry from a hatchery to a gallon empty tank to grow i haven't done this in a while and they are one month old right now how old are the babies when you can determine their gender how old are they when you see the beginnings of a lyretail how do you feed fry in a gallon tank what type of food makes them grow bigger if they all live what do i do with baby mollies at the most i can only keep they should be sexually mature by about months males who are not sexually mature will look like females so even if you can see the anal fins at a young age it might not be what it looks like it is not sure i'd do a small pinch kind of grounded up between your fingers of tropical fish flakes they sell fry food that claims to make the baby grow fast but it's just a gimmick to make money of all the ones i've used i haven't noticed any difference i think anything that claims it'll make them bigger is another gimmick i think its how often you feed them that is going to make them grow bigger and faster i'd feed them a tiny bit times a day well see if you can find friends who want them or advertise them as free on your local craigslist because that's honestly the only way you are going to get rid of them unless you don't mind them being fed to bigger fish fish stores are not going to want to buy them since they breed so easily if a fish store does accept them as in they might take them from you for free they'll prob just feed them to some bigger fish Shark Clownfish Shrimp farm Discus (fish) Breastfeeding Goldfish Gender role Salmon Milk Fish and chips Hamburger Seabird Sailfin Molly Tilapia Pizza Gender Hamster Infantilism Anal sex Blue Whale Platypus Fugu Halfbeak Fish anatomy Fast-food restaurant Dairy Pet skunk Cable television Dwarf gourami Krill Marine aquarium Toilet Atlantic herring Ostrich Orca Aquarium McDonald's Animal Crossing Alcohol fuel Myxobolus cerebralis Condom Bird migration The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bird Zebra Danio Leatherback Sea Turtle Bat Ant Breakfast Australian bass RuneScape skills Tetrapod Best Buy Theory of conduct MMORPG Effeminacy French fries Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sex assignment Kitten Orgasm Albatross Burger King Cuisine of Denmark Food and Drug Administration Cuisine of Malaysia Life insurance Paintball Britney Spears Walleye Mountain Gorilla Organic farming Mutual fund Vegetarianism Kissing gourami Advertising Sex Married... with Children Urinary incontinence Jon Secada Stock car (rail) RuneScape quests Nerpa Muskellunge Rum Eid ul-Fitr P-47 Thunderbolt Domestic rabbit Biodiesel History of intersex surgery Zerg American lobster Humpback Whale Phoebe Buffay's songs
