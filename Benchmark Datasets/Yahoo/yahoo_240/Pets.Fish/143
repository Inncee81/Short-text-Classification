is it uncommon for a tankfull of bettas to co exist peacefully i am wondering if i have made a mistake or not or altered their true nature i have a gallon tank with bettas females males and they all get along very well even at feeding time but there is a hierarchy i don't know much about fish i just enjoy how colorful this type is and how easy they are to keep i just maintain their water treat it and change their filter every weeks they have been with me for almost months now and no squabbles except play are they supposed to be violent fish this does happen from time to time however the peace will not last eventually one will decide to take out the competition and your going to have a war on usually these peaceful fish will be very young when they are all mature things will turn violent i would remove all the males to prevent a tragedy thats already brewing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Brewery Marine aquarium Clownfish Discus (fish) Aquarium Fish farming Sewage treatment Dwarf gourami Hydrogen economy Hamster Space Shuttle program Brewing Social rule Theory of conduct Reef tank Polish September Campaign Sake Honey God Emperor of Dune Donald Rumsfeld Spider Eastern Front (World War II) Water purification Seabird E85 Cheating in Counter-Strike Horse Carburetor Swimming pool Yom Kippur War Sea-Monkey XML Yohoho!
