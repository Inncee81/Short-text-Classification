partial water change how do you do it how exactly do you do a partial water change do you use warm tap water or cold tap water do you leave it to stand overnight how do you maintain the same temp as in the tank does the ph flutuate when you add the water into the tank additional notes warm boiling water is said to destroy the oxygen molecules in water leaving the water to stand overnight will be cold the next day to do a partial water change you should use a syphon gravel vac these can be bought at pet shops or you can even buy them online do you test your tank for ph and nitrites or ammmonia if so and your ph is to your fishies liking already then you shouldn't need any ph up or down formula's all you should need to do is take out of your water volume using the gravel vac tap water is normally ok i use it here in tassie and our water is pretty bad for chlorine atm i use a good quality tap conditioner in the water i have never stood water overnight before and i keep alot of different types of fishy friends and they are fine as long as you know what the quality of your water is for this information you should be able to go to your local council website or make a phone call ask around does your water have a metallic smell or taste if so chances are your water is treated with too much chlorine to just stand over night anyway i use twice the recommended dose for water conditioner as our water is heavily treated with chlorine and my tanks are healthy never just pour or squirt it in everything you put in your tank should be measured properly if your nitrite and ammonia are very high you may need to do a water change of every couple of days but if everything is good then you should do this once to maybe twice a week especially if you have alot of fish in the tank how messy they are etc hope that helps oh and do not boil the water you remove all the trace elements out of it don't use bottled water either same reason tyr to judge the temp of the water you take out and get it the same near enough as you can before you put it in add tap conditioner first before putting water back into the tank temp change of a couple of degrees doesn't really do anything to freshwater tropical fish Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Ammonia Water Water purification Brewery Sea-Monkey Water (molecule) Acetic acid Cyanide Temperature Aquarium Solar power E85 Motor oil Bottled water Carbon dioxide Coffee Asthma Ocean thermal energy conversion Ozone depletion Autonomous building Tofu Hydrogen peroxide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hydrogen economy Boiling point Ozone Theory of conduct Alternative biochemistry Drowning Ozone hole Swimming pool Haloalkane Diving Chlorine Idli Sake Fish farming Siphon Eutrophication Thermal power station Sodium hypochlorite Lake Fountain Beer Carburetor Alkane Tea Fish Alcohol Biogeochemical cycle Plastic Air conditioning Swimming Hard water Fire fighting Omega-3 fatty acid Password Helium Cruising (maritime) Mattress Rebreather Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Food preservation Thermoregulation Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Customs and etiquette of Japan Sauna Wood pulp Diving suit Titanium Diabetes mellitus Hydrochloric acid Prostate cancer Diving cylinder Nuclear power Discus (fish) Polychlorinated biphenyl Plutonium Frog Bong Hydrogen Insulin Explosive material Escherichia coli O157:H7 Pet skunk Dishwasher Tattoo Jewish cuisine Fluoride Methanol
