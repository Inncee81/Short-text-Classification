why are my fish dying okay i just cleaned my fish tank put all my fish in another contaner while i cleaned it and then pored them back in the tank i left the room for like hours and of the fish are dead and the others ones are acting like there going to die this has never happened before whats going on btw there goldfish did you put declorinator in did you correct for temperature meaning if the water the fish were in was warmer colder than the clean water in the tank they can go into shock and die you have to put them in ziplock bags and float them in the water like you did when you first got them did you do a complete water change did you wash the rocks with detergent both of these kill beneficial bacteria that keep fish alive also detergent and cleaners are toxic to fish and most of them are difficult to rinse off completely did you use a stress coat type medicine it's not exactly necessary but it helps how long were the fish in the container if it was over crowded and they were in there a while the oxygen level drops and the fish can get fatally sick pouring them in can injure the fish internally if it's been awhile since you cleaned the tank the clean water can put them into shock the chemicals have built up in the dirty water but the fish were used to it when you put them in clean water it changed the chemicals too fast and they went into shock and died this is the basic idea it's more complicated than this do research on how to clean a tank get a gravel vaccum it's the best invention ever fun and easy way to clean the tank and it preserves the environment for the fish Aquarium Marine aquarium Dry cleaning Dishwasher Textile manufacturing First aid Water Goldfish Fugu Energy development Swimming pool Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen peroxide Menstrual cup Foodborne illness Fish farming Detergent Hard water Motor oil Dam Acne Hydrogen economy Solar power Laundry detergent Ice core Hydroponics Rebreather Fishing Agar plate Soap Glass Eutrophication Chemical warfare Brewery Vacuum cleaner Water pollution Tilapia Sento Japanese tea ceremony Insulin Sea-Monkey STS-50 Thermal power station Shark Corrosion Apollo Command/Service Module Food preservation Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Motorcycle Sodium chloride Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Sterilization (microbiology) Cryonics Scuba set Mercury (element) Great Lakes Vinegar Myxobolus cerebralis Shampoo Anchor Fire extinguisher Urticaria Autonomous building Disinfection Embalming Allergy Grand Calumet River Nuclear power Halitosis E85 Dead Sea Cannabis cultivation Apollo 13 Sulfur Aluminium Japanese toilet Dairy Vacuum Pneumonia Ricin Chronic fatigue syndrome Space disaster Poison Car washing techniques Explosive material Haloalkane Ozone Wound
