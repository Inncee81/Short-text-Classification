my fish are sick everytime i give em stupid tetra daphnia jelly some sort of disease breaks out they are tropical this time i am using api pimafix to treat cottony fungus but i have spotted white spot and fin rot too so would like to also use api melafix one fishie has only one little arm fin left and another fishie is on its side with fungus can i use both together first you need to identify all the problems and put them in order of importance to treat fungus comes last since it's rarely deadly quickly white spot or ich is a very fast killing parasite while fin rot is a slower killer really between the two considering you have three problems and in three different classifications you will need to be quite careful how you treat first melafix and pimafix are out both are very mild medications that will not get the job done quickly enough in this case your fish are far too weakened by everything going on to rely in these chemicals i would suggest you start with jungle labs fungus eliminator or fungus clear both contain medications that will clear up a fungus or in the case it's a bacterial infection instead of fungus they will treat that as well if that's not available you can use maroxy you can combine this with maracide for the ich white spot and maracyn tc for the fin rot it's a lot of medications but you have a lot of problems going on all at the same time i would also suggest you start off all of this with a large water change at least and an additional water change every day replacing the removed medication only replace the medication for the amount of water you remove not the entire tank again please feel free to email me if i can help further mm Pneumonia Malaria Diseases of the honeybee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Honey fungus Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Spanish flu Diarrhea Sexually-transmitted infection Theory of conduct Gypsy moth Carnivorous plant Foodborne illness Fungus Lyme disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cantonese cuisine Malachite green Sewage treatment Fancy rat Anti-aircraft warfare First aid Shrimp farm Water purification Asthma Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Ebola Cancer Anthrax Wood Conjunctivitis Drowning AIDS Tsetse fly Pharmaceutical company Biological pest control Acne Stomach cancer Biological warfare Hemp Sterilization (microbiology) Rabies DDT Ich Sleeping sickness Nail disease Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hip fracture Hypoglycemia MS-06 Zaku II Crohn's disease Medical analysis of circumcision Decompression sickness Wheat Disease Mushroom Dandruff Multiple sclerosis Candidiasis Agar plate Discus (fish) Psoriasis Progress of the SARS outbreak Smallpox Athlete's foot Orca Shark Lung cancer Fugu Meningitis Infectious disease Guinea pig Cyanide Mach kernel Neopets Antibiotic Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cirrhosis Fire fighting Diabetes mellitus Food preservation Compiler optimization RISC Oak Pesticide Paget's disease of bone Gmail Myxobolus cerebralis Fish farming
