convict fry what can i do with my convict fry i have tanks i dont have any tanks where they would be safe this small i intend leaving them with the parents until they spawn again but soon ill b left with the choice to safe them or let them be eaten should i maybe take out the cave where the parents spawned in to stop or delay them spawning again the parents will probably spawn anytime after the fry are weeks old maybe slightly longer i read a site where it took month see link below moving the cave might buy you some time but they will probably just find somewhere else to spawn you might also stress them out if they are using this cave to hide the fry in convicts will spawn alot most likely every weeks unless you can fine a lfs that will take them off you its unlikely you will save every batch of fry you have you could buy a tank divide and separate them when they start to eat them but you will still have to find somewhere for them to go or else you will soon be over run with them i would leave them to get eaten and maybe save or and put them in a breeding net if the tank large enough that way you would have your own pair of convicts that you raised from birth good luck this link is to someones diary its about him raising his convict fry http www geocities com the dog geo convict aug html Discus (fish) Salmon Philip J.
