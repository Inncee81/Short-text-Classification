strings growing out of anarcharis elodea egeria i don't know what the difference is between these names but i have one of them lol anyway about days ago i noticed that all of my anarcharis plant started developing these strings about inches long coming out of them what is that either it's very good or very bad i've had the elodea for more than weeks why does it all of a sudden start producing roots i'm so curious it starts producing roots after you bought it because previously it had been quickly grown in its warehouse environment and whatever roots it may have grown were ripped out when it was packaged for sale and then shipped around a lot and probably only lived a short time in the fish store so it's never had a chance to settle into a permanent environment and so now it's feeling at home and had a chance to set in or grow roots which btw is where we human beings get the same saying that infers we have finally found a home so that it's growing roots is a good thing Elodea Shaggy dog story Opportunity rover Social rule The Cure Ecco the Dolphin Equine conformation K' Billboard Hot 100 Sorghum Stone Age Objective-C Hair Kender Microeconomics Animal Houseplant Hydrilla The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Simone Weil The Amber Spyglass Organic food Deforestation Sewage treatment Customer relationship management Hard disk Hash table Wonderland (McFly album) Surplus product Topps Randomness Breastfeeding The Roots Species Textile manufacturing Norway national football team Community Supply and demand Plant Linked list Tenshinhan Atari 2600 Tina Turner Auxin 1957 World Series Password Discus (fish) Doomsday argument Hamster Video game controversy Humanist Movement Guinea pig 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Sam Walton Biology Street-Legal Star Trek Customizable Card Game Ecology Gross domestic product Java programming language Christmas Shifting cultivation Human Britney Spears The Emancipation of Mimi Time Out of Mind Good Times Computer Dairy American lobster Inventory Wheel of Fortune Sydney Riot of 1879 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee $ale of the Century The Martian Chronicles Neolithic Revolution Napier's bones TLC Halting problem Law of value Best Buy Ojibwe language Root Emacs Statistics Biodiversity History of Victoria Origin of language Joy Division (band) Internet fraud PHP Lisp programming language Paul W.
