freshwater aquarium help please i am buying a gallon aquarium for my room and i need help i have a siamese fighting fish and i am planning on buying blind cave fish a medium pleco a corydora or two a couple of dwarf gouramis and blue gouramis a coolie loach and an angelfish small what is your advice should i cool it with the angelfish or is this a good thing to work with for the most part the grouping of these fish is not a good choice for a gallon set up there are a few problem's you'd run into you could run an aquaclear to provide the necessary filtration but then you're going to run into the compatibility issues problem most common plecos will grow to around inches there are some that stay smaller but the primary logic in people buying one is for algea control and this is not necessary plecos are an armored catfish and bottom feeder they only eat algea if there is no other food source present problem the gourami and betta are both labryinth breathers and i'm sure it's just a matter of time before they get into it in a ten gallon tank problem an angelfish is a cichild therefore very territorial and will be aggression on your other fish and stress them i feel the real issue here though is space a ten gallon tank doesn't provide enough space for this grouping to be comfortable with each other you're coolie loach slipped my mind is probably going to grow to be at least six inches too and will become cramped in a gallon tank if you were to change this tank over to a long then you have better possibilities at least to get the gourami in and probably the coolie the angel i still don't think is going to work and that pleco isn't needed but if you insist on having one he'll need to be in a gallon tank when approaching adult size i know this might not be in your budget but the grouping isn't going to work out to be honest the cories would be ok if you have other questions you can get extensive help at fishless cycling com just use the link on my profile jv Dwarf gourami Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Aquarium Kissing gourami Clown loach Gourami Marine aquarium Tilapia Freshwater angelfish Autonomous building Reef tank Fish farming Floppy disk Loach Hard disk Poker jargon Perciformes Toyota Prius Goldfish Clownfish Hydrogen economy E85 Equine conformation Sea-Monkey Extreme Programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Intelligent design Suckermouth Catfish Cichlid Biodiesel Alcohol fuel Halfbeak Elephant Philosophy of language Thermal power station History of Singapore Hamster Crayfish RISC YuYu Hakusho Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gar Weekly World News Donald Rumsfeld Strap-on dildo Panama Canal B-47 Stratojet CPU cache P-47 Thunderbolt FLCL Shrimp farm Axolotl Fishing RuneScape economy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cruising (maritime) Sex and the City Battle of the Bulge Theory of conduct Microeconomics Coming of Age (TNG episode) Marine angelfish Transformer Sewage treatment Central processing unit Whaling Ethics History of the tank Scientology beliefs and practices Rei Ayanami RuneScape quests Ecology The nature of God in Western theology Logic Milton H.
