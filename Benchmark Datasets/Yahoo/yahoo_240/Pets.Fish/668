i have a striped raphael catfish and it doesn't seem to grow much do you know if they grow lots or does he need more food or what i have one in my son's tank and one from years ago in my old tank which is now my fathers they don't grow that fast really the one that is years old only grew maybe in in all that time he's in a breeder spends the majority of his time in an old ceramic log that we've had since my very first tank so to answer your question no they grow very slowly and i believe max length is inches and no you don't need to feed him more food but if you want faster growth try some high protein food like brine shrimp frozen not freeze dried Shrimp farm Sea-Monkey Tilapia Fish farming Maize Clownfish Brewery Food preservation Desert Carbon dioxide Ceramics Hamster Catfish Salmon Peanut Cantonese cuisine Krill Fishing Axolotl Chicken Livestock Wheat STS-50 Autonomous building Hemp Marine aquarium Tofu Dwarf gourami Food Dodge Charger Puberty Irrigation Logging Wood Bird migration Peat Dog Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cuisine of Malaysia Soybean Sea ice Ferret Economy of Pakistan Zebra Danio Growth hormone treatment Discus (fish) Capercaillie Urban sprawl Sewage treatment Insect ConAgra Foods, Inc.
