horrendous algae and fish dying i got suckermouth catfish to help me with the horrendous algae issues that i have with my tank tetras guppies and snail i also do a water change every week without fail this morning i noticed that the catfish were all dead i cannot seem to understand what is going on can algae be poisonous i have no live plants in the tank i want to do a complete clean up of my tank is it ok to keep the fish in a bowl for a day while the tank goes through a cycle don't do a complete water change it takes more than a day to cycle a tank again do a water change scrub all the algae off the walls and then carefully fill the tank back up with dechlorinated water through this entire process leave the fish in the tank instead of doing water changes use a siphon to vacuum the gravel gavel vacuuming will remove excess food and waste for some more algae assistance check out fishless cycling com or email me nosoop u to prevent algae vacuum the gravel weekly keep the tank out of direct sunlight and don't leave the tank light on for more than hours a day edit plecos and other suckermouth fish do eat algae they just tend to do a poor job these fish will not replace proper maintenance so you still need to keep the tank clean Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Eutrophication Fugu Fish farming Sea-Monkey Carburetor Photosynthesis Fossil fuel power plant Fishing Flush toilet Siphon Thermal power station Energy development Aquarium Algae Water purification Ecology Discus (fish) Shrimp farm Japanese tea ceremony Hydroponics Tilapia Irrigation Coral reef Kosher foods Dairy Animal Rail terminology Suckermouth Catfish Hamster Dry cleaning Vacuum tube Nuclear power Plant Carbon dioxide Reef tank Dishwasher Slow sand filter bed Carnivorous plant Diatom Upholstery Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Casting Bhopal disaster Frog Cyanide Biogeochemical cycle Axolotl Chlorophyta Polychlorinated biphenyl Coffee Entropy Hydrogen economy Kissing gourami Foodborne illness Nutrition Antarctic krill Water Halfbeak Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Wine making Kashrut Chinook salmon Cannabis cultivation Dieting Aquaculture Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Nutrient Goldfish Cruising (maritime) Hydrogen sulfide Light pollution Sugar beet M60 machine gun Sunlight Tofu Plankton Dam Vacuum Pebble bed reactor Menstrual cup Water pollution The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Future energy development Brewery Space Shuttle program Fancy rat Cell (biology) Bedbug Algal bloom Incandescent light bulb Environmental concerns with electricity generation
