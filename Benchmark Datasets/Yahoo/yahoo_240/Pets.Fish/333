why dont ppl read the question i have been using this site for like three days and already i am fed up with how many useless responses and answers that are clearly contraindictated by the qestion itself for example i ask how to help cycle my tank and inform readers that the fish is already in it and has been without problems for two days now what answer do i get you should get feeder fish to put in the tank if they do fine you know its ok to put your fish in well obviously if this person had been paying a sliver of attention that is of no help great idea for someone whose fish isnt in the tank duh i say that i have a budget of five dollars for a new fish item i recieve a recommendation for purchasing a kit i dont know why these ppl bother writing such a lengthy response without taking the time to absorb the question but it is a waste of space time and reading i suppose this is just a request for all of those out there who are at fault please dont respond unless you are prepared to give a helpful answer i am sick to death of going through all five daily questions asking the same thing rephrased hoping to get an intelligent response also when seven ppl answer a question that wasnt asked chances are good that anyone who truly knows what they are talking about is going to see a long list of responses and decide that their answer isnt needed for once i wish i could just post something and answerers would pay close attention to detail and give a well thought out and educated response based on the information given just hoping maybe a few ppl will read this and decide to spare some poor asker all the frustration thank you everyone who took the time to encourage it helps to know that i am not the only one annoyed by some ppl on here and thank you also for all the offers to help with questions through email cetus thanks you as well well i think that getting a bad answer or something that is not clear is not a good thing for the most part most of us that answer regularly or have education and experience in these things give good answers on here i have to say there are quite a few people that give vague crap ass answers and i apologize for them even wasting your's and my time looking back at your q's first question about the cycle fivespeed gave you the correct answer on that yes there is a difference because a bowl doesn't usually have a filter and gravel in there it doesn't provide oxygenation and the proper surface area to really cycle it out a bowl really shouldn't be used to house any fish really because of space issues and filtration do you see pet stores sell and display fish in them yes but it's temporary really and shouldn't be used at home for long term housing question about the ryukin again fivespeed gave you the ba there i really can't add anything else to that to help explain any different the inchers you see at walmart are grown out in ponds and they reach this size rather quickly at that size they are usually about months old question kii do petsmart employees know what theyre talking about fish question i am planning on going to petsmart and asking some questions about my ruykin i wouldnt ask walmart but is petsmart any better in everyones experience are they generally well educated in their department additional details hours ago we have no small pet stores nearby and i have been asking on answers but on questions such as age of a certain size ruykin nobody seems to know i could easily ask them what the age of the fish they purchase is tho magicman gave you the best input however fivespeed already told you the age about your ryukin kii the real problem here is that when you ask what is the age of a fish it's not like a child where you can log in the birthdate or something in most fish fish will grow differently and unless you raised the fish it's whole life yourself it's just going to be a guesstimate even if you went to petco or walmart the danger with going to walmart is the opportunity of you being targeted for sales of things you don't necessarily need and i am sure they will try to sell you something the only thing looking at this information you should be directed to buy would be a filtered tank if all you have is a ryukin then you don't need to worry about a heater so much but you really need to get a filtered tank for it sorry but that's the facts of the case i can't tell you something different and not be distorting the truth as you can see on the last question magicman again gave you the best answer there now yeah like i said in the beginning i nor magic or fivespeed can control people posting crap that isnt true i can only just say sorry there are morons in the world but i don't have the power to keep them off here or deny them the rights to demonstrate thier superior stupidty i will say that there sure are some answerers in here that need to be muted or booted out of here for expressing information that is false and inaccurate yet they will continually post it it's as if thier online ego gets a kick out of misleading people instead of using the brain god gave them i can say in closing when you do get stupid answers just put it where you put all your used toilet paper thats what i do because i feel the advice i see and the toilet paper are the same thing and take action accordingly you can email me anytime you need if you have questions and you
