a question on zebra dianos i have zebra dianos and got them because they were only cents at the store i got fish books and looked up some information but it really didn't say anything one of them is very skinny but he or she eats the other one was bigger in the belly area when i first got them now it gets bigger and bigger the other one eats i have seen it but she he is always following the other one around i did get a little info from the books they said that males are skinny and females are more rounded is this a way of them mating or is something wrong with my fish when i thought that my white molly was pregnant i added marbles in the spot where she always was it just so happens that my zebra dianos hang out in the same area so if they lay eggs in the marbles will some servive that sounds very much like you have a male the skinny one and a female the bigger one and that he is interested in mating all danios are called egg scattering fish they scatter the eggs over the gravel or substrate and in plants as they spawn they like many other fish are also avid egg eaters so unless a tank has been especially planned and set up for breeding them it's highly unlikely you would ever find and eggs or fry mm Danio Zebra Danio Shark Platypus Clownfish Ostrich Leatherback Sea Turtle Lion Salmon Discus (fish) Egg (biology) Kakapo Kissing gourami Grunion Sailfin Molly American lobster Parthenogenesis Sexual reproduction Hybrid Aphid Cat Dr. Seuss Walleye Egg (food) Bird Beetle Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Skinny Puppy Seahorse The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Live-bearing aquarium fish Animal Tigon Cheetah Horse Ocean's Twelve Seabird Fugu Nile crocodile Hermaphrodite Goldfish Life in the Freezer Elis Prefecture Chicken Bagworm moth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Panthera hybrid Tarantula House Mouse Octopus Kodocha Tuatara God Emperor of Dune McDonald's Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pizza Zeidae Murray Cod Brook trout Tlingit Freshwater angelfish Spider Roe Omega-3 fatty acid Great White Shark Sonic Adventure Non-human animal sexuality Poker jargon Cantonese cuisine Sex Pink salmon Japanese cuisine Chinook salmon Cuisine of Laos Red Squirrel Ramen Cichlid Rhea (bird) Fish and chips Hamburger Veganism Condor Dragonet Dinosaur Starship Troopers RuneScape quests Kruger National Park Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Arctic grayling Creatures in Bionicle Cuisine of Denmark Piccolo Junior Saga Sushi Chinese cuisine Halfbeak Fancy rat Boom Town (Doctor Who)
