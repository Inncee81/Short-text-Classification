sw tank alge blooms 'red sand' help appreciated i have a saltwater fish tank reef tank it is a gallon with lbs fully cured live rock from an established tank and lbs agronite lbs live sand and lb live sand from another established tank i have a skimmer running hrs and a fluval i was getting set up for the 'cycle' and i starting adding small amount of pure ammonia for days until my am ppm was at i never saw any nitrites but my ammonia has been dropping and my nitrates are up to a nice ppm now that nitrates have shown up for the last days and my ammonia is now at i have a few questions if my ammonia is dropping now at why is my nitrates showing and i never seen any nitrites my sand is having some light 'alge blooms' of red its like the sand is sorta turning red why is this and is it ok is my tank cycled did i kind of clone a tank should i add a fish or to keep ammonia in there a cleanup crew i already have hermits and snails thanks it all depends on what bacteria were on the live rock and in the live sand there are two groups of bacteria involved in the process one which converts the ammonia to nitrite and another which converts the nitrite to nitrate if both groups are low you'll get the three separate peaks but since you started with a good source of living bacteria the ones in the second group nitrite to nitrate may have been able to keep up with the amount of nitrite those from the first group were creating if this were the case you wouldn't have noticed any nitrite red or reddish brown if red this may be cyanobacteria see photo http www sloreef com bojan cyanobacteria files cyanobacteria jpg red slime algae and you don't want this in the tank it's feeding off the nitrate that's being produced and if you're using tapwater to mix the salt there is probably phosphate in the tank as well cyanobacteria doesn't like high flow so use a powerhead to direct current at problem areas do some water changes to lower the nitrate level and use a phosphate absorbing pad that you can cut to fit the filter if you've been using tapwater it would be better to use reverse osmosis water the culligan self serve dispensers in some stores are this or get an ro filter for home use or at least mix this with the tap water to reduce the amount of phosphate if a reddish brown this is more likely diatoms http www saltcorner com sections guest algaepage brown diatoms diatoms jpg and this is natural in a new tank you'll still need to control the nutrients but the snails and hermits will help control this they won't eat the cyanobacteria the tank's cycled only when nitrate is the only compound of ammonia nitrite and nitrate that you're able to detect since you're there it would be okay to add one or more fish depending on their size start with species that would be smaller and more peaceful then build to the larger more aggresive species of the fish you intend to keep just go slowly and add fish per week you may also want to increase the size of the cleaning crew these will also help clean the Fish farming Nitrogen Plankton Hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen economy Carnivorous plant Photosynthesis Biogeochemical cycle Water purification Explosive material Uranium Biodiesel Nitrogen cycle Carbon dioxide Ozone depletion Hydrogen Cyanide Ammonium nitrate Ozone hole Soil pH Algae Diatom Water (molecule) Shrimp farm Water E85 Soil life Algal bloom Lake Earth's atmosphere Coral reef Reef tank Brewery Ecology Chlorophyta Fire fighting Ice core Fertilizer Dairy Energy development Electrophysiology Nitric acid Alkane Food preservation Mineral Thermal power station Sea-Monkey Antarctic krill Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Autonomous building Sodium nitrite Rebreather Ham Milk Ocean thermal energy conversion Sulfuric acid Transformer Illegal drug trade Osmosis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina CPU cache Internal ballistics Bacteria Geology of the Grand Canyon area Carburetor Cellular respiration Nutrition Coal Hamster Salton Sea Nuclear fuel cycle Drill bit Origin of life Ozone Alternative biochemistry Sun Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Tank Chlorine Cell (biology) Aluminium Curing Cannabis cultivation Lake Burley Griffin Biochemistry Solar variation Foodborne illness
