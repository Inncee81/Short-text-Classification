saltwater tank refugium question ok i have a salt water refugium set up it is an actuall refugium not like a gallon tank or anything my only question is this should i have like an air stone in it as it does not seem like there is allot if any movement of water though it the water is filling up and leaving the other side but it just looks like for the most part it is stagnant and just sitting there would an air stone be ok and should i do that the amount of water leaving your tank is the same amount being returned by your return pump therefore if you have gal per hour going into one side you have gal per hour coming out of the other side of your sump or fuge or sump fuge mix a refugium is designed to spread that current out over a large space so it will pass through everything you have in it at a slower pace not blasting on one rock or blowing your plants micro algae all over the place no definitely do not put an airstone in there the bubbles will stick to everything in there and end up in your tank Marine aquarium Thermal power station Sea-Monkey Aquarium Reef tank Autonomous building Sewage treatment Brewery Fossil fuel power plant Hydroponics Biodiesel Fish farming Carbon dioxide Water purification Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina B-47 Stratojet Bong Electrophysiology Sugar beet Town gas USS Aaron Ward (DD-483) Rebreather Hydrogen economy Panama Canal Apollo Command/Service Module Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fire fighting Water (molecule) Cave diving Dairy Indianapolis 500 Action potential P-47 Thunderbolt Solar power Fuel injection Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Terran (StarCraft) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Glossary of firefighting equipment Infusion pump Three Mile Island Gas turbine Derbyshire lead mining history Automobile emissions control Sutro Baths Eutrophication Siphon Scuba set Hurricane Frances Chernobyl accident Snorkel Tank truck Convair B-36 Wildfire Glossary of firefighting terms Lake Flush toilet Glacier F-16 Fighting Falcon Power station Dry cleaning Fuging tune Stock car (rail) E85 Tidal power Dead Sea Internal ballistics Osmosis Opportunity rover Sellafield Swimming pool 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Wave power Novelty (locomotive) Intravenous therapy Irrigation Tank locomotive USS Trigger (SS-237) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Energy development Gowanus Canal Glossary of wildland fire terms Space Shuttle external tank Soap bubble Heinkel He 112 Ocean thermal energy conversion History of the People's Republic of China (3/4) Battle of Tarawa Tilapia Gallon Second Battle of El Alamein Pit toilet Scramjet Concrete Textile manufacturing Explosive material Tank classification Basement Fast bowling Space Invaders
