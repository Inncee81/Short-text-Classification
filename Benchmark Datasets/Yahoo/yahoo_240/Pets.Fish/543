would it hurt if and when i do buy fish it's on a thursday and we get the fish as a last minute thing and only have a minute drive and we get back it's pretty late so would it be ok to float the bag in the tank over night and release them in the morning and how much water do u release i usually do the whole bag that shouldn't be a problem just let the shop know the fish will be in the bag over night so they can give you larger bags and more air than water this will keep the fish safe overnight i strongly suggest you don't add any of the water from the bag intot he tank no matter how clean the shop there is always the possibility the water contains a disease or parasite mm Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rebreather Dialysis Myxobolus cerebralis Sewage treatment USS Yorktown (CV-5) Mercury Atlas 6 Dairy Shark Ocean's Twelve USS Waters (DD-115) STS-59 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Customs and etiquette of Japan Sea-Monkey Animal Crossing USS Tunny (SS-282) DD tank Operation Market Garden STS-114 USS Wasp (CV-7) Fish farming Bong WFAN (AM) Mattress Attack on Pearl Harbor Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans MC Hammer Oasis (band) Diseases of the honeybee Malaria SS Andrea Doria Kitesurfing Angling M60 machine gun Foodborne illness Theory of conduct Aquarium Diving Diving regulator Cruising (maritime) Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum cleaner The Tracey Ullman Show shorts USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Carburetor Stock car (rail) Discus (fish) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Stock (food) Hydroponics James Brown (musician) Jackass: The Movie USS Thresher (SS-200) Great Lakes Environmental concerns with electricity generation Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Columbine High School massacre Dinghy Social rule Airbag Elementary arithmetic The Human Stain 60 Minutes Shaggy dog story USS Wichita (CA-45) USS Ammen (DD-527) Ecco the Dolphin Cave diving Emergency preparedness Tea Koi Gaia Online Shrimp farm Seine (fishing) Autonomous building Vitamin D First aid Fugu Swimming pool Have I Got News For You Dog training Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Thermal power station Novelty (locomotive) Coffee Symbiosis Wine making Fancy Crane Confidence trick Hydrogen economy STS-51-L Airport Floppy disk Good Morning, Vietnam Messerschmitt Bf 109 Aquaculture New Morning
