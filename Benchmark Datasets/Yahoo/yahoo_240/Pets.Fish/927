starting a salt water aquarium hey i'm an aquarium hobbiest but so far i've stuck to fresh water i'm thinking about moving on to saltwater don't worry i plan on doing tons of research but does anyone have any suggestions any thumb rules i should know about or does anyone have a quick check list of things i need from the start and or how much they cost i know it's expensive so be honest basically anything you can tell me that you think is important will be helpful i think one of the most important things is to get the largest tank you can afford freshwater fish can handle much wider fluctuations in water chemistry because they are used to a much smaller volume of water overall than the ocean most of the problems that saltwater aquarists have is by having some parameter of water chemistry out of whack in nature the ocean fluctuates very little so the fish are not more delicate they are used to much narrower parameters this is why you should get a larger tank the larger the volume of water the more slowly things like ph and temperature shift look at your local water company's water report one thing of importance to note is the phosphate levels in the water and the hardness of the water if the water has high phosphates you are going to have problems with algae and mostly the kinds of algae that saltwater fish don't really eat consider ro di water don't decorate your tank until after it cycles cycle it with damsels then take the damsels back to the store damsels are hard to catch especially if you got the big tank suggested in some shops will give you partial credit on the damsels you return damsels do not play well with other fish such as tangs they are aggressive eaters and will harry a fish to death without ever touching him if the primary cause of saltwater losses is water chemistry the next cause is fish incompatibility learn to distinguish the difference between fact and opinion there's a lot of information out there and you have to be discerning are there tanks that have damsels and tangs together sure but they're either large enough to accommodate or someone's buying tangs every months find what works for you and know why it works and run with it pick the one fish you really really really want and build your tank around it even though you may add that particular fish last have the end goal of your tank in mind as stated freshwater fish are a lot cheaper plan your tank with a final community in mind and don't buy fish on a whim be religious with your water changes see tip you can cheat a little with freshwater because of the aforementioned tolerances but do what you have to do to make those water changes a have of your tanks volume in saltwater made up and ready to go for emergency changes feel free to pm with more questions Aquarium Fish farming Shrimp farm Reef tank Hydrogen economy Water (molecule) Fish Ecology Cruising (maritime) Dead Sea Twelve leverage points Discus (fish) Sea-Monkey Lake Gar Hard disk Shark Solar power Floppy disk Fly fishing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Carbon dioxide Fishing Halfbeak Crayfish Tilapia Poker jargon 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Microeconomics Tlingit Milton H.
