pregnant fish i think my guppie is pregnant i have a net for the fry and a breeding thing to put the prgnant fish in will it hurt the pregnant fish if i put her in to early because its kindof a small space and also what is the best way to tell when she is about to release her babyswithen like a day just let her be in her tank she and the babies will be fine as long as you add a lot of live plants for the fry to hid here is a video that shows a guppy about hours before birth if you watch carefully you will see that she has a sqared appearance beneath her head http video yahoo com video play vid i wouldn't move her it will just stress her out and i wouldn't net the babies out either because they grow much faster and healthier in a big environment then in a small confined space hope that helps good luck eb Fish farming EastEnders Sea-Monkey Hamster Aquarium Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Equine conformation Saturn V Philip J.
