should i defrost my frozen blood worms before feeding i just bought frozen bloodworms they come in frozen cubes cubes should i defrost the worms and feed my fishes or just pop the whole cube inside the tank after defrosting a cube can i put half in the tank and store the rest in the freezer again advise pls thnks i would defrost the wholde cube as in my experience it is quite difficult to cut in half a fully frozen cube the fact that the cube is frozen will not alter the temperature of the water although most fish will not readily go for food that is frozen in the case of goldfish they will be greedy and can hurt themselves trying to gobble it down to quick in my opinion i have always defrosted the cube all the way before feeding and discarded any leftover do not refreeze whats left as it can become contaminated with bacteria which will harm your fish live bloodworm are potential disease carriers and freeze dried bloodworm are not good for fancy goldfish as they can cause bloat however if you have tropical or marine fish then freeze dried bloodworm or prepacked 'delicia' which is bloodworm in jelly would be just as good as frozen Refrigerator Tofu Goldfish Diseases of the honeybee Food preservation Domesticated turkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Axolotl French fries Ice cream Gar Myxobolus cerebralis Breastfeeding Marine aquarium Dairy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Aquarium Bread Ice Freeze drying Omega-3 fatty acid Shark Fish farming Discus (fish) Slow cooker Philip J.
