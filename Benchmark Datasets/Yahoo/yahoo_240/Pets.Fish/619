mixing fish right now i have silver shark approx inches black redtail shark approx inches dwarf tiger barbs about fully grown inches each female dwarf guarami approx inches chinese algae eater approx inches catfish black w white spots approx inches they all live hapily with each other it seems the catfish doesnt swim around alot ive never seen him eat but hes gotten alot bigger is this a good mix what else could i put in with them what is the best kind of food to feed them right now im feeding them complete flake food becase i ran out of blood worms im wondering if there was something better than blood worms i heard they were the best and the have the most protien is there a difference between enamel coated rocks like the blue green red ones and the other gravel smaller rocks sandy type stuff i know its a big long question but im curious i want to give my fish the best environment i can d all answers are appreciated d how good of a mix depends in part on the tank size i'll assume these are in the gallon you mentioned in your last question the dwarf tiger barbs can be very nippy and might cause some problems for the other fish especially the gourami they may never cause a problem at all but they will need to be watched the silver shark is most likely a fish also known as a colombian shark or catfish and will very quickly outgrow the tank further more it is a predator that will start to make meals of your other fish as it grows you can top of the problem here with the fact that as it ages and grow it will require brackish water and eventually a fully saltwater tank to live i don't think a chinese algae eater is a good mix for any tank anytime they get large rowdy and territorial in addition to the fact that they will stop eating algae at all and will actually attack your other fish so i would suggest you replace the cae with something like a bristlenose catfish that will eat the algae and will not become a problem for the other fish find a new home for the silver shark and replace him with a peaceful fish that will not grow over about long as for feeding i would suggest using a quality flake of pellet food as a staple and supplement with bloodworms blackworms mosquito larvae brine shrimp and other assorted frozen foods it's not only about which has the most protein but feeding a variety of foods to give them a balanced diet of micronutrients and vitamins any aquarium safe gravel will work well in this tank with this selection of fish none of them have any special requirements in that regard mm Tilapia Shark Marine aquarium Hamster Dwarf gourami Goldfish Fish farming Veganism Clownfish Sea-Monkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Krill Axolotl Fishing Guinea pig Salmon Mosquito Kissing gourami Aquarium Fugu Domestic rabbit Tofu Halfbeak Gar Vegetarianism Peanut Tea Fauna of Australia Sewage treatment Cat Omega-3 fatty acid Healthy eating Maize Chlorophyta Aquaculture Nutrition Potato Antarctic krill Zebra Danio Agriculture RuneScape skills Cuisine of Malaysia Animal Koi Catfish Goby Tag Aztec Fancy rat Cuisine of Denmark Dog Vermicompost Hamburger Biological pest control Cuisine of the Southern United States Cantonese cuisine Genetically modified food Hydroponics Breastfeeding Bengali cuisine Protein Folic acid Coeliac disease Raw food diet Crocodile Capercaillie Autonomous building Finding Nemo Great White Shark Organic farming Fish Tyrannosaurus rex Vitamin Domesticated turkey Tlingit E85 Orca American lobster Stingray Bottlenose Dolphin RuneScape locations Fish and chips Creatures in Bionicle Brine shrimp Honeybee Tooth
