is it safe to put the small two inch turtles in a fishtank freshwater the ones they sell in chinatown they are called red ear sliders and most likely no it is not safe they usually eat fish not always but i wouldn't risk it also they produce a ton of waste so if they don't eat the fish they will prob dirty up the water enough to cause problems if you refering to china town in la you bought illegal turtles in the state of ca it is illegal to sell a turtle if it is less then inches the two turtles need a very large tank or pond and a large filter to be healthy they will reach about inches when full grown they also need an uv light to remain healthy or be allowed to bask in the sun i think they are cute little guys but most people do not realize how large they get and how much upkeep they need to thrive they either die or become really unhealthy if not properly taken care of and after they grow big the novelty wears off and no one wants them anymore it's rather sad i really only suggest having one if you have an outside pond they can live in good luck with them but if you like your fish keep them out of the tank Aquarium Fish farming Nuclear power Snapping turtle Goldfish Hard disk Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Turtle Hamster Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Leatherback Sea Turtle Chinatown Tetrapod Fugu Sea turtle Humphrey Bogart Fishing Chinook salmon Domestic rabbit Japanese tea ceremony Hamburger Shark Health insurance MapleStory Pittwater Council Gramophone record Factory farming Characters in the Smurfs Environmental concerns with electricity generation Whaling Tank Tattoo Brewery Swimming pool Fancy rat Autonomous building Softball Guinea pig Timeline of alternative rock Dairy Bonsai Economy of the United States Ecology Roman eating and drinking Tobacco smoking Water Foodborne illness E85 Plesiosaur Dog Crayfish Tofu Tuatara Cruising (maritime) Smoke-screen Series finale Aquaculture Tooth Finding Nemo Confidence trick Teen Girl Squad Rocko's Modern Life Pitaten Veganism Menstrual cup Characters of Naruto Atkins Nutritional Approach Light pollution Tai Chi Chuan GunBound Stage lighting Reptile Infantilism Growth hormone treatment Sun Firework Body piercing M16 (rifle) Crocodile Treehouse of Horror XV Kylie Minogue Physical attractiveness Havanese AFI 100 Years series Vitamin C Unreal Animal Crossing Dinosaur Reef tank Vegetarianism Smelt Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Dialysis Quotation mark Peanut
