i do not understand why a large portion not all of today's adolecents are so ungreatful i hate reading things like i want a cell phone but my dad won't give me one and things like that whining about not having luxuries like i pods and cell phones why is it so hard to just appreciate and enjoy what we do have such as life food homes parents love friends instead of dwelling on what we don't i just don't understand why it's so hard for some kids to realize that many of us are extremely fortunate compaired to other people i pods and cell phones may be nice to have but we don't need them to be happy if some of these kids think that they need a cell phone to be complete there is something seriously wrong here remember when we had to work for things and when we respected when our parents said no products do not equal happiness they might in some situations by you popularity but i don't think i would love my friends as much if they only loved me for my stuff ya' know i like the way you think and i totally agree with you i also think that people in todays world are missing out on life people are making them selves so stressed out and they are spening their life working and upset i think everyone needs to just relax and look at whats in front of them i feel bad for the people that give up on life and all they try to do it make money its not untill they are about to die that they realized they missed out on their life The Fairly OddParents Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Friends Avenue Q Social rule About a Boy Rich Mullins Timmy Turner Nicomachean Ethics Saved by the Bell Transactional analysis Eric Cartman The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Rent (musical) Procrastination Laura Schlessinger One Tree Hill (TV series) Ten Commandments Sant Thakar Singh Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada Kender Breath of Fire III Emotions (album) Grandview, U.S.A.
