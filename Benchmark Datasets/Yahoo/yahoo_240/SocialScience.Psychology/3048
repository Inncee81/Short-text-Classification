how can i not so open with others it seem i always have the need to express myself even the secrets i plan to keep from a friend i end blurting it to another friend and sometimes that friend is insenitive and forgets its not something she should say in front of her she does anyways and i realize i wouldn't even have this problem if i just kept my mouth shut the whole time but it's difficult how does the rest of you do it a philosophical way oops title should be how can i not be so open with others god cares more about what comes out of your mouth than what goes in it maybe you just need someone to talk to on a regular basis about your personal life someone whom you trust i used to have an even bigger mouth than i do now what helped me was seeing a therapist twice a week she helped me figure out what was causing it for me i was needy i needed someone smart to talk to because my friends weren't qualified to help me with what was bothering me i didn't have a mom anymore she died when i was and dad was out making money no one had time for me now i'm yrs old and the only thing i need is my computer my cats and a glass of milk i hope no one calls i hope no one stops by i enjoy my privacy peace quiet girls have to talk did you know that female babies make more coo ing noises than boy babies do girls are born needing to talk and connect emotionally with others realize that when you blurt things out it's because you're being controlled by impulse therapists call it poor impulse control i hope you get the help you need you deserve to be happy having a lot of fun Friends About a Boy Shaggy dog story Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents Kyle Broflovski Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.
