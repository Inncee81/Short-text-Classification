what are some types of insanity with descriptions i need quite a few so even if many people have answered go ahead and post i will base my judgment on who has the best answer by spelling thoroughness of description and my personal opinion thanks to all who answer as in schizophrenia and monomania schizophrenia a severe psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability detachment from reality often with delusions and hallucinations and withdrawal into the self monomaniaan obsessive interest in a single thing or a preoccupation with a single idea or thought this is for a story i am writing that takes place in an asylum just so you guys know what it's for split personality a person with split personality is almost like two people occupying the same body the second personality can emerge from time to time and may call itself by a different name example michelle is a humble cartoonist who has a dangerous split personality her second self is named roxanne whenever roxanne emerges she acts very mean to everyone around her and rearranges michelle's furniture to her liking because michelle will have no memory of this roxanne then leaves michelle messages on their answering machine about how she wants to come out more michelle goes to a psychologist to get help and keep her condition under control and during their sessions the psychologist often attempts to reason roxanne and try to erase her note inmy opinion this is one of the most exciting types of insanity ocd obsessive compulsive disorder is a mental condition in which the subject constantly behaves in a certain way and cannot stop themselves this usually evolves from an extreme phobia examples some people with excessive germophobia can develop an ocd that causes them to wash their hands vigorously and for a long time and try to sanitize any surface they touch another from of ocd is theoretically developed from the extreme frear of falling and constitutes checking surfaces multiple times for confirmed tangibility putting their foot on it then retracting it and repeating several times before they walk on it there are ocd's for almost every behavior bipolarity another mental stress disorder bipolarity is a condition in which the subject has drastic mood swings that make them either extremely happy or extremely sad no examples Bipolar disorder Psychosis Borderline personality disorder Schizophrenia Mental illness Psychotherapy Asperger syndrome Psychiatric hospital Autism DSM-IV Codes Anxiety Traumatic brain injury Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Dissociative identity disorder Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Psychiatry Narcissism Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Procrastination Charles Darwin's illness Controversies in autism Drug abuse Social psychology Addiction Mania Milton H.
