neuroscience or psychology ph d i'm an undergrad psychology student with plans to go to grad school my question is for those who have experience in these fields i'm debating on whether i should look into an interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral program or a psychology program with a concentration in cognitive or behavioral neuroscience ultimately i want to study the mind brain and philosophical issues aside the brain is where it's at knowing that cognitive psychology will eventually be explained by a robust cognitive neuroscience i'm concerned that not studying the brain on all levels will leave me in more of an area of abstraction traditional psychology and i won't really be in the know or have as many opportunities for understanding how the mind brain works in an academic setting or elsewhere i would appreciate any comments or even questions thanks neuroscience is an extremely broad field if you go into a psychology program you will be narrowing the scope somewhat most likely to brain behaviour relationships if that is the aspect that is of most interest to you then a psychology program may be the better course i realize it may be difficult to narrow your interests at this point but one thing i would suggest is to think of the top five or so research areas which you find most intriguing what areas of brain research excite you if you can generate such a list then find out who is doing the cutting edge research in those areas are they psychologists neurologists biologists geneticists anyway you get my drift decide the area you want to get into and then figure out the degree which will give you access to that area good luck Cognitive science Neuroscience Cognition Consciousness Cognitive neuroscience Science Second language acquisition Developmental psychology Philosophy of mathematics Connectionism Medicine Sigmund Freud Philosophy of mind Philosophy of perception Brain Cognitive psychology Artificial consciousness History of psychology Intelligence (trait) Schizophrenia Psychoanalysis Asperger syndrome Meme Autism Race and intelligence Intelligence quotient Attention Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cognitive neuropsychology History of brain imaging Religious studies Human Philosophy of language Linguistics Mind Francis Crick Human brain Free will Motivation Psychiatry Face perception Psychosis Behaviorism Unconscious mind History of science Philosophy George Lakoff Psychotherapy Graduate school Meditation Hypnosis Infantilism Simon Baron-Cohen Transpersonal psychology Biological neural network Biology Neuro-linguistic programming Dyslexia Hampshire College Evolutionary neuroscience Sociobiology Evolutionary psychology Kundalini Mind control Holism in science Biology and sexual orientation Aspartame Soul Logic Ethics Neurotheology University of Maryland Baltimore County Magical thinking Behavioral finance Geography Structuralism Human nature Drew University Psycholinguistics Personality psychology Mental illness Comparative psychology Near-death experience University of Connecticut Psychology of religion Western philosophy Parapsychology Memetics Brainwashing Anthropology
