last night i dreamed i killed someone that person died years ago can someone tell me what it means to me it means you are feeling guilty or you think you neglected that person some how during life it does not mean that you are going to snap and kill someone just that you are grieving your loss and perhaps feel guilt guilt does not necessarily mean that you think you are responsible for the death but guilt for something said something not done etc if you put the question to your subconscious it may provide the answer Guilt Grief Prosecutor's fallacy Sin The Brothers Karamazov Narcissism Scenes from a Memory Cult Infantilism The Amber Spyglass Bayesian inference EastEnders Religion John Berryman Korban Abortion debate Jury trial A Course In Miracles Phaedo Henry Lee Lucas Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Life imprisonment Unconscious mind Murder Kurt Cobain Cindy Sheehan Arnold Rimmer Socrates T'Pol Government of France Professor X Meaning of life Immortality Scopes Trial Contrition Clinical depression Yami no Matsuei Leo Frank Ken Ichijouji Summa Theologiae Karen Horney Animism Mumia Abu-Jamal Death Miscarriage of justice Knots Landing Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Transactional analysis Please Save My Earth Night (book) Mary I of Scotland Jury Hamlet Avenue Q The Lovely Bones The Apprentice 2 Zoophilia Vir Cotto Spider-Man (film) Jacob Charles Manson Excommunication Babylonian law Original sin 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Morality One Tree Hill (TV series) Angelus (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Infant baptism Confession Rape Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Raven Religious views of suicide Objectivist philosophy S__ren Kierkegaard Scientology beliefs and practices Presumption of innocence The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Sviatopolk I of Kiev Moses Existentialism Darth Revan Lucid dreaming 343 Guilty Spark Sub-Zero God Emperor of Dune Zeratul Gwen Stacy Rei Ayanami Katy__ massacre Medical views of suicide Micronauts Evil Richard Rahl Vietnam Veterans Against the War Roper v.
