what are the benefits and or disadvantages of drinking distilled water this question asked a few days ago please refer to that and check out all of the responses one answerer was a dr i disagree entirely with her i want to know what the general consensus is with this question people's health depend on it and this is something that the general public should know the truth so if you are a dr please enlighten me i am part of the general public and our knowledge should never be limited we pay you dr's to care for and protect us with knowledge why is it that so many of you do not that makes me angry dr's should teach not just treat i prefer filtered water over distilled water i do believe it to be true that the process of delivering water from a public water utility affords the opportunity for many toxins and impurities to proliferate in the water as it meanders to its destination the water may have been pure and without harmful impurities when it left the plant but collected harmful agents along the way however no one is guaranteed that purified or distilled water is any better without continual testing at the point of destination i feel better about drinking filtered water myself but only in a general and subjective sense not a scientific one additionally i believe that the process of distilling water removes many necessary nutrients from the water one would need to replenish those nutrients via another route such as multi vitamins or mineral supplements Water purification Water Vitamin C Cancer Sewage treatment Dairy Science Breastfeeding Motor oil Cocaine Contract Tocopherol Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Veganism Philosophical skepticism Carnivorous plant Expert system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sulfuric acid Nutrition Rum Milk Meaning of life Medicine Water (molecule) Ultraviolet Democracy Scientology beliefs and practices Distilled beverage Freedom of speech Folic acid Atomism Stem cell Nutrient Genetically modified food Thermal power station Simone Weil Prostate cancer Nuclear power Chronic fatigue syndrome Liberalism Vitamin Alchemy Healthy eating Fractional distillation Methylsulfonylmethane 613 mitzvot Objectivist philosophy Theory of conduct Alzheimer's disease Alcoholic beverage Growth hormone treatment Sugar beet Alcohol fuel Organic food Distillation Autonomous building Fecal incontinence Determinism Fossil fuel power plant Public policy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Abortion debate Organic farming Epistemology Plame affair Moral relativism Spiritism Absinthe Psychology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hamster Mosquito Buddhism Hydrogen peroxide Zinc Immanuel Kant Stomach cancer Ethics Beer E85 Sea-Monkey Philosophy of language Maimonides Free will Publicly funded medicine Education in the United States Homeopathy Essential oil Open access Annuity Past teachings of Prem Rawat David Hume NEWater
