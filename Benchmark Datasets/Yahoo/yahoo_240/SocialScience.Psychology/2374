a question of control why do people feel the need to tell others what to do whether it's about smoking abortion eating healthy whatever it is why do certain people need to have everyone do as they say and what makes these self proclaimed righteous people so right is it really because they are so insecure in themselves they need everyone else to validate their thoughts perhaps i should rephrase a bit this isn't about people close to me giving advice this is the people who are telling me i am free to do as i please as long as it's their way here's an example people tell me i can't smoke in a restaurant but i can't tell them the smell of their fish dinner is making me just as sick i know i could give a better example but this is just off the top of my head some people just feel the need to push their values and ideas on other people they think they are right all the time and everyone who doesn't agree with them needs to be told about it personally they make me ill and i let them know it i guess i'm too old and cranky to put up with it anymore sorry Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kitchen Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
