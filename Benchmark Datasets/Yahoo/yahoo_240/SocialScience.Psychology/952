how do u change certain qualities about yourself that you don't like what i mean is how does a person go about changing themselves from this shy introverted person to a more outgoing happier person i was getting better at doing just that but i seem to have reverted backwards now i feel i am worse than ever i don't even care to be around people anymore what is wrong with me i know i am depressed a lot but does being depressed make ur whole world just turn upside down and inside out i'm trying to be a better me someone i will like more and someone my husband will like more i'm tired of feeling so inadequate all the time can anyone share some advice for helping to get over this gloomy stage of my life i really want to change so many things about myself i just don't know where to begin or how to do it i have to say that this sounds so much like who i used to be the greatest change in my life was the fact that i realized that basically i had to overcome my own nature and i have to make that choice everyday there is no miracle fix although there are some meds that will help such as beta blockers and such but i chose to do it own my own i don't let my self start to slip back because truthfully you learn to recognize the warning signs and you can reduce their impact when you are aware of them the truth is that you will probably never feel absolutely comfortable in social situations and with lots of people but as you feel yourself making strides to be better than you are you will overly feel better about yourself Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Social rule Jon Secada A Course In Miracles Ethics S__ren Kierkegaard Scenes from a Memory Manual transmission Utilitarianism Alexander Technique Pitaten Traumatic incident reduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Breastfeeding One Tree Hill (TV series) Opus Dei Transactional analysis Microeconomics The Wall Transsexuality Infantilism Theodicy Shaggy dog story Procrastination Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Milton H.
