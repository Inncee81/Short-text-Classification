if someone has a negative attitude towards you then are you also negative to yourself i used to be very much like that especially during those awkward teenage years if someone seemed disapproving of me or not to accept me i was absolutely sure it meant i was somehow inferior or not as worthy as them and i would really take it all to heart and decide they were right now that i am grown up and can think more logically without teenage angst clouding the issue i realise that any negativity another person chooses to display towards me whether it be vocal or written whatever comments they make or if their actions are cruel and spiteful i leave it with them i don't take it into my life i accept that they are negative that they have said or done something that was designed to hurt me but that ultimately it was their words actions deeds thoughts and theirs alone people can only hurt you to that extent if you allow them if you decide that what they said or did was a truth then you are allowing those people the power to undermine you be brave try to protect yourself with a transparent shield let the negativity bounce off that shield and deflect back to those who are sending it out for every negative thought you find yourself having replace it with two positives don't let them wear you down and bend out of shape the person you are One Tree Hill (TV series) Homophobia Hate speech Theory of conduct Atheism Infantilism Deflector shield Propaganda Vegeta Theodicy Evil EastEnders Placebo (band) Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Abortion debate Socrates Philosophy of language Estoppel Social rule Boston Public Tenshinhan Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Religious conversion Transactional analysis Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Ethics Handedness Palpatine Narcissism W.I.T.C.H.
