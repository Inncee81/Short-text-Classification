what caused columbine brian rohrbough father of one of the students killed int the columbine blamed the shootings on abortion and the teaching of evolutionary theory personally i believe that that is incorrect i believe that the shootings were caused by the fact that the shooters were tormented and no one did anything to stop it back when i was in high school i remember being tormented mostly by football players and members of the f c a teachers just looked the other way and if i did anything to defend myself i was the one who was punished fortunately for the tormentors i am a nonviolent person i'm all for defending myself but i don't instigate and i won't shoot anybody i can definantly see how that sort of treatment would spawn hatred deep enough to drive someone to violence blaming evolution and abortion really doesn't even make sense to me your thoughts please keep it nice no blatant insults i think it really has to do with something within the certain people like you said you're a nonviolent person it probably hurt you alot when you were in high school but you didn't take revenge on what they did to you those two boys had problems and they were set in an atmosphere that just made them go off i agree with you that no one helped but did they ask for help we always wish that when we're at school teachers will notice and help us individually but with hundreds of kids its probably easy to let a few slip through the cracks and unfortunately those couple that they let slip or that they just didn't notice came back and took as many innocent lives as they could and then took their own i don't think the evolution and abortion have anything to do with it either the father was probably trying to make excuses i'm sure he's stuck in a place neither of us can imagine he was to say something my cousin goes to columbine and oddly enough she was having an abortion the day the shootings happened so she wasn't there kind of ironic Columbine High School massacre Theory of conduct The Marshall Mathers LP Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Bowling for Columbine Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Knots Landing Video game controversy One Tree Hill (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye EastEnders Bully Kodocha Days of our Lives Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pitaten Hey Jude Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Transactional analysis First-person shooter Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Torture Kyle Broflovski Domestic violence Blood (computer game) Scapegoat Prisoner's dilemma Perfect Dark Venom (comics) W.I.T.C.H.
