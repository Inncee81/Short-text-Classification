why do some people overexaggerate things my friends flatmate whenever she talking about something makes it sound so much more facinating interesting amazing and better than it probably actually is it's not that she is positive about life and everything in the way that some people are it is more like she is trying to make her life sound more interesting why do people do this apart from trying to make themselves seem more impresive and is there anyone here who does the same thing could you shed some light on the matter well there is 'the possibility' that the individual has a need to be seen in the light they paint themselves otherwise seeing their life as a much less interesting than that of others why do people want to stand up on a stage and put themselves through the possible humiliating experience of not having an audience laugh at their jokes why do people 'put themselves forwards' into the media spotlight and seek adulation when there is little or nothing to be adulated over i estimate it as a rather large con game and that some segment of joe public want and seemingly love need to fall in with it robbie williams i see that he biggest exponent of this a con merchant and of which at times he's only too well aware of and i suspect often hates his fans for being the drug he needs my sense of him is that he really doesn't like himself very much and is why he holds a very low opinion of his fans too others on the other hand have no conscience about the drivel they pour out while they condescendingly look down on the moronic dross that are 'their fans ' trouble is the seem to actually believe in themselves come the glorious ''revolution '' there will be a special wall built specially for them to stand against and built by themselves and the sweat from their brows hopefully sash Garfield Social rule I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Capital punishment Shaggy dog story Liam Gallagher EastEnders Goldstein's book Theory of conduct The Young Ones (TV series) Duran Duran American Psycho Indianapolis 500 One Tree Hill (TV series) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Merchant of Venice The Wall Married... with Children Blonde on Blonde The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Plame affair Oasis (band) God Faye Wong Slayers Queen (band) Ultimate Spider-Man Friends Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show Jimi Hendrix Little Britain Ocean's Twelve Major League Baseball television contracts John Vanbrugh Poker jargon Days of our Lives Federico Garc__a Lorca God Emperor of Dune John Cage Daredevil Syd Barrett Creationism Kylie Minogue Initial D The Jim Rome Show Blood on the Tracks Knots Landing Methos Paul Is Dead Whose Line Is It Anyway?
