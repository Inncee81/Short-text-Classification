what is wrong with me i have had low self esteem and other issues for as long as i can remember i know why in a way due to abandonment issues with my parents a cheating spouse constant torment from an older brother growing up but i want to fix it i want to fix so many areas of my life but just never do i will go on a whim and go on a shopping spree for myself and feel better for like hours then its back to how i feel now i will call a whole bunch of psychologists to find who has the first appt which is usually a few days determined that this time i will get help and by the time the appt comes i dont go i will run out and get a gym membership go times and quit i have signed up for different colleges enrolled registered but furthest i finished was one semester i never follow through with things and i am always putting myself down regardless how many people tell me im amazing im beautiful im this im that i think im a fat ugly worthless pos but i wont change it why bless you my heart goes out to you and you do have your finger on the cause of your problems or issues as they say these days furthermore you know the right road to take but have a difficult time of it following through then you get down on yourself for not seeing the doc etc and the pattern repeats itself the reason you don't follow through is because you don't know what would happen if you did begin to make some positive changes that will lead you out of the sink hole you are in sort of a fear of success and why not who ever gavew you positives for just being a kid all kids are precious don't you think whose fault is it they don't feel loved when parents are abusive neglectful drinking or drugging or just plain mean varmits many kids think they can get that love by succeding at any and everything but this fails too and so the kid or young adult gives up who is going to care anyway does any of this ring a bell do you want to cry i do because i know wshat it feels like to feel unloved even hated and unwanted i became a people pleaser who would do anything for a compliment or to make a friend i was a great provider but a terrible human being because i simply didn't know the formula for me therapy was life or death so i went and went some more there are so many like you and like myself out there you are not alone bless your heart i pray for you to find the path and take it much of the journey will be pain but as much pain as you feel you will feel joy and happiness in equal measure what is wrong with you you mean look at what is right with you look at what you have been through and still you survive still you want to find happiness that has so cruelly eluded you how precious your crys for help you are at a great and important crossroad keep up the work that will mark you as more than just a survivor you only have my word but i have seen it change thousands of lives you are primed for change it can and does happen every day Theory of conduct EastEnders Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friends Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Grief About a Boy W.I.T.C.H.
