job interview problem i get severe anxiety at interviews i take really long answering questions my answers don't come out coherently i go blank sometimes i use a lot of ums and ahs i can't help it i also pause for very long periods that the interviewer has to start asking something else i also find it hard to elaborate on what i'm saying seem to repeat myself sometimes because i've got nothing else to say about the topic that i'm discussing i practice a billion times before interviews on my own with friends but it doesn't seem to help my voice also shakes when i try to project my voice because i'm so nervous it's embarrassing how can i overcome this is there any medication that can sedate me before these interviews should i go to a doctor therapist psychiatrist help me only thing i can suggest is being as prepared as possible if you are confident you know all that will be asked then you will feel better about the interview sorry if tht doesnt help t Milton H.
