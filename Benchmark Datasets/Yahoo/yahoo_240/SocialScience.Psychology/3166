what do you do and how how can i let go of this disgusting fear of showing who i really am how do i get over the fact that i've wasted so scratch that too much time on fear and scared of rejection or what may happen how do i just let go and be the person i am and not care and just live the way i'm supposed to how do i look my biggest fears in the eye and try to overcome them what mindset should i be having constantly to remind me to do the things i want to do and do the things i know i can do without the worry of what may happen or whatever when probably all the worrying im doing is over nothing and if i were to face my fears the outcome would be not as scary as i thought it would be i need some words of wisdom anyone your potential is determined or limited by your self belief as the promotional material says the event was 'about creating breakthroughs moving beyond fears and limiting beliefs accomplishing goals and realizing true desires turning dreams into reality creating fulfilling relationships and modeling the strategies of peak performers to produce a quantum difference in your life ' if you cut out the hype the simple message is if you believe in yourself enough you can achieve anything a memorable one liner was the only thing that's keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself most people have self doubt around universal themes ask anyone and most people will admit they lack confidence in some areas of their life the interesting thing i learnt from this seminar is that this self doubt is around universal themes these themes cross age gender religous cultural and language barriers common doubts include 'i am not good enough' 'i am lazy' and 'no one loves me' you can learn mechanisms to eliminate self doubt robbins calls it 'immersion' where you break old patterns and build new ones by repetition he uses a lot of neuro linguistic programming techniques to achieve this with his audiences he says progress is not automatic a memorable moment in the seminar was when we had to visualize ourselves inside a bubble and inside that bubble was a series of videotapes neatly arranged in a time line that represented all our memories in our lives so far we had to pull out the negative videotapes and destroy them this was followed by time spent visualising the future and how your life will look and years from now belief impacts on many levels the robbins message was that things shape our self belief he calls them the triad these are our patterns of physiology focus and language or meaning he highlighted this with the quote where focus goes energy flows our values and beliefs shape our actions robbins believes you can vanquish whatever is holding you back from taking action walking barefoot across a bed of glowing coals is the physical metaphor he uses in his seminars to prove this point to the skeptics eliminate negative self belief and take massive action are his keys to success to create positive outcomes you must take massive action where focus goes energy flows is a quote used by robbins in his presentation to highlight why you need to know your outcome and why achieving this is a must but many people fail to take the next step they delay put off and find many reasons or excuses not to act robbins believes progress is not automatic and action is power take action even if it is the wrong action he says it is never a failure if you learn something matching mirroring creates connection trust empathy robbins spent a fair amount of time in the seminar talking about and demonstrating interpersonal communication skills he used people from the audience to show how the process of matching and mirroring the non verbal communication and body language of others can be a very powerful way to connect with people in essence you create rapport by adopting the body language of the person you are communicating with he believes rapport is power and total responsiveness is created by a feeling of commonality if you have learnt these techniques before and haven't used them for a while i suggest it is time to dust them off and put them into action next time you are communicating with someone on a one to one basis anything is possible if you focus on passion and purpose robbins believes that to have an extraordinary quality of life you need two skills the science of achievement the ability to take anything you envision and make it real and the art of fulfilment this allows you to enjoy every moment of it he says success without fulfilment is failure find your passion and purpose in life my purpose is to make a difference in people's lives and use my gift as a speaker model yourself on other achievers to gain improvements quickly and step up to a new level of achievement robbins believes learning from others who are the best in their field is the fastest way to achieve success he told the story of how he wanted to improve his tennis game and so employed andre agassi the then number one ranked player to help him achieve this who could you model yourself on people's lives are a direct reflection of the expectations of their peer group according to robbins success is built on a healthy high energy body heart and mind if you are not healthy all of the above points are a waste of time your health is determined and influenced by your lifestyle one major change i've made since the seminar is to eat a healthier diet and exercise more regularly as a speaker my whole business depends on my ability to perform at a peak state like any professional athlete the success of business is directly linked to my diet and health take care of yourself your body is ultimately your most important asset Strategic management Narcissism Empathy Goodness and value theory
