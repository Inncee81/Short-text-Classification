how come people experience deja vu like idk deja vu is really weird to me how do people experience it the term d j vu is french and means literally already seen the term was applied by emile boirac who had strong interests in psychic phenomena d j vu is an uncanny feeling or illusion of having already seen or experienced something that is being experienced for the first time since d j vu occurs in individuals with and without a medical condition there is much speculation as to how and why this phenomenon happens if we assume that the experience is actually of a remembered event then d j vu probably occurs because an original experience was neither fully attended to we wern't paying attention or fully awake nor elaborately encoded in memory one has simply forgotten most of the original experience because one was not paying close attention the first time if so then it would seem most likely that the present situation triggers the recollection of a fragment from one's past the experience may seem uncanny if the memory is so fragmented that no strong connections can be made between the fragment and other memories several psychoanalysts attribute d j vu to simple fantasy or wish fulfillment while some psychiatrists ascribe it to a mismatching in the brain that causes the brain to mistake the present for the past many parapsychologists believe it is related to a past life experience thus the feeling that one has been there before is often due to the fact that one has been there before the original experience may even have occurred only seconds or minutes earlier on the other hand the d j vu experience may be due to having seen pictures or heard vivid stories many years earlier the experience may be part of the dim recollections of childhood however it is possible that the d j vu feeling is triggered by a neurochemical action in the brain that is not connected to any actual experience in the past one feels strange and identifies the feeling with a memory even though the experience is completely new obviously there is more investigation to be done there is plenty of research on the net just google deja vu D__j__ vu Hypnosis Psychosis Lucid dreaming Abduction Phenomenon Parapsychology Dream Cognitive science Memory Schizophrenia Second language acquisition Out-of-body experience Transsexuality Psychology Near-death experience Traumatic incident reduction Neurofeedback Gestalt therapy Hypoglycemia Post-traumatic stress disorder Autism Precognition LSD Social psychology Infantilism Philosophical skepticism Sexual orientation Artificial consciousness Attention Scenes from a Memory Consciousness Motivation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Traumatic brain injury Brain Psychoanalysis Karen Horney Psychokinesis Milton H.
