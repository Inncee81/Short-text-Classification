meditation i plan on starting meditation i want to know what kind of music and how i can do my room to have an atmosphere to meditate in cheaply i might add i'm and won't be able to go out and buy lots of thngs so keep that i mind i have developed simple nonsectarian universal spiritual practices based on my experience and background with various religious and spiritual paths for me the purpose of any spiritual practice is to encourage self reflection internalizing this awareness and to develop wonder gratitude and awareness of the interdependent forces of the universe i have taught these techniques to my children ages and and we do them together we also do a sacred meal where we think and are grateful for all of the things that have contributed to the food and drink we are about to consume we do this by presenting the food to a picture of the earth while chanting be one be love be peace we also have a family drum and chant circle to help express a connection with the interdependent forces of the universe here are the simple techniques that i have developed for both chanting and silent meditation practice your specific posture does not matter if you are uncomfortable sitting on the floor you can sit on a chair with feet flat on the floor way of oneness chanting practice being more musically inclined i created a nonsectarian alternative to the combination of chanting a rhythmic phrase or mantra to a visual object often a scroll picture or statue this is a more active form of meditation as compared to the silent form of meditation which is discussed below you are more than welcome to use this chanting practice if you think you may find it possibly useful while there are many folks that seem to believe their particular mantra which is a phrase which is repeated as a focusing device has magical power it really is the mindfulness that matters the mantra is just one of the vehicles you can use to get there i recommend be one be love be peace as the chanting and meditation mantra which is appropriate for nonsectarian universal spirituality in the way of oneness this phrase is a reframing and translation of the hindu term satchitananda which means pure being pure consciousness and pure bliss and is another way of referring to the interdependent forces of the universe or the universal divine or brahman or god or goddess or dharmakaya or whatever label you prefer i use two forms be one be peace for those who prefer a four syllable mantra or more often i recommend be one be love be peace for those who prefer the pace of a six syllable mantra as in drumming people who like to chant are attracted to the rhythm and they find it an easy way to center themselves and become mindful the specific chanting practice method that i find helpful in the vein of the way of oneness the realization of interdependence is to chant be one be love be peace in a position of reverence palms together in front of chest with fingers pointing upward a traditional gesture of respect to a picture or photograph of the planet earth which is a wonderful visual representation of the interdependent forces of the universe just chant this phrase loudly or softly in a comfortable pace until you are satisfied silent meditation practice in the way of oneness meditation is simply learning to live in the moment when nothing distracts you and when you are not tied to the past or anxious about the future in meditation you become peacefully aware of your real self the more you use it the more aware you become when you learn to live life for each moment to enjoy and appreciate life to the fullest at that moment you suddenly become impervious to the myraid of doubts and fears that you've lived with all your life there are a couple of simple techniques for silent meditation as well you do not have to sit on the floor you can sit with erect back on a chair many people say try for minutes twice a day i say start with a simpler goal minutes twice per day the benefits include stress management and relaxation benefits which help the body increased mindfulness and focus and increased energy the mindfulness can be a benefit to your spiritual life but meditation also has non spiritual benefits here are two easy techniques breathing meditation check posture close your eyes and relax focus on your breath entering and leaving your body count breaths mentally one to four repeat don't fight a wandering mind but calmly direct it back to task sit for a minute afterwards mantra technique choose a personal calm word or phrase that you will repeat in your meditation i use the nonsectarian be one be love be peace and as above in the breathing meditation listen to your breathing and let it relax you with each breath once you are relaxed mentally hear your calm word or phrase in your mind let it repeat in your mind don't fight a wandering mind but calmly direct it back to task sit for a minute afterwards conclusion that is all there is to these very simple but beneficial silent meditation and chanting techniques many people think that something mystical should happen during meditation or chanting most often nothing happens and nothing should be expected i hope these are helpful be one be love be peace namaste dave God Bhajan Neuro-linguistic programming Magic (paranormal) Tantra Vishnu sahasranama Reiki Aum Kukai
