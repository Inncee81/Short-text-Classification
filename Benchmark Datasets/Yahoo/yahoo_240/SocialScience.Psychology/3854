huge hot but strange turn on ive been noticing that for a pretty long period ive been having this fetish of getting turned on even just by reading about court cases where the guilty is sentenced to death or prison the turn on is because i think that the judge who ordered the sentence would enjoy a lot while the guilty guy is in prison suffering also i think the same way when thinking about the police and the jury and not forgetting the prosecution who are all involved in sending the bad guy to the gallows or to prison even prisons guards and senior officers turn me on like hell when i think of their family life which could be sometimes exciting finally i always think that i shud have at least become a policeman or a prosecutor the worst turn on that i got was when saddam hussein was hanged so you can imagine my strange fetish tks in advance for your answers bye strange yes abnormal probably something to worry about absolutely not be yourself be who you are Charles Graner Jury trial Plame affair Mumia Abu-Jamal Appeal Capital punishment Prosecutor Leo Frank Beltway sniper attacks Double jeopardy Murder Miranda warning Schapelle Corby Adversarial system Plea bargain Scott Peterson (convicted murderer) Presumption of innocence Judge Advocate General's Corps Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution John Allen Muhammad Lynndie England Miscarriage of justice Criminal justice system of Japan Radical War Mikhail Khodorkovsky Judith Miller (journalist) Watergate scandal Lee Boyd Malvo Impeachment Rainey Bethea Hanging Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane James Bulger Karla Homolka Apology (Plato) Edgar Ray Killen Jury EastEnders Karl Rove Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Hell Ronnie Earle Trials of Saddam Hussein Charles Peace Symbionese Liberation Army Regicide Henry Lee Lucas Capital punishment in the United Kingdom Theory of conduct 2001 Cincinnati Riots Torture Futurama (TV series - season 4) Fred Phelps The resolution of the Dreyfus Affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson 2003 Invasion of Iraq Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Roy Meadow Donald Neilson Inquisitorial system Harold Shipman Leopold and Loeb Unlawful combatant Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial State terrorism Capital punishment in the United States Porridge (TV) Government of France Criminal procedure Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Katelyn Faber Sam Sheppard Terry Nichols Recurring South Park characters Smith Act O.
