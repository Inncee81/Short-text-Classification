how far do you remember from your childhood do you remember any events or images from your childhood i remember images and events not in detail from preschool kindergarten st grade nd grade then somehow skips rd grade and remember things about th grade and so on i would like to know if anyone has similar type of memory like i do is it normal how come i don't remember one particular year grade in my life every grade i have some events images remembered nothing special i can remember teacher's faces and other images except rd grade why this is an interesting topic the human mind is amazing and very little understood your mind itself remembers and files away everything that ever happens to you from 'tramatic' experiances to the rd grade its all in there somewhere with the exception of brain injuries then its not known if the information is stored anymore or not when you 'forget' something its usually caused by a 'miss filing' of sorts basically what happens is your mind forgets how to pull that information out of long term memory so you can 'view' it it is normal for people to 'forget' periods of their lives specially as you get older as you grow your mind has to make space for more and more information and things become jumbled day to day stuff can get mixxed together usually when something super important or super important at the time happens its stored and remembered better than a day where nothing was out of the ordinary its really nothing to be worried about though you may feel like your missing a piece of your life your not its in there somewhere with the brain being so little understood there isnt much more detail i can give you try looking at old pictures or what not you may find that it joggs your memory to help find whats missing i would like to add this information for anyone that finds this in google this is the same system that causes people who experiance tramatic events to eventually remember things from their blackout when i was years old i had a major snowboarding accident inwhich my body took over and i blacked out i somehow walked down the entire mountain got help was rushed to the hospital had catscans stayed for awhile and came home and for the first couple years after i couldnt remember anything from the moment i got off the ski lift till i was at home watching 'george of the jungle' today i can remember pieces of the whole event though there is still black the hospital the ride home etc Immortality Skiing Social rule Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Cognitive science Education in the United States Infantilism Out-of-body experience Time Out of Mind False memory Milton H.
