if you say the same word to many times it begins to loose meaning and you sorta forget how to pronounce it or i do anyway why does this happen or am i just one weird nutter p i once did it with the word 'stairs' it was so weird how a common word suddenly became lost in my mouth and my brain couldnt understand it any way but does anyone know why this happens sashtou i can empathise with that it is believed to be due to the laws governing cortical arousal that is the brain gets stimulated when faced with new challenges or in this case new words this stimulation leads to chemical reactions going on in the brain including the release of seratonine adrenaline etc which makes the owner of that brain feel good the more familiar the brain becomes with that experience or in this case word the less the various reactions as described above take place so the individual feels less stimulated excited and sometimes even confused at this stage words can fail to produce the same impact as before for the brain and can following this development start to lose their meaning or lead to confusion hope helps live long and prosper the shepherd Traumatic brain injury Social psychology Clinical depression Autism Urinary incontinence Orgasm Hypoglycemia Out-of-body experience Brain Francis Crick Serotonin Puberty Chronic fatigue syndrome Epinephrine Stroke Drowning Addiction Dualism (philosophy of mind) Panic attack Proprioception Oral sex Stuttering Concussion of the brain Dream Goodness and value theory Brain-computer interface Dyslexia Cognitive science Aphasia Lucid dreaming Transsexuality Tobacco smoking Psychosis Fibromyalgia Psychology Motor cortex Methamphetamine Allergy Drug addiction Chinese language Free will Narcissism Glial cell Advertising Hypnosis Autonomic nervous system Consciousness Child sexuality Milton H.
