i crumbled in a presentation help with stage nerves i did a presentation to the guys at work the other day i crumbled i found it difficult to breath and get words out and had to wrap it up very quickly to stop myself losing control of my voice it looked really dumb seeing as id asked to do a presentation i never get like this if i know the audiance well but with some new people i just felt the pressure i have had this once before when asking a question in a conferance i knew everybody there so i guess its a problem with groups of people anyone knows what this event or phobia is how to stop it ive always wanted to be a good public speaker this is an extremely common problem that goes simply by the name fear of public speaking you are definitely not alone in this in fact i have difficulty with public speaking myself you're probably right that your fear is of speaking in front of groups of people rather than just a few strangers in most cases people with this difficulty are afraid of being judged by others when they speak what if i can't get the words out right what if someone thinks my question is stupid what if they think my clothes are all wrong and so on and so on there's really no easy way to get over this fear it takes a lot of hard work and determination one of the first things you can do though is to simply practice speaking to groups of people every chance you get start out in small groups and try forcing yourself to ask questions just to get started when you've had enough experience asking questions and you're starting to get comfortable with that then maybe take the next step by trying to do another presentation in front of a small group of people keep taking small steps up like this until you get to a point where you're more comfortable speaking in front of larger groups there are also a lot of self help books out there on this same subject i'd suggest looking into some of those although i don't know of any to recommend specifically Stuttering Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Extreme Programming Social rule Shaggy dog story Alcoholics Anonymous Time Out of Mind Esperanto as an international language GED Homophobia Equine conformation Scientific method Infantilism Diving Socrates Hearing impairment Whose Line Is It Anyway?
