i like myself better drunk why even though i understand what 'that means' in terms of alcoholism why i get so nervous around people that i hate being out so usually when i am i drink i guess what is the process that gets person to that point where the body mind and emotions 'seem' to work better when calmed i want to stop this cycle but at the very same time i do not want to because being around others make me so ridiculously nervous can u help me understand this more what an insightful comment 'i like myself better' drunk it is so true not only are inhibitions lowered but our own 'guards' are put to sleep the guards are our unconscious demanding of an 'ideal' state and savoir faire that relentlessly drive all people and some give up and go numb or don't care 'what you think about me' or embrace alcohol or the other drugs yes yes we do like ourselves better intoxicated but oh my god the price that has to be paid we cannot get out of our prison we are in in but the guards can be 'laid off' and our self acceptance quotient can be increased usually via competent psychotherapy the step programs work too for those with social phobia's or avoidant traits or just too dam shy as they are usually quite a gregarious and accepting group moreover the steps are actually superb psychology that require honesty confession acceptance of self good and bad qualities and helping others nothing beats a good ole benzodiazipene for anxiety but dr's are scared to death to rx it so the next best thing is etoh king alcohol however in short order the king will make more anxiety than ever before and you could get hooked i hope that helps some Anxiety Panic attack Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Clinical depression Insomnia Addiction Sigmund Freud Meditation Anorexia nervosa Traumatic brain injury Social rule Borderline personality disorder Phobia Drug addiction Neuro-linguistic programming Carl Jung Scientology beliefs and practices Hypnosis Diazepam Psychosis Post-traumatic stress disorder Self-harm Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence EastEnders Psychiatry Antisocial personality disorder Cancer Alcoholic beverage Mothers Against Drunk Driving Homophobia Shyness Drug abuse One Tree Hill (TV series) Goodness and value theory A Course In Miracles Happiness Stroke Traumatic incident reduction Drunk driving (United States) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Infantilism Procrastination Social psychology Existentialism Unconscious mind Sleep Enzyme Economics Decompression sickness Psychology Socrates Parkinson's disease Humanistic psychology Obsessive-compulsive disorder Ethics Sedative Vomiting Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Neurosis Consciousness Alexander Technique Health insurance Multiple sclerosis Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Narcissism Enneagram Alcohol Empathy Stuttering Drunkenness Sola fide Bipolar disorder Chlorpromazine Transactional analysis Justification (theology) Methamphetamine Clomipramine Chronic fatigue syndrome Doxepin Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Avoidant personality disorder Autism Hyperthermia 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Ethanol Extreme Programming Mind
