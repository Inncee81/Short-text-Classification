why do we react to name badges children seem to love having to wear a badge with their name on it they put it on with excitement and wear it proudly adolecents find wearing name badges often embarassing and will try to hid it shly from view for adults it's a pain in the arse a tiresome something that you dutyfully do while older retired people will have a bit of fun over it and joke about it for eg that they are getting to old to remember their names so need a badge answer has some good points i might add that i work in the emergency room and it distinguishes me from the patients in scrubs sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between us or the cleaning staff it also allows me into the parking garage my time clock and it makes the patients more as ease if they know your name it is supposed to be a security check as to who is where they are supposed to be children love to see their name on things it gives them that special identity that this is my name so far as the older folks it creates a more friendly atmosphere and many do have trouble remembering names although i have been guilty of that myself thank you for asking Social rule Scouting Psychiatric hospital The nature of God in Western theology Justification (theology) Franklin (television series) Avenue Q Warrant Officer Columbine High School massacre 2000 Australian Grand Prix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dissociative identity disorder Military slang Buttocks Little Britain Scrubs (TV show) Friedrich Schleiermacher Pok__mon Live!
