how can this forum justify slapping down a helping hand extended to a depressed person who's asking for help they deleted my offer to have this person email me if they needed someone to listen and advise with all due respect to what i imagine were only the kindest of intentions on your part i suspect that security reasons are probably behind ya's unwillingness to allow people to offer their personal e addresses in this very public forum we're all essentially anonymous here using avatars and screen names also there's no minimum age limit so people who post here may be quite young that means that any one of us could be a sexual predator or have other nefarious plans to exploit the vulnerability of a questioner whether that vulnerability stems from the questioner's tender age depressed emotional state or whatever the best way to help someone who is in such distress that we clearly aren't going to be able to help much by simply answering here in ya is probably to encourage that person to reach out to a safe resource for example a suicide hotline or one of the many internet resources including interactive forums that specialize in supporting people struggling with mental health issues if you really want to make yourself available to listen and advise depressed people and that's certainly a noble goal you might wish to join one of those internet support groups where peer counselling is not only allowed but welcomed Fathers' rights Suicide Self-harm Internet forum Plame affair Reparative therapy Internet troll Spam (electronic) Transsexuality E-mail Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Borderline personality disorder Martial art Singapore gay equality movement Ex-gay Password E-mail spam Motion picture rating system Religion Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Pretty Good Privacy MMORPG Karen Horney Narcissism Cult Infantilism Social psychology Clinical depression Childlove movement Human sexual behavior Anonymous remailer Windows XP Mental health Neville Chamberlain Asperger syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Torture Surveillance Alcoholism Anonymity Philosophy Neopets Information warfare Autism RuneScape cheats Homophobia Anorexia nervosa Medical views of suicide Psychoanalysis War on Terrorism Computer security Murder Mental illness Homosexuality and Christianity Adi Da Appeal Philosophy of language Child sexuality Domination & submission (BDSM) Life insurance Theodicy Domestic violence Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Cancer Child pornography 2channel Rape Theory of conduct Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Computer virus Abortion debate Unemployment Samaritans (charity) Gmail Floppy disk National Kidney Foundation Singapore Suicide prevention Hypoglycemia Stopping e-mail abuse Pedophilia Avatar (virtual reality) Roe v.
