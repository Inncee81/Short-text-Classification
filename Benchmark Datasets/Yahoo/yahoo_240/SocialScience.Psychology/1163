is the statement it's better to love than to not have loved at all true if a man was born cut from the outside world confined to a box in which he lived would this man be lonely furthermore if someone put a women inside this box with the man than took her away would the man be worse of than he was before my main point to this question is to understand why people say that statement loosing someone you love is the worst pain you can endure people have done amazing things for love for her but is it better to not feel the pain cry the tears feel the loneliness more vain than never meeting her at all never sharing the moments together that are currently burned into your mind like the branding of the big mac into your skull of course you'll feel better soon enough but was it worth the pain you've felt from the spoils of true love i hate the pain part but you have to risk the possibility of that pain to feel the joy sometimes you get to feel the joy and you don't lose the joy you can't know ahead of time if the relationship will last for days or decades if you take the protective path never risking the pain you don't give yourself any chance to find happiness that might last a long long time no chance at all Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat Simone Weil Shaggy dog story The Emancipation of Mimi Cliff Richard Book of Isaiah Past teachings of Prem Rawat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Goodness and value theory Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eastern Orthodox Church Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind EastEnders Babe Ruth Happiness Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.
