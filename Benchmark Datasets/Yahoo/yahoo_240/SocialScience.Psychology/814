how can i be less sensitive in general i'm not overly sensitive just more sensitive than most i work in a type of job where there's a lot of marketing we have to do and calling random people who don't want to necessarily always be called and when they use a tone w me or i can tell they're getting really pissy i get that pit in my stomach like i'm at the top of a roller coaster you know like how right before you go down your stomach kind of drops out i've worked a lot of customer service jobs food retail cashier mervyn's etc and it seems like some people just have thicker skin but i think they're born like that and it's not fair i really want to be a waitress b c i think it would be kind of fun but at the same time whenevr there's conflict anywhere i get really scared and feel like i have to step out of the room even if someone gives me a slightly annoyed tone or look i get super depressed and it liek ruins my whole day and i avoid them for a long time how can i be more thick skinned i am not sure you can become thick skinned i have tried for years with no luck you can fake it but deep down inside you will always be what you are Social rule Hersheypark Diving suit Human skin color Mattress Stomach McFly Gastroparesis Brewery Acupuncture Escalator Stomach cancer Pizza Dice Dim sum Bank Hair Sperm Whale Equine conformation FoxTrot Cedar Point Comanche Psoriasis The Emancipation of Mimi Physical attractiveness Friends Star Wars: Galaxies Counter-Strike Fecal incontinence The Adventures of Pete & Pete Professional wrestling aerial techniques Fair use Knots Landing New York Jets Tesco Tofu Kennywood 2000 Australian Grand Prix Clarinet IPod Citigroup Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Apprentice 2 Cheating in Counter-Strike Homer Simpson Retailer Milton H.
