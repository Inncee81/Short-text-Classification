do you think our life path is set before we are even born the reason i'm asking this quetion is i think they are people who were born to be lucky and those who were born to suffer misfortunes no matter how much the try to avoid it at the same time there are those who are bad and they never suffer for their evil doings and those who are just good people and there always have something bad things happening to them its unfair really something interesting in what you say made me have a think before i answered some are born with misfortune cannot get out of poverty because of circumstances of one kind or another some are born in poverty and do get out of it do well etc as far as bad people never suffering for their evil doings i think that they do a lot of what happens to us on the road of life is painful and sometimes wonderful but that's what makes life i can't explain why some good people have these awful things happen to them but also i think sometimes that it makes us a better person in the fact that something or someone somewhere else can benefit from our experience etc i hope you know what i mean and i don't mean to go on an on take care now and good question Theory of conduct Evil Goodness and value theory Luck Theodicy Altruism Nicomachean Ethics Supernatural Transactional analysis Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices John Howard Yoder Discordianism Karma Peter Singer Current teachings of Prem Rawat Socrates Incarnations of Immortality Utilitarianism Stoicism Kimi Finster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Sant Thakar Singh Duties of the Heart Health insurance CPU cache Ethics Merit Problem of evil Contract Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Attribution theory Religion Atomism Capital punishment Conscience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Glen Jacobs Reincarnation Moral relativism Rich Mullins Social justice Dualism (philosophy of mind) Charles Goodyear Philosophy of language Science Swami Vivekananda Social psychology Crime film Leviathan (book) God Emperor of Dune Human nature Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Paul W.
