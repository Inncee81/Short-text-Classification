what do you think is this song about it's like you're a drug it's like you're a demon i can't face down it's like i'm stuck it's like i'm running from you all the time and i know i let you have all the power it's like the only company i seek is misery all around it's like you're a leech sucking the life from me it's like i can't breathe without you inside of me and i know i let you have all the power and i realize i'm never gonna quit you over time it's like i can't breathe it's like i can't see anything nothing but you i'm addicted to you it's like i can't think without you interrupting me in my thoughts in my dreams you've taken over me it's like i'm not me it's like i'm not me it's like i'm lost it's like i'm giving up slowly it's like you're a ghost that's haunting me leave me alone and i know these voices in my head are mine alone and i know i'll never change my ways if i don't give you up now continued t's like i can't breathe it's like i can't see anything nothing but you i'm addicted to you it's like i can't think without you interrupting me in my thoughts in my dreams you've taken over me it's like i'm not me it's like i'm not me i'm hooked on you i need a fix i can't take it just one more hit i promise i can deal with it i'll handle it quit it just one more time then that's it just a little bit more to get me through this i'm hooked on you i need a fix i can't take it just one more hit i promise i can deal with it i'll handle it quit it just one more time then that's it just a little bit more to get me through this i think its about someone who is missing a part of themself its almost like they just dont want to go on with life because they are depressed about something the person who wrote this song obviously went through a rough time that he doubted himself and fell through a deep depression becuase of some obsticle he faced in his life Jon Secada The Marshall Mathers LP Blood (computer game) Hubert Selby Jr. Avenue Q Ozzy Osbourne Anxiety Tina Turner One Tree Hill (TV series) Boxing Knots Landing Days of our Lives Cliff Richard Megadeth Red Hot Chili Peppers Emotions (album) Black Sabbath Kurt Cobain Holy Spirit House of M Napalm Death Billie Frank The Clash Scenes from a Memory The Legend of Zelda series enemies Blonde on Blonde Suicide methods RuneScape quests The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Max Martin John Berryman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aquemini Shaggy dog story Def Leppard Dead Like Me The Shining (film) Poker jargon Hank Williams Aquaman Bruce Springsteen The Temptations Procrastination Drug addiction American Idiot The Haunted Mansion (film) Bipolar disorder The Ark in Space Tenshinhan Ghostbusters The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Aerial (dance move) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Self-harm Smokey Robinson Boogie Nights Incarnations of Immortality The Haunted Mansion The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Opeth Doom enemies Decompression sickness RuneScape Random Events Waylon Jennings Daredevil Sin City Elliott Smith Treehouse of Horror V The Supremes Rent (musical) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Rod Stewart Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Akuma (Street Fighter) Nas (rapper) Leech Breath of Fire III First aid She Loves You The Roches Guns N' Roses A Day in the Life Frankie Laine Ranma __ characters Sigmund Freud Marvin Gaye Jiddu Krishnamurti Something Positive Gestalt therapy Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Aladdin (1992 film) The Police Kain (Legacy of Kain) Sting (musician) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Smashing Pumpkins
