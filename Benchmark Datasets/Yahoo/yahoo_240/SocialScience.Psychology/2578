is it normal to hear voices when i get tired when i get tired i start hearing different voices they're really clear and it seems like they're right there they just say random things i get really relaxed and focused when i hear them is this normal no they don't tell me to do things yes my tv is off alot of them sound like they're being rude for some reason kateambro yes exactly they're short phrases that are pretty much random i wasn't concerned about this until i started reading some of the answers my mum siad that chances of having schizophrenia are so slim that it's not even worth getting analyzed i don't know anything about of my family because my dad was adopted while it's uncommon it could be normal for you sleep deprivation will cause auditory hallucinations voices are common it's especially common with speed users because they are up long enough to get that second wind and beyond often staying awake for days at a time if you are experiencing sleep deprivation psychosis then you have a serious sleep disorder and should get that checked out severe sleep apnia for example can cause you to be extremely sleep deprived even though you do sleep do you snore very loudly do you often wake up feeling like you are choking are you overwieght or frequently go to sleep before any booze you have consumed has worked it's way out of your system do you often wake up feeling like you've not slept at all check out the signs of sleep apnia see if you suffer from it untreated apnia can cause heart disease severe long term sleep deprivation makes you far more likely to be involved in a car accident and a host of other consequences if you do not have a sleep disorder there are few places to look one is the onset of schizo normally this manifests itself before your mid s often late teens early s typcially there is an environmental factor combined with hereditary succeptability to the disease the best that can happen if this is the case is drugs can reduce the epidsodes and the severity things to watch include a family history of schitzo has anyone first cousin or closer developed schitzo drug use is often associated with the onset severe sleep deprivation is also extreme stress is another environmental factor the other possibility is that you have some telepathic abilities when you are tired generally means you quiet things down by doing so you hear things that are really there all the time but you just don't notice them telepathy as a skill can be honed and you can prove disprove this by working on the skill find a voice that you can verify a close friend whom you are on the same wavelength with attempt to get quiet and verify thought snippits telepathy exists but it's not movie style read people's thoughts at will at least nobody i've ever heard of or seen has possessed such strong skill if it helps any at very stressful times in my life i've heard little snippets when extremely tired just as you described this has happened for years now so it's not the onset of schitzo as the onset is rapid and overwhelming the voices progress into visual hallucinatins paranoid delusions and other manifestations of the disease within a few short years of the initial onset years is not documented and by my age the onset of schitzo from what i understand just doesn't happen without environmental factors such as heavy metal poisoning or drug induced reactions i am rather sensitive picking up emotions from those around me at times and even hearing spoken speech directed at me once i verfied the words and that she had spoken them and it freaked us both out lol she was miles away when she called out too me then we repeated it a few times are you using any over the counter or illegal drugs what might be happening is a reaction asperin in particuler causes ringing in the ears in many people this can progress to auditory hallucinations if you suffer from migraines and treat them with asperin you might literally be od'ing on asperin and the auditory hallucinations are your bodies way of saying make it stop there are several drugs out to treat migraines that are much easier on the body midrin imitrex and others finding triggers is very important thus preventing them in the first place other drug interactions may be causing this as well maybe an anti depressent mixing with something else large amounts of caffine can trigger meth like audio and visual hallucinations along with irreguler heartbeat and other nasty side effects might be you need to simply knock back on the caffine and if you smoke reduce how many cigs you smoke in a day any other stimulents you take reduce those as well especially sugar which can withs ome people act like a type of speed what you don't want to do is misdiagnose what's going on anti psychotic meds will make you rather psychotic if you are not already that way when you start schitzo is a totally disabling disease and your life will be over as you know it if you are developing schitzo no cure and the drugs to control it only lesson the impacts not really control it if you are developing schitzo and do not get treatment you could harm yourself or others so my advice is now that you are aware of it have somebody close monitor your actions be aware of the symtoms of schitzo and watch for them but don't obsess over it most likely your ok and you just have the gift of hearing things others don't journal just write your thoughts every day make sure to note every episode that happens start logging your diet and sleep and drug intake see if there is a common factor chart the frequency if it increases in frequency duration or intensity then and you can find no common environmental cause first start with an md especially if this trend continues over a period of months if it stays the same or reduces you are probably not developing schitzo i'll link you to the symtoms of schitzo and you can run down the list to see if you are experiencing any of them don't stress too hard unless they do indeed increase in frequency severity and or intensity many people do indeed have such experiences but are not schitzo they will come during really stressful times in your life or really spiritual times of your life when the walls between you and the sea of people are thinnest when you are quietest it sounds more like this is the case than the onset of schitzo as your question is very lucid and well organized however that is what the journal is for if you constantly jot your thoughts down you will find either that yeah your a little wierd everybody is don't worry about that if you find that sometimes your thoughts are so chaotic and strange that you barely recognize your own thoughts then worry and seek treatment the journal helps you sort out which is the case allowing you to review your thought process while in a rational state of mind if there are periods of irrationality don't take emotional distress as irrationality if your po'd or feeling depressed or such you may rant to get things off your chest it's when there are no emotional stimulus to distort what your feeling or if you find yourself lacking emotion altogether that you want to
