i really believe based on my limited research that i have add does anyone know how that is actually diagnosed in an adult and how do they treat it the diagnostic criteria for adhd in adults is similar to that for children i have linked below to the diagnostic criteria there are three sub types of adhd adhd predominantly innatentive formerly known as add adhd predominantly hyperactive or adhd combined type to diagnose you they would run similar tests that they run on children but geared towards your age level there would also be questionnaires to fill out a talk interview and they would probably want to see your school records they would probably also want to check for other things like other learning disabilities depression anxiety etc since all of those things can mimic the symptoms of adhd and they would want to rule out other things to make sure they diagnosed you with the right thing as for treatment it depends on what you have trouble with what your job or daily life demands etc medications like concerta ritalin adderall etc are used to treat adults with adhd as well as with children if the symptoms don't show up that severely in an adult's life many adults with adhd often find that the troubles they had in school disappear or transfer to different things once they are adults medication may not be necessary and the adult can work with a counselor instead who would help them figure out strategies for coping with the things they find difficult Methylphenidate Asperger syndrome Amphetamine Medicine Chemical imbalance theory Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypoglycemia Bipolar disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Autism Clinical depression Narcolepsy Schizophrenia Mental retardation Procrastination Multiple sclerosis Cancer Growth hormone deficiency Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatry Neurofeedback Stroke Psychotherapy Mental illness Growth hormone treatment Autism epidemic Diabetes mellitus Expert system Migraine Stomach cancer DSM-IV Codes Auditory processing disorder Asthma Nurse Bradley Nowell Dyslexia Diagnosis Anxiety Hearing impairment Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Sleep Transsexuality Learning disability Stuttering Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion Dissociative identity disorder Hyperactivity Addiction Borderline personality disorder HIV test Atherosclerosis Nicotine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Chiropractic Drug addiction Narcissism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Epilepsy Cephalic disorder Intelligence quotient Fibromyalgia Adderall Methamphetamine Homeopathy Antidepressant Endometriosis Coeliac disease Anti-psychiatry Sleep apnea Alternative medicine Psychoanalysis Obsessive-compulsive disorder Phobia Malaria Alcoholism Anorexia nervosa Breast cancer Balance disorder Multiple myeloma Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Cerebral palsy Medical analysis of circumcision Malignant melanoma Oncology Tourette syndrome Acne
