how can i still be sick years after i have seen this question http answers yahoo com question index ylt auq sypstspenrc pbako lsy ix qid aamlq d and i answered it as i thinked about it made me truly sick i get my last meal out how can i be still so affected by that years after i know i should go to see a specialist but i am really afraid of the possible effect that a bad report from a psy can have on my career in the armed forces it would be easy for me to say you didn't deserve it you did nothing to promote it it is all about power and control of the perpetrator and while that is all true you have heard it a million times and it still means nothing to you i know it means nothing to me either there is still the wonder of why the reason is we are people who were victimized and cannot understand how another person would do that because it is not in our thought processes to even conceive that i hate being a victim of anything and in that have had dreams of rape which were romanticized i don't know how that makes sense at all and i think i have the hardest time with that part of it if you need to talk to someone you can email me it is a difficult process and recovery is extremely hard because the issues keep changing Rape Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Free will Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Goodness and value theory Abortion debate Appeal The nature of God in Western theology Coercion Domestic violence Theodicy Expert system Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Social rule Stomach cancer CPU cache RuneScape cheats Time Out of Mind Philosophy of language Evil Murder Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prayer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sola fide Simone Weil Science Capital punishment Torture Infantilism Transactional analysis Sexual orientation Extreme Programming Philosophical skepticism Cindy Sheehan Logic Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Stochastic process John Lott Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina A Course In Miracles Jon Secada Scientific method Borderline personality disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mother Teresa Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Bill Maher Merit Hearing impairment Alcoholics Anonymous Role Deconstruction Supernatural Abortion Neuro-linguistic programming Ozone depletion Jean Charles de Menezes Originalism Consensus decision-making Summa Theologiae Critique of Pure Reason Objectivist philosophy Roswell UFO incident Katelyn Faber Identity and change Justification (theology) Inflation Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Mind control Existence Calvin and Hobbes Intelligent design Aphasia Martial art Information warfare Identity theft Person Many-worlds interpretation Leviathan (book) Requirements analysis Arguments for and against drug prohibition Religion Domain Name System Deprogramming Rent (musical) Philosophy of space and time Novel Religious Society of Friends Ethics Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Karen Horney Philosophy of mind Jiddu Krishnamurti Phishing Aesthetic Realism Determinism
