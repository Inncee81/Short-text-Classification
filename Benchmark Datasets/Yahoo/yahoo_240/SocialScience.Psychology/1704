having hard time waking up when the alarm sound why is this i would set my alarm and without me even knowing i would tun it off my mom always get upset with me because i don't wake up in time i asked couple people and they told me to move the alarm in the farthest point of the room and i did that but it is not working the interesting thing is that during school weeks when i have a test or something i would tell myself that if i won't wake up in time i won't get a good grade then magically i am able to wake myself and turn the alarm off and go right to study but if i don't have a test or anything i unconsiously turn the alarm off why is this even if i go to bed early i am like that and i have hard time telling myself that it is a test day everyday i really need answers what should i do i do this alot too your body does it naturally when you are really tired and truly need the sleep the rest of the time its mostly because you don't have anything motivating you to wake up like when i am doing something in the morning ie softball practice playing golf etc i am up and ready to go in no time at all but the rest of the time i am like more min more min etc b c i have nothing pressing me to wake up good luck you are a normal teenage young adult girl just like me Shaggy dog story Milton H.
