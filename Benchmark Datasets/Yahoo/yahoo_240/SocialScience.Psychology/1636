do your children argue with you and to make your point lucid to them have you ever asked the same question on y a in an effort to demonstrate to your child that the vast majority of responses show that the child should adjust its take on things i'm a child well an adolescent and i do argue w my parents but it's not because i'm a rebel actually children argue not because we're rebles or something i would like to answer your question if you may so that i can give another perspective if that's okay i'm a psychology student and i learned from our developmental psychology class that sometimes children especially adolescents have too much idealism and criticalness they have this ideal world and see the real world which is not a par w their ideal world they believe that adults are responsible for this real world so this would lead them to convince themselves that they know better than adults also adolelscents frequently partake in arguments this is called argumentativeness and it is seen when adolescents are constantly looking for opportunities to ty out and show off their new formal reasoning abilities these are just of the six manifestations of immature adolescent thoughts said by david elkind of course one reason can also be a generation gap this actually affects familial relationships more than what we account it for kids especially adolescents feel that they aren't being understood by their parents because the values of the times now is different from their parents anyway i guess for all parents w adolescents it's actually normal to have arguments during this stage because well first the strains of puberty may be the cause given all the hormonal stuff and all plus adolescents also feel the need to express their autonomy and these arguments would progress more in midadolescence to late adolescence as teens would try their own way in life of course this would pass once they become well adjusted and i guess more mature so there are actually many many aspects that's involved in this and that how a child should adjust to things can't really be controlled by the adolescent given the changes and new life experiences that they have of course this is assessing that your children are adolescents i do not wish to argue lke what is typical of my age group i just wanted to share these pieces of information i guess it shows that parents even though their children seem to be getting older actually have a lot more shaping to do and i'm sorry about that but adolescence really is full of pressures according to erikson it is a critical stage for self identity perhaps arguing with them isn't the best method but you can try cognitive restructuring that is challenge their beliefs but not by arguing rather use their own reasoning and start to question it one by one adolescents especially those from the early to middle ones are also characterized by hypocrisy they have all these ideals yet it would not hold because they don't really believe in it wholly like one time my teacher in cognitive psychology told us about this patient she had a teenager who thinks that he does not have any goals she first asked the guy why he thought that and then he said that he just does not care then she started asking the guy if he dressed up that morning and it all came down to the patient himself saying that he himself willed himself to go to the psychologist with that she asked and then you still don't think you have goals or something like that Adolescence Psychology Social psychology Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Philosophy of language Second language acquisition Developmental psychology Child sexuality Human Theory of conduct Epistemology Autism Narcissism Infantilism History of intersex surgery Clinical depression Philosophical skepticism Religion Franz Boas Abortion debate Transactional analysis Strategic management Sexual differentiation Objectivist philosophy Motivation Transsexuality Growth hormone treatment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Polyamory Critique of Pure Reason Artificial consciousness Stuttering Child sexual abuse Past teachings of Prem Rawat Idealism A Course In Miracles Theory of cognitive development Goodness and value theory Pedophilia Reparative therapy Hypnosis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ethics Sexual orientation Magical thinking Breastfeeding Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Intelligence quotient Friedrich Schleiermacher Person Theodicy Psychology of religion Education George Lakoff Medicine Meaning of life Fathers' rights Economics Where Mathematics Comes From Philosophy Logic Sexual abstinence Deprogramming Immanuel Kant Church of Christ, Scientist Prostate cancer Intersex surgery David Hume David Reimer Kender Gender role Postmodernism Intelligent design Noam Chomsky Abortion Anthroposophy Teach the Controversy Creationism Blood on the Tracks Philosophy of mind Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Peter Singer Homeschooling Moral Politics
