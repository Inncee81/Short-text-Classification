is telepathy real how to learn it most people have some degree of telepathy you just have to recognize it when it happens do you know who is at your door before you answer it can you sense that it will rain do you sense when others aren't feeling well do you get a sense of danger when my husband i met we discovered we could read each other's thoughts one night i had the strangest feeling that my fiancee was ill he was at work i hadn't heard from him all day but i sensed that he would call me tell me he was i made up the sofa for him just in case my feeling were correct a couple hours later he called and confirmed my feeling he wasn't certain if he was well enough to drive home he lived in a different state from where he worked so my mother i went picked him up from work both of us had to support him as we walked him out to the car his temperature when we got home took it it was over degrees climbing my mom called his parents to let them know so they wouldn't be worried my mother i were both insomniacs we were able to keep an eye on him all through the night he was sck to his stomach too which doesn't help matters by morning his fever was down to degrees and by mid afternoon he finally felt well enough he thought he could get home safely he still looked felt bad by the time he got home his fever had climbed back up he was off work the rest of that week with a combination of diarhea nausea fever chills sweats vomiting aches pains all over his body that was in the 's we knew very little about things that can make people sick he had started feeling bad about minutes or so after he had went to eat lunch at the deli perhaps it was food poisoning we don't really know he treated it like it was a flu my mom i sensed that this was more serious than just the flu thankfully he recovered i have always been able to sense when something is wrong with him he is able to with me at times also when we were first married we didn't have a phone i would give him a grocery list in the morning before he left for work sometimes i would forget to put something on the list that i wanted that was out of the ordinary when he would get home the item would be in the grocery bag the first time this happened i remarked oh good i was afraid i had forgotten to put this on he list he replied you didn't put it on the list in fact i was worried you would be upset with me for picking up something that wasn't on the list i don't know why i did it i was just walking by it when suddenly this urgent feeling come over me i picked it up my husband explained then i told him that urgent feeling must have been me i explained i was worried that the item wasn't on the list it was something i had planned to fix for our dinner this week the thought just kept nagging me this would happen with anything from apples blueberries cherries to xerox paper yellow bananas zucchini he was always relieved i knew he had asthma before he was diagnosed he didn't want to believe that even though his symptoms were obvious to me our oldest daughter had lung problems when she was born which caused her to develop asthma his older brother also had asthma once when he came home from work i sensed he had a serious hernia problem told him he needed to see the doctor right away he actually had three hernias which required three surgeries i sensed when i was pregnant even when things didn't seem to point to it i knew what my babies were going to be this was before ultrasounds were available once we arrived at a friends who were getting married the next day saturday they couldn't find their marriage license i told them it was in a box on the top shelf of the bride's bedroom closet nobody checked or believed it even though i was certain it was there they could have checked it just to see if i was right or not but others who had been there longer convinced them that it couldn't be by the time sunday came the marriage license still wasn't found the brides sister showed up asked me if there had been anyplace not searched i told her the brides bedroom closet hadn't i hadn't been permitted to look even though i was certain it was there the sister said nobody would stop her from looking she went to the bedroom opened the closet against many protests pulled down the box and opened it right on top placed inside by the bride herself who suddenly remembered that she had placed it there for safe keeping just prior to our arrival was the marriage license another time i sensed that a baby was in breach position with the cord wrapped times around the baby's neck i told this to the mother to be who was a friend from work thankfully she wasn't upset when i told her she went to her ultrasound the breach was confirmed exactly as i described she said she was glad i had told her cause when the doctor confirmed this she didn't fall apart like she would have they were able to remove the cord from the neck turn the baby the baby was born healthy without anymore complications
