how can i directly confront a compulsive liar i have a friend that has been lying about everything in her life from owning a gun to past abusive relationships and everything in between she is a prototypical compulsive liar in that all her stories seem to be based on building sympathy and directing attention back at her i really want to do what i can to help and i know it is a long shot to make any difference unless she decides that she wants to change any reasoned advice or experience will be appreciated have proof when you confront them a compulsive liar is very good at manipulating the truth so good they even convince themselves that the lie is reality it is an illness so she may not even believe you unless you have evidence if she is in fact sick it is important for you to confront her she may need help and not even know it be prepared to lose her as a friend though people with mental issues tend to surround themselves with people who are willing to act like nothing is wrong Lie Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin City Obsessive-compulsive disorder Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Gestalt therapy Domestic violence Simone Weil Theory of conduct Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Appeal Liar paradox Goodness and value theory Brainwashing Days of our Lives Insanity defense Burden of proof Neuro-linguistic programming Theodicy Truth Al-Ghazali Friedrich Schleiermacher A Beautiful Mind Aristotle Compulsive gambling One Tree Hill (TV series) Memento (film) Logical argument Serial killer Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Narcissism Religion The nature of God in Western theology Religious Society of Friends Dead Like Me Transactional analysis Alcoholics Anonymous EastEnders Involuntary commitment Philosophy of language Ethics Scientific method Opposition to cults and new religious movements Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Milton H.
