madonna whore maddonna whore the maddonna whore syndrome is that men typical men not all men want to be with a woman who is innocent and virginal except with them they want a woman who is immacculate until they want her and then she spreads like warm butter why is there such a double standard why is it socially acceptable and encouraged for men to sleep with as many women as possible but for women to maintain the illusion of purity what do you think actually that is a psycological phenom and since i was on a psycology forum i foolishly assumed that there would be some people with half a brain on here who wanted to talk about psycology apologies not to everyone that replied but a select few two in particular such views of women stem from tradition gender roles and expectations of women gender roles still do endure in many areas today and women are in large part responsible for this as long as women continue to expect such things as to be 'treated like ladies' which is in keeping with those traditional gender roles then such gender roles and social stigmas will endure with unequal pay also being amongst them unfortunately most women in the usa simply don't comprehend that in order to be treated equally they must be equals instead they are more interested in receiving the privileges of being treated 'old fashioned ' being equal means dropping such gendered privileges some women know this and live by it and want to make their own way in the first place most it seems do not and they ruin it for those women who do want to be treated as equals nina who answered above seems to be amongst the latter group by expecting such such traditional treatment out of her husband as she does she actively contributes to the maintenance of traditional gender roles in our society if women expect to be treated like ladies then society will expect them to comport themselves like ladies as such women who sleep around will be looked up on as harlots in short as long as some women expect to be treated according to a double standard then they will be viewed according to that double standard as well as said above women will be treated as equals when they act as equals many women do act as equals unfortunately for them many others do not Gender role Bisexuality Christian views of women Fathers' rights Psychology Prostitution Marriage Sexual orientation Woman Gender-neutral language Transsexuality Divorce Gay rights Nudity Labor theory of value Economic inequality Heteronormativity Rape Discrimination Masculism Homophobia Gender identity Infantilism Affirmative action Microeconomics Human sexual behavior Pedophilia Sigmund Freud Hikikomori Liberalism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Abortion debate Religious Society of Friends Dissociative identity disorder Power (sociology) Homosexuality and transgender A Course In Miracles Civil rights Social rule Domestic violence Theory of conduct Free will Sex Macbeth History of feminism Mary, the mother of Jesus Homosexuality Clinical depression Bipolar disorder History of sex Autism Noam Chomsky Wealth Separation of church and state Social psychology Hypnosis Intelligence quotient Property (ownership right) Software engineering Betting (poker) Anarchism and capitalism Gender identity disorder Rabbi Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Social justice Borderline personality disorder Insomnia Madonna (entertainer) Culture of the United States Jewish view of marriage Sex-positive feminism Whore of Babylon Religion and sexuality Clergy Human Colley Cibber Physical attractiveness Culture Biology and sexual orientation Undergarment Book of Revelation Gender Clothing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mind control Transgender Health insurance Polyamory Plame affair
