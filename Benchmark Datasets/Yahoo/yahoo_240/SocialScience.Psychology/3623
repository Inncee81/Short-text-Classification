hi all can you better deal with a situation if you try to have a detached attitude details inside d can you better deal with a situation if you try to have a detached attitude or do you need to be emotionally involved explain your answer use examples if you wish thanks for answering in advance have a nice day night thanks for sharing take care thanks just me it depends on what the situation is sometimes you have to have a detached attitude for example if there is a crisis if there are other people who would be adversely affected by you showing emotion if there is action to be taken immediately then there is no room for emotional involvement we have a 'professional' front and a personal one the responses are hopefully different although in really stressful jobs at debriefing it is dealt with by a seemly inappropriate dark humour it is acknowledged and promoted in such professions however if it is a personal situation then you can be as emotionally involved as you wish to be people have different tolerance levels for similar things what you have to be careful of is withholding emotions too many times so that you start to repress all emotions that never helps cry when you want to cry laugh when you feel like it feel sad happy dippy low whatever emotions are part of life accept them and deal with them to remain healthy who wouldn't want to experience a whole range of emotions better to be alive than living dead Scientology beliefs and practices Narcissism Ethics Social psychology Post-traumatic stress disorder Borderline personality disorder Infantilism Polyamory Traumatic incident reduction Breastfeeding Transactional analysis Clinical depression Defence mechanism Hypoglycemia Psychoanalysis Theory of conduct Divorce Sexual orientation Asperger syndrome Meditation Hulk (comics) Religion Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Empathy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Patriotism Happiness Nicomachean Ethics Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Force (Star Wars) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Reparative therapy Homophobia Stuttering Karen Horney Terri Schiavo Abortion debate Laughter Prayer Grief Triage Sant Thakar Singh Autism T'Pol Humour Domestic violence Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Prostate cancer Drug abuse Stroke Evil Current teachings of Prem Rawat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Fathers' rights Objectivist philosophy Shaggy dog story Altruism The Ashlee Simpson Show Anger management Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Franz Boas Goodness and value theory God Emperor of Dune Traumatic brain injury Pitaten Soul Strategic management Time Out of Mind Mojave people Dead Like Me Software engineering Humanist Movement The Brothers Karamazov Antisocial personality disorder Culture of the United States Urinary incontinence Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hillary Rodham Clinton Simone Weil Psoriasis Glen Jacobs Dissociative identity disorder Economic inequality Plame affair Undergrads Emotion Characters in the Smurfs Combat stress reaction Asexuality The Star Wars Holiday Special
