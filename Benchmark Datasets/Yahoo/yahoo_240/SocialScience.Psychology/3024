how do you speed up a deliberation if i understand your question correctly due to its lack of detail you're trying to make a decision and having trouble doing so there's really no way to speed it up and maybe you should just take your time so that you do make the right decision if time is of the essence then make a list of the pros and cons what would happen if you decide one way and what would happen if your decision is the other way look at it from both angles and then decide if you happen to make the wrong decision so what you learn from all your life experiences and that insures that you don't make the same mistakes twice none of us is perfect and we all make mistakes and the wrong decisions but right or wrong decide on something so you can quit deliberating and go on with your life good luck Theodicy God Emperor of Dune Ontological argument Consensus decision-making Nicomachean Ethics Biblical inerrancy Debugging Decision making Non-native pronunciations of English Value system Social rule Dissociative identity disorder Scientific method Abortion debate Originalism Free will Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Milton H.
