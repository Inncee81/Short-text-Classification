relationship question i would like to discuss how a boyfriend girlfriend spouse affects and should affect their partner we can tackle this in any and all age groups but i'd imagine doing so in our own would be the most vehement and enthralling discussion to start it off as for our generation the idea of a partner seems to be central to our social lives whether it be our social lives with them or just our social status much weighs on the one ye be mackin' with is it healthy for us to put much pressure on finding someone are our high school years really wasted if we never slip out hand under their shirt or unzip their pants and less and more physical actions too also we often seem to invest much of our emotional welfare in the partner we've all heard the stories of susy lou threatening to kill herself because billy joe left her and some even going through with it is it even possible for us to be in love at such an age i think you are making a big assumption here for me and for my friends our lives revolve around our individuality sometimes that may be school other times work could be a sick family member or the new crush but whether we were single or in a relationship i don t believe any of us felt the pressure to find someone i ve been single for the longest in my life and i ve no desire to be in a relationship now i also think it is important for you to make the distinction between emotionally invested and suicide people that have a genuine emotional investment in others do not necessarily commit suicide furthermore people who commit suicide are not necessarily emotionally invested there are too many extraneous variables here i think you made some good points but you may be preaching to the choir and i'm not sure they'll offer much discussion Love Polyamory Suicide Divorce Domestic violence Sexual orientation Fathers' rights About a Boy Social psychology Internet troll Infantilism Boston Public Borderline personality disorder Political economy Economic inequality Grief S__ren Kierkegaard Supply and demand Friendship Reparative therapy Consensus decision-making Human sexual behavior Culture of the United States EastEnders Altruism Neighbours Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Prices of production One Tree Hill (TV series) Homophobia The Amber Spyglass Economics Annuity Religion Drama Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Zoophilia Social rule Homosexuality and Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Confidence trick Sin City Derek Parfit Sex and the City Art Jean-Jacques Rousseau Empathy Friedrich Schleiermacher Heterosexuality Psychology of religion Age disparity in sexual relationships Meaning of life Coercion Narcissism Marriage Polygamy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Same-sex marriage Avenue Q Friends Carl Jung Glen Jacobs Anarchism and society Eastern Orthodox Church Model (economics) Supersymmetry Plame affair Sociology Autism rights movement Emotion Sexual abstinence Children of God Happiness Socialism A Course In Miracles Asperger syndrome Corporate governance Daredevil Alcoholics Anonymous Clinical depression Bisexuality Autism Motivation Serial killer Nicomachean Ethics Sin Maison Ikkoku Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses
