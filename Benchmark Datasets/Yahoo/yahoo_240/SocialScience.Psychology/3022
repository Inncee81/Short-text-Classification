what exactly does a bad reputation dies hard mean a bad reputation dies hard means that once you have obtained a bad repuation by doing something you should not have done or by knowingly or unknowingly hurting someone that stays with you for a while you may have done many good deeds and just this one bad deed but that does not matter because the thing that you did to get a bad repuation washes away all your good deeds you can always improve and avoid doing the mistake again but you can not expect others to forgive you easily or look at the way they used to before you had this repuatation i know its hard when you did something by mistake or unknowingly and you have regrets for what you have done and people still around you do not take your wor for it but that is how life is people forget good things but they will not forget bad things quickly after a time and efforts of improvement and paying for what you have done your bad reputation might eventually go away but it will take time people will have insecurity towards you its not always that they are judging you its just the loss of trust which they have lost towards you it takes a lot to build trust and its even harder to regain it but its not impossible therefore if you have obtained a bad reputation give it a long time to go away Social rule Theory of conduct Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anger management Nicomachean Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Unemployment Cenodoxus Utilitarianism Merit Sin Chess strategy and tactics Sola fide Transactional analysis Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Extreme Programming Sydney Riot of 1879 Karma in Hinduism Anchor Goodness and value theory True Crime: Streets of LA Sermon on the Mount Socrates Computer insecurity I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Karma Doomtown Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shen Gong Wu Justification (theology) Poker jargon 1957 World Series Craps Deflation (economics) Kimi Finster Apology (Plato) Rich Mullins Windows XP Mutual fund Scientology beliefs and practices Norway national football team Luck Haibane Renmei Piccolo Junior Saga Salvation In The Groove (game) Contract Current teachings of Prem Rawat FC Rostov Public-key cryptography One Tree Hill (TV series) Possession Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Trust (Law) USA Prisoner's dilemma The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Martial art Estoppel Blackjack Year of the Spider Karen Horney Procrastination Password Suicide methods Vernon Schillinger Jon Secada Rule in Shelley's Case Conker's Bad Fur Day IBM PC compatible Epistemology Trademark Leviathan (book) Beavis and Butt-head ELO rating system Pashtunwali Lie Inflation John Howard Yoder Babe Ruth Moral relativism Bat Lash Property (ownership right) EastEnders Snake oil (cryptography) Angels in Islam Capital punishment Kodocha New York Knicks Beatmania IIDX Forgiveness The Ashes Shaggy dog story Trust (Law) non-USA Phoebe Halliwell Jean-Luc Picard Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Cindy Sheehan Diving Slayers
