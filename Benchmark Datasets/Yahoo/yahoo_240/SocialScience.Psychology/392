why our mind wants love when love is impossible for people like me i d ream it i want it i'm never had a girlfriend but my mind wants it a lot but i'm not worthy of anything and will probably not ever have anything i'm not good at speaking don't have a good job im not good at doing anything really so i'm really a nobody there is no way i can ever have a girlfriend so why is it our mind wants what is impossible it is your mind that tells you it is impossible tell your mind to stop doing that i did and all of my wildest most wonderful dreams have come true life is like a movie and you are the director make your movie any way you want it to be but you can't just wish for it it's not enough to just envision the life you want you have to make it happen with positive thinking and hard work the world needs dreamers and the world needs doers but what the world needs most are dreamers who can do Carlos Castaneda Lucid dreaming Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John Howard Yoder Avenue Q Cliff Richard Carl Jung Social rule Dream About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Israel ben Eliezer Kodocha Philosophical skepticism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Merit Jon Secada W.
