what shall i do i have a friend that i feel i like her more than others but whenever i see her i get hurt afterwards i like her so much that sometimes i cant believe to like someone from the same sex like this its not sexsually though but the problem is that i get hurt and depressed from her reactions but still like her do you think i have a problem or what is it with me it sounds like this person is an emotional drain for you and those are not good people to stay in company with if you feel drained and sad and depressed after spending time with her then it sounds like its time to end the friendship emotional baggage can be very hard on a person physically and mentally and its not fair to yourself to continue on if it makes you unhappy after you are near her end the friendship and find someone more compatible to your own likes and personality it will be much healthier for you in the long run Pitaten Social rule Borderline personality disorder Narcissism Anger management Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Alcoholics Anonymous Love Grief Boston Public Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Transsexuality Psychosis Friendship Empathy Homophobia Self-harm Everwood Happiness Panic attack Sant Thakar Singh Depression (mood) Prostate cancer EastEnders Bernard Williams Sex and the City Histrionic personality disorder Mental health Transactional analysis Divorce Anxiety Dualism (philosophy of mind) Physical intimacy Split Enz Suffering R.E.M.
