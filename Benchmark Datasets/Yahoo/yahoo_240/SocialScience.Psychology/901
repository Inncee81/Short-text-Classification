how do psychologists make inferences about differences between groups you have an experimental group example schizophrenia you have a control group example undergrad university students example give them both a written pencil and paper cognitive subtest which correlates in fmri studies with activation while performing this particular subtest in healthy individuals example the prefrontal cortex compare the scores on the subtest using a statistical measure for example a chi square or a t test in this case a chi square seems to work if the difference is found to be significant to less than a p value than one can infer that both groubs differed in a statistically significant way with less than chance for error although this depends on the particular p value p is and p is then going back to that cognitive subtest which normally correlates in a different statistical measure pearson correlation with the part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex one can infer that schizophrenics have some sort of dysfunction in that part of the brain thats how psychologists make inferences about differences between groups Intelligence quotient Brain Schizophrenia General intelligence factor Psychology Cognitive science Functional magnetic resonance imaging Psychometrics Psychosis Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Statistics Prefrontal cortex Working memory Factor analysis Race and intelligence Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Neuropsychology Decision making Visual perception Attention Quantitative marketing research Normal distribution Intelligence (trait) Consciousness Second language acquisition Biology and sexual orientation Statistical parametric mapping Randomness Psychosurgery Meditation Psychological testing Long-term memory Sex and intelligence Autism Human brain Mikhail Lebedev Health issues and the effects of cannabis Neuroscience Cognitive neuropsychology Cerebral cortex The Bell Curve Electroconvulsive therapy Correlation Bipolar disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Linear regression Mental illness Mental imagery Dyslexia Ronald Fisher Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Item response theory Hippocampus Magnetoencephalography Cognition Biological neural network Multiple sclerosis Inference SAT Scientific method Social psychology Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Philosophy of perception Doomsday argument Borderline personality disorder Cerebellum LSD Likelihood principle Meta-analysis Hypnosis The Mismeasure of Man Parapsychology Cancer History of brain imaging Human height Charles Spearman Standardized testing Brain-computer interface Mind control Graduate school Episodic memory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Memory Solar variation Motor cortex Cetacean intelligence Telepathy Psychology of religion Pearson's chi-square test Brain imaging Karl Pearson Transcranial magnetic stimulation Science
