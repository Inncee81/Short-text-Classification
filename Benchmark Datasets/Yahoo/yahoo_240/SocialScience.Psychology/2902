are there any wxplenations why the mayan calender says that the end of the world will be on dec sorry about the wxplenation i ment to say explenations i don't believe the mayans said the world will end on instead it is my understanding that they believe the world will end as we know it however my research has lead me to believe that there may be a catastrophe pole shift as we approach this date the following is a summary of the mayan people and their predictions for the time the mayan indians regard their beliefs as both a science and a religion their discoveries are not done in a lab but rather by tapping into the cosmos via the mind through the extensive use of meditation they are able to discover and track planetary movements as well as space anomalies such as black holes they used this information to construct a calendar so accurate that no present day calendar can rival its accuracy they also use this information to predict future events according to some mayans this date marks the end of the long count of their calendar set to end on a winter solstice on this date our solar system will be center aligned in the milky way's equator our sun will be centered in a position called the tree of life as it does every years we will have exited the forth dimension and entered the fifth dimension this date also marks the end of the mayan great cycle of the long count which is equivalent to years we exit the age of pisces and enter the age of aquarius in this position unusually violent sun spot activity may cause a pole shift earthquakes tsunamis and floods will run ramped significant loss of life will occur earths magnetic field will temporarily collapse humans will be exposed to a cosmic energy that will facilitate enlightenment in this state of higher consciousness we will recognize that all matter plant animal mineral are bound as one this realization will mark the end of wars for a time people will be able to connect to the essence of god vibrating energy like only the most enlightened can the date marks a goal to be reached evil forces will make every effort to keep humanity from reaching the date these evil forces are those entrenched in the third dimension in the material world they have no desire to leave this age and wish to continue exploiting and endangering all life for material gain wars just prior to this date could be most devastating with a loss of as much as of our population anticipated the resulting man made environmental damage could make life inhospitable for those who survive humans have freewill man's future is not set yet nor predictable strive for peace sources tick tock countdown to what http www exitmundi nl maya htm steep uphill climb to messages from the mayan milieu http www chiron communications com communique html mayan prophecies and calendar http www crystalinks com mayanprophecies html the real doomsday dec http www mondovista com endtime html don alehandro mayan elder http www astrologyweekly com forum showthread php t Eschatology Black hole Sun End times Maya civilization Solar system Gravity New Age End of civilization Solar variation Hipparchus (astronomer) Maya mythology Chinese calendar Fermi paradox Tsunami Sri Aurobindo Soul General relativity 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Gregorian calendar Numerology Flood geology Earth Cassini-Huygens Astrology Planetary orbit Tide Spiritual evolution Doomsday argument Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Gamma ray burst Moon Physics Global warming Human Calendar Ecology Simone Weil Deluge (mythology) Space colonization History of astronomy Meaning of life Solstice Creationism Time travel Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Energy development Natural disaster Future energy development Hubbert peak theory Astronomy on Mars Science Mercury (planet) Age of Enlightenment Ekadasi Earthquake Stellar evolution Origin belief Geomagnetic storm Solar cell Global climate model Particle accelerator Millerites Ionosphere Wheel of the Year Religion Wind power Kardashev scale Space elevator Speed of light Comet Ionizing radiation Reincarnation Determinism Christian eschatology Sea level rise Timekeeping on Mars Year Hubble Space Telescope Quantum mechanics Intelligent design Planetary nebula Zecharia Sitchin Psychology of religion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Big Bang Survivalism Ice core Polarization Lunar Prospector Reality World Wide Web Colonization of the Moon
