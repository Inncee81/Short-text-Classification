am i a homosexual what should i do about these unwanted feelings i'm a guy i'm i'm a christian and am involved in my church and don't believe in homosexuality i don't have a lot of sexual feelings in general but sometimes i feel aroused at another guy however i have no desire to have sex with another guy and mainly think these feelings come from some sense of envy like of wanting to be another person to make up for what i perceive as my own inadequacies i'd like to change this because i believe marriage was created by god for me to enjoy with a woman and that having a family is part of god's plan for me hey i envy hot guys all the time i can admire beauty in all things my friends sometime wonder about me but i'm quite the homophobe it disgusts me thinking of doing anything with guys i'm very much turned on by girls but yeah i do have the ability to envy traits in hottie guys that i want for myself i see it as much like envying anything else Homophobia Infantilism Human sexual behavior Love Homosexuality and Christianity Gender role Transsexuality Sexual orientation Ex-gay Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Homosexuality Sexual abstinence Friends Reparative therapy Birth control Sexism Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Anal sex Same-sex marriage Marilyn Monroe Iago EastEnders Brian Griffin History of sex Laura Schlessinger Marriage Religion and sexual orientation Physical intimacy Pedophilia Christian right Cliff Richard Clerical celibacy Religious Society of Friends Sexual attraction Homosexuality and transgender Little Britain Effeminacy Theodicy Aesthetic Realism Zoophilia Sadism and masochism Eric Cartman Polyamory Anglican views of homosexuality Serial killer Roman Catholic Church Sexual revolution Socrates Brave New World Penis envy God Fundamentalism Paraphilia Can't Hardly Wait Oral sex Anti-gay slogan Biology and sexual orientation Human One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind Nip/Tuck Jon Secada A Course In Miracles Gay Heterosexuality God and gender Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints My Life as a Teenage Robot Sexual dysfunction Theory of conduct Religion and sexuality Philipp Melanchthon She Loves You Don't ask, don't tell Stewie Griffin Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Gay rights Holy Orders Sexuality in Christian demonology Homosexuality in China Jealousy Luanne Platter Sex education The Amber Spyglass Woman Bondage (BDSM) Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII Avenue Q Bat Lash Orgasm Sub-Zero Clothing Slashdot trolling phenomena Abortion debate Separation of church and state Age of consent K'
