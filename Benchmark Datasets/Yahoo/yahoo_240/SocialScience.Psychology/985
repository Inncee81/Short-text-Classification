what makes people have limits and can our limits be changed i'm not talking about illegal acts when things are open to interpretation why are some peoples ideas of moral or ethics of a higher or lower degree then another persons mostly it has to do with how you were raised by your parents and what kind of friends and people you hung out with not only as a child but also later down in life some people could have the most strict upbringing and they turn out to be rebels or they learn that they dont want to do that to their kids so they arent seen as their parents when they have children religion also has some to do with it because religion does set boundries for people as to what they can and cant do either because its against what they believe is right or because it is an ethical issue it just all depends on all of your life experiences and how you decide to handle them and learn off of them most humans are pretty conformative and once they have a set of goals or once they do something a certain way that they see fit then its hard to get them to change and that goes for how they clean their room to how they do things at work to how they set their limits on their morals or ethics but like i said before it can all change by who your with throughout life or what all you go through it just depends on the person Ethics Abortion debate Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social psychology Bernard Williams Moral objectivism Nicomachean Ethics Value system Scientology beliefs and practices Reality Abortion Friedrich Schleiermacher Coercion Causality Transactional analysis Hearing impairment Theodicy God Emperor of Dune Separation of church and state Science Immanuel Kant Moral relativism Sigmund Freud Animal rights Peter Singer David Hume Karma Education Summa Theologiae Motivation The nature of God in Western theology Theology Soul Capital accumulation Paternalism Alignment (role-playing games) Moral absolutism Polyamory Reincarnation Laura Schlessinger Drama Dharma Coin collecting Confucianism Subud Lie Economic inequality Bertrand Russell Religion Paradox Abortion in the United States Alcoholics Anonymous Rudolf Hermann Lotze Free will The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Determinism Categorical imperative Jewish principles of faith Sexual orientation Humanism Aristotle Alfred Kinsey Noahide Laws Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Social justice John Howard Yoder Immortality Sant Thakar Singh Adoption Creationism Eugenics Evil Education in the United States Meaning of life Insurance Same-sex marriage Worldwide green parties Anthroposophy Education in Germany Social progress Moral core Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Punk ideology S__ren Kierkegaard Ownership Jiddu Krishnamurti Kender Human Philo Thomas Hill Green Philosophy Status of religious freedom in Malaysia
