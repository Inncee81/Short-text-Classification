difficult co worker i have a co worker who is senior than me she works in the company for years we had some clashes during my first year in the company since i was given a certain small position this position was about monitoring the other employees with regards to their sanitation she was badly affected when i mentioned in one of our routine meetings that there is something wrong with her department she got so offended that sometimes she will throw some boxes in front of me although i already apologized to her that it was not personal and that i did not mean no harm against anybody she still reacted like some elementary who kept on bullying me for the past months it was months now since that last mistake of mine still i feel nervous and pressured with her pressence in the workfield although we talk still i can feel that she does not like me that much what shall i do to overcome this stress that i feel in the workplace how am i going to work without being conscious on how i work it seems to be that she feels threatened by you since you are newer than her and she's been there longer but honestly you shouldn't care what she thinks you are there to work and you don't have to be friends with everyone trust me i don't like half of my co workers but i don't say anything to them because i'm there to work if your co worker wants to act like an immature child then there is nothing you can do some people just have a rod stuck up their butts if she doesn't want to take your apology and wants to act like she's better than you then screw her you don't need someone like that putting you down just do your job Social rule Plame affair Theory of conduct Stuttering Avenue Q Transactional analysis Shaggy dog story The Smoking Room American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) EastEnders Hillary Rodham Clinton Hikikomori The nature of God in Western theology Anger management Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Singlish Electronic Arts The Amber Spyglass Escape from New York Euphemism Spanking W.I.T.C.H.
