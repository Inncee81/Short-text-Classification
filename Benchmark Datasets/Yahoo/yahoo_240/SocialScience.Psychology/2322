do you despise minced whitefish editing i am drawing an analogy between tv programme editing and fish products on the one hand you get lovely long interesting substantial chunks that you can feast your eyes and metaphorically your teeth on and on the other you get just a mass of shredded little tiny bits of minced whitefish none of which last even as long as a full second and instead of giving you a visual area to explore at your leasure while you listen to the commentary you're battered by a blizzard of tiny cuts that make you feel like youve gone ten rounds with mike tyson after just a couple of minutes of the programme for the second time in two days ive had to turn the t v off because i cant stand being visually abused or visually raped by an intrusive editor is the minced whitefish editing style only suitable for the low attention span retard audience that watches mtv and should programmers sack talentless editors who just try to conceal their lack of talent behnd qikstyle hmmm interesting but at the end of the day visual media is an art form and just as in fine art there are many different ways to express that medium so sharp editing isn't for everyone but it is a way sometimes to get content across that actually within itself wouldn't sustain long term attention or put another way would lose impact of course different paces of editing are used all the time espeacilly in films that may at first feel as if they spend a long time on certain scenes and flesh those out for instance period dramas often have prolonged portrait shots but if you study the film you would be surprised to find that the editing can actually call on very short cuts from one shot to another especialy in times of high tension or drama so this type of editing is hardly new sometimes it can get a little silly i must admit and in the hands of inexperienced film or documentary makers it can go awry not intentionally i am sure it is very hard to make a decent piece with photography mtv isn't really for the brain dead either it is just a very unique visual and audio style designed to be fast opaced and constantly moving allowing a large amount of information to be imparted in a relatively short space of time okay not all of the information is in any way that important but it is still a challenging way to present media so short answer don't like it don't watch it lol Poker jargon Movie projector Internal ballistics Anime Photography EastEnders Drill bit Machinima Art Wood carving Extreme Programming Music video Film Kurt Cobain IBM PC compatible Terminal ballistics The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Fast bowling Electrophysiology Filmmaking Stereoscopy Blade Runner Sharon Tate Split Enz Gramophone record Sound effect Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shaggy dog story Doctor Who spin-offs Alien (film) Kylie Minogue MTV Advertising Marching band Euphemism Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Editor Knots Landing Theory of conduct Ra (board game) Knife Windows Vista Serial killer Laserdisc Drama RuneScape quests PNG Jam (TV series) Kodocha ITV Wood Compact disc Leaf Solar system Alfred Hitchcock Friends 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Henri Cartier-Bresson Team Fortress Classic Grunge music Unemployment Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Oasis (band) Science fiction film TLC I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Bish__jo game Kasparov versus The World John Lott Marshall McLuhan The Shining (film) CPU cache Tofu Jacob Neusner Bong Mike Tyson Resident Evil (video game) Audiophile Aikido Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 2001: A Space Odyssey Visual Basic Visual Basic .NET Drawing Time Out of Mind Beavis and Butt-head
