why teenagers tend to behave worst than when they were younger i see a lot of children in the rush of being adults they want their parents to trust them and they want so badly to grow up but the more they grow the worst their behavior is they are louder in the streets they answer back at their parents they insult older people are they confused about what the word mature means they want to be consider as a mature person but they seem to not see or ignore how adults really act black pearl you are right there are a lot of inmature adults just like the one that thumbs down you please no thumbs down to anyone if you disagree just leave it alone teenagers are facing a drastically changeing society coupled with the natural tendency of teens to rebel a little from the ways of their parents they have a hard time trying to figure out just exactly what their roles will be in this new and changing world that they live in when our kids are or they see their parents as being the wisest people in the world as they get to their early teens the parents are still pretty smart to them just awflully strict at the parents seem very dumb and stupid at parents are the most stupid people that they know then when they get married in their early 's they begin to seek a few hints like how to get along and how to raise their own kids by the time they reach their 's they come to look at the parents as having learned something that they need to learn for themselves when they reach their 's the parents again become very wise and knowledgeable it's not the parents who have changed very much it's the kids who have made all the changes it's all a process of maturing and coming to learn and grow as mature individuals that changes their perspectives all we can do as parents is to raise them in the best way that we can love them guide them give them a moral foundation we just have to hope that some of it is retained by the kids surprisingly enough when we do a good job of raising our kids they figure it out sooner or later that it was the right way to have been brought up and they then pass that along to their kids until then we as parents have to just hang on because it's going to be a bumpy ride for a few years rae raji the green witch Infantilism Adolescence Education Narcissism Human Kylie Minogue Economic inequality Autism rights movement Second language acquisition Karen Horney Theory of conduct The Fairly OddParents Rocko's Modern Life Autism The Kinks Generation Y Robert A.
