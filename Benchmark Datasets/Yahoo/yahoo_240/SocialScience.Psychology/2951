why do i space out so much i tend to have a short attention span i'll give you a few examples listening to people when i 'listen' to a teacher priest speaker i tend to just ignore them very easily and get lost in my own train of thoughts talking to people when i talk to people i don't try to be mean but if they talk about stuff that bores me i tend to block out what they say somehow then when they ask me a question about what they just said i'm like 'sorry what ' haha it's embarrassing sometimes i was going to write something else but i forgot what it was cause i lost my train of thought again haha see what i mean i hate this oh yeah i remember now when i practice music guitar i can't concentrate on one song so i tend to learn quite a few at the same time you know how sometimes when you try to go to sleep but you can't cause you have all these thoughts racing in your mind and then you just keep thinking and thinking and space out more i think too much why is that i'm years old too much caffeine and junk food not enough sleep attention deficit disorder not enough will power to pay attention Social rule Stuttering Richard Feynman Hypnosis She Loves You Socrates Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hyperactivity Urinary incontinence Rich Mullins Psychosis Meditation Insomnia Roxette Consciousness Caffeine Little Britain Shaggy dog story Gerund Attention Sant Mat Cliff Richard Dream A Course In Miracles Shit Musical mode Human Philosophy of language Singlish Ken Chu Procrastination The Catcher in the Rye Psychoanalysis The Ashlee Simpson Show Sociolinguistics Aikido Spanish language Milton H.
