a psychologist in group therapy said to me that she did not think my mother wanted me and i was not accepted and i still feel that i am not acceptable at times not good enough not with everyone i feel this but with some people and i still look up to people too much how do i overcome this first of all and the most important part is it is not your fault if a mother in any way rejects or acts like she doesn't want her own child there is something wrong with her not you this can also be very damaging because as a baby you like all babies are dependent on your mother to give you all the things that you need and if she doesn't meet your needs you will grow up feeling unwanted insecure and have low self esteem the mothers role is also to teach you unconditional love which is your foundation which teaches you how to loved trust and be confident i know this subject very well because my mom resented me so she neglected me and i felt unwanted loved growing up there also is you are probably more intelligent with a more advanced spirituality which puts you on a much deeper level than your mom could ever understand this is becoming more common recently the younger generations are a lot smarter which is making the older generations feel threatened and sometimes competitive you are looking for the motherly love that your mother couldn't give you and you are wanting to have all that you missed out on i hope your mother doesn't spank you or i prefer to not give it a cutesy name it is abuse and is very harmful to your self esteem confidence and just your sense of who you are i have had a lot to get over as i basically said most of my experiences just now and you can heal from this i know it seems hard and it can be too but if you want to overcome this you can you are not alone and like i said i have been seeing this a lot lately and if you ever need someone to talk to you can e mail me i am also very sorry that this has happened to you and it feels bad right now but you can improve how you feel it is not permanent and again none of it is ever ever your fault just out of curiosity has she put you on medications yet mine did when i was puberty is best treated with and needs psych meds not really they just keep doing that i tried almost everyone and it took about eight years to do that only to find that happiness does not come in a pill it is already in you your mother just buried it with her selfishness and lack of parenting skills this is not a mental disorder that you have maybe your mom's but definitely not yours pills wont help you and i really hope you are not on them because they also can make you feel worse in your situation if life is full of ups and downs and you are surviving these down times then the good part is coming soon be strong as you are there is more than this that will be your life and it will get better so hang in there Narcissism Transsexuality Theory of conduct Sant Thakar Singh Infantilism Pitaten Reparative therapy Anorexia nervosa Ex-gay Adoption Clinical depression Alignment (role-playing games) Charmed Transactional analysis Evil Scientology beliefs and practices Pedophilia Dissociative identity disorder Alcoholics Anonymous Milton H.
