i feel like i haven't achieved anything im and i was just browsing on face book and i came across lots of old school mates well most of them are either married have kids or both im not a fan of children and dont believe in settling down to early not to mention my relationships never last long cause i keep meeting idiots but i feel like they are making something of their lives and im not i do have a diploma in child care and education and almost a bsc hons in diagnostic radiography and imaging i think a career is far more important than anything else so why do i feel like this some factors i'd like you to consider think of it this way and you might see everything you've achieved you are very well qualified once you decide to have a family you can provide for them better than anyone else and will most likely have a great job that you'll like going to every morning b c you haven't compromised that you have a diploma in child care meaning you will be quite prepared and qualified to take care of your children when you have them you are young only you have plenty of time for marriage and children besides you're almost done your degree so you'll have more time to focus on your social and romantic life now you can now relax and take all the time you need in finding the right person for you b c you don't have pressures of school and that won't take away from your relationship as far as i can see you've made some pretty good decisions in the past and you'll be a happier person for them whoever said it was necessary to be married with kids by everyone is different and bases their life's choices on what is more important and valuable to them stop worrying about what other people will think of you and what they value look to yourself and see you're already on a very good path good luck in all your future endeavours and take care Social rule Goodness and value theory Laura Schlessinger Sexual orientation Polyamory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kodocha Theory of conduct Master's degree Asperger syndrome Education in Portugal Pitaten Education in Germany Current teachings of Prem Rawat Interracial couple The Amazing Race Social work Medicine Pedophilia The Critic Hillary Rodham Clinton The O.C.
