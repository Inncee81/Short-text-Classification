why do some people feel hot while others feel cold why do some people think a certain environment is comfortable while others think it is too hot too cold too humid too thin too dry etc i dont believe that its because they grew up int hat environment if this were true then i wouldnt complain so much about it being too hot i say this all the time even in winter i live in missouri and have lived in missouri all my life all the places i have lived have been within miles of each other my question is why do some people think that its too hot while others think its too cold that's the joy of being warm blooded we make our own heat and that's not the same for every person also it depends on factors of the individual person if someone was just outside in the heat and came into an air conditioned room they would find it quite comfortable but if someone else just came from another air conditioned room they might think it's cold Sauna Thermoregulation Hyperthermia Urban heat island Water Menstrual cup Climate of the United Kingdom Hot air balloon Solar power Severe weather terminology (United States) Diving suit Lighting Heat index Common cold Heat Weather lore K__ppen climate classification Manchuria Drowning Welding Warm-blooded Heat exchanger Coffee Tea Autonomous building Renewable energy Carbon dioxide Desert Ocean thermal energy conversion Anticyclone Sento Weather front Energy development Insulation Water vapor Hypothermia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spark plug Biome Ozone depletion Sea level rise Geography of Spain Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Houseplant Miami, Florida Reading spark plugs for racing Fire fighting Global warming and agriculture Ecology of Hong Kong Thermostat Swamp cooler Tropical cyclone Mirror Damn Yankees Mercury Atlas 6 Motor oil Bird migration Carnivorous plant Wind power Geography of Japan Cuisine of Denmark Ozone hole Global climate model Wind Japanese tea ceremony Geography of Bolivia Garlic Firestorm Sea ice Asthma Rosacea Meal Brewery Mattress Upholstery Langmuir probe Metallurgy Soup Bread Wind chill Continental climate Central heating Thermal power station Fog GED Steam engine Cannabis (drug) Climate of India Tbilisi Autism Ecology Changeroom Mummy Terraforming National Weather Service El Ni__o Chicago Heat Wave of 1995
