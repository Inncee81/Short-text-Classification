i have been with this guy for months now he' perfect in so many ways but he hits himself horribly hard when i don't do ehst he thinks i should do this behavior is horrible to watch and it'd disturbing he hit his head so hard tonight that i thought he might knock his down self out no he is not on alcohol or drugs he just can't control hitting hisself aand each time he does this he tells me that he is sorry hid behavor is depressing me and making me feel really sad because i just can't please him in very single way but he would like me to be just like him perfect i'm far from that and this is hard what would you do to make this whole thing better i'm really confused and sad because tonight we was going to go somewhere but he started hitting hisself because he got mad at me over one thing that he does not like for me to so he hit himself i am afraid that he could hurt his self and the police could blame it on me for something he does to hisself what can i do i really do love him so it seems i am in a fix god bless everyone and thanks i don't know how old your boyfriend is but he may have adhd or at least lots of pent up anger that he doesn't know how to deal with if he is taking it out on himself that is bad but if someday he takes it out on you that is even worse i think you need to encourage don't force him to maybe see a therapist for his anger issues he will be happier and so will your relationship with him if he doesn't do anything about it he runs the risk of possibley developing depression if he isn't already and or becoming substance dependant another that needs to change is the idea that you need to be perfect for him or anyone else at that if he requires perfection from you to make him happy i hate to say it but your relationship will not work out in the long run if it is you that thinks you need to be perfect you will sadly fall short of your own expectation time and time again because no one is capable of being perfect you need to embrace who you are the good and the bad and accept it and apply realistic changes to your life if necessary i hope my advice will help the both of you and make your relationship flourish EastEnders Theory of conduct Sin City Dead Like Me Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theodicy Ranma __ characters Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Goodness and value theory One Tree Hill (TV series) Borderline personality disorder Extreme Programming Pitaten Force (Star Wars) The Smoking Room Alcoholics Anonymous Kodocha Phoebe Halliwell Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Addiction Traumatic incident reduction The Smashing Pumpkins Psychotherapy Drug addiction Milton H.
