i've been called a geek and nerd a lot over the years and i get treated like a pariah i need some help to make this simple i have since childhood been called a geek and nerd many times but i sit as quiet as when i accept this aquicesce i am mentally challenged enough as it is when except children in my class teenagers harrass me and have given me the insulting name of a pariah nerd or geek or whatever slang term name that fits their needs i have given up a lot of my time to fit in with them but it has failed miserably i then and now am finding out that i have aspergers syndrome which makes it even more difficult in social situations such as the likes of small talk due to my insufficent level of self esteem i gave up on the things i love such as mathematics and other such sciences can you please help me get my game back and give me some advice on how to maintain my self esteem when in my childhood i had plenty of the sweet stuff since i never fitted in with people i lost many of my talents i regret that i used to feel powerful now weak to give you an idea of this i stopped doing mathematics which caused me to slip back to the second best class in stead of first class my vocabulary it was wide and huge in dialect has turned nothing more but common blabber i have these huge words in my brain but i can't seem to construct the words intop bridges of communication i am and left feeking suicidal i regret all of the decisions i made just for the sake of fitting in i was never accepted now everything seems black i don't know what to do thank you to all you people i will saty in touch okay you're being listened to and i want you to know you cared about even though we are strangers to you first of all i would really suggest getting in touch will a professional like a counsellor referal from your doc i've been there and this will initially take the pressure off you and give you somewhere to take this despair there are so many levels to this but the main one i can think of is that the people we are in relation to in life 'mirror' our relationship we have with ourselves believe me when you get your self esteem and self worth in check the comments these people make won't even touch you anymore and you'll wonder why they used to have such power over you i promise you this you cannot lose you talents either they are a part of who you are and will always be there you've hit a bump in the road and the positive side of these feelings i know this sounds weird when your world seems black is that you've had enough and are looking for another way which is going to be better than all the crap you've had up until now you are being forced to have a better relationship with yourself and to look at deeply held beliefs about who you think you are which is whole and complete by the way this can only be a good thing even though it is very painful right now you said yourself a number of times about 'trying to fit in' well hey guess what you figured out that being yourself is the best way to be and paradoxically when you relax and accept yourself exactly as you are you won't be able to stop the stampeed of people wanting to be around you if you need to talk to anyone please feel free to email me my name is sarah and i am yrs old i am training to be a counsellor and have been through a similar experiences in the past myself not that i know how you feel i guarantee you are going to get through this tell your family friends doctor counsellor the universe that you are finding things tough and the moment and need support you probably don't realise how many people are behind you now ready to hold you up until you can begin again confident in who you are remember the world isn't complete without you the circle gets broken if you're not about you're part of the future don't let anyone bring you down remember also that they are in a lot of pain and only get to feel okay by bringing vulnerable people down bullying so that they feel worthful themselves let me know how you are sarah lawton Nerd Social rule Autism Asperger syndrome Controversies in autism Stuttering Geek Piccolo Junior Saga Poker jargon Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Transactional analysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Kodocha Hikikomori Shit Little Britain Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Undergrads Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders American and British English differences Friends Jon Secada Milton H.
