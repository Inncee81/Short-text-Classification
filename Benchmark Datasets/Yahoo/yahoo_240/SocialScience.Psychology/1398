i have a question about drug addiction my husband is a drug addict i dont know what to do ive tried hiding them but he puts me down about other things i have done he even said he felt he was too good for me because my family is disfunctional my sister was raped as a child and so was i so the disfunctional family bit was not my fault but any time i get close to the subject of taking away his fix he goes insane and begins to verbally abuse me i am constantly searching for his love i try to forget about mentioning drug abuse to him so we can somehow fix our disfunctional relationship but he is gone emotially and acts like he is dead toward me altogether he allowes me to give him oral sex but when he is through he just say's thank's that was good and rolls over to go to sleep i have reciently given up and am begining to accept the constant drug abuse i even started to help him get drugs thinking it would bring us together again but he still stayes as far away from me as possible first your family is not dysfunctional because you and your sister were raped get that out of your thoughts and feelings right now addiction is a complex issue involving physiological and psychological issues you don't say what specifically he is addicted to so i'll address addiction in general addiction hijacks the pleasure reward centers of the brain by giving undeserved reward responses to the drug this happens in a very primitive part that is quite stupid where ego instinct and emotion reside as well there is no rational thought here and no control either there is only need and satisfaction this part of the brain will seek to control the rational cognitive part in order to achieve its goal of satisfying its need get the fix for the addiction it will cause the ego to distort the person's sense of self worth often by causing them to put down others it will do whatever it needs to do to get the fix which becomes the most important thing it will also twist truth and reality in order to justify its existence the only way he will ever accept help is to admit he has a problem he has to want it for himself until that happens anything you do to steer him from his drug of addiction will cause him to rebel against you as he has been doing i'm not going to say leave him or stay with him but i do advise you take a close hard look at your relationship it could be a long difficult road to travel seek counseling closer to you people who truly care for you not necessarily friends or family who are more readily available and qualified than what you may find here there are also support groups available on line where you can gain understanding from others who are going through what you are that really helps Drug addiction Addiction Drug abuse Transactional analysis Social psychology Motivation Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis A Course In Miracles Clinical depression Religion Autism Human Mind control Alcoholics Anonymous Happiness Arguments for and against drug prohibition Borderline personality disorder Divorce Transsexuality Philosophy of language Psychology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Goodness and value theory Domestic violence Neuro-linguistic programming Epistemology Child sexuality Methamphetamine Sexual orientation Hypnosis Abortion debate Rat Park Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Second language acquisition Psychotherapy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Traumatic brain injury Rape Sadism and masochism Psychosis Altruism Social rule Theodicy Serial killer Days of our Lives EastEnders Friedrich Schleiermacher Laura Schlessinger Orgasm Reparative therapy Alcoholism Carl Jung Human sexual behavior LSD Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Summa Theologiae Neighbours Sexual dysfunction Science Meditation Determinism Procrastination Simone Weil Nicomachean Ethics Contract Consciousness Traumatic incident reduction History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Peter Singer Psychology of religion Child sexual abuse Polyamory Theory of conduct Self-harm Vernon Schillinger Gestalt therapy Plame affair Post-traumatic stress disorder Love Medicine Bipolar disorder Same-sex marriage Anselm of Canterbury Consensual crime Soul Anxiety Out-of-body experience Mental illness Phaedo Zoophilia Scientific method
