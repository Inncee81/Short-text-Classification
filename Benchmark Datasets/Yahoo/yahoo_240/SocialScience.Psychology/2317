dream of tigers we were handling tigers at a zoo and we were sort of teasing them but not really anyway we wanted them to look skinnier so we sheared them and made them do stupid tricks like dog obstacles at dog shows because we wanted them to lose pounds it was obvious the tigers felt angry they looked fierce and also felt degraded people said if the muzzles which weren't tied on so tight came off the tigers would attack one girl who handled a tiger me felt scared but she kept on leading the tiger through the obstacles she didn't really have a choice because she didn't know where to bring the tiger if she got tired and didn't want to work anymore and she couldn't quit her job so she just walked the fierce tiger around on the leash scared that at any moment it could attack but also making sure to try and look calm and collected people would stop and talk to her like the tiger was not a big threat and she never said she was scared does anyone know what this can mean you may just be ruminating about the possible repercussions of your attempts to control others in your peer group you may find it enjoyable to manipulate others on a whim but upon reflection you realize that you are engaging in behavior which is in reality not acceptable to your true self Shaggy dog story Skinny Puppy EastEnders The Contender (television series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Eddie Guerrero Children of Dune Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) K' Characters of Naruto One Piece minor characters Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Kim Possible Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.
