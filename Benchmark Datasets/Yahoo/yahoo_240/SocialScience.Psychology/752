get her back possible to get back together my girl broke up with me last sunday because she wanted me to see that i could be happy without her she basically got tired of me complaining about alot of things going on in my life and i can see now where i went wrong at first i told her how much i loved her and how i didn't think we could just be friends i didn't keep doing that though i decided to go along with her wish she changed her status on myspace and facebook to single i changed mine to that too but then to divorced and then she changed hers on myspace to divorced as well on friday we hung out we went out to eat went to the park and went to a movie i paid for it all i made a joke at dinner just minutes into our date and she said she can't help being sexually attracted to me at the end of the night i told her i loved her and wanted her to be happy she said she loved me i hugged her and then i left we have been talking just about everyday through either email or phone and she even said that sh additional details seconds ago she wanted to continue our meeting at the park some night i've been talking to her everyday and even last night i said something along the lines of i don't think i was given a fair chance she said something like i'm just watching you right now i don't know what to think if i should put the moves on her next time or what we were together for almost years seconds ago i know for a fact that she had a good time on friday she kept talking about other things she wants to do together does this sound like someone that might eventually want to get back with me it sounds like she's playing some really pointless games and that she's lucky you're so into her because a lot of guys would have taken this break up and ran with it you'll get her back hell what am i saying it seems to me that you already have her back Friends EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show The Emancipation of Mimi Avenue Q Knots Landing The Star Wars Holiday Special Nine Inch Nails Pitaten Marilyn Monroe Ex-gay The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fiddler on the Roof 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Hey Jude Kodocha Fancy Crane Sin City Bon Jovi Conker's Bad Fur Day Garfield Time Out of Mind Extras (sitcom) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
