what to do to be less shy how does somebody overcome shyness any advice i used to be terribly shy i did not have any friends in school i wouldn't raise my hand in class if i had to give a speech or presentation my whole body would tremble and i would turn red and sweat but once i got my job working in a fast food restaurant i started to over come my shyness a little bit while i was working i was forced to make friendships with my co workers because we worked so closely and i was also forced to talk to strangers once i started working at the register at first i dreaded it i did not want to talk to people i didn't know and it felt like torture but after a few months i was more comfortable with it a few years later i got a job as a veterinariy technician and i was forced through my job to actually sit down and talk to a stranger one on one this was my biggest fear and at first i was terrible at it i couldn't give eye contact i felt so uncomfortable but i have been at this job for a little over a year now and i am no longer shy at all after being forced to talk to strangers for so long it is no big deal anymore i am actually starting to enjoy talking to people and i look forward to it my mom always told me that i would eventually grow out of my shyness i didn't believe her but she was right i am not super outgoing i am still kind of quiet by nature but i am definitely not shy anymore i feel sooo much better i don't have so much anxiety anymore i don't know how old you are but maybe you can try getting a job that forces you to talk to people it is going to feel like torture at first but it really help you get over your shyness good luck and be patient Shaggy dog story Shyness Social rule W.I.T.C.H.
