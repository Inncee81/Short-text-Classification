have you ever saved somebody's life i want to know if you have ever saved a persons life and i would like to hear how you did it and how you felt afterwards i saved a guys life months ago at work i was called to a brawl outside a nightclub where a number of males were fighting some how the bouncers at the club thought it would be a good idea to let people outside with bottles during the fight and some ended up in the brawl knowing the sort of bar it was i knew that there was a good chance that some of the guys would be carrying knifes so i hung around the out sides of the main brawl rather than running in the middle to cop a knife in the back breaking up small one on ones i noticed guys well outside the main fight area and went to check on it when i got there i saw this long haired freak hit the other guy who then dropped like a sack cut badly on the cheek it was then i saw a bottle in the long haired guys hand and he was raising it to stab this guy on the ground again so i came up from behind and grabbed this guys wrist and jerked him around to put myself in between long hair and the bleeding cheek guy i told the long haired guy to drop the bottle twice i'm not about to grab a bottle out of someones hand who's still got it cocked while still holding his wrist i got lucky when he did drop it my buddies showed up i was getting to the stage where i'd cocked a fist and was about to see if i could k o him not a bright move but it would have been my only option if it was one on one but it was the longest wait ever staring into this guys eyes i saw no remorse for what he'd done and i saw the twitches as he looked at my body position and how i'd set my hands looking for an opportunity to break free i was lucky one of the guys i was working with wasn't he won't be back at work for a while he was stabbed in the hand going the same thing Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Inside Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling aerial techniques Piccolo Junior Saga EastEnders Sin City Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Tag Kill Bill Archery StarCraft: Uprising Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass Blood Simple Miss Saigon Buddy Guy Boxing Swingout Jon Secada Leon White Meat Loaf Professional wrestling slang Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Escape from New York Mixed martial arts One Piece minor characters Carpal tunnel syndrome Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Indianapolis 500 Gesture Suplex Platoon (film) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Volleyball Piledriver (professional wrestling) Akuma (Street Fighter) Great Teacher Onizuka Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Collateral (film) Tekken characters Friends Little Britain The Contender (television series) Scenes from a Memory Humphrey Bogart Sub-Zero Pitaten Brian Close Family Guy Hey Jude Horizontal bar Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Perry Satullo Equine conformation Phoebe Halliwell Kasparov versus The World Ben Johnson (athlete) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man The Catcher in the Rye Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Battle of Cut Knife International League Textile manufacturing Teen Girl Squad Wound Samurai Deeper Kyo Types of bowlers in cricket Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma She Loves You Ty Cobb Softball Suicide methods Milton H.
