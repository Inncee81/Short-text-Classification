insurance settlement check who gets the insurance check my son myself of split it i bought my yr old son a great used car which his step brother smashed into this is the third used car i've bought my son the neighbor smashed into the first one while parked the second one died soon after it was purchased i'm a single parent and disabled so it's very helpful for my son to get around on his own his dad doesn't help much we really wanted to keep the car though we have to get a salvage title which will make it difficult to ever sell the only other choice was to give it up to the ins co and try to find another really good used car for little money we chose to keep the car and the insurance co paid us a lot more than we thought i bought the car and it's in my name i had been thinking about changing it into my son's since he turned my son did have the oil changed put a new tire on and paid recently to have a brake job on the car so he did keep it up some what's fair i suggest that you give the car to your son with no strings attached at his age he is going to make mistakes and learn quickly from them allow him that freedom to feel independence and and worthiness without any caveats or promises of retribution for bad behavior if you give him the opportunity to make you proud he just may do it Microeconomics EastEnders Blackjack Poker jargon Knots Landing Health insurance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insurance The Amazing Race 2000 Australian Grand Prix Supply and demand Warren Buffett Monopoly (game) Procrastination Tire Inflation Life insurance Mutual fund Predatory lending Citigroup Friends German car number plates Table tennis Wal-Mart Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Escape from New York Unemployment About a Boy Contract Auto insurance Automobile Emperor Guangwu of Han Good Times U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Dodge Charger Bulk vending Charmed Estoppel Shaggy dog story Best Buy Buffer overflow Initial D One Tree Hill (TV series) Adverse selection Marilyn Monroe Ocean's Twelve Freeters Security (finance) Annuity Internet fraud Great Depression R46 (New York City Subway car) Babe Ruth Toyota MR2 Liberalism Collision detection Lex Luthor Grandview, U.S.A.
