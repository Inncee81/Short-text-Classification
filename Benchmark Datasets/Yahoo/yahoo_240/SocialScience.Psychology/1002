about dreams see details someone else's question prompted me to ask about this the question was do we dream in colour or black and white my response included an answer to this but i felt the need to apologize because i gave details that stretched beyond the specific topic the first details is my response to the above question do we dream in colour or black and white and the second details is my question i'm a very interesting dreamer i have dreams that are both in color and b w i also have dreams which are in b w and just one color and dreams which are b w and a few colors sometimes they look real sometimes they look foggy and sometimes they look like television like i'm watching t v i have both good dreams and bad dreams some of my dreams are of the past some of them actually foretell what's going to happen which is quite obvious to me when events that i've dreamt do indeed occur and some of them make absolutely no sense i've heard it said that dreams don't last very long however i have filled entire notebooks by recording just one single dream i often awaken with physical sensations and symptoms that are the results of the occurances in the dreams i've had for example believe it or not i've awakened with excruciating pain and vaginal bleeding after having had nightmares of being raped i also experience lucid dreaming in other words i experience dreaming with consciousness when i lucidly dream i am often able to control what happens in my dreams although not always and there are even times when i can dictate what my dreams will be about sometimes entirely and sometimes only certain content there are also instances in which i can ''pick up where i left off'' after i awaken and then return to slumber i have no explanation for any of the above i've studied a bit of psychology but not much about dreaming i apologize for venturing away from the specific topic sorry i didn't remember the short character limit finally to my question my question i'm just curious about what everyone thinks of what i experience as i said in my response to the poster's question i'm not educated about dreams and i'm not asking about a specific dream related subject i simply want to know your thoughts so what do you all think i'm not asking for professional opinions although they are definitely welcome i'm just a curious dreamer thanks try the site www dreammoods com they have a dream dictionary along with common dreams and other explainations having to do with this it is the most detailed and reliable site i have found i use it often i was reoccuring dreams that were terrifying i thought maybe if i interpreted them and gained an understanding as to why i was having them they would stop and they did dreams often use symbolism so what you think your dream may mean may actually turn out to be something completely different nonetheless it is very interesting Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Consciousness Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophy of language A Course In Miracles Traumatic incident reduction Artificial consciousness Milton H.
