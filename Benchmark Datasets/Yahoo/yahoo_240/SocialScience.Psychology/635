how do you get over the feeling of being screwed by being screwed i mean feeling hopeless my main concern is knowing what i'm going to do for a living income for the rest of my life to sustain health and happiness within ourselves we have to deliberately formulate healthy perspectives hopelessness is not a healthy perspective and will weaken you separate the two issues for a moment one issue is the shark tank the other issue is our perspective of the shark tank the truth of the matter is all lifeforms are sort of swirling around in an ocean of push and shove all seeking energy to consume in order to live no matter what anyone says about altruism or goodness or sharing or getting along with each other the truth always remains that everything instinctively feeds on whatever it can get away with chewing on as my father wisely says everything's just trying to make a living humans form an agreement called a social contract that's a kinda sorta truce as you know well it's an uneasy truce but the rise of humanity has been upon that truce we learn and live and evolve and rise in fits and spurts toward less predatorial behaviors within our own species it is wise to remember that no one really likes the shark tank it really is a matter of everyone's just trying to make a living in this ocean of life and within the rise of our species' social contract some of us evolve as individuals to be less animalistic less predatorial but again as you know well most people do not rise very far above animalistic fear and greed and violent theft of other's energy below is a link to maslow's heirarchy of human needs human societies rise through those stages and every human has to rise up through those same stages most usually individual achievement in that ascension is less than the loftier achievements of society itself sometimes not though when our societies tolerate wide spread wanton plunder as does our current republican paradigm in power with an exploitation of workers and families and children and the elderly and such to make a buck the contrast between an individual's loftier stage of maslow's needs against the more predatorial less developed stage which that society is functioning within can be disheartening and make us feel hopeless it's important not to feel hopeless though because when the sharks smell blood they attack more brazenly the trick is to remain steady within yourself balanced positive don't let yourself get down don't let the sharks smell your blood or the animals will feed off you and call it capitalism or survival of the fittest avoid predators bolster your own advantages stay low don't stick your head up unless you're stronger than the fish around you empower yourself methodically with education savings and a steady heart it's not all a struggle but you have to try you have to rise enough to be able to kick the dogs off when they slobber around your ankles so to say if you sit in the woods long enough something's going to start gnawing on you bugs bacteria pickpockets republicans and other such vultures so stay on your feet as best as you can keep moving and keep your eyes open don't ever give up the sharks tend to be profoundly fearful and weak themselves their power is false brutal predatorialship is unhealthy for socieities and always causes trouble and collapse so be prepared in the face of true wisdom and health predators tuck tail and leave you alone http www union umd edu gh basic needs images maslows hierarchy jpg Ethics Ecology Shark Dog Animal communication Human Motivation Gray Wolf Economic inequality Beetle Organic farming Alignment (role-playing games) Tai Chi Chuan Spider The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Coercion Equine conformation Hamster Domestic rabbit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mosquito Religion Simone Weil Altruism State Aikido Force (Star Wars) Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Kashrut Biology Shrimp farm Anarcho-primitivism Strategic management Democracy Poverty Medicine Physical attractiveness Libertarian socialism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Anarchism Libertarianism Economics Psychology Philosophy of language Social psychology Political economy Sociocultural evolution Free trade Sociobiology Cat Chess strategy and tactics Social justice Conservatism Ten Commandments Biodiversity Aerial (dance move) Unemployment Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Postmodernism Overpopulation Science Evolution Protoss Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dairy EastEnders Life Dog training Social rule Jean-Jacques Rousseau Food Scientology beliefs and practices Patriotism Vietnam War Guinea pig Psychotherapy Human nature Health insurance Animal rights Communitarianism Whale Black (people) Microeconomics Action potential Meme Antarctic krill Law of value Evil Cultural relativism Weight training Tooth Ethology Community
