if a person cannot express any feelings or needs whats wrong my wife never told me her feelings or expressed her needs i thought she was happy until she ran off with a coworker after years together my friends told me that surely she talked to you about not being happy and no she never did its like she internally exploded and is rebelling against me what gives your expression rebelling against me is curious it's really difficult to understand why your wife was not communicating with you either she did not feel that she could or she didn't think it would have a good result or perhaps she had feelings for someone else and she had decided she didn't care for you enough to avoid acting on it i'm sorry she didn't try unless there was some reason to be afraid of you which i certainty don't think is the case i think she should have communicated if you think she had a lot of resentment about something that she internally exploded then you must have some idea that something happened that you think she had resentments about so i'm not excusing her but i would recommend that you consult with a psychologist who can help you to examine what might have been your role i certainly respect your willingness to explore this i think doing so will help to insure your future happiness in a new relationship there are a lot of wonderful women out there who need a loving partner so once you have recovered from this terrible betrayal and loss know that you can have the power to make another human beings dream come true which is truely the best way to find your own happiness god bless Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Shaggy dog story Free will Philosophical skepticism Goodness and value theory The Amber Spyglass Alcoholics Anonymous Plame affair Transsexuality Sant Thakar Singh Ethics Social rule Pitaten Avenue Q Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charmed K' Bernard Williams Carl Jung Summa Theologiae Miss Saigon Simone Weil Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Angel (vampire) Sexual orientation Insanity defense Rape Jean Grey Love Grandview, U.S.A.
