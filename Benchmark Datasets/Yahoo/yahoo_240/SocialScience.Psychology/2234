why are almost all people hypocrites people will tell you not to lie not to cheat not to steal not to do any of that stuff yet whenever you look closer at that person they always do the same thing to some sort of extent my mom tells me not to steal anything like any good parent should and just last week i saw her take a magazine off the shelf in the bookstore she works at she works there so no one questions her when she walks out without paying for anything i find that all people are like this to some extent i bet if i looked closer i would too to some extent i cant think of anything off the top of my head at the minute though my question is why people are so ready to make themselves look like they can give advice that they themselves dont follow and also if its possible for a person to go through life without being hypocritical by nature the only time stealing is ok is when you steal second base it was a magazine its not like she had to steal a turnip to feed her starving family society defines acceptable behavior many attempt to teach their children these mandates by living within the rules of conduct established by the culture over time because many fail to live up to society's lofty goals they can only resort to telling their children that they are a prime example of what not to do or they establish more detailed and restrictive rules of conduct that are almost impossible to abide by yes parents aren't perfect they make mistakes every day but for the most part they attempt to instill societal norms into their children in the manner that they can you can describe this conduct as being hypocritical i choose to describe it as teaching as best we can given our own limitations and imperfections and yes of course the magazine behavior is not acceptable behavior it was an unfortunate incident which i'm sure she now regrets but it was a learning experience from which you both can learn Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Socrates A Course In Miracles Marriage Polyamory Sexual orientation Value system Scientology beliefs and practices Science Gender role Abortion debate Infantilism Education Treaty Religion Child sexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Jehovah's Witnesses Extreme Programming Internet troll Goodness and value theory Education in the People's Republic of China Franz Boas Human nature Paradox Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Justification (theology) Vulcan (Star Trek) Autism Evil Ayyavazhi mythology Confucius Article One of the United States Constitution Microeconomics Coercion Human sexual behavior Appeal Abington School District v.
