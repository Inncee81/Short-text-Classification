how do you set boundaries with people i've been called easy b c ppl can get me to do things for them it makes me mad b c most of the time i'm only trying to help out of the goodness of my heart but it hurts that ppl think they get one over on me i don't do everything ppl want but for some reason ppl seem to push me to see what i'll do for instance this lady in my church grp always needs a ride sometimes i don't feel like going but i do just b c she needs a ride or if some ministry is asking for i'll give b c i feel bad for the ppl the ministry is helping it's like i've got a target on my forehead or something i wish i were stronger or tougher but i'm just such a ppl pleaser i know i need therapy but is there anything anyone can say to help me change it's basically a matter of considering your needs as well as those of others sure someone needs a ride money whatever but what does it cost you to give it to them your needs are just as legitimate as everyone else's and even more so to you since they're your needs it's not selfish when you consider your own needs it's only selfish when you actively harm people in doing so and no refusing a favor is not actively harming do the internal math when someone asks for a favor if it costs you very little to help them but really helps them a lot then maybe you should but if it involves going out of your way to do something that isn't particularly important in the scheme of things then it's okay to say no in fact it's always okay to say no and it's not necessarily easy for someone like you it's something you've got to practice at it'll become easy after a while but until then it'll take some effort Theory of conduct Gross domestic product Altruism Consensual crime Social rule Evil Inflation Goodness and value theory Prisoner's dilemma Coercion Free trade Autism rights movement Ex-gay Reparative therapy Utilitarianism Jon Secada Robert Maxwell Extreme Programming Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transactional analysis Theodicy Microeconomics Capitalism Precautionary principle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Separation of church and state Sant Thakar Singh Mothers Against Drunk Driving Economic inequality Equine conformation Rich Mullins Craps Evangelicalism W.
