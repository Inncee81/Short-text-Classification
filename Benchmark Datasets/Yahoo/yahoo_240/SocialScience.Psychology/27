please help me how on earth do i counter this i avoid anyone who might find me attractive i do it because i think that if he sees me up closer he might think that i'm too different looking or ugly or not really that good looking if you know what i mean i feel as though i can never live up to standards of other girls my own age i feel as though i am no competition whatsoever to them that makes me shy away from guys because i always think they are comparing me to other prettier girls i also have social anxiety which doesn't help a bit either i know it sounds ridiculous but that is the truth i absolutely hate feeling so unconfident about myself all the time oh and by the way i'm years old and i still feel this way am i hopeless please what can i do i often worry about not getting married later on because of the way i am even though i know i've still got a ways to go yet it just really bugs me help i have a friend who is like this still i didn't really notice it in her until she was about or so she is now and she is very afraid of commitment normally she is quite confident but in relationships it's like if it even seems it could be good it can't be true and she pushes them away this causes her to go for the less desirable guy rahter than the one she really wants i have seen a lot of changes in her and she has gotten better but i think it is something you have to face up front and one day at a time try taking things in baby steps and work first on yourself you may find it easier to feel confident about yourself if you work on yourself whether it is exercising a hobby etc focus on yourself and give yourself goals such as over the next months i am going to focus on whatever then in months i am going to focus on then set a time when you are going to actually look for a partner there is no sense going into a relationship if you don't feel that you can handle it and you are ready this way also you can gain some control over the situation and it may make you feel better Social rule Friends EastEnders Theory of conduct Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ranma __ characters Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Jean Grey Sex and the City W.I.T.C.H.
