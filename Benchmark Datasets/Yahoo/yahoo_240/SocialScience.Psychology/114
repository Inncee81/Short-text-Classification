how do i overcome this addiction to asking questions i initially began using yahoo to get help on some serious issues when i knew i couldn't discuss them with anyone i knew now it feels as if i've gotten into the addiction of asking questions on yahoo for the tiniest of things things i could probably figure out on my own but insist on asking the yahoo community i am just as addicted to other internet activities as well how do i overcome this co dependency or addiction i'm afraid at some point it might get so bad as to consume my life thanks don't you think it is kind of ironic to be asking yahoo how to not ask yahoo the word addiction has become quite a fad we seem to use it for almost anything but the most important criteria to ask yourself is whether this yahoo and other computer acivities have resulted in some dysfunction in other words hampered you or hurt you in your life socially vocationally financially etc etc in some significant way do you feel that you have missed out lost out on some opportunities wake up the next day with some regrete guilt etc if so it might be a problem but one of the major steps in overcoming this problem is the awareness that it is a problem you awareness suggests to me that there is no one better qualified to solve this problem than yourself if your not inclined to go cold turkey than i would suggest you try to answer questions for others rather than ask perhaps you would begin to feel the confidence in your capabilities that is erroded by your co dependency Addiction Philosophy of language Goodness and value theory Narcissism Sigmund Freud Autism Procrastination Drug addiction Sexual addiction Milton H.
