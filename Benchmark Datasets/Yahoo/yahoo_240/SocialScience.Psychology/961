how to sell a product that nobody wants to buy this is how i answered the exact same question when it was asked five days ago by shoppinggirls i would think the best way to do that would be to find a new use for it or some new context in which to present it that would give it some degree of desirability i don't now what this product is but amost anything has some uses and potential value beyond its originally intended purpose what else can this product do or what else can be done with it other than what it was originally designed for if nothing comes to mind then think about various modifications that could be made to it to adapt it for another more popular purpose if even that fails then i've got two and a half words for you tax write off it later occurred to me to add the idea try to find out exactly what it is about the product that makes it undesirable and see if that can be changed in some way Advertising Explosive material Arabic alphabet Grammatical mood Life insurance Extreme Programming Originalism Meaning of life Intelligent design Scientology Scientology beliefs and practices Microeconomics GNU General Public License Inflation GED U.S. Electoral College Sydney Riot of 1879 Species Political economy The writing of Principia Mathematica Intellectual property Quizbowl Fair use Illegal drug trade Family Feud Copyleft The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Anarchism and capitalism African American Vernacular English Propaganda Sexual orientation Heinkel He 100 Social rule Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Moonshine You Don't Know Jack Ken Jennings Coercion Article One of the United States Constitution English grammar $ale of the Century Democracy Perl G.I.
