drunk and getting raped and drunk and doing it with the girl difference i know that a woman can file rape charges if she was raped while drunk or under the influence of alcohol but what about the guy if he's drunk and he had sex with a girl he thinks wants it he'll be in deep trouble i mean both have been drinking both aren't thinking clear will the guy be forgiven a little at least for being under the influence when he had sex just like how the girl is given leniency for getting raped when she had been drinking i know people often ask you have a sister but i wanna say you have a brother coz what if that happened to your brother i think if you're drunk and you had sex then it's both parties fault anyway you have to be really really wasted for that to happen and getting that wasted is stupid enough i disagree i believe that if they are able to make the choice to drink then they should be responsible for the actions they make while under the influence what if you were raped while you and the other guy were intoxicated would you want his charges to be lessened because of this i sure as hell wouldn't Rape Sin City Humphrey Bogart Statutory rape The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct Can't Hardly Wait Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal 2005 trial of Michael Jackson EastEnders Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Married... with Children One Tree Hill (TV series) Ghastly's Ghastly Comic Social rule Driving under the influence Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Dead Like Me Drunk driving (United States) Knots Landing Serial killer Vernon Schillinger Trainspotting (novel) Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
