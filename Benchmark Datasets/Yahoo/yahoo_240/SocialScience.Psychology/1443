i have a theory my theory is that some people become pack rats hoarders because they are afraid that if they throw away specific items that they will forget about them the memories made with them i figured this out because i save stuff that could be completely meaningless but because i have had good memories with them i have to save them otherwise i will most likely forget about them i will probally forget about the memories i came up with a way that i can get rid of these things still remember them take pictures they last longer i wonder if there is a diganosis for this disorder i have if you think you suffer from this disorder too feel free to say so also what do you think about my theory thanks yeah everywhere i go i bring a camera with me so i can always remember everything lol my room is clean im not disorganized lol thanks guys you are very helpful yes i have once maybe ill whatch it again whats your point i definitely think your theory is correct it's funny because yesterday on rachael ray's tv show she was talking about cute ways to keep or preserve the memory of items that you should probably throw away check her website or maybe youtube for some ideas Theory of conduct Memento (film) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Sigmund Freud Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Cliff Richard Dream Memory Traumatic incident reduction Teen Girl Squad Obsessive-compulsive disorder B3ta Jon Secada Meaning Psychoanalysis Rich Mullins Rei Ayanami Social rule Dissociative identity disorder Mental illness Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Phoebe Halliwell Post-traumatic stress disorder Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina True Crime: Streets of LA Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Jude Collyer brothers LOL (Internet slang) Reincarnation Mojave people Blood (computer game) The Strangerhood Sleep Piccolo Junior Saga Undergrads Friends Transactional analysis Mnemonic Long-term memory G__del's incompleteness theorem Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Empire Burlesque Autism rights movement Philosophical Investigations Animal Crossing Stephen Hawking C plus plus False memory Shaggy dog story Pok__mon Live!
