little advice please what are teh most effective ways to solve problems does dream incubation really work gimme some other ways in which i can get solutions to my problems thanks i have seen little proof that dream incubation works as for problem solving it depends more on the individual than one set formula there are inherent flaws trying to solve things alone unless you possess the ability to extract yourself and view with an unbiased mind yet listening to others leaves you vulnerable to their prejudices and slant on problem solving what i would suggest is getting a number of opinions consider them with an open mind and then either select that which is best for you or base your solution on the best and your personal solution i have always approached any problem with not only an open mind but with the philosophy that there are at least solutions to every problem pick the obvious and then look for the other see which applies Combinatorics Theory of conduct Scientific method G__del's incompleteness theorem Mathematics Extreme Programming Human Philosophy of language Philosophy of mathematics Theodicy Numerical analysis Ethics Frame problem Expert system Capitalism Karen Horney Victor Cousin Public good Logic Platonic realism Collision detection Complexity classes P and NP Artificial consciousness Psychoanalysis Peer review Utilitarianism Karl Popper Scientology beliefs and practices Simone Weil Ordinary differential equation Second language acquisition Chess problem Ontological argument Dream Franz Boas Stoicism Technology Consciousness Cultural relativism Creativity Telepathy Philosophy Newton's identities Computer chess Leadership Computer security Karma Occam's Razor Computational complexity theory Abortion debate Genetic algorithm Epistemology Infinity Adjoint functors Bayesian inference Bertrand Russell Chess problem terminology Algorithm Dissociative identity disorder Mathematics of general relativity Linux Western philosophy NP-complete Human nature Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Demarcation problem Heuristic Halting problem Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mediation Internet troll Relativism Mach kernel Finite element method Externality A Course In Miracles Sigmund Freud Moral relativism Meaning Inflation Soul Sudoku Normal distribution Philosophy of space and time Prime number Baldness Action potential Gestalt therapy Existence of God Existence Trip distribution Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Art Decision making Interactive proof system Probability Reiki TRIZ
