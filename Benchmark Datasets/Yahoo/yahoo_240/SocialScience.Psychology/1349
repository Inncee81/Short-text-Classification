what should i do about this difficult person she acts like she's bipolar even though she isn't she takes people on emotional rollercoasters is self destructive and messes up her relatonships with everyone around her she is also an emotional manipulator she has anger management issues and blows up over small things and will sometimes get very stubborn when she wants to get her way she is frustrated easily and doesn't know how to express her feelings appropriately she doesn't know how to treat people properly she is very childish and difficult to deal with and disengaging from her is not really an option so any suggestions any way i could help her thanks she is also incredibly attention seeking it becomes difficult to deal with all her constant demands sounds like someone i know is she your boss or family member even if she is your boss you have rights of your own and you should do things within reason and don't break the law if she asks document everything and be sure you don't become a scapegoat if something goes wrong always try to protect yourself you just distance yourself from her and try to maintain a working relationship and not a personal one only communicate with her if it is a necessary part of your job if she's your family living in your house it may be a harder to avoid her however you must also learn to ignore her if she misbehaves if her temper flares leave her alone don't let her believe her tantrums are worth the attention you are not helping her by trying to meet her every demands realize that that is impossible and that by doing so you are only contributing to her ill treatment towards you if you don't work for her you must tell her you are not her servant and leave it at that or skip the subject to something else to talk about i assume she's part of your family since you want to help her it sounds wonderful but you need to think realistically is she ever appreciative of the things you do for her doesn't it just make her want to get angry at you even more when you do good deeds for her but you don't get it quite right like she wants you cannot teach her how to express her feelings appropriately you are not a mind reader stop feeling guilty and sorry for her or she will continue to verbally abuse and manipulate your emotions you need to be stronger and ignore your instincts to allow yourself to be taken on an emotional rollercoaster stop contributing to this irrational cycle get away from her tantrums if you can i know it hurts to see her this way but it isn't your fault that she is this way remember you cannot control her actions but you can control your own actions and how you respond to her when she misbehaves be wise and pre plan and prepare yourself when you know she's going to get upset you need to think about yourself and the rest of the people involved isn't it terrible to have to have to go through this again what can you do for her you can be sweet enough tell her ahead of time of things that might upset her so she is never surprised this is nice gesture you don't really have to do but who knows if she is ever appreciative however you cannot foresee everything that might go wrong you must stand up for yourself and don't allow yourself to be controlled if you really want to her to treat you right you must do this for yourself and at the same time you're helping her know that her actions are inappropriate the sooner she learns that she cannot manipulate people around her anymore the more likely she will improve her behaviour be aware that you cannot really control her actions or her feelings ignore her when she blows up at small things learn to give her big attention only when she behaves appropriately let her know that being cheerful and having a positive outlook is the way to go good luck Social rule Theory of conduct Anger management Asperger syndrome Fathers' rights Domestic violence Plame affair Autism Hulk (comics) EastEnders Tai Chi Chuan Nicomachean Ethics Spanking Dog training Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Procrastination Psychoanalysis Internet troll Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Clinical depression Friends Luck Shaggy dog story Karen Horney Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Great Teacher Onizuka Narcissism Poker jargon The Smoking Room Ranma __ characters Pok__mon Live!
