i'm looking for a somewhat positive way to confront a problem employee how can i make this work this woman is not well liked among her co workers and has a bad habit of trying to get others to do her job for her even though she is in no supervisory position just this month alone she has caused a temp not to come back to work for us and i had an employee come up to me and say he will not work with her again she gets defensive easily when you point out something wrong with what she is doing and quite frankly i'm ready to pull her full time status i don't want to come outright and do it i want to see if she will be willing to correct her ways what makes this difficult is that i can't stand this woman myself and would love nothing more than to fire her can i succeed where four other supervisors have failed as an employer you have the right to confront an employee with poor office etiquette which is sounds like she has you might want to consider preparing a quick list of duties that she is normally to perform and citing the times issues that she has pawned off on others though she has no authority to do so if it makes you more comfortable you can also speak with the others who have complained about this employee all of course in the privacy of your closed door office and let them know that the issue has been addressed this way the problem employee has been handled in the same fashion as the non problem employees if after this meeting she does not have a change of attitude or work habits hand her a pink slip and let her know that her services are no longer needed no one needs a disruptive office nor do they need to be unhappy coming into work good luck Plame affair Volleyball Heinkel He 112 Customs and etiquette of Japan Fast bowling Unemployment Friends Mojave people Coming of Age (TNG episode) Dog training Principal-agent problem Craps Call centre Equine conformation The Smoking Room Reservoir Dogs Public-key cryptography William the Silent Rick Santorum Mach kernel Graduate school Chess opening Menstrual cup Drug test Scientology beliefs and practices Computer security Japan Self-Defense Forces Pitaten Charles Peace 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Gender-neutral language The Death Gate Cycle Alexander Technique American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Sin City Ethics Battle of Jutland 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tennis Boxing Internal ballistics Password Whose Line Is It Anyway?
