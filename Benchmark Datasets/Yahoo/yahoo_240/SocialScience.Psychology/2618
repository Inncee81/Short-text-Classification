repeating dreams since lil kid dream am on checker board n no matter where i step devil pops up in front of me horns tail pitchfork red n all am yo now so approx yrs have it chases me all over board what's up with that serious question so serious answers pls t y it could be something you saw on tv when you were a small child and it made a big impression this is going to sound crazy but when i was very little maybe four years old or so i started having nightmares that all i could recall when i woke up was the images of a black pitchfork looking object and a black shovel in the dream they followed me around and they were ominous somehow scary when i got older i accidentally came across a big yellow book of my mother's it was about gardening and on the cover which was all yellow were the exact same images lol a black colored spade and a black colored three pronged garden hoe and when i saw this i immediately recognized these pictures from my nightmare i must have seen this book when i was little and for some strange reason those images had scared me after finding the book and making this discovery i no longer had the repetitive nightmare it's funny what makes an impression on us when we are little i imagine that if you saw a checkerboard in a cartoon perhaps when you were young you equated that with fond childhood games pleasant memories but then to see a devil pop up on the board might on a subconcious level be quite frightening to a small child devils aren't supposed to infiltrate memories of fond childhood games ideas memories childhood is a time of innocence we don't perceive the world around us in negative terms we are ignorant of the things that may be dangerous or ominous and when they appear it affects us deeply conciously and definitely subconciously however if you are looking for a more freudian explanation of your dream then perhaps it could be that the checkerboard represents your life and the moving around on the board represents different directions you are trying to take the devil popping up may represent your subconcious fears things you are afraid of happening at different points in your life with every major life shift of direction you take hope this answers your question lol i found this most interesting Satanic ritual abuse Philosophical skepticism Prank flash Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophy of perception Sigmund Freud Sinfest Dream Wassily Kandinsky The Giver W.I.T.C.H.
