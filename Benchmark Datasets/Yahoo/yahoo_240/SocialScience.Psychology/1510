mental healing does anybody here believe in the ability to heal ones self with the power of the mind are mental abilities real can i really bend a spoon with my mind or numb a part of my body so that it won't feel pain has anybody experience anything like this which is truly phenomenal i am not sure if you can heal yourself physically with your mind but a guy named james randi has set out to debunk these ideas such as bending spoons with thought http www randi org here is another source to find out about these things http www skepdic com however i have read stuff where if you leave things up to your subconscious mind or god as they call it then your subconscious mind will cause your body parts to make the right movements to somehow solve the problem you find yourself in the subconscious is not powerful enough to cure diseases or fix some things internally and i doubt if it has any effects on external items such as causing a spoon to bend which is what james randi tries to debunk however i might think that our subconscious mind might nudge us in the right direction to go to get the help that we need a real life example is when i was snowboarding for the first time and i was with someone i knew who i thought was more experienced than me we both went on the intermediate slope but it was too steep for me and the other guy i kept on falling down and crashing and something in me my subconscious or gut told me to go to the beginner slopes and my head even turned to look in the direction of the beginner slopes to learn how to snowboard before going to the intermediate slopes i ignored what my gut was telling me stayed on the steeper intermediate slopes and ended up not turning correctly while going down the slope crashing and landing on my left arm wrong and ended up overextending my left arm and messing it up i always to this day regretted not listening to my gut which was right i look at other incidents also in my life that weren't as bad and realize that if i had listened to my gut i would probably not have gotten into the problems that i did when i consciously ignored my gut i am not sure exactly what would have happened if i went with my gut instead because i didn't experience it but i am pretty sure it would have been better experience than when i went and ignored what my gut was telling me the advice i try to tell others and which i stick to now is to follow your gut heart because it usually if not always knows better than what you may consciously think is the right or best thing to say or do Milton H.
