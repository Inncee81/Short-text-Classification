why do guys always assume your interested if you smile at them can't a girl just be being friendly i believe it has to do with the way women are portrayed on the television if they see that women who are strangers to them smile and wave they are interested in that particular person is there something like a rule i should be aware of you have hit a live wire with this question bless your heart for asking it i think part of it is the television mtv country western video's and plethora of advertising that we are bombarded with that sends the unequivocal message if one gender or the other gives any sign other than a snotty snobbish rebuff it has to mean he she is interested how pathetic for us i friendly smile nod wave look is not a costly thing but they are rare rare for the reason you have noted the woman gets hit on for being 'friendly' and becomes cold and aloof but the guy also has an awkward situation too if he considers it 'just friendly' and it's more than that to not have made some advance is an approach avoidance conflict and to make an overture and get a huffy cold shoulder can leave him off balance as to what messages are being sent we all need help in developing some signals that help us feel connected yet not about to jump into the nearest bed i so hope that several people answer this superb question and get to thinking about how we can be less isolated especially in the u s of a don't know about u k etc but suspect it's the same or let's stick a cell phone in our ear and an ipod in our palm and 'pretend' that we are connected lol Social rule Humphrey Bogart Gender-neutral language Aerial (dance move) Mobile phone Madonna (entertainer) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Stuttering Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Theory of conduct The Cure Titanic (1997 film) Human sexual behavior Eye contact Current teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Shawn Michaels Social psychology Surveillance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Friends Transsexuality Chess strategy and tactics 50 Cent Big Brother (USA TV series) Undergrads Cybersex Prank flash Infantilism EastEnders Radio Marie Antoinette Music video Gender identity Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children About a Boy Emotions (album) Incarnations of Immortality MTV Propaganda George F.
