is there a cure for deep thinking as it has occured god has created me with many oddities some of them i can live with but others really tick me off and one is deep thinking i seem to put too much thought into many aspects of life and almost get to the point where i struggle so hard to almost put life into an equation and i really hate it because it emotionally drains me and secondly it causes me much stress and frustration it is sometimes uncontrollable as well is there any way to stop it or atleast limit it sometimes it's great to really think deeply but sometimes we just run round and round in our own little mental mazes like hamsters on those wheels they put in pet cages time to get out two things work for me one is running for real my brain is racing so i go out of the house and across the road to the park and try and get my body to catch up now i'm not very young and not very athletic so this can be a comical sight but if it makes passers by smile that's ok the main thing is even though i don't go fast just running gets my body into a rhythm where it shuts down the obsessive bits of my brain i'm usually out of breath after ten minutes but that's ok because i'm usually a lot calmer in eight the other thing i do is to sit up straight and be still shut my eyes and focus my brain on an image that makes me feel calm it'll probably be a different image for everyone maybe a great moment on a great day or a beautiful picture or the smile of someone you love or just something simple like the flame of a candle really see that image behind your eyelids look at it and let it fill your mind after a while you'll probably notice that your breathing has got slower and your muscles are not so tense i've been doing this for years and now it only takes a couple of minutes to get calm and focussed but at the start or if the stress is very bad it may take longer i hope this helps you your uniqueness and all the things that make you what you are are so precious your life is about learning to bring all those things into harmony so you can act on the positive things and balance the negative ones be happy Shaggy dog story Stuttering Eye Aikido Equine conformation The Death Gate Cycle Numerology Consciousness Urinary incontinence Meditation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Autism W.
