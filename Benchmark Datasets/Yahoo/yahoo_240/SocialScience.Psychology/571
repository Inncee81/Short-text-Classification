how do i learn to love music again i'm a singer guitarist in my late 's i've written and recorded my share of songs the score of a short film and done some live performance i know my theory and both write and improvise well my problem is this after ten years the magic is gone i've come to see music as pure math a graph of pitch vs time a set number of notes the human ear can differentiate that we musicians combine in an unlimited number of ways to influence human emotion we play a major chord progression with a fast beat and people feel happy minor chords to make you feel sad maybe some suspended chords for that open airy feel yes it's more complex than that but any musician who knows what he's doing can create other emotive patterns nostalgia frustration loneliness it's all just an equation for manipulating feelings i'm addicted to it but it feels fake i don't even enjoy listening to music anymore i just see patterns there's no divinity or joy in it anymore just numbers what should i do i recommend going back to classical music beginning with mozart through early th century these composers didn't write from the perspective you described they wrote from passion just listen to an entire symphony with your eyes closed with no intent to interpret or criticize just experience that surprise at the variations and developments in each movement Musical mode Tonality Music Heavy metal music Blues Classical music era Music genre Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Chord (music) Authentic performance Joseph Haydn Sonata (music) Romantic music Sonata form Herbie Hancock Timpani Symphony Sampling (music) Grunge music Serialism Blood on the Tracks Fugue Jazz Mathematics A Day in the Life King Crimson Musical terminology Pop punk Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) Time Out of Mind 20th century classical music Progressive rock Emotion Definition of music Musical notation Time signature Yes Charles Ives Atonality March (music) Beethoven's musical style and innovations Key (music) Figured bass Trombone Trey Anastasio Music theory Emotions (album) Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven) Folk music 10cc Baroque music Consonance and dissonance Music of Louisiana Anton Bruckner The Beatles The Emancipation of Mimi Johannes Brahms The Supremes Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven) Human Iggy Pop Music history of the United States Klezmer The Who Postmodern music Musical works of Mozart Double bass Vibrato Frank Zappa Well-Tempered Clavier Stuttering Ragtime Umphrey's McGee Charles Mingus Harmonica Rock (music) Marvin Gaye Modulation (music) Peter Gabriel Popular music Journey (band) Henry Cow John Cage Carnatic music Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Charlie Parker Lindy Hop Queen (band) Music history of the United States during the colonial era Power chord
