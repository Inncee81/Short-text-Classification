what is the difference if any between a psychopath and a sociopath the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath is somewhat blurred at least according to the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm dsm iv lists both definitions together under the heading of antisocial personalities because they share some common traits however some professionals maintain there is a difference beyond the similarities shared traits of the psychopath and sociopath include a complete disregard for the feelings and rights of others this usually surfaces by age and may be accompanied by cruelty to animals these traits are distinct and repetitive creating a pattern of misbehavior that goes beyond normal adolescent mischief both the psychopath and sociopath fail to feel remorse or guilt they appear to lack a conscience and are completely self serving they routinely disregard rules social mores and laws unmindful of putting themselves or others at risk of the more distinguishing traits some argue the sociopath to be less organized in his or her demeanor nervous and easily agitated someone likely living on the fringes of society without solid or consistent economic support a sociopath is more likely to spontaneously act out in inappropriate ways without thinking through the consequences conversely the psychopath tends to be extremely organized secretive and manipulative the outer personality is often charismatic and charming hiding the real person beneath though psychopaths do not feel for others they can mimic behaviors that make them appear normal upon meeting one would have more of a tendency to trust a psychopath than a sociopath because of the organized personality of the psychopath he or she might have a tendency to be better educated than the average sociopath who probably lacks the attentive skills to excel in school while psychopaths can fly under the radar of society many maintaining families and steady work a sociopath more often lacks the skills and drive for mimicking normal behavior making seemingly healthy relationships and a stable home less likely from a criminal standpoint a sociopath s crimes are typically disorganized and spontaneous while the psychopath s crimes are well planned out for this reason psychopaths are harder to catch than sociopaths as the sociopath is more apt to leave ample evidence in his or her explosions of violence hence while similar psychological traits might fall under the antisocial personality heading from a social and criminalist point of view the differences between a psychopath and a sociopath may be significant according to experts persons with a non criminal history can also display lesser or varying degrees of either personality type Evil Serial killer Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Drug abuse Personality disorder Psychosis Schizophrenia Mental illness Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Pedophilia Narcissism Rape Paraphilia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alignment (role-playing games) Addiction Mental Health Act 1983 Coercion Anorexia nervosa Controversies in autism Intelligence quotient Borderline personality disorder Hypoglycemia Sexual orientation Stuttering Domestic violence Infantilism Hikikomori Gender role Traumatic brain injury Hypnosis Narcissistic personality disorder Cult Drug addiction Dissociative identity disorder Child sexual abuse Childlove movement Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Human Zoophilia Political terrorism Capitalism Human height Divorce Substance abuse Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Abortion debate Personality psychology Second language acquisition Determinism Dog Sexual addiction Columbine High School massacre Crime Transsexuality Psychoanalysis Histrionic personality disorder Gender identity disorder Child sexuality Sadism and masochism Psychology Economic inequality Species Dyslexia Franz Boas Sigmund Freud Video game controversy Transgender Human nature Opposition to cults and new religious movements A Course In Miracles Cephalic disorder Transactional analysis Grief Abortion Strategic management Theodicy Sociocultural evolution Autism epidemic Autism rights movement Sexual abstinence Leadership Gun politics Fathers' rights Schizoid personality disorder Atheism Reparative therapy Homophobia Black (people)
