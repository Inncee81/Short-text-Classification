victims of sexual abuse someone i know its not me its just i choose not to name the person who is close to me was a victim of sexual abuse although they are an adult now they carry a lot of guilt and problems one thing i dont understand is they are still friendly although uncomfortable with the abuser her brother i have suggested that although its good to share things and that i am glad she's shared it with me that it'd be a great idea to share with her sister who will be supportive and has always been a solid figure throughout her life the brother himself was a victim of abuse whatever part of his brain should be saying that was wrong didnt work and so this woman at the age of was subjected to some horrible things any thoughts advice on how i can help her basically she was when this happened to her and she feels somehow its her fault but her brother was when it happened i really am having a hard time explaining to her she is not to blame just wanted to say these answers have been extremely helpful thank you and thank you the rest of you that added since helpful stuff this is a hard question to answer but i will try as i have been through a similar situation i wasn't but i was a teen when it happened it took me until i was an adult to even be able to tell anyone so your friend is already one step ahead of where i was she told you that's a good thing the first part of healing is admitting that it happened then she needs to know that she did nothing wrong and that it was not her fault i found that reinforcing the fact that she was brave enough to have a voice with regards to this was admirable and a strong indication to not only herself but those around her including many who have suffered the same fate but are afraid to speak speaks volumes about her inner strength she needs to know that her voice no matter her age works two fold it helps in the healing of herself and gives others the strength to come forward even the smallest voice should be heard try to make her understand that telling the proper authorities will get her brother help i find that most of the guilt comes from the fact that she felt helpless and fears that someone else may become victimized because nobody knew of the danger what helped me was to get a diary and start entering all my thoughts to put it on paper in a place that no one else will ever read it really helped me i wrote like crazy for a very long time but felt much better after i got it all out without interruption as she gets older she will learn to move on and when she is ready she needs to confront her abusser and get closure whether or not he is willing to accept the blame makes no difference she can get closure either way but she needs to get over the hard part of realizing she did nothing wrong and that it is not her fault in any way always give her your ear and hear with your heart try very hard not to cry she needs your strength there is no statue of limitation on rape which is essentially what her brother did she may need to get her closure by telling the police or the childrens aid social services to procecute him to get her closure it's all dependant on her but if she does that it will open it all up and she may not be ready for that yet so there is no rush give her time and just be there for her when she needs to talk and reinforce that it's not her fault she did nothing wrong it's his fault and she needs to stay as far away from him as possible until she is strong enough to deal with it i'm glad she has a friend like you that she trusts she has bestowed a very heavy trust in you be sure not to betray it or it will cause further damage this answer is being answered by two sisters that have been exposed to sexual abuse good luck to you and your friend it's a long road to heal but it is possible with help and time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcoholics Anonymous EastEnders Rape Pitaten A Course In Miracles One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Milton H.
