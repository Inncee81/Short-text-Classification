how can i improve attention in studies please guide me i have the same problem i'm studying for finals at this very moment actually my biggest problem is having the internet on my wireless laptop so after i finish replying to you i have to shut this thing off i get distracted by games a lot if you're going to study on your computer be sure to remove anything fun from it i find that music helps me at appropriate times just pick something that gives you energy i never really follow the lyrics anyway so it's not too distracting also doing little things like reviewing what you just learned after class helps which i fail to do because i'm a slacker i also keep a drink like water energy drink or juice with me and a simple snack that doesn't take much effort to eat like peanuts good luck Extreme Programming Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Diablo II: Lord of Destruction IBM PC compatible Meaning of life Fecal incontinence Bluetooth Social rule Windows XP Avenue Q Rum Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law Plastic Current teachings of Prem Rawat Vegeta Breakfast Theory of conduct Universal Serial Bus Cuisine of the Philippines Aerial (dance move) Ron Weasley Half-Life 2 Internet New England Patriots Norway national football team Floppy disk About a Boy Cro Amiga Power Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Procrastination Coming of Age (TNG episode) Marathon (sport) Mouse (computing) Kylie Minogue Fable (video game) The Critic Teen Girl Squad Karaoke Dim sum The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Garfield Tooth Azumanga Daioh It's Walky!
