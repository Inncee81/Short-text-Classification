to atheists if there is no god then how do you define what is right and wrong what rules do you follow just curious because as far as morality i don't think that an atheist would have a guide on how to act stay calm i don't want to offend anyone this is a good question and i hope i can help you understand that morality and religion are not tied together concretely i have an appreciation for humanity and the wonderful things that we can accomplish if we come together with good intentions if you can see another person as an individual as a person with desires and intentions with experience and very personal perceptions if you understand that many of us see the world in a completely different perspective then it is easy to appreciate others for thier uniqueness and inherent value what some people consider morality defined by god or by organized religion is actually part of a written and unwritten code of how we can all come together as a society and live together in peace some of us don't need these written rules because we live with this acknowledgement of individual rights as if it were incoded in our dna we automatically appreciate others without knowing them personally so treating them with respect and dignity is our automatic response to interactions with others this carries over to how we respond to the society in general the world the environment the universe we respect what is appreciate the all and acknowledge that we are one i don't need to be told how to treat other people when i was born with that knowledge Theory of conduct Simone Weil Supernatural Religion Morality Theodicy Sin Goodness and value theory God Utilitarianism Atheism Ethics Socrates Determinism Objectivist philosophy Black (people) Pashtunwali Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Friedrich Schleiermacher Same-sex marriage Meaning of life Free will Alcoholics Anonymous Value system Human nature Existence of God Alignment (role-playing games) Fundamentalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social justice S__ren Kierkegaard Predestination Abortion debate Deconstruction Evil Originalism John Howard Yoder Ten Commandments Sexual orientation Zoophilia Coercion Social psychology Religious Society of Friends Religious pluralism Causality Moral relativism Cultural relativism A Course In Miracles Immanuel Kant Separation of church and state Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Argument from morality Universal pragmatics Conscience New Testament Jewish views of religious pluralism Confucius Social rule Religion and sexual orientation Ontological argument Altruism Bernard Williams Property (ownership right) Roman Catholic Church Autism rights movement Religion and sexuality Peter Singer God Emperor of Dune Economics Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Human sexual behavior Satanism Nicomachean Ethics Transcendental argument for the existence of God Childlove movement Christianity Homosexuality and Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Jewish philosophy Psychology of religion Hinduism Asperger syndrome Creation-evolution controversy Summa Theologiae Current teachings of Prem Rawat Evolutionary creationism Ishmael (novel)
