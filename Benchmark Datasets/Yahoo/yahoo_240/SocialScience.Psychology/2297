i have a fear of rejection i cant figure out how to crack it i do not have low confidence i can talk to girls easily if the barrier between us has been broken i am comfortable with myself the majority of the time i am also happy most of the time and i really dont take things too seriously however i am shy although i have fooled one girl i am in a psychology class so i plan to ask a girl for her phone number or to talk some girl for the first time and i get all excited but when the time comes the idea leaves my mind or i just get nervous and later i feel as though i have let myself down the most dominant reason is that i have a fear of redness i have rosacea i guess the rosacea side of me that has all of the qualities i do not like is scarred i have had bad experiences and it seems not to matter that i try to improve myself confidence and self esteem all the time by always visualizing things and being positive with myself i guess i am afraid of falling into weakness that is how i perceive it this will sound like a kind of crazy answer but take what works for you and discard the rest of it so long as you are dependent on others to make life choices happiness for you you will have this fear it's as though you've given away your own personal power by saying to yourself that you need someone else's approval or acceptance you are saying that your own feelings about yourself do not matter you wrote that you do not have low confidence but enter the situation with the girl and that goes out the window then to boot you make yourself feel guilty when you have not fulfilled your promise to yourself i really do understand what you are going through my fianc has a really terribly scarred back he'd never had a serious girlfriend before despite being an incredibly caring and attractive person because he was always so shy and full of self hatred of how his scars made him look first things first repeat after me i am not my rosacea it doesn't define you it is something you happen to live with that's it very famous people have had rosacea and not let it define their lives according to wikipedia president bill clinton diana princess of wales mariah carey http en wikipedia org wiki rosacea secondly realize that stress anxiety are actually going to make it worse so you might as well decide that you don't like feeling that way and you definitely aren't going to do something that makes a source of your misery worse not to mention self confidence is the sexiest thing a man can sport let yourself be if you find you just can't bring yourself to ask that girl out don't make it worse and beat yourself up over it just say ahh well i'll try again another time just let it go don't even give it a second thought unless you find it is something constructive the big step realize that rejection has no effect on you whatsoever what does it mean if someone rejects you it only means that you two weren't a good match after all frankly it'd save you much more time and emotion to know that before getting into a relationship can you imagine finding out a year into the relationship that she is really high maintenance as opposed to your laid back nature or that she was really focused about little tiny things in life while you are able to roll with the punches rejection has very little to do with the person being rejected and speaks volumes about the person doing the rejecting remember that everyone that has ever lived has had some fear of rejection in their life we all want to have approval that we are doing the right thing being the right person the only way to overcome it is to say to yourself that you are happy with who you are and if you aren't happy with who you are change what you can till you get there regardless of what others believe then you'll never ever be let down honestly the maxim is true you can't please all of the people all of the time so best to make yourself happy first oh and one last thing the right person will come and they will be someone who can see the real you regardless of what you look like or even what you act like i have never once been deterred by my love's scars of course i notice them but they don't even touch him i don't care about it in the slightest because it has no bearing on the person that he is if a girl doesn't realize that about you she is really not worth a minute of your time best wishes Theory of conduct Emotions (album) The Emancipation of Mimi Shaggy dog story Pitaten Sin City The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy EastEnders Dualism (philosophy of mind) Time Out of Mind Ranma __ characters Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Ethics Sharon Tate Infantilism A Course In Miracles Poker jargon Milton H.
