honestly this is like a self fulfilling prophecy are all women like this i wasnt always like this approaching women has become pretty easy for me i guess it came down to confidence u see i go to the university gym almost every day to work out a different part of my body and there are several different females who work there im not f cking kidding they start conversations with me i just go up to them when i have to exchange my card for a lock and key or whatever and they either do the hair flip smile in a kinda shy way or even at times initiate a conversation with me sometimes when i give her my id card she'll purposely touch my hand too or she'll just look down on the ground in a kind of shy way bc i kno im good looking and very few can match up and im talking about ladies this may all seem like one big collosal joke but rest assured its not this brings me to my ultimate question are all chicks like this once again i wasnt always this much of a gigolo and these encounters dont just happen at a gym im talking like every day i don't get it what's the question and what are you bitchin' about you want to know if all women will flirt with you i can say that the answer is absolutly no not all women will flirt with you do you have a problem with girls starting a conversation with you i'm guessing that it's because you like guys and don't want the girls to talk to you right just tell them look i already got my shit packed and don't like da puss ok Social rule Cliff Richard Have I Got News For You Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Aerial (dance move) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Singlish Humphrey Bogart The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Joke AFI 100 Years series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Shawn Michaels God Emperor of Dune Oh My Goddess!
