am i at all schizophrenic i don't know if all of these are are just an irrational fear or just my natural personality or whatt but the thing is laugh all you want i sometimes think that if i try hard enough and have enough focus i can do telekenesis or however you spell it like when you move things w your mind in other words supernatural powers and sometimes i find myself just talking to myself like literally asking myself questions like how was your day and like why are you so upset it's not that i think there is another person in my mind just that the voice i speak out loud is just different fromt he one in my mind so i have conversations with myself and when i talk to myself i look beside me liike there's someone there i am always scared that there are some kind of supernatural powers trying to get me and it really freaks me out and that's why i hate the dark sometimes i can't sleep because i worry about that and a lot of times i zone out though idk if that's relevant btw i'm also when i was about i had conversations in my mind with oh god i feel so stupid actually saying this with dea people and i actually believed it was real i actually felt their response in my mind i don't ever hallucinate really or hear conversations in my mind but i do talk to myself a lot and believe i have supernatural powers like some kind of a weirdo please don't be mean oh and last thing sometimes i do hear things like people and random noises and stuff but i think that's only because i'm paranoid about some murderer trying to kill me cause i'm home alone and stuff it sounds to me like you are an average teenager with some eccentricities and a hyperactive imagination to set your mind at rest on one point everyone talks to themselves to some degree such as when trying to work out a problem you are having as far as hearing other voices that could be a problem if they are directly talking to you some of the symptoms you describe do sound like paranoid schizophrenia my advice to you is to talk to a professional Social rule Psychosis Time Out of Mind Milton H.
