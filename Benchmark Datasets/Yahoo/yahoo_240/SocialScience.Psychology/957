why do people want more i have been thinking about some things well a lot of things about life and the world and god and people as a whole in general most of the time when i stop and look around everyone wants more and while i know that is not a bad thing is there ever a point when someone looks around and realize that it isn't all about what they want i see people mostly teens wanting that pair of jeans or those super expensive shoes when in their town there are people starving to death why is it that we so easily myself included want so much for ourselves and want so little for everyone else open ended desire and ambition are what keep us going they are proabably mankind's strongest motivators a love for challenge and desire for improvement is an integral part of a normal healthy human personality the shame is that too many misinterpret and misuse this abstract value to destructive and self destructive ends perfect total contentment sounds like a good idea in theory but in practice it breeds apathy and psycho emotional as well as cultural stagnation progress occurs only when people are motivated to look for something better than the current status quo the keys are to want more and better for others as well as one's self and to be able to fully enjoy what one has while still striving for better Evil Summa Theologiae Meaning of life Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Simone Weil Utilitarianism Eugenics Urantia Suicide Psychology of religion Arthur Schopenhauer Human Sant Thakar Singh Confucius Sexual orientation Goodness and value theory Infantilism Friedrich Schleiermacher About a Boy Objectivist philosophy Predestination David Hume Justification (theology) Love Anarcho-primitivism Asperger syndrome Intelligent design Social justice Sigmund Freud Jean-Jacques Rousseau Altruism Psychoanalysis S__ren Kierkegaard Current teachings of Prem Rawat Property (ownership right) Microeconomics Sin Dog Theodicy Second language acquisition Michel Henry Stoicism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Soul Human sexual behavior Extreme Programming Bernard Williams Reincarnation Alcoholics Anonymous Franz Boas Value system Phillip E.
