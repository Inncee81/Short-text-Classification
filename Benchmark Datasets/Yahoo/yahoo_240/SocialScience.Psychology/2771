how do i get over my fear of parties i've had bad experiences at parties most people just ignore me and if i'm not that lucky i'll be teased or tortured one time someone even picked me up and dragged me across the floor by my legs how do i stop this how do i get over my fear do you have to go to them in the first place you need not only self confidence but also some self esteem if you don't like parties then just assume that and don't go i know i don't like parties and i'm just fine i don't feel confortable around strange people drinking and acting dumb you're better than the people that ignore you and surely better than the ones who pick on you so why even bother being in contact with such people i'm sure you can find tons of better ways to spend your time if on the other hand it's something you'd really like to get over so you could feel more comfortable with yourself and enjoy parties just start by making yourself more comfortable with who you are admit and defend your emotions your inhibitions your views your personality stand up for yourself first you have to realize and deal with who you are and why you are that way discover yourself and set your priorities just don't force yourself to enjoy something that has nothing to do with you you have your reasons you're justified don't stress about it Social rule Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Religion Avenue Q Nicomachean Ethics Philosophical skepticism Human sexual behavior Milton H.
