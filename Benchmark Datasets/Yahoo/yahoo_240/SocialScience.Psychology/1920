molested boy says to the abuser bye daddy any explanation so about few weeks ago i read in a newspaper about a boy something like years old that was kidnapped and abused buy an older guy when the police rescued the boy and arrested the abuser the little boy said bye daddy to the abuser and he wasnt his father this boy also had so many chances to escape but only the boy knows why he didnt escaped since i read this i was thinking quite a lot about this case and now i wonder what was going on in boys mind what do you think i think the abuser brain washed the boy into believing that he was his father it is a manipulation tactic that pedophiles use to get children to trust them the reason the boy did not escape is because molesters scare the heck out of them by threatening to kill or harm either them or their family members if they don't cooperate they bond with their abuser for survival it is part of the survival instinct he succeeded in keeping himself alive by cooperating what a brave little boy i hope the abuser got his butt kicked in jail Sin City 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pedophilia Marc Dutroux Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal EastEnders Infantilism Domestic violence North American Man/Boy Love Association Childlove movement Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq The Invisibles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hannibal Lecter Child sexual abuse About a Boy Leo Frank YuYu Hakusho Sathya Sai Baba Fred Phelps Child pornography Sexual abuse South Park Jean Grey Scientology beliefs and practices Guiding Light Jacen Solo Billboard Hot 100 Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Satanic ritual abuse False memory One Piece minor characters Obi-Wan Kenobi Neighbours Scrooge McDuck Characters of Lost Darth Vader The Dukes of Hazzard Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Plame affair The Untouchables Lynching in the United States Jeffrey Dahmer Mind control American Dad!
