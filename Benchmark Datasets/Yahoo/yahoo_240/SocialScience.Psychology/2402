lucid dreaming i have read a few articles on this subject aparently it is said that if you can force your mind to relize that you are not in reality during a dream you will then gain full control over the dream that once you realize you are asleep and what you are doing is only in a dream then your mind will allow you to take control of every aspect of the dream once you have given yourself control of your dream you are no longer bound by the laws of physics or rules of society i am curious if others have heard of this or expirenced it it is said that peopl report having lucid dream events spuraticly and on the odd chance it takes place but it is also said that the act of lucid dreaming can be perfected and masters to occur whenever one wants to any input is valued i do it sometimes i can't do it every night morning it's usually in the morning that it happens pretty cool though Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Philosophy of mind Psychokinesis Reality Hypnosis Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Sleep Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Project MKULTRA Philosophy of perception Dream Theater Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Simone Weil Characters of The Sandman Avenue Q Emanuel Swedenborg Telepathy Carl Jung Electroencephalography Gestalt therapy Therion (band) Die Meistersinger von N__rnberg Probability Philosophical skepticism Milton H.
