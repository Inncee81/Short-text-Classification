why do i always worry about nothing i always worry about everything and i have a hard time being myself around people i never really know what to say to people i always feel paranoid too especially with my close relationships like with my boyfriend of over a year i'm paranoid that he really doesn't like me that much when really he tells me day after day how much does i also feel lonely alot even though i have friends and family i have a hard time being myself around people even my own family sometimes and i never used to i never used to have a hard time talking to people either but lately i've been really shy i'm years old why do i always worry about things and feel paranoid ever since high school i relied on people to tell me what they thought of me and if they didn't tell me that i was really awesome or something i'd get really depressed what are some things i can do to feel more secure with myself without relying on other people i think that you need some time to yourself just to relax go to a spa get your nails done and when you feel like your worrying about something stupid just ask your self why am i worrying about this is this important for me to be concerned about and just take it easy for a while you sound kinda stressed Social rule Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Shaggy dog story Nine Inch Nails The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Charles Darwin's illness One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show The Smoking Room About a Boy Time Out of Mind The Lovely Bones EastEnders The Emancipation of Mimi Dead Like Me Taxi Driver Boston Public Friends Jam (TV series) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Coupling (TV series) Singlish Kim Possible Scenes from a Memory Moomin Sin City Series finale Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John Frusciante Rock Follies Rich Mullins The Catcher in the Rye Earth Girl Arjuna Johnny 5 God Emperor of Dune Hey Jude Surveillance The Critic Enneagram Kim Possible: So the Drama Megan Griffin Radiohead Static Shock Hearing impairment Procrastination Sneakers (film) K' W.I.T.C.H.
