how do i become less stuck up this school year something i want to do is become less stuck up i don't generally consider myself to be stuck up but it is a mechanism i use when i feel nervous or intimidated i know i shouldn't act stuck up but what are ways that i can conciously change my behavior in order to not give the appearance of being stuck up or a know it all hey you know whta i'm a black guy and even i go thru this lol don't worry about that bs some people just stick out more than others you probably have certain features or a certain look that might induce a bit of jealousy jealousy is natural because you stand out people want to be closer to you they want to get to know you better and wish you would talk more people want to shoot down eagles and help turtles it's just the underdog nature of us all we root for those that don't seem a threat if it bothers you that much then just make the effort to talk to people more but not to the point of ramnling cuz then they'll say you're bragging as long as you are you people will find something to say about you the one who stands out of the crowd so i would just not worry about it if they can't say you're stuck up then they might say you think you're so hot lol and also people mistake insecurity for conceit in those who look attractive they expect you to be a certain way just based on the way you look they don't consider the possibility that you are quiet or that you manufacture confidence because they make you feel uncomfortable just relax and let it all go to hell lol for real you are by all means not the only one going through this just worry about what's important and find things that put a smile on your face comedy is a cure for nearly everything sorry to make this so damn long Social rule Milton H.
