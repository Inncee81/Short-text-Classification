why do people mistake being a giving caring person for a weakness i think it's really a sign of a strong person if you are not giving with the expectation of receiving as well if you are giving and caring about someone from your heart i think it shows that you are confident and happy in yourself enough that you just enjoy making the other person happy so it doesn't matter if you get anything in return it's just how you are and you are fine with that but some people look at this like it's a bad thing people misunderstand it as a weakness because if you give care for others it is just like giving a part of yourself to the people you are helping for some the reason why you might be doing these things is to gain favor from the people that you are helping mistaking it as submission to those who are in higher positions or ranks contrary to that perspective it is in fact a very brave thing to do helping other people sincerely is not an easy task those people who whole heartedly give and care for others are those people who have so much happiness and goodness in them that they want to share it with other people just like everything else it's a matter of how you look at things but anyway if just an if it really is a sign of weakness then what it's just a sign it doesn't necessarily follow that it really is right g od luck Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Care Bears Pitaten Kasparov versus The World Lie Economic inequality Goodness and value theory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Atheism Deconstruction Past teachings of Prem Rawat Confucius Estoppel Opus Dei Philosophical skepticism Contract Characters in the Smurfs Biblical inerrancy Chess strategy and tactics Luck Utilitarianism Abortion debate John Wycliffe Dualism (philosophy of mind) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Capitalism Cryptography Duties of the Heart Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Apology (Plato) Jon Secada Current teachings of Prem Rawat Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses 1957 World Series Operation Barbarossa Monkey (zodiac) Grumpy's Three Wishes Avenue Q Microeconomics Fallacy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Doomsday argument Chess terminology New York Giants The Fairly OddParents Strap-on dildo A Course In Miracles Sant Thakar Singh Brave New World Meaning Infant baptism LaVeyan Satanism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Supernatural Prisoner's dilemma David Hume Merit Phoebe Halliwell Negima Certified Nursing Assistant Charles Grandison Finney Community Theodicy Pascal's Wager Acts of the Apostles Bernard Williams Poker jargon Treaty Politics of Canada Tactical voting Happiness Debugging Derek Parfit Ruy Lopez Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Evangelicalism Kimi Finster Moral Politics Eastern Orthodox Church Meaning of life Simon Commission Agnosticism Leadership Predestination Christian eschatology Mojave people Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sydney Riot of 1879 Heresy Yusuf al-Qaradawi Seventeen-article constitution Aikido Summa Theologiae Epistemology Public-key cryptography
