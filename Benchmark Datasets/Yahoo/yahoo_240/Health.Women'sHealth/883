periods pads what types of pads should i use ok heres the dealio i just started my periods on july th and i just started my nd cycle on friday on my first period the blood was dark brown my flow was light this time the blood started out brown and started to get redder and redder after the st day my flow got heavier and heavier too this last night i put an always regular maxi with wings on and a carefree pantiliner on b c i thought it would leak through i woke up this morning to find my pantiliner completely soaked with blood both red and brown and some had even leaked through into my maxi today my flow was really heavy and red so i wore a maxi all day and just now changed to a stayfree ultra thin regular for heavy flow every time i went to pee lots and lots of blood would flow into the toliet i dance and i didn't go today cause i was afraid people would see my pad or go through my shorts can they c it my mom is buying some new pads cause im running out what do you suggest based on what i said above first calm down cause stress does funny things to your period oh and be grateful for a great understanding mom i hope my daughter can talk to me too when she comes of age now the stuff you want to know first don't dance all girls have or will go through it accept that and relax second always wear dark colthes shorts pants during your period and denim jeans are really great for even when the pads leak lightly that is it's less likely to show and as far as seeing the pad wear loose bottoms and baggy tops second if i understand you right this is just your second period ever if thats it then for the first year maybe your body will do different things it may not do the same thing every time and the first time or two will be extra heavy oh and certain days will be heavier than others always be prepared third don't double up if you're that paranoid and you think it's that bad set an alarm clock and wake up to change about every four hours ten minutes to change that isn't gonna be that big a deal fourth buy the thin always pads i personally prefer the kotex cause their velco did i spell that right and not plastic sticky stuff i also always wear the long overnight ones regardless of the time of day just cause i feel like they smooth better under my pants and cover better cause it runs sometimes fifth stay clean and change about every four to five hours if not sooner i go through about pads during a period week don't ever buy the scented ones cause they could cause an infection sixth don't stress over the blood in the toliet it happens and only cause proparbly the clots hanging around near where your pee if you have to change a pad constantly then worry about the amount of blood in the toliet and the blood that you're losing cause it could be the sign of something more serious but the regular rule is you should be able to go about four hours i hope this helps i can't stand having my period and good luck oh and calm down again everybody has to deal with it and we're all paranoid about it being noticed Sanitary towel Urinary incontinence Mattress Menstrual cycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Social rule Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story AFI 100 Years series Time Out of Mind Insomnia Dialysis Sleep Slayers Radiohead Ron and Fez Ice hockey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Treehouse of Horror V The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pok__mon Live!
