women only birth contoll and period problems okay so lets start here im and about a month and weeks ago i skipped a period i had spotting and then days later i had stomach pains so i went to the e r days after it started they said i had an ovarian cyst that ruptured so then i came home on a sunday and went to the gyno on a tuesday they put me on birth controll well told me to start wen i got my period next so then i waited about weeks and i had a little spotting not a lot so i started the pill and my period never came but i couldnt stop the pills so i jsut kept taking them and i just finished my first pack and i got my period like days ago but tis like reall really really heavy and not to sound nasty i just wanna know wut it is but i have like hugh clots in it and i have really bad cramps like never before now for the question is the cramps and clots beacouse i havent gotten my period in about months and because of the cyst or is it because of the birth controll i have been through this very same thing and yes it is probably because you haven't had a period for two months the addition of the hormones from the birth control pills and if you have had an ovarian cyst then that is likely the explanation ovarian cysts are not uncommon and there is a possibility that you had more than one which is also common and birth control is a normal treatment for this it is also common for the cysts to burst during or at the onset of a cycle the birth control pills will stop a period and even prevent it if taken continuously which you should only do if instructed to do so by your doctor also don't forget that clotting is normal as you are expelling the lining of your uterus where the egg implants itself each month the clotting is the lining and blood i would call the dr 's office and confirm all of this and for your own peace of mind and go for a check up if needed it can never hurt to be safe however i don't think that it is anything for you to really worry about Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Ovarian cyst Childbirth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Cancer Miscarriage Stomach cancer Fertility awareness Tocopherol Ben Johnson (athlete) Puberty Ovulation Infertility Breastfeeding Atherosclerosis Psoriasis Folic acid Vitamin D Syringomyelia Dialysis First aid Spina bifida Intrauterine device Obstetrics Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometrial cancer Ocean's Twelve Shaggy dog story Prenatal diagnosis Endometrium Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Deep vein thrombosis Depo Provera Dysmenorrhea Migraine EastEnders Wound healing phases Milton H.
