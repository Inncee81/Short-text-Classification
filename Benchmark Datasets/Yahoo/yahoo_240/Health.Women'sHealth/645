using tampax for the first time help hey for the past few years i've always used sanitary towels when i'm on my period but i want to try using tampax i'm a bit nervous about using them for the first time though i just have a few questions and any answers would be appreciated does it hurt using tampax will it damage my hymen i'm a virgin how do you know when the tampax has gone high enough and is in the right position thanks very much i think you guys can tell i've never used tampons before lol unless you have put it in wrong no it doesn't you won't feel a thing hymens aren't alike some women are even born without one the truth is that it won't damage the hymen doctors say it's pretty elastic when it comes to the size of a tampon you'll feel some resistance but at some point you'll feel it disappears that means it has reached the exact point when i started using tampax i used the ones with applicator i'm not sure how it's said because the size helped me figure out when it was properly set advice on the position you must have while you're putting it in pretend you're going to pee but don't sit in the toilet it seems uncomfortable but it's the best position trust me Tampon Theory of conduct Social rule Deconstruction Hymen Procter & Gamble EastEnders Fecal incontinence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Floppy disk Shaggy dog story Good Morning, Vietnam Friends Hey Jude Virgin Diving Humphrey Bogart Toilet Sento Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Condom Milton H.
