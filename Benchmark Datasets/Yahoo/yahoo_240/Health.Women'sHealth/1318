please women how can i make my woman like sex does she want to have sex with you that's the most important questiuon because if she doesn't she probably isn't going to like sex with you no matter what you do but if she does then one thing to remember is that for most women pleasure in sex is linked to intimacy women like to feel close to their partner valued and cared about lots of guys concentrate on the mechanics of sex g spots penis length etc etc it's way simpler than that it's about getting intimate getting to know one another from the skin in being close mentally as well as physically instead try laying naked together just touching sensual massage bathing together without going 'all the way' get really intimate build a scene focus only on her if you haven't got the time or interest to do that then you don't really want her to enjoy sex you just want her to tell you she does so you can enjoy it more take your time focus on her and good luck Physical intimacy Human sexual behavior Social rule Strap-on dildo Oral sex Nudity Child sexuality Theory of conduct Erogenous zone Orgasm Inhibited sexual desire Anal sex Zoophilia Penis Massage Gender role Bondage (BDSM) Sex toy Condom Sexual abstinence Polyamory BDSM Love Sexual intercourse Happiness Infantilism Domination & submission (BDSM) Meaning of life Friendship Gay slang Friends Human sexuality Ex-gay Human penis size Jam (TV series) Little Britain Philosophical skepticism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Domestic violence History of sex Masturbation Goodness and value theory Phone sex Lawrence v.
