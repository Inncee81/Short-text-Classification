women health question ok imma be up front and apologise for all the information im about to give but if you dont like it then dont bother answering please this is a serious question and i need a serious answer ok i had an vaginal infection and i had it cleared up afteri went to the gyno a few weeks ago i was on meds and after like day i notice it started to go away and i was like great and i went to the gyno again for a check up about weeks ago and he was like it cleared up and i have to go again to get a pap smeer on the th fine right no becuase the infection came back and i dont know how no i want to know a couple of things because i never had a pap smeer before ok when i go will the infection mess up the pap smeer if so then should i cancel the pap and go to the dr and get my infection checked up or can i just go there to get it done and let him know it came back also can a man get the infection too its bacterial vaginosis that i had can my bf have gotten it and gave it back to me because we have had unprotected sex since it cleared up could that be the reason it came back also my mom told me after i get my period im supposed to dush and thats probably how i got it in the first place is that true this infection is a bacterial imbalance problem it can be caused by any number of things wearing thongs sex not cleaning properly after sex bubble baths douching having and iud type of birth control having multiple sex partners i really don't think it will mess with the pap smear i've had a yeast infection and still been able to get a pap done but you need to ask your doctor first just to be sure you should be able to call the office and ask sounds like if you were diagnosed with an infection down there by a gyno you've been examined down there but just in case you don't know what to expect for the pap smear they will put your feet in those funny stirrups the doctor will put lube like ky jelly on a funny looking plastic thing he will insert it in you it will click and spread open it doesn't hurt he will use a swab to rub against you he will probably feel your ovaries that's it you're done also i noticed that you said you have a male doctor don't be afraid if you want a female in there mom sister friend or if you want a female nurse to be present and explain what is going on also here is a website i looked up for you listed in my sources the dr should have a pamphlet on it that he can give you as well Strap-on dildo Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical analysis of circumcision Cervical cancer Social rule Herpes simplex virus AIDS Pap smear Stomach cancer Vulvovaginal health Menstrual cycle Oral sex Shaggy dog story Gynaecology Anal sex Cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Urinary incontinence Sexually-transmitted infection Computer virus Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Body piercing Breastfeeding Abortion History of intersex surgery Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pneumonia AIDS reappraisal Childbirth Little Britain Vagina Joke Intravenous therapy Miscarriage Theory of conduct Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Oral contraceptive Douche Female genital cutting Infantilism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Socrates Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Orgasm Folic acid Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Rabies EastEnders Friends Colposcopy Gender-neutral language Genital wart Avenue Q Plame affair The Inside Emergency contraception High-heeled shoe Sexual intercourse 2001 anthrax attacks Babe Ruth Group sex AIDS pandemic Homosexuality and transgender Breast Singlish Laura Schlessinger Menstrual cup Intrauterine device Fertility awareness Diving Angel One (TNG episode) Katelyn Faber Kurt Cobain Earring Hepatitis C Sex education Progress of the SARS outbreak Sexual orientation Infertility Sexual reproduction Marilyn Monroe Joy Division (band) Endometrial cancer Certified Nursing Assistant Malaria Medicine
