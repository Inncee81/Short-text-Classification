should a girl see the gyn at i was having an argument with my mother in law about my yr old step daughter and of course anything i say about our daughter is stupid according to my mother in law because i have only been around for yrs but anyway my stepdaughter started her period yrs ago and her mother never told her anything about it she taught herself everything now she will be living with us and i think she should start seeing the gyn but my mother in law claims she should wait until she is now that sounds very wrong to me i started seeing a gyn after i started my periods at am i wrong or right i think it would be very stupid to wait since she is already having monthly mensrtal i think that from an educational standpoint its a good idea the doctor can teach her how to perform breast self exams teach her about proper sexual protection because like it or not teens do become sexually active answer any questions she might have that she's too embarrassed to ask you or someone else and it will also allow her to become accustomed to the medical environment and not feel threatened by it please stress the fact that her visit will be a physical and faq chat session not a pelvic exam which would freak any girl out at and let her know that if she's having any sort of gynecological problems this is how things work your mil is a prude and grossly under educated oh and you can tell her that a recent report in the journal of gynecology and obstetrics encourages pubescent visits to the gynecologist for just the reasons i outlined Medicine Gynaecology Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Emergency contraception Puberty Transsexuality Prostate cancer Infantilism Hikikomori Science Chiropractic Teach the Controversy Reparative therapy Ethics Criticism of libertarianism Socrates Sigmund Freud Rape Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Pedophilia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Laura Schlessinger Childlove movement Franz Boas Physician Sexual orientation Social rule Sexual abstinence Creationism Pitaten French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Fecal incontinence Cooperative education Medical record Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of intersex surgery Bernard Williams Extreme Programming Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Patent Orgasm Cancer Law school Sex education Religion Premature ejaculation Pelvic inflammatory disease Incest Negima Female genital cutting Human sexual behavior 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Intelligent design Boston Public Juris Doctor Status of religious freedom in France Gender role Partial-birth abortion About a Boy The Mother Condom Domestic violence Scientific method Abortion Pregnancy Divorce Intelligent design movement SAT Fathers' rights Alexander Technique Androgen insensitivity syndrome Homophobia EastEnders Niddah Circumcision advocacy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma F.
