man with question i'm lbs overweight due to meds all in my stomach how can i dress to look less heavy i wear my shirts pullovers out and try to wear ones with stripes going down but still look all poofed out especially in profile my doc says giving up the meds is not an option at this time i'm ' and used to weigh about and was decent looking but now i'm a blimp i would really appreciate some female input thanks small vertical stripes actually slim the figure instead of widen it the only other thing you can be certain to do is to be sure your shirts do not hit you or pull in particular at the area that is largest on you this draws more attention to the area i can commiserate with a medication causing sudden and extreme weight gain i am still struggling to lose weight from a particular birth control i was on three years ago women don't mind an overweight man we're not all shallow edit i did a quick web search for you and found these tips that i thought may be helpful to you dress thinner tip wear the right size no outfit is going to take pounds off your hips but choosing the right clothing that fits properly can go a long way to slimming your look if clothes are too tight all the bulges rolls dimples or any other flaw you may have will show through if clothes are too big they add bulk and can make you look heavier than you actually are dress thinner tip patterns fool the eye optical illusion patterns diagonal stripes zig zags and the like can fool the eye and detract from problem areas however avoid horizontal and vertical stripes because these both can cause you to appear heavier tips to dress slimmer choose darker solid colors such as black navy blue and gray black rules dress monochromatic all in one color top to bottom no patterns if you want to wear patterns go for smaller ones that overlap avoid horizontal stripes look for thin vertical and and diagonal lines for a fluid look select accessories to draw attention from trouble spots wear clothes that fit not too baggy but not tight and clingy tips for the portly man clothes must fit perfectly loose clothing makes you look even bigger while tight clothes give away curves that you don't want exposed avoid any sweater blazer or shirt with naturally sloped shoulders because these tend to attract the eye right down to your mid section jackets should be well adjusted around you waist area and should fall right below your buttocks vertical lines help elongate your look optically that in turn will make you appear thinner trousers should be worn on your hips preferably with a low rise which is a shorter distance between the top of the waistband and the crotch of your pants avoid letting your belly stick out over your pants this lengthens your torso and shortens your legs resulting in a very unattractive combination consider wearing suspenders instead of a belt to minimize attention to your waistline empty unnecessary items from your pockets overstuffed pockets also call attention to your mid section v necks are a great way to camouflage double chins as they draw the attention away from your neck and more towards your chest area whatever your body type make sure your best features stand out while your less perfect ones remain for the most part unnoticed remember do not try to overtly camouflage your weaker points because it only brings them out even more the best way to prove this point is when a balding man uses a comb over hairdo in an attempt to hide his bald spots it only emphasizes the problem more Billiards Kilt Shirt Professional wrestling holds Weight training Camouflage Horse Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Suit (clothes) Canadian Armed Forces Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Diving suit Suplex Social aspects of clothing Tightlacing Welding Black tie Mattress Diving Kimono Japanese tea ceremony Dog Hair Drill bit Double bass Knife Hamster Archery Dragon Booster Glossary of climbing terms Garfield Marching band Violin Volleyball Buttocks Physical attractiveness Bicycle Heavy metal fashion Snooker Gramophone record Terminal ballistics Hakama Casualty lifting Swingout View camera Cat Sari Pantyhose Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Gas metal arc welding Sailing Sniper Tank Car handling Tire Death rock fashion Poker jargon Figure skating Bicycle lighting Comanche Wing Chun Glossary of American football Colours, standards and guidons Color Textile manufacturing Menstrual cup Softball Overall Drawing Gray Wolf Piccolo Junior Saga Wind turbine Clothing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cheetah Barbie Wallpaper group Geology of the Appalachians Aikido Nudity Cello Breastfeeding
