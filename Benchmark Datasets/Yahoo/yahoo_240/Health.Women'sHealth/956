from one woman to another they may occur at the same time each month or be irregular typically a cycle occurs about once a month but can be as short as days or as long as days and still be considered normal menstrual flow lasts about to days a menstrual period is considered late if it is or more days overdue according to the usual pattern of periods a period is considered missed if there is no menstrual flow for or more weeks the causes a late or missed period could be because of any of the following pregnancy this is the most common cause of missed periods if you have had unprotected sex even once in the past several months see your doctor for a pregnancy test before you consider any of the other possible causes stress stress is the second most common cause of late or missed periods in teenagers it may be emotional stress or depression or it may be physical stress such as a severe illness a sexually transmitted infection rapid weight loss or gain or strenuous exercise dieting or binging and purging may interrupt menstrual cycles changes in your usual routine for example going on a vacation may also cause your period to be late or missed normal development during the first couple of years of menstruation many teenagers have irregular periods during this time the body's hormones are not yet finely tuned so the ovaries may not release an egg once every month as a result your cycles may be irregular occurring as close together as weeks or as far apart as months hormone imbalance hormone imbalance is rarely the cause of missed periods in teenagers polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common type of hormone imbalance that affects the menstrual cycle polycystic ovaries may cause irregular cycles increased body hair acne and weight gain sometimes when you stop

your doctor finds nothing abnormal during your physical examination and you've been having periods for years or less your irregular periods may be part of your normal development if you have had sexual intercourse go to your doctor's office for a pregnancy test when your period is late for you even if you normally have irregular cycles hormone imbalance if you have missed several periods without an explanation your doctor can check your ovaries and look for any signs of hormone imbalance blood tests can be done to measure hormone levels it is important to identify pregnancy early so that you can discuss the options available to you and start prenatal care early prenatal care helps ensure a healthy baby if the irregularity is due to stress then your periods should return when the activities or situations that are stressing you are eliminated or changed as part of normal development most girls' menstrual cycles become fairly regular as their hormone levels become mature and
