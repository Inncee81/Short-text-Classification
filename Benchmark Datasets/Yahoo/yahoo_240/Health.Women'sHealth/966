red bump om breast blood came out i found a bump on my breast and i messed with it and blood came out i am so freakd out do any of you have any insight it is about the size of a pea what it sounds like to me is a blood blister they can form anywhere on the body although what you had and what the picture shows may look different they still may be the same thing they come in different shades but most of them are red to dark red as what you did if you mess with a blood blister blood will come out of it that is my best guess but don't rule out a small breast cyst how old you are may determine what it is if you are above the age of thirty i highly suggest going in for a mammogram if you are younger take note of what the bump looked like it's color and what it felt like talk to you doctor about it and he may have further insight Breast cancer Mammography Breast Salad Fingers Taxi Driver Prostate cancer Eczema Puberty Metastasis Psoriasis Social rule Blue Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Folic acid Acne Discus (fish) Pitaten Breast implant Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind Cancer Rei Ayanami Iron English plural Color Blood vessel Thermoregulation Red Cephalic disorder Stomach cancer Opportunity rover Group A streptococcal infection The Smoking Room Skin Marilyn Monroe Spleen Brassiere Shakespeare's sonnets Television Megan Griffin Cognitive science Paramount Pictures Blood pressure Out-of-body experience Kurt Cobain Bruise Vampire Shit AFI 100 Years series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dolly Parton 'M Blood transfusion Shaggy dog story Major League Baseball television contracts Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Androgen insensitivity syndrome 28 Days Later The Red Green Show Missingno.
