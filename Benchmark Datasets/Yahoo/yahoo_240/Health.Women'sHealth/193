i m not having periods menstruating i have always had a longer cycle up to days than most women my previous doctor told me in that i shouldn't worry as all women are different he suggested i go on the pill to regulate my periods which i did i then came off the pill in may june i was on dianette and my doctor suggested i should not take it for more than a couple of years in may i started taking dianette again however in may i stop taking it i lived in japan and it was easier just to use condoms after coming off the pill my periods were irregular but i expected that the problem is that i have only had periods so far this year i have been to a doctor i live in the states now but he has referred me to a gynocologist i now have to wait weeks to see one my doctor had no idea why i am not having regular periods what could be wrong i am not pregnant age weight stones pounds pounds bmi exercise hour times a week health no problem i am not pregnant i am only ' tall so i am not too slim i eat a healthy diet there are several things to consider here when you go on the pill you switch your own body off when you stop the pill it has to switch back on again one cannot say how long that will be you always had a long cycle and i wonder whether you were in fact ovulating were your periods long but relatively pain free this would tend to suggest that you were not ovulating if you had pain on the first day primary dysmennorhoea this suggests that you were if it was the case that you were not ovulating with a long cycle then taking the pill can cause the sort of problem you have now dianette is a pill brand that is indicated for contraception and acne did you have bad acne and not being insulting are you or were you hairy this with your periods may make me think of polycystic ovaries my last thoughts is that you are not very heavy and take a fair degree of exercise do you eat well are you concerned about putting on weight if your body fat is too low that again can cause problems these are just a few thoughts i cannot be specific as i have not taken a full history or examined you do any of the above suggestions appear too fit Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy Birth control Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Obesity Acne Ovarian cyst Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Tocopherol Atkins Nutritional Approach Ovulation Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual abstinence Prostate cancer Folic acid Weight training In vitro fertilisation Human height Super Size Me Adjustable gastric band Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Endometriosis Condom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bipolar disorder Estrus cycle Social rule Binge eating disorder Exercise Nutrition Niddah Body mass index Veganism Hypertension Childbirth Ovarian cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Physical attractiveness Education in Portugal Sleep Malaria Scientology beliefs and practices Milk Thermoregulation Herpes simplex virus Infertility Miscarriage Hypoglycemia Psoriasis Depo Provera Theory of conduct Garfield Hypnosis Progesterone Dialysis Infantilism Clinical depression Ovary Baldness treatments Migraine Vegetarianism Tobacco smoking Diabetes mellitus Tightlacing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Health insurance Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Apprentice 2 Insulin Multiple sclerosis Old wives' tale Sexual revolution Amenorrhoea GunZ The Duel Equine conformation Heinkel He 112 Alanis Morissette Physical examination Weight loss Isotretinoin
