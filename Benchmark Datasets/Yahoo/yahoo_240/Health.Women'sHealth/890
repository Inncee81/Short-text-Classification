help please information on cervical cancer hey everybody o k so i went for a pap test about two and a half weeks ago then went on vaction i got home today and found a message from my doctor saying to call i told her she could leave the results on the phone so i figure they probally arn't good and am really scared i know i wont know until tomorrow but im scared several members of my family have had cervical cancer and i was wondering is there a genetic link or are we just unlucky lol and also what are the chances of getting rid of the cancer if that is what it is i know it may not be without making me infertily well don't get all worried about something until you know for sure because of doctor patient privacy laws the doctors cannot legally leave medical information regarding test results on an answering machine where just anyone can hear them secondly a lot of cancers are genetic and i would assume this might include cervical cancer as only about of all cc's are caused by hpv the good news is that cc is highly treatable and exceptionally preventable as it is slow growing and it takes years for the abnormalities i e dyplasia to convert to cancer cells if and that's a huge if you do end up needing treatement chances are your fertility will not be effected but this is all putting the cart before the horse you need to know your results first and those will most likely be benign or at worst questionable and need a repeat pap to confirm preliminary findings Cancer Prostate cancer Cervical cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human papillomavirus Medical analysis of circumcision Stomach cancer Pap smear Abortion Medicine Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Urinary incontinence Metastasis Breast cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen insensitivity syndrome AIDS reappraisal Endometrial cancer Cryptorchidism Colposcopy Cystic fibrosis Privacy Genital wart Apoptosis Medical prescription Chiropractic Huntington's disease Folic acid Ovarian cancer Infertility Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cephalic disorder Coeliac disease Virus Abortion debate Alcoholism AIDS Menstrual cycle Childbirth Stroke Mesothelioma Rabies Cervix Gonorrhoea In vitro fertilisation Circumcision Divorce Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Migraine Tobacco smoking Diabetes mellitus Syringomyelia X-ray Down syndrome Sickle-cell disease Herpes simplex virus Growth hormone treatment Antiretroviral drug Alzheimer's disease Multiple sclerosis Hypertension Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Genetic disorder Radiation therapy Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Scar Ben Johnson (athlete) Hypoglycemia Meiosis Eczema Singlish Fertility awareness Stem cell Myocardial infarction Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Epilepsy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Soft tissue sarcoma Obstetrics Involuntary commitment Lupus erythematosus Psoriasis Familial adenomatous polyposis Terri Schiavo Leukemia Helicobacter pylori Malaria Surveillance Mental Health Act 1983 Y chromosome Milton H.
