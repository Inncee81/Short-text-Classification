is it true that when you're pregnant you dont get your period in my years of life i have known a lot of pregnant women including myself i was lucky and had straight months of period free bliss others are not so lucky one girl i knew had her period all the way through her pregnancy she didn't even realize she was pregnant until about months along because she started showing and couldn't understand the tummy weight till she went to the doctor i've know people who had spotting several times during the months as well there is no real set of circumstances that one can tell makes one person's experiences different then another it just sort of happens that way Pregnancy Days of our Lives EastEnders Teenage pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Fertility awareness Abortion debate Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Abortion Kate Vaiden Miscarriage Alois Hitler Roe v.
