i had unprotected sex the same day that i started antibiotic treatment before i started am i still protected i have heard many reports that antibiotics interfere with birth control pills so i'm looking for some advice on my situation this past wednesday i went to the doctor and was told that i had a uti and that i would need to use backup protection for the rest of this pill pack the thing is we came home around pm had sex around that afternoon then i took my birth control pill at my normal time pm then at that night i took my first dose of the antibiotics so i'm wondering am i at risk for pregnancy because we didn't use a condom on wednesday even though i took the antibiotics hours after my birth control pill the effectiveness of your birth control may have been lowered slightly by the antibiotics but it shouldn't have lowered it that much yes you should use a back up method of birth control when you're on a hormonal birth control and antibiotics but honestly i've been on antibiotics before and had sex without a back up method and been fine my advice to you is to just be sure to use a condom for the duration of the rest of your prescription of antibiotics and not to stress too much about that one time Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Psoriasis Herpes simplex virus Urinary incontinence Medical analysis of circumcision Sex education Folic acid Childbirth Condom Antibiotic Isotretinoin Acne Gonorrhoea Common cold Tocopherol Endometriosis Atherosclerosis Safe sex AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Sexual abstinence Harm reduction Chemotherapy Hypoglycemia Pharmacology In vitro fertilisation Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Cancer Sexual intercourse Neighbours Turner syndrome Elvis and Me Cellulitis Pneumonia Dialysis Medical prescription Organic farming Clinical depression Coffee Clostridium difficile Diabetes mellitus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mercury Atlas 6 Veganism Diazepam Growth hormone treatment Hormone replacement therapy Anal sex Multiple sclerosis Abortion Intrauterine device Guinea pig Crystal methamphetamine and sex Allergy Pregnancy Vitamin C Lorazepam Paracetamol Insomnia Hearing impairment Medical cannabis Caffeine Cephalexin Rocky Mountain spotted fever Sedative Gastroparesis Nutrition Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Diaphragm (contraceptive) Premature birth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alzheimer's disease Apollo 8 Elvis Presley Insulin Avenue Q Syphilis Methamphetamine Sildenafil Chlorpromazine Spina bifida Abortion debate Sexual revolution Homosexuality and transgender Osteoarthritis Iatrogenic Migraine Diarrhea
