planned parenthood i am going to take my daughter to planned parenthood for birth control the doctor says she should be on it for her period i am on the pill and it costs a month so i dont want to pay over for us both so if i let her go in and get it herself about how much money do you think it will cost is it free or what im taking her to one in pa if that helps i went to planned parenthood before going to my doctor for birth control they will give it to your daughter for free if you can't afford it or if your insurance won't cover it it's really a great program you should talk to your own doctor though because dollars a month is way too much to be paying my insurance allows me to pay only dollars for three months worth even without my insurance i could still get my pills for less than dollars i hope things work out for you best of luck Warren Buffett Medicare (Canada) Medicare (United States) Emergency contraception Insurance Wal-Mart Life insurance Publicly funded medicine Planned Parenthood Health insurance Variable universal life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Health savings account Medical malpractice Economy of the United States Houston Chronicle Health care in Canada Pharmaceutical company Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Menstrual cycle Social Security (United States) Education in Germany Economy of Russia Predatory lending United States dollar Personal finance Fertility awareness Health maintenance organization Health care in the United States Microeconomics Oral contraceptive Blackjack New Deal Social Security debate (United States) Unemployment National Health Service Wheel of Fortune Margaret Sanger Unemployment benefit Financial services US health reform under FDR Psoriasis Public transport Samuel Alito Term life insurance Abortion in the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Social security Money Roe v.
