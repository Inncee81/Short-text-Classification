i need help with the pill so i am finally starting birth control for the first time but my doctor basically gave me the pills and left nice huh so im not to sure on what to do i believe that i am supposed to wait until i start my period i started that today i guess i take the first pill then right and then also i heard you take a week off after each packet why and when do i start again reading the pamphlet that came with the pills will be helpful you can either start on the day of your period or do what i used to do when i was on them the sunday start you take the pill on the sunday after your period starts sometimes it is easier to do the sunday start so you can always count on what day of the week to take your first pill and when your period will come if you are on regular pills you will take them for weeks called on weeks then you will have week off of them however some brands will have the th week with different colored pills that don't truly contain birth control you don't have to take them but many people do just to maintain the good habit during their 'off' week if you had a sunday start start the sunday after your period if you started on the day of your period do the same again also take them at the same time every day that you take them this will greatly impact the effectiveness of the pills i found that setting an alarm reminder on my cell phone was helpful for when to take the pill and writing on a calendar what my on and off weeks were also helped Oral contraceptive Liturgical year Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Daylight saving time Computus Urinary incontinence Gregorian calendar Psoriasis Hebrew calendar Angels in America Theory of conduct Acne Mid-Autumn Festival Easter ISO 8601 Ben Johnson (athlete) Dominical letter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Birth control Tag Surveillance Sunday Apollo 8 Gospel Social rule Guinea pig Ocean's Twelve Lent Placebo Sabbath Fecal incontinence Doomsday rule Calendar Endometriosis Wheel of Fortune Medical prescription Sharon Tate Migraine Fasting Neighbours Rosh Hashanah Alanis Morissette Margaret Sanger Coptic calendar Sleep Major League Baseball television contracts Week Password Depo Provera Monday Night Football French Republican Calendar Julian day Intrauterine device Jewish holiday Holy Week Chronology of Jesus Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dietary fiber Leo Wyatt Stomach cancer Patent medicine Childbirth Calculating the day of the week Maya calendar Code division multiple access CPU cache Rose (Doctor Who) RISC Year of the Spider MTV2 Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar Calvin and Hobbes Caffeine Birthday Crossword Sea-Monkey Blur Canonical hours Cleveland Browns Paul Weller 97.3 Forth One Sexual reproduction The Doctor Dances Shavuot Buffer overflow Penis enlargement Antiretroviral drug Maprotiline Antidepressant Tocopherol Palm Sunday She Loves You Matins Destiny of the Daleks
