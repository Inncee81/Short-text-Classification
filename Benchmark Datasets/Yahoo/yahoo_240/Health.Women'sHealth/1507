birth control funny periods ok so i've been on birth control for almost a month saturday will be my last sugar pill and i was just a little curious because my period hasn't come yet with the first four inactive pills i haven't had unprotected sex this month and i received my last period on the fourth of july what happened was my doctor had me start my pills after my period thus pushing my period back a week or so so is this normal for the first month or so of takin the pill to not be having a period yes i didn't get mine the first time but i've always been a sunday starter it works better for me just remember it is extremely important to take your pill at the exact same time everyday good luck and call the doctor if you don't get your next one or you missed pills and had unprotected sex Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Alanis Morissette Endometriosis Social rule Milton H.
