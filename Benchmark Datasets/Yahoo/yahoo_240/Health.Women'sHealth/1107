how to predict ovulation my cycle is days with a day luteal phase i heard that ovulation takes place mid cycle so does that mean i should expect ovulation to occur days after my last period i noticed cervical mucus around the begining of this month which ended on august th also is it even possible to get pregnant a day after ovulation ends thank you my bf and i were fooling around no intercourse on the th after my fertile days so there is no possibility that if by a slim chance sperm did get in i cant get pregnant right i also as of today felt a little wetness in my underwear and there was some white material near the opening so does that mean the egg wasnt fertilized here is what you do from the first day of your period count to the th day if you are trying to get pregnant have sex on the th day and the th day and that will increase your chances since it is never really accurate when you will ovulate unless you use a thermometer remember if you have sex every day that will actually decrease your chances of getting pregnant you should always skip a day or two also as a side note a few days after i ovulate i also get a mucus discharge for me but not sure for you it is an indication that my egg was not fertilized it all depends on the consistency of your mucus but you will definitely get a mucus discharge after you ovulate don't listen to the midwife who said to have sex on and th day she is wrong look here where it says take control this is one of many websites that tell you not to have sex daily because the sperm need time to regenerate http www whattoexpect com pregnancy ask heidi week conception chances aspx Oral contraceptive Birth control Infertility In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Progesterone Abortion debate Twin Niddah Estrus cycle Sexual abstinence Sexual reproduction Cystic fibrosis Ovarian cyst Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gonorrhoea Fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Flowering plant Orgasm Maya calendar Obstetrics Abortion Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovary Childbirth Pregnancy test Sexual intercourse Endometriosis Ovum History of sex Stomach cancer Meiosis Female reproductive system (human) Cervix Prostate cancer Action potential Social rule Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Mucus Parthenogenesis Ectopic pregnancy Condom Oral sex Tsetse fly Human chorionic gonadotropin Child sexuality Health issues and the effects of cannabis Temperature Semen Heart sounds Multiple birth Month Spider Stem cell Human sexual behavior Full moon cycle Teenage pregnancy Estradiol Mount Pinatubo Methotrexate Spina bifida Moss Psoriasis Old wives' tale Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Herpes simplex virus Chimera (genetics) Year Strap-on dildo Ovarian cancer Premature birth Folic acid Sex assignment 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Julian day HIV Carpel Urinary incontinence Turner syndrome Solar variation Ploidy Conifer cones Isotretinoin Endometrial cancer Blackjack Safe sex Cryptorchidism Sea level rise Jam (TV series)
