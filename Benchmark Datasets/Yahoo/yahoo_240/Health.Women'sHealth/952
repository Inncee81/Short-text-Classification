women girls only please read and answer your help is needed i have a few questions that i have been wondering about lately i was wondering if anyone here has asked their doctors about using tampons before they started using them i was also wondering how you asked if you did and what their response was also did the doctor try to make it as comfortable as they could and how embarrassing was it after you said it also how did you bring yourself to ask if you haven't asked what are some ways that i could ask my pediatrician i have a female doctor i trust her and all but i am just to nervous to ask about tampons but i want to hear what she has to say i have no one else to talk to about this and i do not want to just try them before i talk to my doctor i have tried several time to ask but i chicken out i know that every girl has to deal with period but i still find it so embarrassing what can i do i play a lot of sports and am very active so i really wanna switch think about what specific questions you have and write them down having the questions written out will make it easier for you to remember if you feel embarrased about the subject you could also show the questions to your doctor instead of asking them what you're asking about is a normal and natural subject rest assured that your doctor won't find it embarrasing i will bet she will try to put you at ease and you will feel better for asking Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tampon Avenue Q Theory of conduct Milton H.
