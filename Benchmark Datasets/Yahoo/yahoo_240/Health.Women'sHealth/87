sex question why air stucks in vagina when u are having sex yesterday when my husband got done with sex he pulled his out and i heard the air coming out of my vagina i think this is funny i burst out laughing it felt like i was farting from my vagina my question is why it happens this happens to me too i think the air gets trapped by the penis in the vagina and then it has to get out this happens when i stand on my head too the air gets in there and when i come back down it comes out it has to be released because your vagina is an anaerobic environment no air the air that's trapped is released so that it doesn't cause bacteria Condom Oral sex Anal sex Sexual intercourse Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Old wives' tale Herbert Garrison Sex toy Jam (TV series) Orgasm Futurama (TV series - season 5) Human sexual behavior Vagina Joke Masturbation Safe sex Sex and the City Sexual reproduction Katelyn Faber Puberty Trapped in the Closet Intersexuality Domestic violence Sex organ Birth control Social rule Drawn Together Recurring South Park characters South Park Good Morning, Vietnam Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pornographic movie Menstrual cycle Yoko Ono Human sexuality Transmission (medicine) Goatse.cx Coming of Age (TNG episode) Urinary incontinence Flatulence Coitus interruptus Sexual differentiation Kenny McCormick Shaggy dog story Vagina dentata Baise-moi History of intersex surgery Gr__fenberg spot Vulvovaginal health Premature ejaculation Sex doll Penis envy Penis removal Douche La Blue Girl Great Teacher Onizuka Intersex surgery Physical intimacy Diaphragm (contraceptive) Soil life Glycolysis Time Out of Mind Micropenis Sex assignment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Russian joke Futurama (TV series - season 3) Hey Jude Eric Cartman Sewage treatment Female ejaculation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gay slang The Caves of Androzani Human penis size Whose Line Is It Anyway?
