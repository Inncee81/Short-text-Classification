getting mirena iud this week ok so i am scheduled to get it on wednesday and though i am ashamed to say it last week was the first i had heard of it i have a hard time remembering to take the pill regularly so my doc suggested it and i went onto the website and watched the dvd my doctor gave me but there are still some q's i have someone may be able to help me with how long is the string and what are the odds my husband will feel it i don't want him to be creeped out also has anyone had this removed and had any pregnancy issues because we are planning on getting pregnant again in the next year or two thanks yes i do know it is a year thing but it is also removable so that isn't an issue for me my doc and i discussed that the mirena is a good iud but it is really expensive and if you are only going to keep it in for a year or two try something else try the nuvaring instead the string is usually cut really short and will become softer with time and vaginal secretions he will not know it is there unless you tell him dont tell he'll never know pregnancy sould be be back to normal within the month or so Birth control Pregnancy Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle EastEnders Ectopic pregnancy Back to the Future Friends Abortion debate Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Strap-on dildo Condom Intrauterine device The Shining (film) Breech birth Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Obstetrics Bernice Summerfield Deftones Sharon Tate Dalkon Shield Infertility Days of our Lives In vitro fertilisation Sexual revolution Social rule Oral contraceptive Pelvic inflammatory disease Childbirth Endometriosis Pedophilia Intact dilation and extraction Mattress Theory of conduct Prolactinoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Neighbours The Riordans Sexual intercourse Doctor Emmett Brown Partial-birth abortion Milton H.
