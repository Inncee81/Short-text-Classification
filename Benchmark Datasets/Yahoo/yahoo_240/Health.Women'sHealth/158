bleeding sex and the leep i had the leep procedure done a year and a half ago to remove some abnormal cells from my cervix ever since then everytime i have sex i bleed and cramp and it obviously is not nearly as enjoyable the doctors don't seem to be concerned that i am still bleeding and having these problems i am frustrated obviously has anyone else had this happen or know why this may be happening any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated thanks i had a leep procedure about years ago for the first year or so i always spotted and cramped after sex i still cramp after sex my doctor didn't seemed very concerned about it either but i can tell you what she told me about it she said that everything has healed it is just going to take time for my cervix to be as strong as it was before sex actually exercises the cervix that is how my dr explained it to me when you have sex your cervix contracts and relaxes just like any muscle does when you exercise it so the cramping is the equivalent to a muscle cramp as far as the bleeding goes my dr told me that i would spot because the tissues or my cervix were still very new and young because of the leep that the spotting was just because they were irritated i really hope this helps you your dr should have at least explained what was going on to you Cervical cancer Miscarriage Childbirth Muscle Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Obstetrics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence Colposcopy Fertility awareness Gonorrhoea Cramp Endometriosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Sexual reproduction Cervix Medical analysis of circumcision Puberty Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Massage Endometrial cancer Stroke Intersex surgery Abortion Intact dilation and extraction In vitro fertilisation Chronic fatigue syndrome Premature birth The Caves of Androzani Breech birth First aid Genital wart Fisting Myocardial infarction Erogenous zone Diabetic retinopathy Gynaecology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Atherosclerosis Stem cell Anal sex Female genital cutting Sauna Ventricular fibrillation Healing Medicine Castration Crohn's disease Menstrual cup Cephalic disorder History of intersex surgery Turner syndrome Exercise Multiple sclerosis Skin graft Weight training Hemorrhoid Methamphetamine Transsexuality Uterine fibroids Atrial fibrillation Tourniquet Acne Radiation poisoning Hypnosis Coeliac disease Smallpox Cardiac arrhythmia Cryptorchidism Hysterectomy Surgery Lung cancer Diverticulosis Eye Cystoscopy Asthma Cancer of the larynx Ex-gay Scar Physical therapy Parkinson's disease Acupuncture Placenta praevia Osteoarthritis Sex organ Human sexual response cycle AIDS Eczema Blood
