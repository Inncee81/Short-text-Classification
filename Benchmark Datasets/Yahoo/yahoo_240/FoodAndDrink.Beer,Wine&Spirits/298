champagne tastings i am going to be in reims in march and am interested in doing a champagne tasting i am going to be based in paris so i only have one day for this the houses that i have found reccommended are launois pere et fils mercier alfred gratien perrier jouet pommerier mailey grand cru velve cliquot mumm tattinger and maison veuve cliquot ponsardin naturally i don't have time to see all of these can you reccommend a top btw reims is in the champagne region of france btw reims is in the champagne region of france and is the place for champagne mercier is well worth visiting has a nice tour of its cellars but it is not located in reims but in epernay perrier jouet is in epernay so is alfred gratien launois is not in reims and you need to make an appointment veuve cliquot ponsardin is in reims but you must make an appointment for a tour in advance i am puzzled by the person who recommends veuve cliquot ponsardin but then says to forget veuve cliquot since they are one and the same i never heard of pommerier do you mean pommery mailey grand cru isn't a champagne house it is the name of a vineyard area pere fils just means 'father son' and is like part of a winery name launois pere fils which is in mesnil sur oger mumm is in reims center a short walk from the rail station and has a good tour of the cellars before the tasting taittinger is in reims but quite a long walk from the station it is well worth seeing because it has some incredible old pyramidical cellars hand cut out of the chalk by the romans you will probably find it difficult to do more than two winery visits in one day in reims since you'll want to go on a tour conducted in english you'll probably need mins hours per house i hour for tour mins for tasting and some time in the gift shop etc and they close for lunch i'd plan on mumm taittinger both in reims center and if time pommery which is near taittinger both good tours interesting cellars and very good wines there are some champagne shops in reims by the cathedral which offer tastings the cathedral is very historic and worth seeing and the tourist office next to it has maps of the champagne houses and details of visiting but i suggest you do your research before hand and check when the engllish language tours are running see http www maisons champagne com traduction english limach gb htm for links to teh champagne houses websites if you went to epernay there are many champagne all next to each other down one road and you can walk out of one and right into the next one champagne's biggest market is the uk its less than hours drive from the channel ports so they are very used to english speaking visitors english is widely spoken and all the larger champagne houses speak english you'll have a great time don't forget to order a glass or bottle of champagne with your lunch in reims Champagne (beverage) Reims Wine Champagne-Ardenne __pernay The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rais massacre Cape Town Buckingham Palace History of Test cricket (to 1883) Lake District Montreal Terroir Wall Street Rose (Doctor Who) Cathedral architecture Champagne (province) Palace of Westminster Hobart Allied Domecq Grand Forks, North Dakota Quebec City, Quebec Cork Cider Tours Archbishop of Reims Shaggy dog story Tourism Bruno of Cologne Social rule Francis Bacon (painter) Pacific, Missouri Sydney Riot of 1879 Plame affair Gothic architecture The Death Gate Cycle Anjou Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Louis XIV of France Wines of Portugal Chinese language Pinot Noir About a Boy Chris Amon Picard language 24 Hours of Le Mans Jean-Baptiste Colbert Abbey Tourism in Hawaii Dijon Little Britain Asterix Internet slang France in the Middle Ages LVMH House of Bourbon Philip II of France Braunschweig Shiraz grape Ithaca, New York Isle of Wight The Lovely Bones Manchester Cuisine of Denmark Napa County, California 1991 Governor General's Awards Hampton Roads Brittany Fort Worth, Texas Table tennis Wine bottle Auto racing Canterbury Cathedral Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dallas, Texas Leicester City Centre Hiberno-English Chinatown The Two Doctors Poker jargon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina W.
