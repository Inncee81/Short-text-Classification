why do they never make the bottom of wine bottles flat they always have the huge indentation that takes away half the bottom is there a reason for this there does exist many bottles that have a near flat bottom however to the point stability of strength sedimentation other http pweb netcom com lachenm puntfaq html for sure the number one reason is to relieve stress on the bottle's structure the strength gained by the dimple is best observed in sparkling wines which are under pressure in manufacture engineering of many things it occurs that a crease or dimple relives stress improving that items strength in addition it happens to be a remnant of early bottle produce iv what is the purpose of the punt there have been many different explanations proposed on alt food wine and many people are absolutely certain that their explanation is the only correct one no consensus has been reached on what the true purpose is or even if there actually is only one true explanation for the presence of punts in wine bottles here is a list of the proposed explanations along with some analysis of each one it is a remnant of historical glass blowing techniques and serves no real purpose punts certainly were a result of historical glass blowing techniques the blowpipe was attached to the neck of the bottle and then it was transferred to a tool called a punty a k a punt ponty pontil pointel ponto pontil rod ponte th c which was put on the base of the bottle an indentation was the natural result thanks to dan razzell for an explanation of old glassblowing techniques however whether punts have just survived because of tradition or whether they survived because they have some useful function s is still open for debate as the rest of the list suggests it once had a purpose which was that it made the bottle more stable when standing up hugh johnson mentions this theory in his book vintage the story of wine primitive glassblowing did not approach today's standards of precision making a concave surface which will stand on end is much easier than making a flat one since with just a small manufacturing error a flat surface can become convex causing the bottle to tend to tip over while a concave surface would be just a little less concave and would remain stable as a result concerns about stability may have contributed to the development and retention of the punt this explanation and the first are partly supported by the fact that not all of today's wine bottles have punts punts are certainly not absolutely necessary in wine bottles now though they may have been essential in the past it once had and may still have a purpose which was to strengthen the bottle this explanation supposedly accounts for the deep punts in many sparkling wines there is at least a grain of truth to this since early champagne bottles were weak and breakage due to pressure was a problem however on a previous occasion when this explanation came up there was a long debate about whether the punt actually contributed significantly to the strength of the bottle some people claimed that the weak point in modern bottles is where the base joins the sides and that a punt would have an insignificant effect on the stability of this region i haven't done the calculations on how much a punt would strengthen the base of a bottle myself but i am somewhat skeptical of the importance of any such effect does anyone want to volunteer to do the calculations or know of a reliable source where this topic is covered the reasoning and calculations should address how significant the effect on bottle strength would be including whether the punt strengthens the weakest point in a modern bottle's construction details i have not seen in any arguments to date in any event technology has probably rendered the strength question moot since modern glass is much stronger than the glass used in early bottles on alt food wine michael wilson noted a trend toward shallower punts and thinner glass making the wine bottles lighter thus saving shipping costs and increasing profit margins apparently bottle strength is less of an issue than money nowadays also keep in mind that the strength explanation mainly addresses the issue of punts in bottles of sparkling wine as bottles of still wine can be much weaker it has a purpose for sparkling wines aiding in the stacking of inverted bottles on top of each other this explanation was suggested in the oxford companion to wine st ed p which states that this method of stacking is necessary or at least very helpful for traditional sparkling winemaking i have no reason to believe that this use is untrue but it may have originally been more of a serendipitous discovery than the result of a conscious design also like this reasoning doesn't explain punts in bottles of still wine its purpose is to collect sediment to make the wine easier to decant this certainly doesn't explain punts in sparkling wines nor is it helped by the fact that there are some red wines which do not have punts it may be useful for this purpose but i doubt that sediment collection was the original reason for the design again it seems more likely to me that a use was found for something which already existed i also doubt that it makes a signficant difference in the amount of wine which can be decanted easily if anyone has done a relevant experiment i'd be interested in the results its purpose is to aid in pouring the wine in an elegant fashion in case you haven't seen anyone do this the idea is that you can pour wine by placing one hand on the base holding onto the punt with your thumb i seriously doubt that this is the purpose as there seem to be just as many people who think this is awkward and pretentious as those who think it is elegant and sophisticated however a punt is undoubtedly useful if you want to pour wine this way its purpose is aesthetic and or marketing related a to make the bottle look bigger mentioned in the oxford companion to wine st ed as a possible reason for punts in still wines now we're getting somewhere while this may not have been the original purpose i could see that current marketing and packaging gurus might appreciate the illusion of a bigger bottle b because people expect to see a punt in quality wine since they have always been there somewhat related to reason above again this explanation may certainly be true at least in some cases popular perception is certainly considered to be very important in sales of consumer goods conclusion so after all those possible explanations what is the bottom line possibly many or all of the above explanations contribute to the existence of punts in various wines different producers may have slightly different reasons and a single producer may even use different reasoning for having punts in bottles of different wines over the years each one of these explanations has been proposed by at least one person on alt food wine as being the one true reason behind punts who can say that wine producers don't hold opinions which are equally diverse as those of the wine drinking public personally i favor the idea that the punt was at least at first an accident of early glass blowing technique over time punts probably proved useful for a number of reasons bottle stability when standing stacking sparkling wine while not being strictly necessary for most wines today i believe that the reason for the punt is largely aesthetic people expect to see punts in quality wines due to tradition and the illusion of a larger bottle is probably useful for marketing however since nothing about the issue is truly clear you should feel free to form your own conclusions last revised Jay Gould Long Island Rail Road Corbin, Kentucky Brooklyn Vicky Leandros
