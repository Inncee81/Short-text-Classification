what factors do you consider when selecting a wine is price important is reputation important is the design on the label important many factors involved where where i am having the wine if i were to drink at home it really does not matter just whatever i had left if i were at a restaurant i look at the price and pick out the most cost reasonable bottle for the occasion if i were at a wine bar or winery i pretty much will try anything to discover new and exciting wines who with whom am i drinking if i were with my drinking friends then i would be drinking high quality cab or merlot if i were at a party champagne may be at order i tend to pick out wines that other people like and i would drink to that quality life is too short to drink cheap wines more specifically cheaply made wines what we want is good priced wine without sacrificing quality on special occasions i would open very nice wines but on regular occasions i want good quality wines that would complement the food there is nothing worse than a nice dinner with bad wines as for the definition of quality it is pretty much based on experience and reading price price is important in general an expensive wine are wines that are well made but not necessarily good wine the pricing of the wine is based on factors how much the vineyard and the winery put into making the wine and how they feel the wine is worth needless to say great wine that are highly sought after are expensive also it also depends on where i get the wine wines at restaurants are at least times the retail price wine at sam's and costco's are below retail prices so when i am out at a restaurant i tend not to order the expensive stuff unless someone else is paying vintage what vintage is the wine from certain year is better than others this is especially important when drinking older wines some wines may be too old and not good for drinking also if you are planning to cellar your wine you will want to get the better vintages which means you can cellar the wines longer reputation reputation is important in general a good winery will continue to make good wines there are some vineyard winery that has horrible rating yet we keep on supporting them due to prior reputation best exampmle is chateau montelena which gets horrible rating from wine spectator for several years but we keep on buying and drinking their wines when a winery keeps on producing bad wines we avoid them like plague recommendation i buy a lot of wine and quite a number of them were purchased based on recommendation from the wine salespeople who knows me and whom i trust from articles in wine magazines from word of mouth the fact is that there are too many wines out there and no one can possible drink every single wine there is so sometimes you will have to have faith and trust someone's recommendation rating the same goes with rating you have to take the rating with grain of salt rating from wine spectator and wine advocate and robert parker etc are good guide but everyone like their wines differently so what's good for mr bob parker may not be good for you in fact there are some suspicion that the rating at some of the magazines may be influenced by the amount of advertisement placed within the magazine unfortunately design of the bottle and design of the label are not important at all these are mere gimmicks to attract the less educated wine public to buy their wines we avoid a lot of the critter wines wine with animals on the label Brewery Beer Brewing Wine making Sake Cider Lambic Lager Tofu Yeast Rum Wheat beer Bock Milk Coffee Wine Ethanol Fermentation Tea Alcoholic beverage Basic taste Cuisine of the Philippines Vinegar Egg (food) Honey K__lsch (beer) Rooibos Cuisine of Denmark Guinness Acetic acid Ale Moonshine Yoghurt Biochemistry Belgian beer Breakfast Guinea pig Russian cuisine German beer Kombucha Diseases of the honeybee Vitamin C Cellular respiration Champagne (beverage) Iron Food Reinheitsgebot Alcohol fuel Keg Cheese Japanese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Water Vodka Candidiasis Yarrow Enzyme Breastfeeding Chocolate German cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food science Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Veganism Idli Budweiser Budvar Mead Social rule Pisco Pilsener Distilled beverage Hard water Lactobacillus acidophilus Chicha Carburetor Honeybee Tattoo Dog Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Grog Tempeh HIV test Fire extinguisher Prion Singlish Mango Garlic India Pale ale Fungus Wine degustation
