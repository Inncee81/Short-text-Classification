why do some cultures insist on every beer being ice cold at all times do they not appreciate the taste i mean come on it isn't an ice cream don't get me wrong a cold lager on a hot day is great but there's a line to be drawn it isn't ever good to have ice cold beer the very hot day may be an exception as cold beverages are great indeed some beer styles are meant to be cold examples given above pilsener is a good example it is brewed cold and so is served cold a proper serving temperature being about f american style pilsner are another example other styles are brewed warmer and so are served warmer ales pale ale ipa porters stouts etc i enjoy most all beers and i do not like them ice cold edit soon origin i think you are corect sir it is the marketing of the brewers large brewers and it is tied to the invention of refrigeration back in the day beer was warm due to the fact we had no refer even the cold brewerd pils were served warm the first commercial refers were utilized by establishments such as bars due to their expense brewers ceased upon this and marketed the idea of cold beer and when technology converged packaging cans bottles with home refegeration the cold beer craze hit the brewers ceased upon this and marketed the idea of cold beer at home entertaing etc it was a bit of a status symbol to have a refer we americans really take things to the extreme ales lagers temperature ales are fermented at about f and lagers about f with some variation and so we tend to associate drinking the beers at these temperatures i think it is marketing status and preference that contribute to the myth the ice cold beer is best a beer lesson some people think that the words beer lager ale signify completely different things but that is not true we we talk about beer it needs to be understood that there exists two categories one is ales and the other is lagers ales and lagers are both types of beer beers both ales and lagers have many styles some examples of ales are pale ale india pale ale bitter light ale brown ales porter and stout and alt some examples of lagers are pilsener american style pilsner oktoberfest vienna munich and bock there are many more for each category Cigar Lager Brewing Mexican beer Nicaragua Toyota Camry Wheat beer Dominican Republic Homebrewing Caribbean PHP Brewery Beer K__lsch (beer) Toyota Corona Queens Samuel Adams (beer) Ribeir__o Preto Punk rock President of Mexico Real ale Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Guinness President of India Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ludacris USS Washington (ACR-11) Prime Minister Taiwan Beer Oktoberfest Make money fast Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Republic of Texas President of Finland Draught beer Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement Cantus Sake Corona, New Mexico Mexico at the 2004 Summer Olympics Weimar Republic Miller Brewing Roger Ebert's most hated films Sun Jos__ Figueres Ferrer Moe Szyslak Stout beer Central African Republic President of the Church (Mormonism) Ultraviolet Roswell UFO incident Corona, California Francisco Pizarro ECW One Night Stand National dish Canadian beer Politics of Brazil Bitter (beer) Wine Frankfurt USS Arkansas (BB-33) German beer Duff Beer Belgian beer British comedy Corona Shandy Norway national football team About a Boy Tap (valve) Munich Grog Gin Guadeloupe European Commission USS Independence (CV-62) Near beer ROC presidential election, 2004 Irish diaspora Double Nickels on the Dime Cologne Pilsener Bread Joke President of the United States Monroe Doctrine Edwin Rosario Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China Dean O'Banion Music Hall Big Brother (TV series) Solar eclipse The Simpsons President of Germany Malt liquor Flag of Belarus Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) ROC legislative election, 2004 Monterrey Abraham Goldfaden
