does anyone have any wine suggestions we have tried a few recently we prefer sweet wines to bitter or dry just hate to keep buying the same one over and over there are a lot of wonderful wines out there to try you just have to keep on trying to find the wines you might like here are some recommendations from me as for white wines for beginners i usually recommend sauvignon blanc and riesling sauvignon blanc tends to be fruity slightly sweet and crisp and easy to drink i always enjoy drinking a glass of sauvignon blanc such as duckhorn sauvignon blanc caymus conundrum or chateau st michelle as for riesling it is usually sweeter but also plenty of fruit i recommend either californian or german a good one to start is bonny doon pacific riesling either dry or sweet as for red wine i would recommend either cabernet franc or zinfandel cabernet franc is slightly sweet red wine with quality resembling that of cabernet sauvignon or merlot but without such bitterness there are a few good cabernet franc including peju and titus as for zinfandel that is much more reasily accesible and available as well as cheaper zinfandel is the grape that also makes white zinfandel without the grape skin the wine is sweeter with grape skin it is more complex red zinfandel or zinfandel as we call it is a wonderful slightly sweet wine with lots of fruit berry but they also tend to be higher on alcohol content you can try zinfandel from chateau montelena frank's rosemblum and ridge if you want the really sweet wine then try dessert wine white dessert wine such as ice wine inniskilling and sauturnes chateau rieussec or their second wine half are very nice to drink after dinner while red dessert wine hands down is best represented by port sandeman and dow makes some cheaper port costing good luck and keep on trying i hope you will find something you will like from this Brandy Cognac (drink) Rum Cognac Armagnac (drink) Pisco Wine Beer The Amazing Race Hennessy Single malt Scotch Champagne (beverage) Coffee Plastic Tequila Bock Snap-dragon (game) Scotch whisky Trailer Park Boys Soft drink Pernod Ricard Sake Characters from A Song of Ice and Fire Fortune Brands Allied Domecq Moe Szyslak Make money fast Flat tax Poker jargon Knots Landing AVN Awards Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Chocolate United States dollar Boyz II Men Autonomous building Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
