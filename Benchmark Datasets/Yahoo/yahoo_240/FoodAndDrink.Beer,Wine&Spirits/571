this is a two part question about wine first what is a sulfite second what is thepurpose of a cork i bought some wine that didnt have a cork does that have anything to do with the quality of the wine but what is a sulfite first the cork a cork is just a cap stopper it is the soft bark of a tree it was used for its ability to seal jugs and bottles in the past people would judge a wines quality by whether it had a cork or not today that is not the case many very good quality wines around the world are using synthetic plastic corks also now in vague is twist caps for the same good wines all wines contain sulfites sulfites are created naturally as a byproduct of fermentation in the wine making process and they have also been added by wine makers for decades as a natural preservative unfortunately a very tiny proportion of people are allergic to sulfites a dangerous and potentially fatal allergy sulfite sensitive individuals who have survived into adulthood know what they must avoid a list that includes wine fruit juice sausages salad bars and many other foodstuffs that routinely use sulfiting in production although the threat is small the u s food and drug administration fda has required since that all foodstuffs containing more than parts per million of sulfites which includes virtually all wines must bear a warning label wines made in the u s may contain as much as parts per million an extreme level rarely attained except perhaps in cheap jug wines at which point the sulfur may be perceptible as a pungent aroma resembling a burnt match some processed foods in contrast contain up to parts per million relax do not worry about sulsites or corks just enjoy Wal-Mart Slide rule Auction Amazon.com Bong Philatelic investment Topps The Towering Inferno (film) Neopets Craps Magic: The Gathering Online Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bowls Internet fraud Autograph MAME Hypermarket Shen Gong Wu Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) ASDA Super Mario Bros. 3 Naval mine Carnival glass Electronic commerce Austin Powers GunBound Conker's Bad Fur Day Dot-com Online auction business model John F.
