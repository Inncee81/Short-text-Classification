anyone know how i can get gain or make a kegerator for my home bar low cost don't really want to drop plus on a unit but i would really enjoy one for the upcoming football season to include in my home bar well you have many options here not knowing what you are willing to spend may be hard to find the right match for you first my local wal mart has them in stock for but on website they list for so not sure if my store reduced it to get rid of it or what but try there first i bought my first kegerator through the classified ads in my home town granted i lived in a college town and they were common place so in would suggest if you live near a college town check the classifieds online for one check with your local restaurant supply house they often go to restuarant auctions and by used equipment you may get lucky and they may have one now this last option will depend you can try and find an old frig someone is selling and convert it over but depending upon space you have may not be practial if it is then you can drill hole through door just need to by the coupler valve stem faucet hoses regulator and co tank this would be ideal if your wanting a barrell for pony kegs you can go with a smaller frig but not a micro they aren't wide enough if you do decide to try and make one yourself you will need to measure an empty keg and get the width of it then allow for an extra inches in the width of your frig interior it will need those inches on either side to allow airflow otherwise you are dealing with foamy beer i suggest the first options first if you make one your self your still spending a lot of money for all the hoses and other equipment necessary good luck and pour one for me when you get it Alcoholism Cocktail Cardiac arrhythmia Alcoholic beverage Allergy Chlorpromazine Alcohol Ethylene glycol Sulfasalazine Urinary incontinence Rash Diarrhea Red Bull Disulfiram Drink Oreo Aspartame Hypoglycemia Distilled beverage Moonshine Martini cocktail Addiction Food Wine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Cannabis (drug) Decompression sickness Drug addiction Anaphylaxis Rum Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Drunk driving (United States) Flecainide Veganism Maprotiline Tea Trazodone Lupus erythematosus Hangover Soft drink Prohibition First aid Hay fever Gout Enzyme Caffeine Healthy eating Insulin Clomipramine Word of Wisdom Stroke Penicillin Doxepin Methamphetamine Propranolol Hiccup Russian cuisine Psoriasis Isoniazid Vomiting Long Island Iced Tea Port wine Cirrhosis Amiodarone Homeopathy Molotov cocktail Hyperthermia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tachycardia Sake Buprenorphine Drug abuse Medicine Salmiakki Koskenkorva Irn-Bru Cancer Asthma Dairy Haloperidol Paracetamol Cider Cacha__a Food allergy Atkins Nutritional Approach Immune system Beer Panic attack Bong LSD Cephalexin AIDS Diazepam Coffee Shock Alcoholics Anonymous Citalopram
