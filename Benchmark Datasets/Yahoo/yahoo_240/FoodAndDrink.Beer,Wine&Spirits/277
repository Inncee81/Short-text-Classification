how much beer will it take to get a monkey drunk like a chimpanzee for example yes its a stupid question and don trip im jus curious the short answer is that it would only take about one or two beers to get a chimp drunk be sure to hide his car keys and any sharp objects because chimps get mean and stubborn when they're drunk according to the national geographic website the average weight for a chimp is to lbs to kg alcohol is metabolized by your liver your liver's size is proportionate to your body size a chimp would have a much smaller liver than an adult human several factors are involved such as height weight gender and food recently ingested but in general the human body can absorb mg deciliter of alcohol per hour on average that's the amount of alcohol contained in one oz beer or one oz glass of wine or one oz shot of hard liquor so if you drank enough to blow a in a state where the legal limit is it would take hours for the alcohol to be absorbed so you could drive legally common chimpanzees have been known to attack humans on occasion there have been many attacks in uganda by chimpanzees against human children the results are sometimes fatal for the children some of these attacks are presumed to be due to chimpanzees being intoxicated from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations and mistaking human children for the western red colobus one of their favorite meals the dangers of careless human interactions with chimpanzees are only aggravated by the fact that many chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals and by the fact that the average chimpanzee has over times the upper body strength of a human male local beer is usually brewed illegally along river valleys which are also the habitat of chimps when chimps come across the local brew they drink it become drunk and in that state any encounter with people means an attack hope that answers your question to see some very funny videos type in 'drunk chimp' into yahoo video search or youtube Alcoholic beverage Common Chimpanzee Hypoglycemia Blood alcohol content Human Ethanol Moonshine Sake Coffee Caffeine Prohibition Wine Beer Paracetamol Cocaine Alcohol French cuisine Drunk driving (United States) Public house Drinking culture Chimpanzee Chimpanzee Genome Project Jane Goodall Soft drink Liver Cannabis (drug) Growth hormone treatment Insulin Breastfeeding Tocopherol Folic acid Weight training Evidence of evolution Coeliac disease Cider Gravity Penis Contract Milk Cancer Nutrition Food Dieting Legal drinking age Puberty Water Driving under the influence Rum Malt liquor Miller Brewing Bodybuilding Autism Canadian slang Animal testing Homer Simpson Absinthe LSD Vomiting Distilled beverage Depleted uranium Bonobo Brewery Suicide methods Growth hormone Chocolate Digital photography Word of Wisdom Race Blood Olduwan Cognitive bias Rape Cirrhosis Cuisine of Denmark Mothers Against Drunk Driving The Mind of an Ape Foodborne illness Anemia Australian words Ebola Fugu Human sexual behavior Glucokinase Non-medical use of dextromethorphan American Sign Language Tea Aspartame Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atkins Nutritional Approach Human height Brown Bear Moe Szyslak Sauna Road traffic accident Sewage treatment
