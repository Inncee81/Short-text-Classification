why does this happen whenever i drink hard liquor i get belligerent i grew up in a rural area where it was the norm to get drunk and find a good fight i hated it and left there and like to think that i am more enlightened these days i am one of the friendliest kindest people that you could ever meet and yet if i have whiskey i seem to seek trouble and violence i am really perplexed by this i don't have to struggle to control my temper when i am sober i rarely ever get angry and i don't ever want to hurt anyone i rarely ever drink once last year i think what is going on with me there are happy drunks and angry drunks you are the latter sounds like if you only drink once a year anyway you could just quit all together and avoid the whole problem or drink just a little a little more often and see if you can feel the problem coming on at some point instead of getting rip snortin' drunk just once in a while and not realize you're angry until it's too late sorry for the terrible grammar New Coke Coca-Cola Soft drink Brandy Daz Dillinger Cognac (drink) Rum Equal Rights Amendment Diet Coke Pete Rock Beer Desire (album) The Marshall Mathers LP Brandy (entertainer) Edward Coke The Relapse United States House of Representatives Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Drink Janet Jackson Vanilla Coke Long Island Iced Tea Pisco Alcoholic beverage Pepsi-Cola Wine Andy Warhol Killing Joke The Coca-Cola Company Prisoner (TV series) Serbian cuisine Grog Parliament of Canada My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Quizbowl Earl of Leicester Barbara Boxer Cuba Libre Britney Spears May 2005 in Canada Louie, Louie Street Smarts (game show) Patrick Star Coffee Sewage treatment The Basement Tapes $ale of the Century Slayers The Glass House (TV series) Whisky Radio Yerevan What's My Line?
