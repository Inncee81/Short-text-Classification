is this considered too much drinking my parents both come home from work and immediately start drinking sometimes they only finish half a bottle of wine and other nights they finish a whole bottle and or multiple cocktails some nights more than others i can tell when they have been drinking because there personality changes and i can barely stand to talk to them i have tried telling them that they need to cut back on drinking but they tell me that it makes them happy and they deserve it they won't listen to me and sometimes they just laugh at me what can i do or say to change this please help thanks a drug alcohol abuse professional would say that drinking more than glasses of wine in a sitting is alcohol abuse most people who have a drinking problem have to realize it on there own so confronting them often doesn't work however this does not mean that you should not try i would suggest getting other family members involved if you feel it is that bad if you have siblings talk to them about it if not try an aunt or uncle Blood alcohol content Urine Urinary incontinence Drunk driving (United States) Hepatitis Dehydration Alcoholism Cocaine Hypoglycemia Urinary system Housebreaking Caffeine Drinking Gout Drug test Urination Driving under the influence Disinfection Diabetes insipidus Prostate cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Urolagnia Drink Distilled beverage Leptospirosis Kidney stone Hong Kong Disneyland Driver's license Flunitrazepam Cystoscopy Alcohol Halitosis Energy drink Pregnancy Carbon tetrachloride Marathon (sport) Diabetes mellitus Dutch Schultz Drunkenness Porphyria Alcoholic beverage Diuretic Urinalysis Hyperthermia Bar (establishment) Adolf Hitler's medical health Ethanol Trimipramine Breathalyzer Fluoride Pneumonia Dairy Soft drink Legal drinking age Paracetamol Kidney Cirrhosis Liver function tests Benzene LSD Skylab 3 Urine therapy Cocktail Dexamethasone Laika Public house Human chorionic gonadotropin Paget's disease of bone Urinary tract infection Richard Chase 1,4-dichlorobenzene Diazepam Doping (sport) Birthday Bupropion Forensic toxicology Pregnancy test Cancer Coffee Coca-Cola Binge drinking Alcoholics Anonymous Medical analysis of circumcision Depleted uranium Mothers Against Drunk Driving Blackcurrant Hyperglycemia Hangover Body piercing Prohibition Jim Morrison Polyethylene terephthalate Shaggy dog story Mountain Dew Phenylketonuria Alcohol advertising Ultraviolet Glucose tolerance test STS-58 Sugar alcohol
