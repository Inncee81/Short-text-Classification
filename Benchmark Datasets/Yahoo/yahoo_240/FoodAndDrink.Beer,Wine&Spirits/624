ok so i'm not talking about getting drunk but literally everyone i know at my school uses drinkning for relaxation purposes and a lot of them have these crazy drunk stories and we're all about they all have this way about them that's so different now then it was before and i'm the only one staying sober at all the parties let's face it everyone now drinks but i don't want to underage and i can't lie to my parents but it just feels like i'm being so pressured i know maybe it's just all in my head but still having a buzz is different and it seems like there's this wall forming that i can't penatrate without alcohol what's the big friggin deal what's so sexy about having a drink and why is everyone just going with it and drinking i can't really wrap my brain around that one i would say definitely stick to not drinking it can lead to all kinds of problems when you are not old enough to make adult decisions like having sex driving drunk etc stick to your ideals and listen to your inner voice they will serve you well Beer Bock Lager Miller Brewing Stout beer Guinness Brewery Canadian beer Brewing Gin Victoria Bitter Cascade Brewery Sake Molson Hop (plant) American lager Australian beer Bread K__lsch (beer) Australian English Theory of conduct Mead Burton-upon-Trent Root beer Rum Hoser Australian words Oktoberfest Carlton & United Beverages XXXX Drinking culture I Am Canadian Lion Nathan Alcoholic beverage Public house Ron and Fez Vegemite Pale ale Homebrewing Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Alcohol advertising Lambic Beneath a Steel Sky German beer Cider Coffee Milwaukee, Wisconsin Root beer float Prohibition Darwin, Northern Territory Beer Pong Samuel Smith (brewery) Wheat beer Duff Beer Heuristic Small beer Princeton University Pilsener Tag question Leffe Hiberno-English Ale Bitter (beer) Conan the Barbarian Hard water Rice University Isinglass Cuisine of Denmark British cuisine Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends Patent medicine Canadian slang Ontological argument Ben Johnson (athlete) Singlish Budweiser Budvar Chappelle's Show Anheuser-Busch Moonshine Debugging India Pale ale World Universities Debating Championship Fanta Beer garden Canada Dry Rugby football Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Beer Bad (Buffy episode) Vinegar Philosophical skepticism True Crime: Streets of LA Barq's Rolling Rock Open source Cockney
