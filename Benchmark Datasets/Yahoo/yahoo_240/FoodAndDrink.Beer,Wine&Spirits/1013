alcohol consumption if two average weight teenage girls were to drink wo bottles of wine and a tequila shooter would they get a little drunk or just buzzed doc i'm sure two yr old girls would enjoy that i'd cutt the barbies heads off and send them to you in the mail eat me a lb man would get pretty drunk off of a single bottle ml of red wine assuming it is real wine and not boones farm or some other nonsense therefore i would suspect that a teenage girl would get smashed off a bottle no need for the tequila shooters again depends on if you are talking about real wine or not i suggest you start out by splitting a bottle and take it from there don't guzzle the wine just drink a few glasses when you get buzzed have another glass i really doubt you will need to try out the tequila don't drive don't put yourself in a risky situation i e having guy friends over who you normally wouldn't hook up with etc good luck Hooters 1985 World Series Waiter Martini cocktail __douard Manet Arcade cabinet Smoking ban Welcome to Pia Carrot Bar (establishment) Tokyo Mew Mew 1982 World Series American Airlines Anchorage, Alaska Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway Counts and dukes of Bar Moe Szyslak Don the Beachcomber Bloody Mary (cocktail) Chuck Berry 1987 World Series Cocktail The Mirror Crack'd Dawson's Creek Han twins murder conspiracy As Good as It Gets McCarran International Airport Soho About Last Night (film) Rebreather Colorado Springs, Colorado Dog agility Viva Ned Flanders Ron and Fez Cuba Libre Daiquiri NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Bartender T.
