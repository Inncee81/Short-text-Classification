i'm a huge wine drinker and i was just wondering if u like ur wine warm or chilled all wine should be drank at degrees f temperature white wines can be served on lower temperature in degrees while red wines are traditionally served at room temperature ie room temperature in europe which are typically in the 's and 's no the same as the room temperature here that can get up to 's or more sometimes if you drink the wine too warm all you can taste and smell is the alcohol which will cover the intricacy and delicacy of the wine if you drink the wine too cold the flavor and the alcohol will not come out it is very tricky which is the reason there are many products out there that measures the temperature of the wine prior to serving you should try the same wine at different temperature and see the difference Miller Brewing Alcohol advertising Public house Alcoholic beverage Prohibition Anheuser-Busch Soft drink Beer Coffee Drink Wine Coffeehouse Guinness Alcoholism Root beer Sportsman's Park Duff Beer Moonshine Cider Milwaukee, Wisconsin Alcohol Malt liquor French cuisine Redneck Drinking game Brewing Drunkenness Drinking culture Rum Beer Pong Distilled beverage Rice University Rainier Brewing Company Sake Alcopop Near beer Diet soda Gin Molson Caffeine Ale Tea Lemonade Disneyland Mothers Against Drunk Driving New Coke Word of Wisdom Mexican beer Energy drink Cacha__a Sherbet Quarters Legal drinking age Lager Champagne (beverage) Australian words Samuel Adams (beer) Busch Stadium Blood alcohol content American lager Chocolate Pisco Anchor Brewing Company Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Peruvian cuisine Coca-Cola Root beer float Gatorade Patent medicine Temperance movement Red Bull Systembolaget Hot sauce RuneScape quests Rutgers University Kurt Busch Freeze distillation Beer Hall Putsch The Coca-Cola Company Korean cuisine Grog Dot matrix printer Hangover Copula Saint Louis, Missouri Vodka Porter (beer) Plastic Law of value Liquor store British cuisine __douard Manet Nineteen Eighty-Four Shaggy dog story President (game) Bogan Beverage can stove Oregon Drinking Beer Bad (Buffy episode)
