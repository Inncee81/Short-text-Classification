how do i determine if a scotch whisky i have is valuable i have an old bottle of bell's blended scotch whisky extra special that is numbered before i drink it i would like to know if it may be valuable it was given to me by my wife's grandma and it is very old your bottle is about us worth it is no necessarily cheap but not spectacular either scotch like most alcoholic drinks is a source of blind and sometimes ignorant snobism a blended scotch is on the most part done to make a passable product of a less desirable one however that is not always the truth jw blue label is a blend that can hold its own to any single malt scotch now single malt scotches mean diddly squat other that being a localized product whose quality depends entirely on the producing house a few are exceptional some are good most are crap another way to put it is a blend is made out of single malts if all single malts were good then how come the blend is bad there are some very good single malts that have the character of the region they are produced in but it is not a rule i'd take a jw black over a lot of single malts any day of the week and twice on sundays the age as hironymus very well points out is established a bottling being a destilled product it doesn't age after that a twelve year scotch will be twelve forever once bottled so drink up and enjoy Scotch whisky Single malt Scotch Whisky Johnnie Walker William Grant & Sons Glenfiddich Beer Alcoholic beverage Irish whiskey Champagne (beverage) Canadian whisky Rum Bourbon whiskey Cider Wine Talisker Single Malt Prohibition Glenmorangie Single Malt Port wine Cognac (drink) Guinness Milkshake Moonshine Humphrey Bogart Irn-Bru Brewery Pisco Ardbeg Tea Diageo Coffee Tequila Bock Poker jargon Brewing Malt liquor Blackjack President (game) Barley Wick, Highland Homebrewing Mead TLC Bong Microeconomics Theory of conduct Oasis (band) Genericized trademark Public domain Social rule Jenever Miller Brewing Diving cylinder Pernod Ricard Alcoholics Anonymous National Football League Vitasoy Scotland Tai shogi Biodiesel Goodness and value theory Polyethylene terephthalate Chess opening Coopers Brewery Olive oil Manic Street Preachers Absinthe Sake Trademark Suit (cards) Single Transferable Vote Porgy and Bess Energy drink Porter (beer) Ron Weasley Craps Manifold Brian May Milk Public house Drawing UK Singles Chart Fiddler on the Roof Peter Griffin Ra (board game) Co-Dependent's Day Gasoline The Wack Pack Yuengling Anthony Burgess Coca-Cola K__lsch (beer) Casablanca (film) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Scottish Highlands Kosher foods Vinegar Dodge Charger Brandy Tobacco
