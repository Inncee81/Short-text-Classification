when homebrewing an english stout can i use a glass carboy for the initial fermentation i've looked to various resources and seen different answers some instructions say the glass carboy is for the secondary fermentation racking however with a stout i don't think i'm going to do a secondary fermentation i have an autosiphon so transferring isn't an issue i'm worried about the pressure from the active ferment and the possibility of a glass shrapnel bomb in my basement if my co valve gets blocked any ideas experiences to share thanks generally people start homebrewing with the bare necessities because the equipment costs can add up when getting started so the starting equipment is usually a bucket and a carboy plastic buckets are slightly oxygen permeable so while they work fine for primary fermentation when co production is high and there is a slight positive pressure within the bucket they can allow some oxidising when used for secondary fermentation and have the possibility of hurting the final flavors this is why glass is recommended over plastic for secondary however using glass for primary is a step up so you're always going to win using glass for both primary and secondary your carboy will not explode if your airlock gets plugged up it will be ejected from the neck of the carboy before the carboy will break it's still possible and for that reason a lot of people who do primary in carboys will use a blowoff tube instead of an airlock when the bubbles and the foam gets too vigorous it will just blow off into a bucket of water instead of clogging up and possibly blowing off your airlock besides i like blowoff tubes because the bubbling amuses me Oktoberfest Glastonbury Festival Edinburgh Fringe 613 mitzvot Restaurant Eucharist Isle of Wight Festival 1970 Cuisine of Denmark Passover Foxwoods Resort Casino Cliff Richard PIC microcontroller Woodstock Festival Hobart Wine Zellers French cuisine Asti Falls Festival Jewish holiday Filling station Kiddush King City, Ontario Supermarket Brittany Jerez de la Frontera Slayers Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Oasis (band) Burning Man Woodstock 1999 The Times Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife Oxegen Convenience store Patricia Ford Bl__t Agritourism Lollapalooza Kylie Minogue Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Britney Spears C__line Dion Blue __yster Cult Moscow Coimbra Quebec City, Quebec Isle of Wight Microeconomics Southwest Airlines Public transport Eid ul-Fitr Walt Disney World College Program East Carolina University $ale of the Century Khatushyamji Beef noodle soup Eucharistic discipline Movie theater Icod de los Vinos Burger King Thanksgiving Oregon Country Fair UB40 The Darkness Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Culture of Korea Champagne (beverage) Vinegar Green Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election Wright Amendment San Fernando City, Pampanga Octopus card Hungry ghost Supply and demand Korean cuisine Jewish cuisine Zagreb Australian jazz National Day Parade Cheese Halloween Food and Drug Administration Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Big Brother UK series 6 Vienna RuneScape skills Magic: The Gathering Online Sears Holdings Corporation Animal Farm Wheel of Fortune Lottery Microsoft Office The Who discography Let's Make a Deal Airline Adelaide Film Festival Renaissance Fair Robert M.
