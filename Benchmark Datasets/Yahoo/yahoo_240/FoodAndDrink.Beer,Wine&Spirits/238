is it a good idea to open a beer hall i want to find some way to do it cheap and simple so i thought just a big hall selling beer might work anything to keep initial costs down no frills no dark lighting no signs just a normal beer hall and beer garden and no fancy names either just beer hall any suggestions no seriously we can launch it as a very simple endeavor and then add the frills later as we go but whatever frills you think people like p lease let me know if you can i think this is a fine idea germany supports thousands of beer halls i'd start small maybe max occupancy just have tables and benches so that strangers are forced to sit next to one another encourage singing and dancing on the benches like oktoberfest have live and prerecorded music including some ein prosit type tunes that periodically make people clink neighbors glasses and take a swallow sounds like fun to me __douard Manet Palace of Westminster Oktoberfest Munich Music Hall EasyGroup Wheat beer Tony Bennett Ryanair Guinness Dundas Square Video game music Public house Compact audio cassette Bread Lager Karaoke Aerial (dance move) Aldi Brewery Frilled shark Parliament House, Canberra Cuisine of Denmark Treehouse of Horror V German beer Beer in Serbia and Montenegro Ludacris Wine Mickey Mouse Roxette Show of Hands Hash table Beer Hall Putsch Popular music RISC Computer Ale PHP Avenue Q Willie Nelson Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Beer I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Alcoholic beverage Yale University Bong Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Conveyor belt sushi Leasing Make money fast Diamond Amusement park Princeton University Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Emergency preparedness Music of Ireland Roaring Twenties Freestyle music Bock Stuttgart Late Night with Conan O'Brien Shaggy dog story Beer garden Sauna Heavy metal music Bee Gees Disney's California Adventure Garfield Rathfarnham The Time Machine Extreme Programming Spot the Dog Mnemonic Law of value Biberach an der Ri__ Miller Brewing Kylie Minogue Fischer Random Chess Hall & Oates Blood on the Tracks No frills ABBA President (game) The Ashlee Simpson Show Mixtape The Beach Boys Abraham Goldfaden Hungarian language Disneyland Weimar Republic Whose Line Is It Anyway?
