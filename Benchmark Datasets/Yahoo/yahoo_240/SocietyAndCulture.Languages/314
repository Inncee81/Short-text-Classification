teaching a child another language i want to teach my month old hebrew because i was born raised in israel my adoptive family doesn't speak it though and they say he should learn english first then hebrew i think he should learn hebrew first because he'll be around english all his life what should i do i've heard it's better to teach the other language first is this true sorry i was when i left israel and i had to leave for personal reasons i came from an upper class family and had learned a little bit of english but i had a tutor to profect it i do speak hebrew fluently but my adoptive family never learned because i spoke enough english to get by with them it is possible for you to teach your son hebrew you only have to stick to speaking hebrew to him solely no english the acquisition of english will come naturally through your surroundings and your adoptive family is not right with the claim that he should learn english first that would only make it harder for you to teach him hebrew the problem with bilingual children is that they start feeling uncomfortable about their bilingualism once they detect that they are different from other children usually the reaction to this is that they refuse to speak the foreign language for a while but they still understand it they can also reactivate the foreign language again if they want this problem is intensified when the foreign language lacks prestige in the surrounding environment as it seems to be in your case as the children feel even more awkward but don't let this put you off your plan and don't let your adoptive family put you off your plan he's your son you can teach him what you want just stick to this speak only hebrew to him prepare yourself for the day when he starts refusing it stay calm and confident this is just a phase if you persistently stick to hebrew he'll get back to it too good luck Second language acquisition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Adoption Non-native pronunciations of English Esperanto as an international language Avenue Q Pitaten German language English language Noam Chomsky Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Education in the United States Education in Germany Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Trinity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gender-neutral language Theory of conduct Israel Chinese language Bilingual education Hearing impairment International English Education in Romania Scientology beliefs and practices Names of God in Judaism Autism Stuttering Book of Isaiah Justification (theology) Ten Commandments Hebrew alphabet Family name Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Constructed language Finnish language Education in the People's Republic of China Philosophy of language Infantilism Melting pot Idolatry American Sign Language Jewish languages Holy Spirit God and gender Kodocha Who is a Jew?
