why can some people imitate other accents and sounds while others really suck at it it has alot to do with your listening skills for example when most people are learning a new language there are sounds and accents they cannot interpret hear diphthongs two vowels joined to make a new sound are common culprits they often produce sounds that are very unfamiliar also is accent in stress for example asian languages depend on accent and stress it is why white people make fun of the way they talk however unless you can stop giggling i mean you beavis long enough to hear and duplicate those accents you will never speak the language well enough to be understood except by the most tolerant of listeners but seriously that is the reason why you'll find that people who cannot hear and duplicate sounds and accents are also people who will misunderstand things in conversation or mis speak themselves Vowel Non-native pronunciations of English Italian language Welsh language Hearing impairment Finnish language Dutch language Tone (linguistics) Phoneme Greek language Spanish language Regional accents of English speakers Southern American English English English American English Gothic language Indonesian language Danish language Polish language New York-New Jersey English Varieties of Arabic Serbo-Croatian language Pinyin Singlish Second language acquisition English phonology Meter (poetry) Korean language Hindi French language Australian English Hong Kong English Acute accent English language Romanian phonology Hangul Standard Mandarin Apostrophe (mark) Koine Greek Canadian English Scouse Standard Cantonese Chinese language Latin spelling and pronunciation Spanish dialects and varieties Grave accent Hungarian language Vowel length Portuguese language Slovenian language Stuttering Arabic alphabet New Zealand English Stress (linguistics) Silent E English as an additional language Old French Syllable Romanian language Philosophy of language Vulgar Latin Czech language Diphthong Languages in Star Wars Arabic language Japanese language Old Norse language Kapampangan language Lithuanian language Esperanto Esperanto phonology R__maji Yorkshire dialect and accent Hebrew language Irish language California English Thai language Australian English phonology Welsh English Irish phonology Japanese phonology History of the English language Swedish phonology Phonology Aramaic language English-language vowel changes before historic r Hiberno-English Liaison Aphasia Somali language Brazilian Portuguese Diaeresis Sound change
