is the welsh language hard to learn to put it plainly it is not the easiest language around it has an unusual writing system with some annoying irregularities albeit one that is far more logical than english's mishmash and a vocabulary and grammar that on the whole are incredibly foreign to the anglophone student the dreaded consonant mutations where his cat ei gath her cat ei chath and their cat eu cath all have different starting consonants is a major part of the learning process nonetheless it is not ridiculously complicated and is less difficult than many languages if you can get used to a nearly entirely foreign vocabulary the verb system isn't so difficult all versions of the language other than the literary standard which is barely ever spoken make heavy use of periphrastic verbs i e where 'i sing' and 'you sing' are 'dw i'n canu' and 'rwyt ti'n canu' basically the conjugated verb 'bod' to be followed by 'n and the infinitive verb so when you learn bod it is very easy to write thousands of phrases in the present and there are periphrastic verbs for other tenses too in any rate welsh is really rewarding and in my opinion one of the most stunning languages to communicate in dymuniadau da c s Welsh language English verbs English grammar English language Ancient Greek Slovak language Infinitive Bulgarian language Polish language Dutch language Portuguese language Japanese language Esperanto as an international language Korean language Danish language Greek language Hungarian language Sindarin Non-native pronunciations of English Hindi Latin Sanskrit Finnish language Chinese language American and British English differences Translation German grammar Esperanto Thai language Spanish language Spanish verbs French language Romance languages Subjunctive mood Interlingua Cornish language Scottish Gaelic language Finnish grammar Lojban Arabic grammar Taiwanese (linguistics) West Germanic strong verb Grammatical mood Serbo-Croatian language Spoken Finnish Consonant mutation Esperanto grammar Lithuanian language Germanic languages Aramaic language Singlish Czech language African American Vernacular English Old Irish language Manually Coded English Old French Grammatical gender Future Irish language Verb Copula Japanese grammar Syriac language Germanic weak verb Arabic language Grammatical conjugation Proto-Indo-European language Navajo language Irregular verb Romanian language Vulgar Latin Georgian language Sesotho language Indonesian language Old English language Ojibwe language Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Tamil language Quebec French Adverb Italian grammar Breton language Vietnamese language Slovenian language Alphabet D'ni language Urdu Brazilian Portuguese Kanji R__maji Wolof language Gbe languages Scots language French verbs
