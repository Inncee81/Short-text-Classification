how do i open up a food court restaurant i'm in the preliminary stages of researching how to open up a restaurant in a food court of a mall does anyone know any sites or good books to start off with i'm finding most of the books on restaurants are dealing with actual physical restaurants and not so much food courts i'm not interested in a franchise so i would just need info on what it takes to open a restaurant in a food court thank you firstly if you have no experience in the food court restaurant business i'd advise that you work in one for the next six months or so doing everything possible to get some of the work experience that you'll need to understand and run a food court restaurant profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in restaurants and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a food court restaurant and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your food court restaurant the location of the restaurant is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a food court where there are several restaurants all in a row and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with menu ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have food handling licenses the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped X Window System Restaurant Microsoft Software engineering Economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus OpenDocument Strategic management Wall Street Mozilla Firefox Information Technology Infrastructure Library World Wide Web Common Unix Printing System Super Size Me Cross site scripting Privatization Scientology beliefs and practices McDonald's Plame affair Expert system Electronic commerce Software patent debate Intellectual property Open access Ryanair Food and Drug Administration United States Postal Service Fast food Citigroup Copyright Bulk vending Breastfeeding Publishing Tesco Unicode Domain Name System Public domain Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Peer review America Online Mergers and acquisitions GNU General Public License Francis Crick Lloyd's of London Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unemployment United Airlines SCO-Linux controversies Graduate school Monopoly (game) Airport Mozilla Application Suite Wget Mutual fund SAS System LiveJournal Corporate governance Government of Maryland Coffeehouse Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Internet Appeal Search engine optimization A&W Restaurants Warren Buffett Neville Chamberlain Microcredit Blog Bank Volleyball Organic farming Melvin R.
