am starting my own website in future questions about domain building actual site i want to start a website in next year want to buy the domain name now at least to hold it wondering though after doing that can i at any point buy a web hosting starter package and just pay extra each month or is it easier just to bite the bullet and buy the web hosting package now and build my website later i want to make sure it si the easiest process possible as it's all new to me so if i register my domain on yahoo it is easy enough a year later to then go with another company if i wanted use the same domain name i registered on yahoo and create a site i just don't want to go to another site to build a page next year and have them say my domain name i want is taken you can definitely buy the domain now or somebody might beat you to it and hold it until you are ready to start your website you don't have to buy a web hosting package now if you have nothing to put on it it's one thing to pay year for the domain and another to pay month for a web hosting package that is not used get a web host if and only if you are ready to start your website it doesn't make sense to get a web host and waste money when you have nothing to put in there Web hosting Internet fraud Domain Name System Website Search engine optimization Windows XP Web traffic Public domain E-mail spam PHP Bond Wheel of Fortune The Amazing Race LiveJournal Web crawler Finance Textile manufacturing SCO-Linux controversies Copyright The Apprentice 2 Web analytics Theory of conduct Poker jargon Mouse (computing) Craps Political economy Neopets Debian World Wide Web ROM image Search engine Monopoly (game) Konfabulator BitTorrent Major League Baseball television contracts Mad Money Year 2000 problem Kazaa Apple Computer CPU cache Cable television Microsoft Gmail Copy protection Dot-com Mutual fund Opera (web browser) Google bomb Spam (electronic) Hotmail Addressing mode Tenshinhan Virtual hosting Surveillance Whois CDC 6600 Satchel Paige Topps Thread (computer science) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Macromedia Flash Capitalism KDE Fox Broadcasting Company CPU design Social rule Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Open Directory Project Anderson Cooper Enron Corporation GunBound James T.
