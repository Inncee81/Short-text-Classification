i saw an accountant for initial consultation a few weeks ago and w o warning she sent me a bill what to do i'm starting a company with a few friends and as part of the process i met with a few accountants a few weeks ago to select one for our company one of them decided to send me a bill for for the initial consultation i know it's customary for accountants to provide complimentary initial consultation she also did not warn me in advance that she was going to charge me for the initial consultation i think it's pretty unprofessional for her to just stick me with the bill i don't think that i should pay for something i did not agree to do i have to pay she has our to be company's name my name address if i don't pay will my credit be damaged i should also add that i was referred to this accountant by a friend who had just received a complimentary initial consultation from her i agree with another post i don't know that it's customary for accountants to provide a complimentary initial consultation but you could look at the content value for the time was it a get acquainted session and she asked alot of questions only with no advice or did you get some solid advice that could save you much time and money i would only kick back if there was little or no value to me in the interview otherwise pay up and what a cheap education for future meetings with professionals as well as saving your rep you may not have considered that professionals have only their time to sell so if you waste it when i help clients shop for a cpa we are very clear that the sessions are their chance to show us what they can do if a great opportunity came out of it we'd be willing to pay even if we then hire another firm Internet fraud Plame affair Insurance Advance fee fraud Life insurance John Kerr Appeal Karl Rove Sydney Riot of 1879 Credit card Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) America Online Coalition Provisional Authority Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 L.
