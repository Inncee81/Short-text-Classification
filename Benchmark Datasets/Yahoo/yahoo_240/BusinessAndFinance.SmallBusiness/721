to protect myself can i make my website an llc even if i make no money from the site i have a small but growing website which simply provides information and there are no sales of anything i also have a blog i have written a good disclaimer and terms of service but i am very aware after reading a law website that certain people have been sued either for what was on their website or what they said in a blog it makes me nervous i am looking towards making the website an llc in order to protect myself can that work when you make no money from the website and you are simply a website i e do you have to be a business to have an llc if an llc is not the way to protect myself do i just look at insurance that would cover me if someone claimed that something said was libelous or injured them defamation and other publisher speaker torts section c of the communications decency act passed in says no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as a publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider to date courts have treated this language as a nearly complete bar against liability for users defamatory postings so there really is no need to invest in insurance an llc is a business structure and what you're describing probably would not be classified as a business Communications Decency Act Slander and libel Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Public domain Tort Insurance Tort reform First Amendment to the United States Constitution Near v.
