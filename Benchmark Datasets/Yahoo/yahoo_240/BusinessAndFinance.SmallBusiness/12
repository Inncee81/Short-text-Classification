question about owning a music venue business do i have to go to college to own my own music venue business if so how many years and what kind of major do i have to pick up ps its a christian music venue no you definitely do not need to go to college but the more education you have the better off you always are since you've never been in business before i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money you have to determine whether you'll start a web based business or one with a store front i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a music venue business and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll go after them you'll need to register the business with your state controller's office and make sure that you have any city and county licenses if any are needed where you live all of this will come out in a business plan try this link http www ychange com small business consulting articles html and read some of the articles especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business good luck Extreme Programming World Wide Web JavaServer Pages Wget OpenDocument Domain Name System X Window System United States Postal Service Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Application Suite Information Services Procurement Library SCO-Linux controversies Cross site scripting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator SAML Electronic commerce Economics OpenOffice.org PHP XML HTML Uniform Resource Identifier Emacs SAS System Customer relationship management Trademark HTTP cookie Tesco Information Technology Infrastructure Library UK telephone numbering plan Phishing Legal research Animal Crossing Mutual fund Web server Expert system Unicode Tao Te Ching Computer Software patent debate CPU design Political subdivisions of New York State Microsoft Antidepressant Vehicle registration plate Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Representational State Transfer Public good Domain name Unemployment Mediation Website Student loan Whois Insurance Illinois Windows XP FairTax Gross domestic product Intellectual property Unicode and HTML RISC Opera (web browser) ZIP Code Probation officer Ajax (programming) Retailer MIPS architecture HTML element Avenue Q MAME Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Keynesian economics Education in Romania Bank Free software Enterprise resource planning Warren Buffett MOS Technology 6502 Wal-Mart Apache HTTP Server Neopets Port of Hong Kong Geographic information system New Hampshire Supreme Court Management information system Sun Microsystems Cable television Melvin R.
