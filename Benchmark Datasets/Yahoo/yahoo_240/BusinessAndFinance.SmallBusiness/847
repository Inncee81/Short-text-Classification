how do you get a job at the mall working as one of santa's little helpers i know it sounds funny but i think a seasonal job like this would be cool has anyone ever had this job before how do i go about applying to be an elf usher or photographer during the holiday season do i apply at the mall if so where or does an outside company provide this service i went on the website of the closest mall to me but it doesn't contain any employment information man are you thinking ahead christmas isn't for another months i'm not sure but i would guess that the shopping mall would likely hire their own santa probably a lot cheaper than contracting this out therefore i would contact your mall a personal visit with resume in hand would be best and inquire with their human resources office good luck with it and here's hoping those pointy toed elf boots aren't too tight now maybe i'll start my christmas wish list Santa Claus Christmas Social rule Trailer Park Boys Unemployment Santa's Little Helper Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire Friends Elf Management Cliff Richard Division of labour Sluggy Freelance The Smoking Room SpongeBob SquarePants Saint Nicholas The Death Gate Cycle AFI 100 Years series Beavis and Butt-head Spam (electronic) Eaton's Christmas worldwide Nordstrom RuneScape economy EastEnders Canadian Pacific Railway L.
