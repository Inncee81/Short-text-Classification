i was thinking about becoming a meet mark represenative avon help me i basically need to know everything how do i get customers where and how do i advertise does avon forward any customers to me how is it when you wanna order things do i have to pay money first or after the shipment do i get the shipment delivered to my house help please i need any good tips and ideas from anybody with experience or who has worked with avon meet mark thank you everybody ok i was a avon rep for about a year this is what i did i signed up with a avon area manager who came to my house and talked it all through so ask for this and air all your questions over the phone is no good i was lucky there was a round that had been abandond about a year prior to me starting so i just called around all the houses in my area they will tell you what one you can do but i dont think they care anymore the more the merryier they give you a starter pack books order forms pens and so on i could order out of the book at a cheaper rate but you will get a reps dicount book that is of the next catalogue that comes out you see what is coming in before the customers so you can order to show them or for yourself you can do all your ordering online or fill out the order book and post it the order book is like your exams you took where you have to fill a box for each item that is needed looks scary at first but easy to do once you have the hang of it i signed my aunt to be a rep too and she loved it she was frightened of how to order but her daughter showed her online and they do really well at it together you can make some money at it but dont be tempted to buy this and that like i did as you order of customer orders when boxes ariive to your house with invoice you will be asked to pay this is an example you tick of every item that is there if there are things missing happened alot to me you need to contact them asap to send it to you once you have got all your items you go through your orders as you will have a copy of customers orders and bag each one staple form onto each bag then deliver never leave items unless they have paid you might not get the money once you have the money you put the cheques and cash together go to the bank they gave you a paying in book for and pay the they have asked for by the date they say all this will be on the invoice the money left over is yours wages make sure you put all cheques in and keep cash out if you can because sometimes i found nearly all were cheques so i had to pay it all into account and no wages for me untill next lot of ordering and there was cash so i was in credit in the account so i did not have to put as much in i hope i am not confusing you look all i can say is it is fun hard work if you want it to be and easy if you want it to be you get out of it what you put in contact me if you want i dont mind it might have changed now but i can ask my aunt for you all the best with what ever you decide Mail fraud Internet fraud Bank fraud Wheel of Fortune Poker jargon Winning Streak The Amazing Race Spice Girls Money EFTPOS Surveillance Credit card Microeconomics EastEnders Bond United States Postal Service Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Electronic commerce Euro Social rule Automatic teller machine RuneScape quests Schabir Shaik Trial Insurance Craps The Apprentice 2 Short selling Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Letter of credit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theory of conduct $ale of the Century Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix About a Boy Inflation The Star Wars Holiday Special MapleStory Hip hop collaborations Advance fee fraud Pitaten Avenue Q Neopets Let's Make a Deal Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Quake III Arena Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Bank Extreme Programming Anarchism and capitalism Married... with Children Star Trek Customizable Card Game Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 English grammar Citigroup Wal-Mart Arianne Baseball Shaggy dog story Medical prescription Bulk vending Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Illegal drug trade Contract Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Confidence trick Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Make money fast Gold standard Rent (musical) Relational model Neighbours E-mail spam Corporate finance Something Awful Animal Crossing The Inside Financial audit Argos (retailer) Commodity markets MoveOn United Kingdom corporation tax 24 (television) The Emancipation of Mimi Ultima Online Electronic money Jon Secada Legal research
