bussiness day help i ordered something from target that is about punds on friday aug and it said it would arrive in about bussiness days does that include weekends plus its estimated arrival date was aug will it be here before aug th becuz i hav a scheduling conflict help business days mean working days monday through friday except holidays to count days between order and delivery do not count the day you ordered do not count weekends or holidays and allow an extra day or two between the date of the order and the date that the package is shipped if target shipped the order on friday which is doubtful if that was the date of your order then it would arrive on tuesday more likely target will ship the order on monday or even tuesday so you would receive it on wednesday or thursday in other words if everything is done on time you should receive your order on or before thursday but once in a while orders are out of stock or shipments are late this is the reason that target's estimated delivery date starts on thursday and target gives an extra days just in case good luck Thursday Liturgical year Holiday Good Friday Calculating the day of the week MTV2 Monday Friday Bank Holiday Week Doomsday rule Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Standard Days of the week New Orleans Mardi Gras Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hebrew calendar Tuesday Roman calendar Ash Wednesday Gregorian calendar Friday the 13th Daylight saving time Saturday Wednesday Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Chronology of Jesus Northern Ireland peace process Black Carnival Easter International Date Line Wall Street Crash of 1929 September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Birthday Lent Thanksgiving Major League Baseball television contracts 21 July 2005 London bombings Hurricane Katrina timeline July 2005 in Britain and Ireland STS-59 BBC Radio 2 Dominical letter Rail transport in Ireland Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Caribbean Carnival National Football League International Fixed Calendar Irish calendar Holy Week Fasting Otakon Back to the Future timeline Holidays of the United States The Guardian Operation Market Garden May 2005 in Britain and Ireland June 2005 in Australia and New Zealand Holidays in Canada Ocean's Twelve Moveable feast Yom Ha'atzma'ut ISO 8601 Jewish holiday Monday Night Football Hurricane Katrina disaster relief September 2005 in Britain and Ireland September 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore WRKS-FM Black Tuesday Saturday Night Live Baltimore Convention Center Hotel Project Big Brother (Australian TV series) Mardi Gras Mack Brown Tesco Labour Day CBC Radio One KNHC (FM) Bob Harris (radio) WWE Friday Night SmackDown! 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio United Parcel Service Didache Time zone Paul Is Dead Steam (content delivery) USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Closings and cancellations following the September 11, 2001 attacks E3 Lynbrook High School May Revolution Fathers' rights movement in the UK Midnight Run Memorial Day
