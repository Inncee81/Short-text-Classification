what do they check on a background check at a job they do a credit check too i said no for the box that said have you been convicted of a crime or have a pending felony but i had a minor in posession of alcohol when i was i'm now it was just a misdomeanor but i always thought that check box didn't apply to misdomeanors they made me sign an authorization to do a background check and i'm sure they'll see the mip will they care or do they only care about felonies in general and i don't have the greatest credit which is why i want a job to rebuild it and actually have money and i don't see why they need to look at my credit to determine whether i'm a worthy candidate in general do most companies judge by these things even if you have less than stellar credit and a small misdomeanor a credit check is usually done to see your habits they look at it as if you're habitually late paying bills are you going to be habitually late to work if you have a ton of debt are you likely to steal from the company the background check is to make sure you're not lying about not being a criminal or using a false identity to apply for the job as far as the misdemeanor if they question you about it you tell them honestly that you thought the question pertained only to felonies so you did answer it honestly Plame affair Article One of the United States Constitution Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Credit card 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Prostitution Barbara Boxer Burglary Identity theft Socrates Internet fraud Bill Clinton Theory of conduct Karl Rove Government of Maryland Lie Jury trial Surveillance Detective Felony Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Constitution Judicial functions of the House of Lords Evan Mecham Plame affair timeline Crime Kill Bill Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Civil rights Bruce Johnson Florida Central Voter File Parliament of the United Kingdom Murder U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Appeal Procrastination Ocean's Twelve Ronnie Earle Gun politics in the United States Court system of Canada Fred Phelps Notary public United States House of Representatives Scientology beliefs and practices Ethics Treason Hillary Rodham Clinton Ann Coulter Lewinsky scandal Babe Ruth Three strikes law Jury Probation officer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Capital punishment E-mail spam Henry Lee Lucas Criminal justice system of Japan Credit score Merit Human rights in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Contract Magistrate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shoplifting Assault Jeff Gannon Public Eye Leo Frank Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Government of France History of the United States (1789-1849) Witness impeachment John Kerry Article Two of the United States Constitution National Kidney Foundation Singapore CPU cache Adoption Drug abuse Bill Maher Congress of the United States W.
