anyone in the small hotel management business i'm thinking of careers for after university and something to study at university i've had this idea for quite some time now but i keep having doubts about it i want to know as many of these as possible does it take over your family life ie husband and kids how hard is it to start up and attract people will i have to work there all of the time if i don't run it with a partner is there any legal issues to consider will i have to live in the hotel what would i do about holidays myself how do you go about naming the hotel would people trust me as a manager at the age of about fresh from uni plus any other handy hints or pitfalls you've come across thanks very much jess xx jess before starting this business you might need to consider buying one that is up and running but if you're going to start a business then does it take over your family life ie husband and kids yes and no you see it depends on how great system builder you are that means if you own the business then you should not be the one who manage people hires people etc you should be just the owner not the manager how hard is it to start up and attract people it's hard when you start a business and you don't have a name and no contracts you need to contact many hotels before they even arrange a meeting with you that means if you start from scratch you are nobody with no influence and you need to build your name will i have to work there all of the time if i don't run it with a partner in business you don't have friends if you run with a partner you will get ripped off that's what usually happens and your partner can do illegal things without you knowing about it so one day you might find yourself accused in things what you never did but these documents have your name fingerprints and signature on it etc is there any legal issues to consider yes keep your business and personal book keeping separate never ever pay for personal needs with business money or business credit card it's what you need to do in order to protect yourself legally also when you make a contract with hotel be sure you have the best attorney you can afford will i have to live in the hotel no if you own the business then you shouldn't be doing taxes cleaning the hotel or managing business relationships in fact you should have so incredibly well working system that it would work on its own i skipped some questions would people trust me as a manager at the age of about you will get rejected like all business starters but in the end persistence will pay off you will get the deal if you get enough rejections remember einstein needed to find ways how you can't invent a light bulb that means it's years and years of hard work if you start from scratch but if you buy one that is already established and has let say years history don't you think you'll reach much faster to the success you desire you may also read about investors http www freetomanifest com money freemoneytobusiness html i hope this helped Surveillance Schabir Shaik Trial Social rule Corporation Plame affair Contract Life insurance Mutual fund Infantilism Insurance Warren Buffett Domain Name System Polyamory Corporate governance Contract bridge Capitalism Charles Ponzi Enron Corporation Trust (Law) USA Current teachings of Prem Rawat CPU cache Illegal drug trade Sexual orientation Estoppel Leasing LiveJournal Microeconomics Investment bank Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal SCO-Linux controversies Floppy disk Minimum wage Extreme Programming Construction Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Security (finance) British national identity card Theory of conduct She Loves You Trademark Identity theft Donald Trump Divorce Craps Babe Ruth Primerica Financial Services Credit card Marvel Comics Corporate personhood Friends Knots Landing Windows XP State Bulk vending United Kingdom corporation tax Universal Studios Economics Public transport Stock 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Citigroup Keynesian economics Hard disk Copyleft FairTax Jack Abramoff Mortgage Satchel Paige Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus American individualist anarchism Capital accumulation Freeters Same-sex marriage Law & Order IBM PC compatible Child pornography Public-key cryptography Article One of the United States Constitution Expert system Gold standard Anarchism and capitalism Guild Billboard Hot 100 Commodore International Commodity markets Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Philosophy of business Requirements analysis Pretty Good Privacy Property (ownership right) Appeal Social psychology
