ebay cragslist of my own ok i want to make a site like craigslist and have a good idea on making cash on the site problem is i just dont understand the net to well like html php and other stuff i make graphics but thats it anyone down to do this if not which is what im guessing with about dollar budget how do i get started while i applaud your enthusiasm your budget and knowledge level preclude you from being a success at this point its not all bad though you can get there if you try hard enough first you must get your level of understanding of the web and web applications up to at least that of the average developer go ahead and learn php it's actually very easy then learn about java and design patterns once you get to the point where you understand what jboss is even if you can't create apps yourself you can then start looking around on sites like sourceforge for projects that might be close to what you want to implement you can also then begin finding developers who can help you if you are willing to create the project as open source i hesitate to mention this but if you really want to jumpstart the web site building process take a look at drupal and its framework of plugins if i were to need to build a new web site it might be the starting point i'd choose while you are at it go over to adobe com and download the latest flex builder developer's kit you can go through the lessons built in to the kit to begin to understand how you might be able to incorporate things like flash resources into your web site and applications good luck Ajax (programming) Java programming language BitTorrent Web design Eclipse (computing) Arianne Web application Mozilla Firefox Object-oriented programming World Wide Web Scalable Vector Graphics Object-SQL mapping XML Linux OpenOffice.org MySQL Opera (web browser) Microsoft .NET Visual Basic Managed learning environment Wiki HyperCard Wireless Application Protocol Perl Pretty Good Privacy OpenDocument Macromedia Captcha Gmail Software engineering Grid computing Cocoa (API) Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Windows XP Open source culture JavaScript Apache HTTP Server Neopets JavaServer Pages Aspect-oriented programming Objective-C GNOME BPEL Web page Open access Open-source software Web portal Portable Document Format Cascading Style Sheets Microeconomics ColdFusion TikiWiki Sun Microsystems IBM PC compatible Thread (computer science) Unicode BZFlag Construction X Window System IPod Computer virus Windows Vista Carbon (API) Workflow Requirements analysis NPAPI Windows API Common Unix Printing System JADE programming language ITunes Regular expression HTML Website Windows 2000 NeXT Adobe Photoshop Rich Internet Application Extreme Programming Markup language KDE Lisp programming language Microsoft Windows Delphi programming language Mozilla Application Suite Distributed computing Internet Explorer Web browser Web hosting Mac OS X v10.4 Scheme programming language Web crawler XSL Transformations
