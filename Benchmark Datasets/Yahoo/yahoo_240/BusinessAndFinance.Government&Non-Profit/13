do you use statistical methods at work i hold a bs in mathematics and am currently a grad student studying statistics my question is is there anyone who works in financial management or budget analysis and can tell me how much statistical methods are used on your projects at work or if you use statistical methods at work but you are not in financial management please let me know what type of work you do i did in project management i am a phd student now engineering project risk and time management use statistics but in very basic ways a statistician would barely call them statistics in the sense that no one need ever know somer's d exists but rather procedures which are based either upon normal distributions or ordinal measures to estimate either risk or time on the critical path they should be used extensively and of course are used in six sigma and other quality assurance processes in the united states they are used less than they should be Normal distribution Risk management Industrial engineering Mathematics Reliability engineering Six Sigma ELO rating system Dynamical system Path integral formulation Software engineering Maximum likelihood Software testing Probability Quantitative marketing research Software development process Sampling (statistics) Quality control Modern portfolio theory ISO 9000 Scientific method Prices of production Linear regression Economics Bayesian inference Corporate finance Pi Regression analysis Rational Unified Process PRINCE2 Information Technology Infrastructure Library Project management Bayes' theorem Estimation theory Philosophy of mathematics Fisher information Cancer Sabermetrics Cognitive science Information Services Procurement Library Likelihood principle Control chart Quality Management System Total Quality Management Extreme Programming Bayesian probability Unemployment Labor theory of value Case study Management information system Factor analysis Dynamic Systems Development Method Graduate school Computer vision Just In Time Walter A.
