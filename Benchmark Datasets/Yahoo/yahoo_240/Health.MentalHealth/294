what can i expect from a visit with a hypnotist is it better than a pain psychologist a lot of people tend to think about barking like a dog clucking like a chicken or doing weird things when under hypnosis the truth is that it's just a very deep form of relaxation much like meditation the therapist will use soothing words and imagery to help you relax and depending why you're going they will make suggestions to help you through your particular issue for example say you are visiting a hypnotherapist for quitting smoking they will use imagery to relax you and then make suggestions like you do not like the smell of cigarettes to stick in your subconscious that way when your conscious mind says you want a cigarette your subconscious kicks in and says yuck no thanks i found hypnosis and self hypnosis to be far more helpful than cognitive or any other types of therapy hope this helps Hypnosis Milton H.
