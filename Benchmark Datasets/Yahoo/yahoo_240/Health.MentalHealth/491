am i just too compassionate or depressed sometimes i wonder if there is really something wrong with me and this is serious so please no flaming hearing about cruelty to children and animals affects me to the degree where i can't get things i see and hear out of my mind and it makes me really angry at the world in general i know there's a ton of really good people out there that would never do horrible things to kids and animals but i'm also just floored but the sheer number of incredibly sick and heartless people that do i feel like the world is going to hell in a hand basket sometimes and i'm only in my s i feel like i don't have much to look forward to i have friends and a good job and family and i don't see anyone affected by the stuff that goes on in the world like i do i wish i could be more egocentric honestly is this normal to be so affected by stuff you see and hear in the news and on the internet that it can really ruin your day and give you such a negative outlook on life hi i am very much like you i also am very sensitive to cruelty of any form and hearing about it on the news or thinking about it also makes me depressed sometimes for days and when i realize there's nothing i can do about it it makes me negative feeling as if i don't belong in this cruel world but i don't think there is anything wrong with you and me in statistics i learned that most things are distributed on a normal curve like a wave form starting low then high then low again that means in this case the majority of people feel moderately about cruelty the center bulge of the curve near the average less people are towards left and right sides of the curve on the left the few that care very much have strong feelings about cruelty and few people also minority who don't care much on the other side of the curve so you and i are from the minority on the one side e mail me if you want to talk more Theory of conduct Social rule Inflation YuYu Hakusho Shit K' Pitaten Hearing impairment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Explosive material Empathy Intelligence quotient Microeconomics Keynesian economics Economic inequality Jon Secada About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ELO rating system Time Out of Mind Care Bears Animal rights Milton H.
