does emdr and eft effectively work in erasing the traumatic experiences of a person had are they behavior modification techniques or psychotherapy techniques they are supposed to be the best ways at the mo but check this out the words of a physiologist i'm seeing soon thank you for the enquiry i am always pleased to see people taking their personal mental health seriously and it is important to ask questions to clarify treatments or the people they are intending to see and i fully encourage any searching questions and points as raised i would certainly not disagree with your friend about the current lack of scientific evidence currently available around the rewind technique and this is currently being addressed by the human givens institute by engaging in research projects the fact however does remain that it has helped a great deal of people and hence cannot be discounted it is interesting to note that one of the most accepted theraputic approaches for years has been a psychodynamic approach which itself has little positive scientific evidence behind it one of the most scientifically researched and evidence based treatments is hypnosis and yet this is often termed a fad in certain quarters i feel the most important point to reassure you on is that i use a range of approaches and that no one technique has all the answers what i always do in an initial session is to give information on how trauma works and ways it can be effectively treated we then move on to building in a number of approaches which will help ou move on right from the first meeting these approaches can include the rewind cbt and other aspects which having spoken and discussed with you can be identified as the best way forward my phd dissertation completed only last year was on the effective treatments of ptsd and trauma and i know the limitation but also the possibilities i think the most important thing to recognise and one well evidence in various research projects is that medication alone is not the answer to any psychological issue and that the relationship and rapport between client and therapist is one of the key factors to success regardless of the theraputice approach i feel sure that we can help you to move on and hope to have the opportunity to meet with you in order that you can make your own mind up i am more than happy to answer any questions you have and anything i can do to help you move in the right direction which ever way you feel that is i will be happy to do so Traumatic incident reduction Clinical depression Hypnosis Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychology Neuro-linguistic programming Dissociative identity disorder Scientology beliefs and practices Sexual orientation Milton H.
