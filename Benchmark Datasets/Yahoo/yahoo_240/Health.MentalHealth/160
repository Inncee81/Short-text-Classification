i'm scared please answer me i'm scared to talk to someone new i found this person who is willing to talk to me and willing to try to help me but i'm really scared to let her in i've trusted people before and it always turned out bad i know that i need to talk to someone but i don't know how to talk to someone new and i'm really scared to talk to talk to someone new what should i do they are from an organization did not meet them online it doesn't feel like my family is there for me so i don't feel that i can talk to them i also have this but i found that looking at the possible outcome of your situation greatly affects your decision based on a third party analysis such as this what can happen for you if you don't let her in you'll go away and go damn it and bang your head against the wall and that's it for this particular situation besides you wondering down the road what if or you can talk to her just by asking questions to her and try to find something in common and have a great time and if shes not that friendly or tries to mess with you why care about what you feel toward her and consider it a learning experience if she is willing to help you and talk to you i seriously doubt she is going to try to take advantage of your trust unless shes related to the mob or something if all else fails in the end what do you have to loose pride is it worth something that may be a great experience in your life that can greatly help you Social rule Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune True Crime: Streets of LA Time Out of Mind Goodness and value theory Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transactional analysis Pitaten Coming of Age (TNG episode) Milton H.
