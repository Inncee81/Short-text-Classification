my mother is bi polar and crazy ok my mother has children and step children currently she has of them currently living full time with her step and of hers i can almost guarantee you that she bi polar b c she goes into the expisodes that i recognize from my bipolar friend yes there is a chance she has a deppression problem as i do but she's a little bit more extreme then i am anyways i am married and no longer live at home but when she has the episodes i usually get called either by her or my siblings in tears and i have to pull the family together i grew up with this and it caused me to resent my mother for many years i'm there for her b c she's always been there for me during my deppression times but it's really starting to ware on me my younger siblings all under get really emotional about this and start blaming themselves no matter how many times i tell them it's not them is there anything i can do to make her get help she doesn't beleie in drugs to help her problems but i know that she can't do this on her own and i am on anti depressants and it's a miracle how my life has turned around please if your anti drug dont comment i need help with this not criticism i do not live with my mother in fact i live one state and hours away i feel helpless b c i can't go and help her but i have a full time job and a husband cats that i have to take care of and does anyone know if i were to do a talk with her when is the best time of her moods to convince her to get help if she's convincible this is for my th post and whether or not you read this i'm still going to say it you'v obviously never had someone close to you who has a deppression problem it's not about lieing in bed and not being able to feed yourself it's about not being able to cop with everyday things like normal people its a handicap that theres nothing you can do about it and there's a wheelchair you could use but you refuse to excuse me for wanting my mother to be able to go a whole days and not feel like the world is going to crush her yes she works hard and she needs time off but she can't have it yes everyone has bad days but does everyone have bad days where they feel like nothing is worth doing the world might as well crush her everything is wrong and it's everybodys fault and there's no thinking happy thoughts at this time b c everything she tries to think of that is happy her brain will automatically think negatively so keep your niave and ignerant comments to yourself i can completely understand where you are coming from i currently live with my bi polar ocd grandmother my grandmother has been a mess ever since i met her and has this god like complex sometimes some days she'll be sweet and the next thing i know she throwing pots and pans she doesn't believe in medications either sadly there is no way to make her get help trust me i have tried someone will only get help when they realize that they really need it and that there is something wrong with them it is hard on everyone to live through this first i must suggest to try and talk to her honestly and bring everyone in on this to express their feelings to her that they love her very much but cannot see her live this way express the pain you feel and encourage everyone to do the same promise that you'll support her if she chooses to get help and describe to her what she is doing wrong it may not work and i know how it feels when someone refuses the help but the thing that scares people the most is fear that they will have no support and be left alone but it also is scary and angering to know that you are the only one who is receiving help or perceived to need it so bring the whole family in on a counseling session and heal everyone together that way it doesn't feel as if anyone is being singled out i can't say it will work but i pray that for you it does good luck Pitaten Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Theory of conduct Friends Social rule Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
