i'm so bored with life nothing excites me anymore what can i do i'm only and nothing is like it used to be nothing entertains me all i do now is sit on the computer i mean there's literally nothing to do and now that its summer break all i do is wake up and turn on the computer and stay on it until i can't go to sleep last year i've been failing most of my classes friends are boring me i can't go outside because there is no one to drive me no sister or brother i used to love eating but now its like blech is this depression or something cause it sucks all i do is watch movies because of netflix thank god i want to go to tokyo aruba sky diving jet skiing but lets be logical i'm never going to atleast recommend me a movie thanks i'm really sorry you feel this way especially since you're only i am and i know how you feel but my advice which is probably stupid is find motivation listen to music find music that relates to you and maybe comforts you that is what has saved my life or call up your friends and maybe ask them to hang out at your house that doesn't involve driving only for your friend and if you don't have friends then i suggest finding different motivation because you always need something to keep you together and you wanting to go to tokyo aruba sky diving etcetc you have the rest of your life dear you have until you die don't rush everything now sure you may want to do it now but think about it do you wanna do all that stuff in one day and then the rest of your life is like blah you have the rest of your life and i feel the same way i want to do so many things in life but i have to wait a little i really suggest music seriously do you have parents that could drive you places and if you do have parents ask them for a day trip or something just to get you out of the house i really hope i helped oh btw a good movie is premonition Friends Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 2) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Avenue Q Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Rich Mullins One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard Kodocha Charmed EastEnders The Life and Times of Juniper Lee W.I.T.C.H.
