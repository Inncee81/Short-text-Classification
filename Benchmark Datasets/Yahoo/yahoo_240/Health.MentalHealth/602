is it safe to tell okay so i talk to our school psychologist on a regular basis now and i have become really comfortable with talking to her the thing is i was raped about two months ago and i really need to tell someone if i do tell her is she like legally required to tell that to like someone higher up or my parents or will it stay between the two of us you counselor is mandated by law meaning she can be fined if she does not report abuse however there are many variables here it depends on whether this was date rape someone under age or if it was rape by a caretaker if it was a caretaker then child protective services would investigate with the police if it was someone under age then the juvenile authorities would have to know however you counselor has to obey the law of course you could report without giving the name if you even know the name but she will encourage you to report it however you really should not hold this in it saddens me that you can't talk to your parents but rape is never the victims fault it is all about control for some reason the perpatrator needs control and if he she did it once they will do it again to someone else always remember if this happens it should be report right away so evidence can be collected if there is no evidence then it becomes your word against theirs if the perpatrator still has access to you it will happen again if you keep quiet if he does not have access then he will do it to another it is very important to not feel guilty and like you caused it because it is always a problem within the perpatrator it is not how you dressed or where you were Rape Domestic violence Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Probation officer Child sexuality Abortion debate Child abuse Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child sexual abuse Status of religious freedom in Sudan Abortion Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Divorce Torture Abortion in the United States Deprogramming Terri Schiavo Scientology beliefs and practices Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Capital punishment Arguments for and against drug prohibition Transsexuality Infantilism Breastfeeding Autism Marriage Affirmative action Pornography Rosa Parks Fathers' rights Statutory rape Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 Miranda warning Satanic ritual abuse USA PATRIOT Act Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Serial killer French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Human sexual behavior Property (ownership right) Female genital cutting Charter school The Lovely Bones Karla Homolka Age of consent Children of God Narcissism Child Gun politics Pedophilia Sexual abuse Drug abuse Psychoanalysis Education in the United States Traumatic incident reduction Ted Kennedy Ethics Same-sex marriage James Hanratty Criminal justice system of Japan Plan de S__nchez massacre Scientology Hypnosis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Trademark Luke and Laura Spencer Women in Islam Parental Alienation Syndrome Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Theodicy Causality Plame affair Marc Dutroux History of British nationality law Schapelle Corby Grief Democracy Information warfare Convention on Psychotropic Substances Columbine High School massacre Dissociative identity disorder Jizya Prostate cancer Vernon Schillinger Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Childbirth Drug test Teenage suicide United Nations Protection Force Murder Polyamory Appeal
