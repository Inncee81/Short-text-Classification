i forget things quick not that my memory is bad but recalling the recent past is the difficulty i'm just as far as my memory is concerned i remember things that had happened even those of my childhood but instances when i forget that i had to keep that certain thing back at its place or dry the shower place after shower or what i had to buy in the market happen a lot damn to much and due to that i always get scolding from my mom and dad please help gratitude in advance forgetfulness can be from a lot of different things stress being overtired not eating properly or having a lot going on are some of the most common using certain drugs or substances your elders might call drugs but your peers might not can also cause memory loss such as what you describe try to see if any of these things are true about you then seek to modify those things and see if your memory doesn't improve also something i have found helpful is if i am forgetting things such as the grocery needs i actually do make a list it won't help you with the shower curtain but it can help you not come to the end of each day saying to yourself rats i forgot to do can you talk with your parents about your concerns are you doing ok in school how about when you are with your friends are you having the same forgetfulness with them if your memory for recent events is functioning even in one setting then it is not a matter of something wrong with your brain which i am assuming may be the reason you have posted this question there can be other causes but it is best to check and eliminate the simplest ones first and generally if you are getting along ok in most of your life and it sounds rather like you are perhaps this is a case of normal forgetfulness we forget stuff from time to time doesn't mean there is anything wrong and you are looking just a wee bit too close and worrying just a bit more than you need to be it may just be that if you relax a bit with yourself and try not to focus on your possible memory problem you will find the problem goes away on its own absent the above causes memory issues in a year old are thankfully very very rare Social rule Infantilism CPU cache Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Philosophy of language False memory Pitaten Avenue Q Hey Jude Shit Out-of-body experience IBM PC compatible Computer virus Transsexuality Second language acquisition Hypnosis Time Out of Mind Mediation Equine conformation Victor Cousin Philosophical skepticism Halting problem Sin City Prostate cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Traumatic incident reduction Drug test Stuttering Kimi Finster Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Kim Possible Genetically modified food Blood (computer game) Extreme Programming Intelligence quotient Modem Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Debugging Spanish verbs Deconstruction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fathers' rights Scenes from a Memory Intersex surgery Multiple sclerosis Transformation problem Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Amnesia Memory The Fairly OddParents English grammar Humphrey Bogart Cerebral palsy Garfield Fecal incontinence K' Poker jargon Milton H.
