can't get rid of my black dog as winston churchill used to describe his bouts depression my metaphoric black dog follows me around everywhere i am especially depressed at the fact that i can't make meaningful friendships or even have a relationship with a girl i'm in my 's and i don't see any point in living i am very lonely and it hurts to see so many people enjoying life and i can't my black dog never leaves my side he never goes away when i want him to nothing i do ever seems to help i don't want to go through more years of this all it takes is one pull of the trigger and its done no more pain and i won't go to hell because i am forgiven i don't think that jesus would refuse to forgive me because i chose to take my own life he wouldn't be happy with me but he wouldn't condemn me i've already had all my sins forgiven so give me a good reason to stay alive on this stupid earth ok before i go any further i have to say that i completely empathize with where you are although i am several years older than you and have dealt with this same issue off and on for most of my life and actually am dealing with it pretty seriously right now as well i just wanted to say that so you would know that i hear you loud and clear what is keeping me here is the knowledge i have that god loves me and he loves me so much that he sent his son to die just for me that alone tells me how much i'm worth having said that it's still not easy right so what to do first you have to know that so many of us are out there going through exactly what you are going through which makes me so angry that the enemy of us all is having such a field day messing with our minds and trying to make us do something to take away that incredible gift of life that we have been given by the one who loves us beyond our comprehension you have to also realize that you are in a war while you are here on earth you are in a war for your very soul you have to put on the full armor of god to prepare for this war and get in there and fight how you do this and i'm talking to myself as i write these words is to constantly fill your mind with the word of god as that is the only truth on earth that is real and genuine and powerful whenever you hear something in your mind that is negative push it aside with a truth from god for me my verse that i have clinged to to the point where my fingers are bloody is jeremiah jeremiah for i know the plans i have for you says the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future whenever i think i just can't go on another second i remind myself of this promise that i have been given and actually it is your promise also and i know that every word is true and will come to pass no matter how long i have to hang in there and fight i could go on and on but i'm at work and can't really take the time but i just happened to see your question and something inside of me felt this pull to try to put into words what i have been going through and how i've been doing it not only for your benefit but for mine as well so all i can really say to you and me is to never quit never give up and never ever forget how much you are loved and not alone it is my belief that there are heavenly beings all around us trying to help us in our struggles if we will just let them you do not want the enemy to win give god a chance to bring to pass what he has promised you for your life he loves you more than you will ever know this side of heaven you are worth everything to him and i am sure that there are people in your life who also love you and would be devastated if you were to take your own life you are valuable my friend as am i Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Divine grace Jon Secada Simone Weil Summa Theologiae Sola
