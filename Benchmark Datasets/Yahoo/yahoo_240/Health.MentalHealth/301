how do i have elusive dreams i've had lucid dreams this is what you do keep a dream journal write down your dreams when you wake up everyday this keeps you in the habit of being mindful of your dreams practice every half hour or hour that you are awake pinch yourself and ask yourself if you are in a dream then you get in the habit and you will ask yourself this same question when you are dreaming when you ask yourself if you are in a dream during the day really try to imagine that it could be a dream look around you do clocks change their numbers are words on a newspaper changing is there anything odd when you pinch yourself do you feel it you should be doing this a minimum of times a day but the more times you ask yourself it during the day say times the sooner you will ask yourself that question in a dream have patience it can take a month or more to have your first lucid dream but you must have decent dream recall first which the dream journal helps you with what to do when you are in a lucid dream have a plan of what you want to do already write down your plan the more you write it down the better for me it is always meeting a certain celebrity that i crush over and having haha intimate relations that's my favorite lucid dream but another time i wanted to build a palace that worked okay if you want to meet a celebrity or see something specific don't just say appear that is very hard to do in a dream say something to yourself like when i turn the corner a palace will appear or when i walk down this hallway then i will meet a specific person let the experience come to you if you are losing control of the lucid dream then try to spin around the motion sometimes helps you regain control of it even with all that practice my lucid dreaming was only about twice a month i got really sick of practicing also the lucid dreams were hard to control maybe lasting only to minutes or so it appeared in the dream and once your dream is fulfilled well i mean i wasn't that motivated to practice anymore good luck Lucid dreaming Dream Consciousness Milton H.
