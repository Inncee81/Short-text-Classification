is what i am feeling phycological or an effect of pot two days ago i smoked pot for the first time with my friend i didn't smoke tons but i did smoke enough to get high i felt sleepy and in a daze for hours afterwards the next morning i felt fine but around yesterday i started thinking about it and i became in a daze again now i still think i am not thinking straight has this ever happened to anyone else am i just overreacting ok thanks guys im pretty sure its just phycological because when i dont think about it im fine i hope you guys are right the amazing thing about the brain is that if we eneter a state of consciousness i e being stoned it can remember that state of concsiousness and recreate the experience for us i have done the same thing with lsd cannabis speed and ecstacy its nothing to worry about though you may want to do something else to 'freshen your mind up' the best thing to do would be something that involves you physically as well as mentally such as basketball or a bike ride keep busy for a bit and it should slide and no you're not over reacting its very normal to raise question when the state of your mind is altered hope this helps Cannabis (drug) Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Social rule LSD Hypnosis Arguments for and against drug prohibition Consciousness Philosophy of mind Schizophrenia Dualism (philosophy of mind) Psychedelic drug Francis Crick Jon Secada I Want to Hold Your Hand Traumatic brain injury Methamphetamine Out-of-body experience Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Sigmund Freud Illegal drug trade Time Sleep The nature of God in Western theology Stroke Infantilism Psychology StarCraft: Uprising Poker jargon Psychopharmacology W.
