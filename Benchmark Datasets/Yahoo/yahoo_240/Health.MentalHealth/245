is a hour observation real i really need to see a psychiatrist and good put on meds the average wait around here is month to see one so my insurance company suggested i go to the er and ask to be observed evaluated for hours my question is can i really leave after only day i can't spend a week in the mental hospital i'm having a lot of thoughts of self harm but no real plan for suicide i just feel like i'm quickly losing it bipolar heading towards manic if you really need to see someone for psychiatric treatment i don't know that a hour observation is going to be for the best for you in your situation people are often put on hour watches because anything over hours refers you to the inpatient part of your insurance which will not get paid for unless authorized by the insurance company in advance which requires an evaluation if you are drug seeking which is what it sounds like to me then you can ask your regular doctor to prescribe you something safe for your symptoms until you can be properly evaluated of course you can leave after only day in fact they will encourage it for you since you dont' have prior authorization from your insurance company for anything other than a hour watch and no one wants to foot the bill for you so they arent going to take the chance on an inpatient stay that is not getting reimbursed just be careful with all that since timing is key here if you go in for a hour evaluation and they deem you to be a threat or pose any harm to you or anyone in public they will get preauthorization from your insurance company while you are on your hour watch and then you are screwed you will be in there for as long as the insurance company has agreed to pay and no going back to change your mind because then you are financially responsible for all the bills and your insurance company will not only not pay but probably drop you for good Health insurance Bipolar disorder Psychiatry Publicly funded medicine Mental Health Act 1983 Prostate cancer Antidepressant Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychiatric hospital Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Involuntary commitment Insurance Homeopathy Schizophrenia Stomach cancer Life insurance Pharmaceutical company Nurse Palliative care Triage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Health Service Firefighter Unemployment Wal-Mart Transsexuality Psychosis Emergency Medical Services Reparative therapy Childbirth Medical record Autism Ethics Anorexia nervosa Antipsychotic Paroxetine Alternative medicine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Stroke Lamotrigine Medical views of suicide Public policy Medicare (Canada) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Cornelia Rau Eating disorder Buprenorphine Traditional Chinese medicine Breastfeeding Alcoholism Psychotherapy Milton H.
