water fear so usually im fine on water i love it but last year my parents old neighbors let their year old son drive their boat and he decided to keep going in circles and wouldnt stop we were seriously on our sides and thought it was gonna tip my parents just recently bought a new boat and it was fun and fine until they are going fast and take turns fast and one side of the boat is touching the water it freaks me out im always afraid the boat is gonna tip over and everyone says it wont i have to sit on the floor of the boat with my head down just to relax and that doesnt really settle it the other part is i love to go tubing ive never had a problem with it but today for some reason i was so scared to be on it and i dont know why and once i started going up in the air from hittin the waves i lost it and started freaking out and crying i have no idea why does anyone relate to this or is it just me is there any advice you could give me im years old id appreciate no rude answers im not making any of this up and im not really wanting to tolerate any rude answers thank you though for those who are understanding and are willing to give truthful answers this could be related to something called post traumatic stress disorder because of the prior incident i found out about this from a friend of mine who is a trained psychologist when i told her about something that happened to me which is one of the reasons i'm afraid to drive in addition to other reasons i would recommend discussing this issue with your doctor for more information and additional ideas on how to deal with this you may e mail or im me off site any time Shaggy dog story Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Psychoanalysis Milton H.
