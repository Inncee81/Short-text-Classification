how do you tell people you're crazy i'm crazy i know it and i'm the kind of crazy that can't be helped i hear voices in my head and i know this is sometihng that couldn't be solved with medications because its something that i let happen to me i can turn it off i just don't want to they're not mean they don't tell me to go kill people they're my friends they give me advice they help me with my homework even and yeah this is strange and creepy but thats not the problem i don't want to get rid of them and i don't want people's opinions of whether or how i should do so all i want to know is how do i talk to people about this do i tell my parents should i tell my best friend i mean even if you wanna talk that'd be great please help i just need someone to talk to about this and i don't know how ok i don't really think i'm crazy just fyi so stop telling me i'm schitzophrnic and should seek help i really really don't give a f ck sry and to that one guy w out the email option yes they do tell jokes they're people really not just voices i can see them and have conversations with them and everything and they have humor just like everyone else and no i've never been high but when i'm drunk they stay sober its weird i always remember everything that happens when i'm drunk just b c they remember it not me haha d whether i want to or not hum i dont think your crazy i think what you ahve is perfectly normal it's just that people never talk about it so you dont know everyone has thoughts in their heads you may not be saying them out loud but they are your thoughts its like when your thinking of wearing a jacket on a nice day just incase it rains you think to yourself should i should i not and go back and forwards before you decide i know how you feel about telling people or not scared of what they might think and how they could react to you i'm in the same situation ther you just feel like you need to tell someone before you explode sometimes it helps just to get someone elses thoughts on stuff it makes you realise a lot you are more than welcome to email me and i will get straight back to you i'd be happy to talk if you feel u need to talk to someone you know then you should just go for it i'm sure they'll be very understanding and helpful xxxxxx Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Social rule Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada True Crime: Streets of LA Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Good Morning, Vietnam Cliff Richard One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood on the Tracks Richard Feynman Little Britain Russian joke The Inside Charmed Recurring South Park characters Singlish Milton H.
