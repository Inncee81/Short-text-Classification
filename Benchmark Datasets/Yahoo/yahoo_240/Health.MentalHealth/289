my boyfriend is currently on lexapro for anxiety and depression but lately his symptoms have returned he has it set in his mind that everyone would be better off if he was gone and that everything he touches goes wrong we are having financial hardships since his job relocated back to california leaving him unemployed and his car's engine just blew things arent perfect but they certainly arent terrible either any suggestions on how to help i'm running out of ideas my insurance plan is terrible and it costs alot everytime he has to go for a doctors visit help lexapro didn't work for me my doctor switched me to abilify which was working well for months now i've started to slide again med mixes can take a long time to get right but it definitely sounds like he needs something i would have him consult with the doctor even though it is expensive also i am not that optimistic that therapy would help i went to therapy for years and only the medication alleviated the depression Antidepressant Clinical depression Unemployment Medicine Bipolar disorder Anxiety Milton H.
