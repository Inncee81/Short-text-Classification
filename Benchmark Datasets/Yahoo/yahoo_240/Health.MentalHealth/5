i think i developed a cocaine addiction help i'm years old married and my husband and i started using cocaine a couple years ago at that time we tried it with then acquantiances but after a couple times we stopped and didn't have the desire to continue within the last two months however we have used cocaine several times a week and i'm scared that we have become addicted to it every time we make a pact to not do it anymore when the weekend comes someone will hint to it and the other will support us getting more i'm really scared i don't want to ruin my life and i see that it's not as easy as we thought to stop cold turkey because we rationalize the weekend use as just having a good time on the weekend i told my husband i was going to a na meeting this evening because i think we need help at this time he doesn't have the desire to go any advice thank you good for you for wanting to stop thats the first step first of all cocaine is absolutely psychologically and physically addicting i have been there and i had it bad so i can relate you are watching the slow motion movie of your life unraveling and the only way to change the upcoming scenes is to make sure you take charge of them now you do that by getting help changing your friends acknowledging your addiction and facing it with counseling therapy and maintaining a clean and sober lifestyle let me make this very clear you will not be able to maintain the same friends that you have now and possibly never will be able to be around them again they are enabling you to stay coked up and want you to it helps them justify their use if you do it too added afterthought danielle make sure that if you quit and start feeling depressed that you seek medical help and or counseling it is absolutely important that you do cocaine addictions use a part of your brain called neurotransmitters and neurons to create the high those same neuro's are used normally without drugs to help stabilize and experience emotions cocaine depletes those from the brain to make the high and as a result its why you need more and more coke to get high there are less and less neurotransmitters to create it quitting can lead to emotional unstability and its very important that you do not rationalize getting high when this happens but rather to seek medical attn immediately you cannot justify using other drugs either only medical treatments no pot coke or street drugs allowed period only medications that are prescribed ok you will need to go to your meetings and appts religiously and face the fact in your mind that you either are an addict or are becoming one and that you are taking control of your life now the next step is getting help for your husband because he will continue to use and it will either drag you back into it or destroy your relationship when you quit and he continues first things first get help now then get him help if you need more info or input or suggestions ask here and we will all gladly offer our help as best we can but first and foremost admit you have a problem and face it on a local homefront tell a mom friend dad brother sister cousin and ask them for help non illegal drug help Drug addiction Addiction Alcoholics Anonymous Clinical depression Cocaine Transsexuality Drug abuse Neighbours Sigmund Freud Borderline personality disorder Antidepressant Friends Knots Landing Bipolar disorder EastEnders Dopamine Mental illness Withdrawal Alcoholism Meditation Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paroxetine Psychotherapy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Schizophrenia Prostate cancer Ex-gay Infantilism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Psoriasis Tobacco smoking Stroke Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psychopharmacology Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Scientology beliefs and practices Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatry Reparative therapy Neuro-linguistic programming Psychosis Methylphenidate Illegal drug trade Days of our Lives Post-traumatic stress disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Married... with Children Cancer Dead Like Me Diazepam Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Self-harm Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Multiple sclerosis Urinary incontinence Alprazolam Kurt Cobain Cannabis (drug) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Neurofeedback Mind control Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Motivation Goodness and value theory Narcotic Oz (TV series) Sleep LSD Clomipramine Social rule Health insurance Panic attack Fight Club Humphrey Bogart Anxiety Procrastination Stomach cancer Whitney Houston Divorce Doxepin Psychoanalysis Anorexia nervosa Sin City Narcolepsy Dualism (philosophy of mind) Boogie Nights Action potential The Amber Spyglass
