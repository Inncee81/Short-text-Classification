why don't i feel anything when people die my father died when i was and i remember running into my room and locking the door because i did not want no one to see that i was not crying but the thing is while i was still shocked i was thinking about what i was going to wear to school the next day or how much more freedom i could have and he was not even a bad father and i never gave him any problems but in general when i hear that someone has died i just don't feel anything and i sometimes get an urge to laugh when i see the way some people carry on crying this is something i am very embarassed and ashamed of and i hate being this way i am now and i am a little better at showing sympathy but some of the ways are still here honestly is there something wrong with me do i need help also i have a problem telling people i love them no matter who it is i feel it but i just can't say it my year old nephew told me he loves me and i could not say it back i feel so ashamed please any advice no there is nothing wrong with you it shows that you served your purpose to them gave them a good time during their lifetime and they died loving you if you knew em your strong it doesn't mean you have to cry to show something my grandma died at the age of i smiled the whole funeral i wasn't cruel i knew my grandma wanted me to live a good life she always told me to look left and right for cars when crossing the street watch out for creeps i helped her up whenever she fell down i didn't cry because i knew i was there all the time for her and i served my purpose for being there for her i smiled because i gave it my all to live her life till the last of her remaining days you are probably the same however this doesn't mean that your heartless emotions die but it doesn't mean we can't show emotions but in this case you may feel something but you can't say it back because you are either shocked or happy about it and your emotions temporarily break down and you can't say anything but stand there and smile at them or just stare at em to conclude this there is nothing wrong with you it means you are a strong person and you love your family and friends very much Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Social rule Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Knots Landing Friends Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Real Love (song) Good Times Futurama (TV series - season 5) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind The Smoking Room Obi-Wan Kenobi Coming of Age (TNG episode) 10 Things I Hate About You Night (book) Avenue Q Grandview, U.S.A.
