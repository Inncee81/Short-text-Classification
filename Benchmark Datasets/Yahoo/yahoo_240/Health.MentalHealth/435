i'am always stressed lately i haven't been sleeping real well i have bad dreams often i'am self consouse i lack in confidence my family are km from where iam but they never want to talk my nan gives me no encouragement she is mostly putting me down my family are one of these familys that play mind games i got that alot when i was younger so i have moed away from them and now live with my bf but lately all lil things really piss me off like my dog i snap i get moody often im not sleeping well i think people hate me as i have no friends my own age i can't talk with anyone when i do have a problem what's wrong with me any suggestions on what i might do to help me relax please sencible answers only any stupid ones and i will report i'm here for help not to be humiliated aww bless sounds just like what i've been through and am still dealing with i have so many issues from my past which i have been letting rule the future and getting real worked up over but it's not how i want to be sounds like me that you need someone to talk to someone who doesn't know you in any way like a counsellor who will not judge you who you can talk to about anything and who you know will treat your conversation with confidentiality you're paranoid when you say you think people hate you i used to be like that too but now i think so what if they hate me then that's fine it has nothing to do with not having friends your own age in school i had very few friends i left school years ago and don't keep in regular contact with anyone from there now other than my boyfriend who i have been with for years and friends with for and two younger girls aged and i'm now who live next door but one to my mums house and i've known them years too that i treat as if they were my little sisters and my dad too i have no other real friends you don't say how old you are and rightly so but maybe if i'm not too far away from your age you would like to be my friend maybe you live a long way from me in england but we can still talk via email for some reason i have you as one of my contacts i think you added me first so in the past i must have answered one of your questions will have to look back through my profile now and see what my suggestion to help you relax is to take time out and do things that you want to do go for a walk to the movies treat yourself to a facial or other beauty treatments and always remember you're a princess when you start feeling like you will become snappy and moody learn to identify the moment and then walk away so don't allow the feeling to deepen if you want to get in touch further please use the link via my profile i'd be more than happy to talk with you further you say you can't talk to anyone when you have a problem why you get stressed because you bottle things up but you can talk to me i must point out that i'm not a trained counsellor but do have lots of life experience and will help you to the best of my ability Social rule Little Britain Theory of conduct Friends Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha EastEnders The Smoking Room Scenes from a Memory The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
