why do spock and mccoy wear blue shirts and scottie a red and kirk a yellow shirt as has been stated in the past the jobs usually determined the color worn however i believe some of this was also somewhat subjective here's some samples of who wore what command helm navigation routinely wore yellow kirk sulu chekov are some examples science medical routinely wore blue spock mccoy nurse chapel are some examples engineering security communications virtually anyone else wore red including many a killed crewman scotty uhura yeoman rand all donned red confused yet it gets better originally star trek had tan shirts instead of gold refer to the cage some of these were still used by personnel once the series took off this was originally worn by command operations science even engineering personnel here's another bit of trivia uhura wore a gold outfit just like her red one in at least one episode this would add further confusion to the significance of the colors it should also be noted that commodores admirals didn't always wear gold often they wore red uniforms so they also added to the confusion also of note there was actually a green shirt which seemed to be reserved for captain kirk this green wraparound shirt was first used when a transporter accident split kirk into good kirk bad kirk the producers used a different shirt to help viewers differentiate between which kirk was which in scenes where the two kirks were together it wasn't until star trek ii the wrath of khan that definitive colors were used to separate departments without any confusion at this point numerous colors were assigned to the officers turtleneck undershirts to indicate their department the producers of the movies did well in assigning the different colors sticking to them should someone change departments examples of changes include kirk when demoted from admiral to captain lost the gold trim on his jacket pants that indicates a flag officer since he was returned to a line officer but kept his white command shirt sulu originally wore the gold turtleneck for command but gained a white turtleneck when he became captain of the excelsior scotty originally wore a gold turtleneck when in engineering but when promoted to the rank of captain he gained a white turtleneck anyway i hope this helped check out the links below for more information James T.
