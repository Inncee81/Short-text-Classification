job decision well i have been working at red lobster as a host for about months i went looking for a server job elsewhere and i applied at bob evans and this very expensive exclusive restaurant called its a matter of taste i got offered a host job at a matter of taste and a server job at bob evans i dont really know what to do because both jobs want me to work the same hours on the same days i dont want to pass up the job at its a matter of taste just having my foot in the door there feels like it could be great potential but at the same time they want me to gain server experience so i can become a server there so i dont want to turn down the server job at bob evans i'm not sure what i should do im pretty sure im leaving red lobster but if i cant take both jobs which should i take a job that could eventually turn into a great job or a job that would offer me server experience and more cash now if i were you i would take the job at it's a matter at taste work there get the feel for things and then get a side serving job that doesn't coincide with your host position so you can do both if you can prove to them you know your stuff plus get experience elsewhere they may just promote you to a server learn the menu watch the servers and do as much as you can whenever you can a lot of restaurants like to promote from within i think if you work hard at it you can get them to make you a sever Mach kernel Time Out of Mind The Price Is Right EastEnders Web hosting Blood on the Tracks Table tennis Domain Name System Social rule Supply and demand All That Lobster In-N-Out Burger Apple Computer Public-key cryptography NeXT Unemployment Microeconomics Cheating in Counter-Strike Tennis McDonald's King Crimson MapleStory Graduate school Server Message Block ELO rating system RuneScape locations Michael Garibaldi $ale of the Century Japanese cuisine Major League Baseball television contracts Sin City Netscape Communications Corporation Team Fortress Classic Evan Mecham E-mail BZFlag Anderson Cooper Volleyball Denny's Arianne Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act E-mail spam Shaggy dog story Ragnarok Online Hard disk 2000 Australian Grand Prix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Newsgroup Hollywood Squares Gift economy The Apprentice 2 Electronic commerce Windows 2000 Boston Public Breastfeeding Another Side of Bob Dylan Atomic Kitten Serve (tennis) Wall Street Internet Relay Chat Danger Hiptop Final Fantasy XI Restaurant Big Brother UK series 6 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Server Four square Common Unix Printing System Days of our Lives X Window System Internet fraud Racquetball Web crawler GameFAQs Buffalo Bills RuneScape skills Sydney Riot of 1879 Escape from New York Shogi Microsoft Uniform Resource Locator Lineage II Thomas M.
