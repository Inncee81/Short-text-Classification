my place of employment is going down the hill help i started working in a fine dining restaurant as a server when i first started they wouldn't allow anyone to work there that has not been a server before plus you had to take a pretest on drinks and serving etiquette and if you didn't pass it you would not be hired they were extremely professional in their jobs and it made very very good money i would walk out with a night suddenly drama happened and things started to fall apart we have a new mngmt crew now and they hire anyone that wants the job our new staff has crap for common sense and lack work ethic there are no tests no more weekly serving classes all the servers that had been there before got fed up and quit i am the only one left with a fresh new staff that can't tell up from down our restaurant has turned into a joke i'm lucky to get in a night now i've tried to talk to the managers but they're just as bad and i'm not much for putting my foot down when i should help i can't get more tables since the staff was performing so horribly the managers decided to just put more people on every shift and hire more people i tried to suggest keeping a low staff and training them severely but they didn't want to do that not much of one to put your foot down well then continue to work there otherwise put your foot down no offense but you are the backbone of the restaurant those who break their back to make the company successful are the least appreciated i'm sure the dishwashers work harder than you and don't get tips so appreciate your tips or go get a different job which is your best option when you're still young and tippable this is meant in the best possible manner you either go with the flow or jump on the next boat in other words sink with the ship or grab a life raft personally you're wasting your time trying to make them see the err in their ways why would a restaurant owner manager take business advice from a lowly server they've already shown the inability to hire competent staff it's a sign of where they place the importance do they value you as these other less competent servers yes you need to fluff your resume Craps Aerial (dance move) Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Kitchen Friends Mojave people Knots Landing Tennis Poker jargon Avenue Q Freeters Procrastination Restaurant Volleyball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Tip Futurama (TV series - season 2) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
