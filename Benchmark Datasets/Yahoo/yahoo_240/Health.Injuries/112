i have a burn and i am wondering if its ok it looks odd ok i got burnt on my dad's motorcycle the muffler while i was trying to get the groceries out i told dad and within seconds he had me icing it down then he had me dry if gently then we spread stuff on it i think it was called idocane something like that for the first day but then it started to hurt when i put it on then the skin which was then deep tan brown peeled off it has been days now and its starting to hurt a little it didn't hurt much when i first got it it is now slightly very slightly red around the edges it is roughly inches by inch on the thickest part of my calf outside and the actual burn is a kind of deep tan with red in it color it does not when i touch it and only a little when i press down on it it feels kind of papery and i can feel heat coming from it is my burn healing correctly thank you and i hope i gave you enough information i gave all i could think of sounds about right a nd degree burn i'd say you may want to cover it in oinment like polysporin wrap it with gauze or a large band aid change the bandage once a day wash it with soap water when you rebandage it Wound Tattoo First aid Aloe Milton H.
