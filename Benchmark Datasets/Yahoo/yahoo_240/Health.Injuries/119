i have achy pain in my ankle after spraining it in october last year no swelling couldn't put weight on it without shooting pains didn't get it checked out can't go iceskating because of worry of redoing the injury and this time breaking a bone omg ur story souend eactally like what i did to my ankle when i was a senior in high school i was a cheerleading practice and we were doing jump drills well lets just say that when i landed my jump my ankle rolled inwards and i felt and heard a very audible pop i sat out for a bit of practice with ice on my ankle and refused to be seen by the school sports med specialist continued practice cause i felt no pain even though origanally the pain was excruciating when i got home i had like hour before my all star team had practice so i iced my ankle and taped it up for practice went to practice did everything went home iced it again when i got up for school the next morning i looked as though a had a softball in my ankle and could hardly put any weight on it so i wraped it and went ahead to school i never went to the dr for two reasons i'm stubborn and stupid my allstar team had nationals that weekend and i wasnt going to miss it the reason i never went after was because i felt stupid for waiting so long anyway it healed i guess but ever since then i've been afraid to whip my jumps in fear of reinjuring my ankle and i too have the achy pains in my ankle at times and sometimes for now reason at all my ankle will sortof give out i say you should go iceskating again and just wear a brace on your ankle for support and if anything does happen then go get it checked out this time you can't change what u did in the past by why should it prohibit your future best of luck Kurt Angle Cheerleading Equine conformation Milton H.
