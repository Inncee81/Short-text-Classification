rexing gene dominant in rats hiya reading up on ratty genetics with a plan to breed in the distant future particularly interested in rex and dumbo varieties is the rex gene dominant so if you mate a rex rat to a smooth coat then you get hetrozygous rex babies also i've heard the dumbo gene is recessive so if you mate a dumbo with a top ear you get heterozygous top ears then if you mate a heterozygous top ear to a dumbo of the babies will be dumbos and top ears of course nature rarely works to such precise figures but i'm speaking in terms of chance it'd be great to get some insight from a breeder thanks x the rats i have at the minute are all rescues and i will continue to do so whether or not you think i should breed wasn't the question i asked and i believe that is my decision to make when the time comes to really get what you want as a breeder you need to start your breeding with rats of known genetics known lineage this will require you getting your rats from reputable breeders rats from pets stores and rescued rats are a mixed bag of genetic material and some of that genetic material makes rats bred willy nilly prone to diseases rat genetics code http www boardmanweb com rattery geneticbasics htm it's a lot of work reading up on genetics here's an example of a breeder who knows her lines http www pxrats com geneticsnonagouti html rex genetics http www skyclyde com geneticscurlycoats html dumbo genetics http web ukonline co uk spladoosh genetics du html http web ukonline co uk spladoosh stands bod dum html http members aol com ristorat dumbo html can't speak for rex because right now they are still popping up randomly in my lines i'm not a professional breeder and when i do breed i keep all the babies this is what i know from my breedings about dumbo mom looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo and dad looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo all babies will be dumbo and carry dumbo mom looks like a top eared and carries dumbo and dad looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo of babies will be dumbo and some carry dumbo dad looks like a top eared and carries dumbo and mom looks like a dumbo and carries dumbo of babies will be dumbo and some carry dumbo mom and dad both top eared but carry dumbo of the babies will be dumbo but like you said nature rarely works to such precise figures i just had an accidental litter where mom is dumbo and all of the surviving babies are top eared had two still born i don't believe there are any professional breeders here at y a because i basically know all of them from other forums a good forum to join to learn about breeding and genetics would be http groups yahoo com group ratspacnw spazrats my life has gone to the rats Fancy rat Dog Cat Gene Species Mixed-breed dog Domestic rabbit Cat coat genetics Horse German Shepherd Dog House Mouse Recessive gene Elephant Manx (cat) Dobermann Havanese Labrador Retriever Hamster Pet skunk Gray Wolf Docking Dog breeding Genetics Extinction HTML DNA Black panther Keeshond Biology Reproduction Brown Rat World Wide Web English Springer Spaniel Dominance relationship Gray (horse) Hearing impairment Genetic code Puppy mill Price equation Kakapo Monster Rancher monsters Kevin and Kell Jack Russell Terrier Ferret Cultivar Potato Evolution Dog breed Introduced species HyperText Transfer Protocol Sickle-cell disease Stewie Griffin Nuclear thermal rocket Urinary incontinence Agriculture Virus Polymerase chain reaction Long-term potentiation Molecular evolution Vladimir Peter Tytla Compact disc Rat Terrier Cheetah Discus (fish) Gmail Primate JavaServer Pages Doug Homer Simpson Abortion debate Future energy development Congenital disorder Heterozygote advantage Liger Who Framed Roger Rabbit Chihuahua (dog) Cloning Barbara McClintock Domain Name System Smooth Collie Randomness HTTP cookie Genetic disorder
