i need rat information as much as possible you can give me a website or info on this site first of all i rats and you need to get at least two they are extremely social and its cruel to keep them alone where to get you new rats humane society take very good care of the animals disease free have been properly handled breeder knows what they are talking about takes care of rats for a living check to make sure the rats living conditions are good although most breeders are in it for the love of rats some are just in it for the money and will keep them in horrible conditions will more than likely know who the parents and grandparents are pet store i would highly recommend petsmart over petco last resort petco and many others dont separate males and females you might come home with a pregnant female petsmart only carries females so no risk of pregnancy mose pet stores sell rats as feeder rats dont get them from here even if you think you are 'saving them' i know you would mean good but they dont have proper socialization and are more than likely interbred watch to make sure they are active and healthy ask to hold them before paying for them when the pet store person opens the cage watch to make sure the rats dont run away or try to bite signs of feeder rats your rats cage rats need larger cages then hamsters square feet per rat need multilevel hammocks and levels are highly reccomended tons of toys wiffle balls pet store toys etc and chew toys dont use cedar bedding use pine shavings as a primary bedding then a thin layer of carefresh they will use that as nesting supplies little houses rats loooove tons of little houses and different sleeping areas cleaned out glass jars pvc pipes 'igloos' from petstores wooden shoeboxes anything big water bottle otherwise be prepared to refill it a lot dont put a wheel in there usually rats wont use it but if they do it can cause serious back problems make sure there isnt a wire bottom its horrible for their little feet always have a full food dish clean it once a week dump out bedding scrub with water let dry and add new bedding play time love time out of cage give them slightly cracked open hard boiled egg they will go nuts rat pinata layer paper towels put treats in the middle and bunch up into a ball and tie it so its hanging from the top of their cage digging box fill with store bought dirt and sprinkle bird food all over it then add another layer of dirt water and let it grow wait till all the seeds sprout and let the rats in it they looove digging around and eating the sprouts randomness box a box full of anything and everything safe for rats recycled paper toilet paper rolls scrunched tissues pencils wash rags anything and hide some treats through out the box rats need time out of the cage for at lease hours a day the more the better handle them every day they will sit on your shoulder and go everywhere around the house with you snacks food get your rats food from a pet store and make sure it says mice and rat food dont get hamster food you can mix in rice chrispies or cheerios save money on expensive stuff both those cereals are good for them no sugary foods chocolate and suff anything thats good for you is a good treat for the rats some rat owners say that rats should have table spoon of fresh fruits a day dont over do it on the nuts to much protein for them no salted sun flower seeds get treats from the pet store my favorites are 'yogies' and 'pretzel sicks' bath time its not nessisary to give your pet rats baths however some rats like baths fill a plastic tub your bath tub with inch of water luke warm put some tupperware in there for rats that dont want to sit in the water put some frozen veggies in there for them to much on no need for soap males vs females males are very lazy tend to smell more dont like to explore as much love to sit and watch tv with you some people claim them to be much more sweet then girls have extremely large 'male parts' get oily backs females love to explore need to know whats going on hate being in the cage love to learn tricks dont smell as much love love love humane interaction very energetic do not do introduce your rats with your hamster or any other small animal let them run free in your house unless they know their name mine do give them chocolate give them a bath when the water is higher than inch put soap in the bath put perfume lotion on them let them need electrical chords or outlets play with them if your hands smell like cat or dog or food stick your fingers through the bars of the cage feed them through the bars of the cage poke them with things dont get them rolly balls cause serious back injury do snuggle with them give the kisses pet them let the out as much as possible teach them a few tricks let them sit on your shoulder while you lounge around the house love them this is probably the longest answer i have ever given lol good luck hope this helped Tofu Sin City Ferret Tooth Breastfeeding
