please help im very scared my guinea pig my yr old girl guinea pig has sum sort of fly egg on her bak will she be ok wut will happen to her please help im super scared cuz i her ok so its not big so its not a tumor thats wut we think and i cant afford to take her to the vet and im wonderin if anyone knos wut will happen to her please to the vet technician this is sum pics of the bump thank u so much for your help http flickr com photos n http flickr com photos n in photostream http flickr com photos n in photostream sry theyre all crappy but it was hard to get a good shot well i hope that helps determine wut it is please miss linda m come bak and look at my pictures please im scared so my guess would be that it is some type of an absecess honestly if you don't have enough money for a vet than you shouldn't have it but that's not going to help the sitatuation right now if you guinea pig has acess to the out doors check to be sure that it isn't a tick they can be small like a pin point to the size of a quater if you have a hair clipper like what they use at the baber shop shave the hair around it so you can get a better look at it you a baby wipe or alcohol wipe and wipe it off and put neosporin or first aid cream on it if you have any it could also be ring worm that is inflammed if you could take a picture of it at all from a couple of different views and post them then i could help you much more good luck and i'll check back for pic's even if you can't post them on here if you can post them someplace else on the web i can look at them good luck okay so after seeing the pic's i can tell you that it is probably not an absess it looks to me like it is either a tick or a wart it is unlikely that it is a fly egg the fly's are usually present inside the wound with the eggs a wart can be a nusiance but is probably not going to kill her unless you start seeing more of them then it could be a disease the other posibably is that it is a tick but that would only be explainable if she goes out side or if it could have infested her bedding if it turns pale greenish in color almost like a catapillar then it is most likely a tick and will fall off on its own they can carry disease though so that's another reason to take her to the vet but if it is indeed a tick you can try pulling it off if it doesn't come off then leave it alone you don't want to pull off a wart however if it ever falls off then clean the area with rubbing alcohol aka isoproboyl alcohol best of luck if it appears to be getting bigger or other ones start to appear or it you see something coming out of the hole then take her to a vet around me chicago land area a vet visit costs about and you can tell them that you are on a tight budget and tell them how much you can afford and they can usually work within your limit also change her bedding and make sure that her cage is clean and that the bedding that you put into it isn't infested with anything good luck the other thing that i forgot to mention is that it could be a cyst i found a wesite that gives a pretty good explanation and i'll post it below these cysts are most common on the back and down towards the rump but they can occur elsewhere it is a good idea to have a good palpate all over the surface of the guinea pig regularly when the skin checks are being made see skin problems if you come across a soft pea sized lump which is not attached muscle or bone then it is almost certain to be a cyst cyst's are sometimes harmless but other times can cause problems so there is no way of knowing unless you talk to a vet i'll give you a couple of helpful links below Guinea pig Tick Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Poker jargon Fancy rat Mattress Sin City Skin Shaggy dog story Pitaten Stomach cancer Professional wrestling throws Acne Violin The Inside Aerial (dance move) Social rule Humphrey Bogart EastEnders StarCraft: Uprising The Shining (film) Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet skunk Mario series enemies Sharon Tate Futurama (TV series - season 5) Urinary incontinence Jon Secada Heinkel He 100 Chicken Milton H.
