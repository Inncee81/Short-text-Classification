what cage for a guinea pig this is an update on my other question sort of i want to get a skinny pig hairless guinea pig and i was wondering if they got any bigger than a regular haired cavy because i saw one in the petstore that was way bigger than my cavy maybe my cavy was small also is this cage size big enough for one in inches l x w x h around there please answer does anyone know any web sites i could get a hairless piggy for under because the ones here are and i think thats kind of expensive thanks also it would have to be hairless because my mom is severely allergic to fur we are willing to spend over i just want to know if there are any pigs themselves for under i think memphisgal is wrong well ye they do require more care but they are as healthy as a regular guinea pig just with no fur if your mother cant have a fur guinea pig and u want one than get it but you will have to spend more money than just you need suplies vet bills and ect so if u can only spend dollers than dont buy a guinea pig because it needs proper care that costs more that dollers but i am a fan of guinea pigs and i think a skinny pig is as great as a regular one but u have to be sure to keep there skin clean and not be to cold or warm Guinea pig Fancy rat Hamster Domestic rabbit Pig Chinchilla Taboo food and drink Sphynx (cat) Animal Liberation Front Coprophagia Chinese Crested Dog Platypus Garfield The Sims Animal rights Skin Thermoregulation The Downward Spiral Dog Pet skunk Growth hormone treatment Cat Nine Inch Nails Psychiatric hospital Fur Animal testing Hollywood Squares Pig (zodiac) Porcupine Clothing National Kidney Foundation Singapore Insulin Livestock Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Invader Zim Cro Tarantula Health insurance Rei Ayanami Hip hop rivalries Hair Rodent Cetacea AIDS in Africa Cheetah Three Little Pigs Allergy Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dandruff Herpes simplex virus Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Prostate cancer Dairy Canadian and American health care systems compared Professional wrestling match types Sin City Violin Tattoo Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Guns, Germs, and Steel Vitamin C Arguments for and against drug prohibition Salad Fingers Jennifer Lopez Lord of the Flies Eric Cartman RuneScape quests Wheel of Fortune First aid Human Echidna Spider Ranma __ characters Shifting cultivation Comanche KMFDM Havanese Menstrual cup Capybara VeggieTales Green Day The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Trapping Wal-Mart Psychiatry Ferret The Family from One End Street Hyperinflation Risk management Electroconvulsive therapy Confidence trick Hazing Care Bears Money 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Clinical depression El Ni__o
