why are there so many rude answers in the pets category and are these reportable they range from just feed it to a snake to i think the best breed of animal is a dead one to shoot it with a bb gun seriously it's not freaking funny not only that but it isn't even original i've seen about different people suggesting that mouse rat hamster owners feed their pets to a snake it's getting incredibly annoying my second question is are unhelpful answers like this a reportable offense i have nothing at all against feeding pet snakes it just bugs me when snake owners seem to think that rodent owners should just throw their pet to a reptile i just read a comment saying that snakes were higher than hamsters and that all hamsters deserved to live a life of fear but yeah snakes gotta eat what they gotta eat i have no hatred of them you can try to get an offending answer removed by reporting it i don't know if y answers keeps a running count of how many times the same posters keep doing it but in the pet section i see the same jerks again and again i don't mind differing opinions but i hate the people that are just trying to get a rise out of the others i also kept mice and rats and i think they make good pets too i kept snakes as well i think everything is here for a purpose and everything's gotta eat but there's no reason to deliberately hurt someone's feelings because they care for an animal that you yourself dislike i don't particularly like spiders but i don't suggest to tarantula enthusiasts that they step on them either Hamster Pet Garfield Shaggy dog story Cat Tarantula Snake Creatures in Bionicle Mickey Mouse Internet phenomenon Animal testing Theory of conduct Rat The Secret of NIMH FoxTrot The Smoking Room Snake charming Taboo food and drink Dilbert The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) House Mouse Fancy rat Internet troll Guinea pig Social rule Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Blood (computer game) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Chicken Fruits Basket Pet skunk Cannibalism Animal Kim Possible Capital punishment The Fairly OddParents Characters of Naruto American Alligator Reptile The Young Ones (TV series) Skunk Dog Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Joke Timon and Pumbaa YuYu Hakusho Little Britain The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fauna of Australia The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Escape from New York Shit Slashdot subculture True Crime: Streets of LA Brown Rat Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Have I Got News For You Plame affair Domestic rabbit Whose Line Is It Anyway?
