what is wrong with my dwarf hamster's eye my dwarf hamster's right eye is sticking closed every time i take him out of his cage his eye opens up slowly but it has a reddish pink color surrounding it i see his eye sticked together like that after he wakes up could it really be because of old age i had him and his buddy for over a year thanks gerbilfuzz and sarah my dwarf hamster had that too try wiping it gently with a cotton ball soaked in warm water if a hamster has recurring problems with runny or sticky eyes or the eye appears cloudy the hamster could have an eye infection this can be treated by mixing half a cup of sterile boiled and cooled water with a teaspoon of boric acid powder available from a chemist or pharmacy and using an eye dropper to bathe the eye twice or three times a day although rare hamsters can develop cataracts and the symptom is a cloudy eye although the cataract cannot be treated it is worth seeking veterinary confirmation as the symptoms of a treatable eye infection are sometimes similar my hamster developed cataracts the cloudy eye is a sure sign so check for that loss of eyesight doesn't affect them that much though because they rely on other senses more Hamster Cat Brewery Guinea pig First aid Common cold Urinary incontinence Tofu Glaucoma Diseases of the honeybee Coffee Malaria Domestic rabbit Tocopherol Menstrual cup Fancy rat Conjunctivitis Tattoo Otitis externa Dairy Pet skunk Medical prescription Diabetes mellitus Chicken Diabetic retinopathy Cataract Cephalic disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boric acid Turkish coffee Multiple sclerosis Plastic Blindness Snake Dog Vinegar Shock Dialysis Retinal detachment Garfield Boron Candidiasis Prostate cancer Herpes simplex virus Menstrual cycle Autism Traumatic brain injury Mouth ulcer Sake Cloud Idli Effects of global warming Al-Razi Wound Red Dwarf characters Agar plate Neurofibromatosis type II Cancer Chlorpromazine Manicure Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Elephant Leptospirosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sun Medicine Diazepam Migraine Textile manufacturing First aid kit HIV test Poliomyelitis The Legend of Zelda series enemies Homeopathy Hay fever Internal ballistics Chinchilla Hyperthermia Decompression sickness Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anthrax Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Paint Smallpox Wilson's disease Abortion Eczema Water (molecule) Codename: Kids Next Door Tea Boil Daredevil Havanese Nitrocellulose Little Britain Sterilization (microbiology)
