what is the best cage to get a hamster and what should i get with it i've had many gerbils mice and a hamster the best thing to get is an aquarium ten gallons works fine for one there is no chance that the hamster will get out the litter will stay in the cage and you can see in very well also makes sure you get a sturdy cover for the top they can jump out i had one that fit over the top and it was heavy enough that they couldn't push it off i've also had some that sat on top and had locks that slid under the ridge but if you forget to slide them close the hamster can get out i've had this happen get a food dish and a water bottle that hangs from the side i do not reccomened a gravity water bottle get one that has a ball in it they can drink much easier you should also get a shelter for them to sleep in and something for them to chew on i also suggest wood shavings as the litter it prevents smells and it works well and is cheap Hamster Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Equine conformation Bong Plastic Trapping Chinchilla Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Dinghy John Cage Professional wrestling match types Avalanche Door Volleyball Kitchen Mouse (computing) Sailing Coffee Wine Autonomous building Swingout Happy Tree Friends Japanese tea ceremony Cat Gypsy moth Marine aquarium Pinball Canal lock Mattress Snooker Bicycle frame Dundas Square Combine (Half-Life 2) Canoe Animal communication Animal testing Brewery Knife Rugby union positions Nalgene Manual transmission Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cuisine of Malaysia Siphon Weight training B-47 Stratojet Seismic retrofit Glossary of wildland fire terms Japanese cuisine Gaia Online Wine making Golden Hamster Pet Skateboarding trick Homer Simpson Sento Milk Alcoholic beverage Enceladus (moon) Panama Canal Table saw Glossary of climbing terms Piccolo Junior Saga Pok__mon Abilities Nocturnal animal Lock picking Muroidea StarCraft: Uprising Water Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tobacco smoking Tobacco Social rule Flush toilet Steel Cage Match Humphrey Bogart Magic (illusion) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Window Gerbil Professional wrestling holds Jon Secada Tilapia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Amber Spyglass Strap-on dildo Meriones unguiculatus GunZ The Duel Campfire Nestl__ Champagne (beverage) Bottlenose Dolphin Ron and Fez Chair Capercaillie Aquarium
