biting hamster i have a russian hamster that bites a lot i wash my hands like a billion times so it doesn't smell like food but all she does is bite is there anything i can do to train her not to bite help please unfortunately russian hamsters are known for their mean streak if washing your hands hasn't helped i would suggest that you start wearing gloves and continue to handle her the only way she is going to get to the point you want her to is to continue to handle her do it briefly at first and make sure she gets a special treat at the end of each session lengthen the sessions as you go along and hopefully one day she will be able to sit in your hand without biting you please remember to go slowly with this if you go too fast it will take even longer so go slow start with holding her for seconds give her a treat and put her back in the cage make sure you give her the treat while she is in your hand and not in the cage otherwise she will think that going back to the cage gets her the treat and she may bite just to get back and get the treat do this twice a day and then the next day try seconds and so on good luck with your hammie Hamster Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Dog training Fecal incontinence 2000 Australian Grand Prix Swingout Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Boxing Japanese tea ceremony Aerial (dance move) Weight training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling match types Drill bit Volleyball Pet skunk Internal ballistics Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Electrophysiology Blood on the Tracks Indianapolis 500 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist New Morning Fancy rat The Ashlee Simpson Show Trapping The Star Wars Holiday Special Equine conformation The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Salad Fingers Time Out of Mind Massage Traffic light Fencing Winning Streak Slow Train Coming Upholstery First aid Tattoo Ariel (Firefly episode) Goaltender Menstrual cup Warrior (World of Warcraft) Customs and etiquette of Japan Table tennis Modem Milton H.
