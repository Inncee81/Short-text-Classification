how do i properly pet my hamster so it feels comfortable n relaxed back when i had hamsters i found the best way to make them feel comfortable is by giving them a place to hide like a baggy pocket they'd go to sleep in there also if you give them a few sunflower seeds while holding them they'll just sit there and eat it or stuff their cheeks making a happy hamster hehe you've got to remember our hands are huge to a hamster so for us to feel like we're petting them it must not feel that great for them imagine having your hair stroked with a sofa cushion Upholstery Mattress Golden Hamster Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Chair Shaggy dog story Cat Eight ball Mouse-like hamster Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Hypnosis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Billiards The Smoking Room Physical intimacy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Snooker W.I.T.C.H.
