what are some good chew toys for hamsters well the question is pretty self explanatory right now my hamster has a wooden log thing he seems to climb over it an through it a lot but no chewing he also has something called krunchies natural gnaw bones for hamsters guinea pigs i do not think i have ever seen him touch it since the first day i had him i have had him for days i've currently got two hamsters and while i provide them both with a wide variety of chew toys wooden chew sticks plastic beds and tubes they seem to like chewing on cardboard tubes and chicken flavored chew sticks i've noticed that one of my hamsters will only chew on plastic he ignores all of his other chew toys the other hamster will go through phases at first he would only chew on wood then he ignored wood and would only chew on the chicken flavored chew sticks now he ignores everything else and only chews on cardboard well my point is are you should your hamster isn't chewing on something else in the hamster such as a bed or his wheel some hamsters are picky about what they chew on so it's important to do what you're doing and look for more chew toys to offer him good for you there are a variety of things you can chose from http thatpetplace com pet product advancedsearch web command search searchparams webcategorykey searchparams keywords chew searchparams size resultbody http www petco com shop petco searchresults nav ntt chew n aspx http www petsmart com global search search results jsp i would try things of different textures hardness and flavors here are a couple products i've had the best luck with this one is flavored it's for ferrets but safe for hamsters http www petsmart com global product detail jsp product c eprd id folder c efolder id assortment c east id bmuid itemno ntt chew in small pet previoustext chew n and this one is a hamster house they love to eat the roof http www petsmart com global product detail jsp product c eprd id folder c efolder id assortment c east id bmuid itemno in small pet previoustext bed n if the log you have is hard wood then try soft wood and see if that makes a difference good luck Fancy rat JavaServer Pages Tobacco Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Bulk vending Codename: Kids Next Door Knife Violin Chicken Chewing gum Plastic World Wide Web Guinea pig Tofu Dog training The Inside Brewery Horseshoe Drill bit Ramen Google FoxTrot Cross site scripting Chopsticks Garfield Cremation Polyvinyl chloride Website Web design Pet skunk Pet Korean cuisine The Apprentice 2 Food Uniform Resource Locator Toy Cookware and bakeware Bamboo Philosophical skepticism Web server Comanche Pottery HyperText Transfer Protocol Sake Barbecue Cheese Textile manufacturing Ferret Computer Christmas tree Cocaine Dog McDonald's Napier's bones Domain Name System Strap-on dildo The Young Ones (TV series) Enterprise content management Casting Themes in Blade Runner Milk Upholstery Kosher foods Tooth Lisa the Vegetarian Sugar Unclean animals Happy Meal Theory of conduct Sento Wood carving Tooth enamel Animal testing Scale model The Joker's Wild Seismic retrofit RuneScape quests Quicksort Olduwan Web browser Genericized trademark Internet phenomenon Cuisine of Africa Mac OS X Kim Possible Roswell UFO incident Commodity markets Quantum chromodynamics Tlingit Customs and etiquette of Japan Mushroom hunting Bread Cuisine of the Philippines References to Star Trek Opportunity rover
