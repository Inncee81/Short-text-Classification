are ferrets good pets ferrets are good bad pets depending on a lot of different variables it all depends on you what you are looking for in a pet your time commitment etc what is a great pet to one person is not necessarily great pet for another ferrets are extreamly high maintenance pets start up cost for a ferret is around dollars when you first get your ferrets they will need to see a vet not apart of the dollar start up most states require yearly vaccinations for ferrets rabies distemper this can cost upward of dollars they also need monthy heartworm pills it is recommended that you have two ferrets they can sleep together and play in ways that they cannot with you ferret food is expensive they should have at least three high quality food mixed togther marshals food is not a high quality food do not feed the ferret this high quality means first three ingrediants meat and no fish protein and approximately fat and low fiber the high quality food can cost anywhere from dollars to over for a lb bag feeding them low quality food may be cheaper for awhile but will lead to health problems and costly vet bills later young ferrets monthy bills may be fairly reasonable but as ferrets age they are extreamly likely to get adreanal disease you are more likely to have a ferret get health problems when they get older than not and older is only about so expect high vet bills for about half its life ferrets are smelly there is no going around that fact even descented since ferrets are strictly carnivours they have a short digestive tract and need food available all the time therefore they deficate every few hours they also have a musky smell even decented it get into eveything clothes etc cages need to be cleaned daily to minimize the smell if you let it wait the smell will be tremendous even cleaned daily you can still smell the ferrets as soon as you enter my home they can be litter box trained but it is hard and hit or miss no pun intended when they are out of thier cage they will not seek out a litter box and will usually just go anywhere my ferrets never were litter box trained and preffered to go next to the box dig in it rather than use it expect to have your ferret out of its cage for a minimum of hours a day otherwise they will not be happy ferrets have a lot of energy and need to burn it off when they are out they must be supervised as they get into everything climb everywhere etc mine used to love to go on my dvd shelves and knock them all off finally had to replace the shelves with a cabinet style some of them can be mean there is no gaurentee you must be prepared to deal with an agessive ferret do you know what to do with a problem biter i have a formally abused ferret that was a bad biter i took some nastly bites to the hands nerve damage on one hand even friendly babies can have personality changes if not properly socialized and trained ferrets must be nip trained when they are young there are correct and incorrect ways to do this hitting yelling flicking the nose do not work and may lead to an agressive and hand shy ferret all ferrets nip there is no way to completly stop but it should be controled they should know not to bite you too hard often ect that is where having two ferrets comes in handy they can play with eachother the way ferrets naturally play the cage must be fairly large the ferret starter cages sold in pet stores are not large enough a ferret needs a multi floor cage you'll need hammocks ferrets like sleeping away from thier feces and urine get food bowls that lock to the side or else they will throw them off the shelves large water bottles are best oz ferrets need water available all the time if you know all the information and are prepared to make an expensive and long commitment then go for it please be sure you hav emergency vet money set aside it is recommended at least dollars you do not want to end up as one of the kids on here asking my ferret is injured how do i treat it without going to the vet thats not fair to the pet or responsible i have thousands of dollars put aside for emergencies Rabies Fancy rat Dairy Cat Mattress Japanese tea ceremony Nutrition
