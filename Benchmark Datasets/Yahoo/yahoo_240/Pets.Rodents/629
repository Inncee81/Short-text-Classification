what kind of extra attention should i give to my anti social rus dwarf hamster out of my two russian dwarf hamsters one of them is quite a bit more anti social than the other i got them from a house with kids and what she does is sort of hunch up on her hind legs then punch out with her front legs to scratch you but she doesn't bite it doesn't hurt at all or anything that's what they both did before i got them but they've calmed down a lot since i took them home with me anyways it's just the one doing this now and i was wondering if i should be spending extra time with it so it calms down and doesn't feel threatened i mean like should i be holding her despite her discomfort or just praising her with treats and petting her in her cage this seems like a dumb question but i feel bad handling it when it's frightened i sort of have been just letting her smell my hand and giving her bits of apple and carrot she's getting better i do give her treats out of my hands so that she has so come near to take them usually i pinch the treat between my fingers and hold it in front of her nose and she'll smell it and take it doing what you're doing now is good keep handing it treats cause just like it took time for them to calm down it'll take time to show the hamster that there's nothing to worry about when it learns that nothing is going to happen it will become more comfortable dwarf hamsters are a little bit meaner that other breeds of hamsters so don't worry about it too much Hamster Dog training Social rule Aerial (dance move) Cat Equine conformation Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Russian joke Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pet skunk Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
