hamster breedin question i got one male and i can adopt a female but they are brother and sister will they breed together you think that wrong if i do that because if i see a lot of people that said yes im not going to do it then i will just adopt somthing ugler p s my male hamster is golden i want to breed with same colour but what happen if i breed it with the black hamster i can get i'm not trying to say no you should not breed them but it can be hard they are very territorial and the female might eat the male or the babies once they are born and no they might come out black and golden then some could come out multicolored you never know though either way once the babies are born you need to put the male in a different cage but i have heard of males staying in the cage and not eating the babies and acting like father when they are old enough and don't need to be fed by the mama you need to separate the males and females you would need prolly about five cages doing so and supplying each one in what the hamster needs this could get very expensive Hamster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Liger Inca mythology Guinea pig Beetle Discus (fish) Red Squirrel Koala John Cage Livestock StarrCade Canary Kakapo Brown Bear Domestic rabbit Animal testing Platypus Rocko's Modern Life Theory of conduct Kodocha Tigon Sexual reproduction Days of our Lives Johnny Depp Mountain Gorilla Monster Rancher monsters Panthera hybrid Chocobo Horse Maize Order of succession Primogeniture Ruff Golden Hamster Sharon Tate Hansel und Gretel Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mallard Cheetah Romulus and Remus Salic law Origin belief Neighbours The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kimi Finster EastEnders Adoption Heir Apparent RuneScape quests Animal communication Fancy rat Daredevil Black widow spider Sea Otter Spider Border Collie Bagworm moth Equine conformation My Little Pony Chicken Genesis Brit Awards Fugu Red-necked Phalarope Pet store Monogamy 613 mitzvot The Ashlee Simpson Show Non-human animal sexuality Joke Social rule Internet phenomenon Red Phalarope Cat Berenstain Bears Genetic engineering Puma Ayyavazhi mythology Clownfish Timmy Turner Capercaillie Condom Fur farming Rayman Breastfeeding Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
