is this a good workout for every week i'm about to go into high school and during this summer i have been cycling once or even twice a day i do this mile cycling route which is hilly and downhill and it would take my about minutes to finish it i do this twice once in the morning and one in the afternoon the other days i do miles and most of the routes have steep hills that would take minutes and rest is just flat is this a good workout routine for my age that's pretty good for a year old depending on your goals you might want to step up the time and distance if you're just riding because you enjoy it keep up the good work the only thing i would suggest would be to look into local cycling clubs you'll meet with people who have more experience can show you new routes etc if you're looking to keep fit for some sports at school what you're doing now is just fine the coach in whatever sport you may be considering can give you better advice at what activities to concentrate on but riding for an hour a day will only help if you have any aspirations at becoming a competitive cyclist it's time to start thinking about working on your endurance again hooking up with a local club is your best bet think about long rides once a week at your age you don't want to over do it and by that i mean hours in length maybe longer depending on how flat the route is you shouldn't be thinking about setting personal speed records on these rides but you do want to make it hard enough to be considered a workout at and average speed of mph is good for a hilly hour ride Triathlon Weight training Recumbent bicycle Marathon (sport) Gliding Bicycle Equine conformation Ironman Triathlon Climbing specialist (cycling) Norway national football team Time Mountain biking Cycling in Melbourne Cross-country skiing Individual time trial Exercise Track cycling Extreme Programming Sport Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Bicycle lighting 24 Hours of Le Mans Mountaineering Bicycle helmet Sauna Squash (sport) Interstate Highway Hebrew calendar Bicycle frame Indian Railways USS Tunny (SS-282) Skiing Eddy Merckx Auto racing Daylight saving time Parachuting Football (soccer) Electrophysiology Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Troms__ I.L.
