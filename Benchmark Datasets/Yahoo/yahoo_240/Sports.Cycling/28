how can i make my bike a smoother ride short of getting a new fork suspension i don't know any way to make small things like riding off curbs less jarring my bike is a sort of hybrid between a road bike and a mountain bike with a moderately light frame but the thing about the suspension is it doesn't exist i don't have any shock absorbers springs etc and i can't afford to go all out and get a good fork what are some cheap things i can do to make a smoother ride in that respect would tire pressure have an effect i'm saying this because of the hummer h 's cts system which at the press of a button basically deflates the tire for tough off road situations and replaces the air for the road ok so tire deflation is out and my seat is very soft so is there absolutely nothing i could do besides getting a new fork yes slightly deflating the tires would increase the smoothness of your right but may cause damage to the rims if you deflate them too much also you might try to find a softer seat the gel ones are pretty nice but yeah i usually stand up on the petals when i go off a curb on my bmx bike so it isn't so bad Mountain bike Bicycle Motorcycle Tire Bicycle frame Bicycle brake systems Car handling Mountain biking Deflation (economics) Racing bicycle Honda CX series Mouse (computing) Mattress Cycling Motocross BMW motorcycles Theory of conduct Shock absorber Bicycle wheel Bicycle lighting Horse Recumbent bicycle Bicycle helmet Equine conformation Toyota MR2 Bike lane debate Lamborghini Diablo Gross domestic product Suspension (vehicle) Honda Prelude Chevrolet Corvair Inertial guidance system Segregated cycle facilities Automobile Chopper (motorcycle) Snowboarding Wood The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hiberno-English Lance Armstrong Tank Bike trials riding Cyclo-cross Knife Truth Caterpillar track Stryker Bus rapid transit Drag racing Single-speed bicycle Explosive material Inflation Plastic Mountain bike racing Road transport Horse gait All-terrain vehicle Mazda RX-7 Upholstery Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Pickup truck Battery (electricity) Snowboard Paragliding Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Mercedes-Benz A-Class Thread (computer science) Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 Suspension bridge Psoriasis Dodge Charger High-heeled shoe Tofu Drill bit Chevrolet Camaro Strap-on dildo Guilty Gear Arthur Laffer Passenger car Toyota Prius Fire fighting Bomberman Land Rover (Series/Defender) Polyurethane Carpal tunnel syndrome Vehicular cycling Poker jargon Skateboard Schwinn Bicycle Company Philosophy of space and time Floppy disk Hubert H.
