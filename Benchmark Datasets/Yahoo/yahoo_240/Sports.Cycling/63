buying a new bicycle hello i am thinking seriously about buying a new bike and i want to educate myself before i make any decisions i enjoy both road and mountain biking i currently have a trek mountain bike but the front fork is pretty much shot i am also a triathlete and i bike miles to work sometimes so a road bike would be very nice i can only afford one bike i can maybe fix up the trek what kind of a road bike or hybrid should i look into my budget is about yes i do triathlons with a mountain bike i live in colorado so it is not that strange it is the reason i want a road bike though mountain bikes are jsut so slow i would vouch for buying a road bike however i would suggest supporting your local bicycle shop lbs so you have a resource when you need to get your bike tuned and such however is a very tight budget for a new bike you might consider a used bike or replacing the front fork of your existing bike as well as your tires replacing them with smooth city commuting tires the main advantages of the road bike are the handlebars which have more hand positions so your hands and arms do not go numb from having too much weight on them in the same position for too long in addition you will increase your top speed and average speed by having a more aerodynamic position at speeds above mph wind resistance swamps out all other factors rolling resistance drivetrain inefficiencies etc road bikes tend to be less weight this also helps reduce the power required the biggest things to get used to between road bikes and mountain bikes are the thinner wheels and tires which further decreases the amount of power required by decreasing the rotational inertia and assuming you have knobby tires on the mountain bike significantly less rolling resistance getting used to looking out for more pavement defects and debris can be a harsh learning experience when first starting on road bikes Triathlon Recumbent bicycle Racing bicycle Bicycle frame Bicycle brake systems Mountain biking Bicycle lighting Bicycle wheel Car handling Bike lane debate Tire Cycling Cyclo-cross Motocross Helicopter Utility cycling Single-speed bicycle Toyota Prius Hybrid vehicle Track cycling Fixed-gear bicycle Microeconomics Sport utility vehicle Jet engine Segregated cycle facilities Vehicular cycling Automobile Drag racing Bicycle helmet TGV Internal ballistics Four wheel drive Lance Armstrong Transportation of Los Angeles Schwinn Bicycle Company Formula One cars Derailleur gears Radio controlled airplane Chopper (motorcycle) BMX Mattress Supply and demand Sailing Porsche 911 Stryker 24 Hours of Le Mans Terminal ballistics Electric motor Wind power Honda CX series Fast bowling B-47 Stratojet Poker jargon Welding Personal rapid transit Penny-farthing Space Shuttle program Grand Prix motorcycle racing Aluminium Wood Headlight Chevrolet Corvair Carburetor Climbing specialist (cycling) M16 (rifle) Turbocharger Indianapolis 500 All-terrain vehicle Tractor Mass Public transport Toyota MR2 Law of value Heinkel He 112 Boston and Lowell Railroad Trail NASCAR BMW Formula One Panzer I Shifter (bicycle part) Swimming Bicycling terminology Douglas DC-8 Speed limit Battery electric vehicle Carbon fiber Rolling-element bearing Torque
