dreams of being in highschool still i keep having recurring dreams that im still in highschool at least every month and when i wake up im sad that im not anymore i just feel out of place when i wake up realizing im and not a teen anymore it's so weird usually in my dreams this happens i either have to rush to school or i get in class but i brag that somehow im done with all my work and classes but im still there but i feel out of place and then i realize wait i did really graduate why am i here then i wake up usually it makes me sad but im so tired of having this dream over and over and over my last year of highschool i went to a charter school the last months so i could graduate on time but i was there and never graduated on a stage i also had a dream once that i was graduating on stage but then realized wait i didn't graduate one stage why am i here i feel out of place as usual and then wake up its really getting annoying yet sad sounds like you have some unresolved issues to do with highschool it's tough to miss out on something that you feel everyone else got to experience like walking the stage at graduation and making that transition from still sorta a kid to full adult can be rocky don't stress about it and don't let it get you down what you're going through sounds pretty normal it might help to keep in mind that while you may feel that you missed out the truth is that there aren't many people who do have the typical highschool and graduation experience my last year of highschool i was in a program where i only went to class twice a week my mom graduated early and received her diploma in the principal's office she wasn't even there on the day the rest of her class graduated and my boyfriend's mom was so obsessed with academic excellence she changed his school almost every year so my point is almost all of us have something we feel we missed out on and almost all of us turn out just fine anyway when you are young and then while you are in highschool it's easy to feel that it's the be all and end all of life experience but the truth is your teenage years are just a handful in your whole life and highschool is only years out of or more it's such a small slice of the pie and while it's a great time of life that should be embraced it's also a tough one think back on the emotional ups and downs you experienced during highschool many people say that while many of their fondest memories are there they would never ever go back to their own highschool experiences you have tons of amazing experiences ahead of you and while letting go of being a teenager can be tough keep in mind that you don't have to let go of all of it what are the things you loved most about highschool your friends your music your hobbies whatever it is you can still make an effort to keep those things a part of your life today even if what you loved most was the school itself you can go to college and repeat the classroom experience for as long as you want the truth is you are still very young your youth is not gone the world is yours if you'll reach out and take it at this point in your life you have nothing but potential ahead of you and it's up to you to make that potential a reality you'll find your place in the world with time anyway i hope some of this speaks to you or encourages you a little if you take some time to examine your feelings about where you are in life right now and think about where you want to go and decide what your attitude will be about your past you will probably be able to resolve this within yourself and the recurring dreams will end best of luck to you sweetie Scenes from a Memory Kodocha Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Avenue Q Education in Romania Social rule The Lovely Bones Boston Public W.I.T.C.H.
