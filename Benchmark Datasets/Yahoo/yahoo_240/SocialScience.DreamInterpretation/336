dream interpretations i've been having this nightmare lately it's always the same one it's always about the same person i never remember much when i wake up but here's what i do remember my guy friend lives very far away where he lives they have monsoon season which they are currently in the middle of i originally thought that i was having this nightmare because i hadn't heard from him in a while my mind naturally went to the worst thing i could think of so in my nightmare there is a monsoon where my friend lives he dies in it and my dream is very graphic other than that i don't remember anything else except how it makes me feel scared alone those feelings seem to stay with me throughout the entire day any idea what this means or at least how to get rid of my nightmare thanks your subconsience always tell you things that u really wouldn't think about in your waking life most likely it's your body's way of telling you that you should contact him because u r worried about him in one way or another so to get rid of them all u have to do is speak to him and make sure he's o k but your dreams could also be intuition too so keep a heads up and get in contact with him Dream Lucid dreaming Jon Secada Theory of conduct Social rule The Shining (film) Philosophical skepticism Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Phaedo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Unconscious mind Children of Dune Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nightmares (Buffy episode) Socrates The Tale of the Body Thief Shen Gong Wu Oh My Goddess!
