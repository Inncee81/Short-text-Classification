can you interpret my unusual dream about pork skins and missing fingers i dreamed that i was standing in my room and i was eating very spicy pork skins i remember looking at the clock and the time was pm then i remember seeing an elderly couple standing at my bedroom door the old man told me that eating those spicy pork skins make his hands and feet swell up therefore he can't eat them anymore i remembered hearing his thick southern dialect then i remember standing there crunching on the last pork skins in the bag and looking at my hands in order to see if they were swollen just like how the old man had described to me just moments before to my surprise as i was chewing on the last pork skin i discovered that all ten of my fingers were all gone they looked as if they had been amputated just above the knuckles i stared at my ten missing fingers in disbelief and thought that they might grow back the elderly man insisted on taking me out to eat and although i didn't really want to i told him that i'd be ready in just a minute spiritual journey and or job related were you ever involved with the church a church the old man represents wisdom god and your past the time the last hour eating going out to eat fellowship partaking etc chewing meditation meditating on something i e thinking over an issue or etc hands fingers service ability necessity etc can represent a lot more feeling emotions discernment convictions accustaions etc is the number of judgment or double extention of grace i e grace so it was wisdom's warning something youre doing in life is hamful to you i e the old man telling you not to eat them you dont listen and it ends up costing you your ability to serve perform your job this is just my opinion take with a grain of salt Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Pork Cuisine of the Philippines Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mojave people The Shining (film) Volleyball Joseph (Hebrew Bible) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eastern Orthodox Church Richard Allen (reverend) Past teachings of Prem Rawat God Emperor of Dune Little Britain Philipp Melanchthon Boom Town (Doctor Who) Barbecue Simone Weil Roman Catholic Church Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
