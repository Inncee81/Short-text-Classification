what does this dream mean i had a very strange dream last night it was about my mother we fight alot and i never thought much about it well last night i went to bed at my dream was in a house that i've never seen before we started to fight she started to get steamed and went outside probably to have a smoke when i came outside she went through a gate that was surrounding the house i followed after her but i stopped when i got to the fence she got about yards away before she stopped and grabbed her stomach she came over to me as quick as she could walk and said my lung burst so i got really freaked out she didn't even get in the fence before i woke up it was about am when i woke up what does this mean you are stressed about the fighting you dont want it to hurt your relationship but it is and you feel helpless and dont know how to mend fences Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Atomic Kitten Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.
