ghostly experience or just me being paranoyed my brother had gone off to college and i was left alone upstairs and i was totally unused to the quiet since my bro always played music at night it took a really long time for me to go to sleep but finally after saying the lord's prayer repeatedly i drifted away a little boy was getting a shot i saw the needle going in his skin and he screamed then the little boy was suddenly in the garden in our back yard playing with a dog he had a band aid on his arm where he had gotten the shot and he was happy i woke to the sound of a child the boy from the dream laughing loudly in my ear his maniacal laughter shattered the silence of the dream and i was awake and shaking i really hate needles and all it was as if he was right beside me there was nothing to make me dream this no i hadnt had a shot that day no i have never had any insane people in my family history and no i have never seen this little boy all i am aware of is that the house that i live in now is really old and a little boy used to live here before something happened to him thats all i know and all that my mom will tell me i think this dream is just that a dream you shouldn't worry about it Shaggy dog story Sin City Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Miss Saigon A Day in the Life Sleep House of M Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dream The Star Wars Holiday Special EastEnders What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
