dream analysis i usually dont think my dreams may mean anything but recently i have been dreaming basically the same thing just in different forms the element of these dreams are basically me in different places and just talking and socializing with random people making friends then getting their email addresses and having pictures taken with them etc the people are completely invented and even the email addresses etc they also feel very real like i have actually made these friends and the photos do exist right until a few seconds after i wake up and then i feel disappointed because i feel like i have formed really solid good friendships in the dreams but they are nonexistant i have these every now and again and thought i'd ask about them as i had one last night i thought it may mean that deep down i really want to make new friends though i dont really feel unhappy with my social life what do you think i'd tend to agree with your interpretation that you want to make new friends or expand your network of friends beyond the comfort zone of your own smaller circle of real life friends although you are not unhappy with your social life you do seem to crave a broader range and diversity of social experiences Reality Dream Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis Out-of-body experience Mojave people Unconscious mind Alcoholics Anonymous Friendship Culture Jon Secada Happiness Avenue Q Infantilism Anonymous remailer Lucid dreaming MMORPG Social network Traumatic incident reduction Friends Sexual orientation Transactional analysis Fernando Pessoa Social rule Dog agility Determinism Social psychology Immanuel Kant Music Cindy Sheehan Knots Landing Narcissism Buddhist philosophy James Hillman Singapore gay equality movement Theory of conduct Dream Theater Jack Kerouac Intellectual property Patrick Star God Emperor of Dune Mulholland Drive (film) Computer Evil Arthur Machen Economics Gmail Postmodernism The nature of God in Western theology Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix William Shakespeare Pratitya-samutpada Computer-supported collaboration Internet fraud Inflation Goodness and value theory Atomism Person Deconstruction The Twilight Zone Religion Sociology of religion Franz Boas Philosophical skepticism Please Save My Earth Asperger syndrome Kender The Amber Spyglass Socrates Friedrich Schleiermacher Internet troll Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Cyberspace T-V distinction Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Narcolepsy Anderson Cooper Sleep Facebook (website) Communication skill Left-wing politics Origin of life Homestar Runner Modernism Surveillance Neopets Stopping e-mail abuse Domain Name System LiveJournal Atomic Kitten Anonymity Slavoj __i__ek The Standard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microeconomics H.
