why do i dream about tornadoes ever since was very little i've had very vivid dreams about tornadoes i live in kansas and that could definitely be part of it but i've never been effected by a tornado the dreams are never the same but they do usually involve very realistic situations normally the dream will be moving along and then i will see a tornado in the distance it's never too far away but never right on top when i first notice it i've also noticed that i'm usually with my family and friends and i usually have a safe place to go before the tornado actually hits the house or place i'm in oh and one more thing in about half my dreams i am driving when i first spot the tornado dreams are symbols that the sub conscious creates to help you sollve problems at night in your dreams that you cannot handle when you are awake dreaming of tornados mean that your life is very chaotic that you are unprepared and out of control in many aspects of your life even in your car you are trying to run away from the tornado meaning yourself but you can't at times you can find some kind of refuge for a while but not for long you need to find some personal time where you will not be bothered for awhile and take a critical look at your life both the past and the present take a llok at where you have been and where you are going and see what you think about it and if there is anything you can change for the better that is less hectic and chaotic Lucid dreaming Scenes from a Memory Tornado DDT (professional wrestling) Out-of-body experience The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Andover, Kansas Tornado Professional wrestling throws Thomas Cole Dream Narcolepsy Grandview, U.S.A.
