weird dream about my best fried and me okay im only twelve and i have a girlfriend if that helps the dream is me and and my best friend who is a girl and im a guy are talking in my back yard and we start kissing she then gets a call from her mom and she walks home she lives next door i call her later and ask her if the only reason we kissed is because she felt sad or something like but she said no we start going out in the dream i didnt have a girlfriend before her after a few weeks my grandma died and at her funeral i start balling and she comes over to me and cheers me up we kissed again then i woke up does that mean im in love with my best friend and not y girlfriend i think the kissing indicates emotional intimacy not necessarily sexual or love intimacy in this case you are close despite external forces pulling you apart her mum calling her away or internal forces questioning your relationship you asking her about the kiss in fact those things only strengthen the relationship because you start going out then something bad happens grandmother dies and you cry so she kisses you again i'd say your best friend may be the person you're most close to emotionally maybe you're not in love with her but you definitely do love her and you find her very comforting it seems like she must be a very sweet girl Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Physical intimacy About a Boy Friendship The Amber Spyglass Scenes from a Memory Infantilism The Smoking Room Kodocha Child sexuality Love Phoebe Buffay's songs The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jennifer Parker Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Blood on the Tracks Charmed Polyamory Shaggy dog story Something Positive Neighbours Human sexual behavior Sex and the City Mina Mongoose The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Lovely Bones Mojave people Funeral Little Britain Garfield Futurama (TV series - season 4) Interpersonal relationship The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Philip J.
