please help me interpret this dream i had a few nights ago ok i had to drive south the entire length of lake winnipesaukee to get to my husband as i rounded a bend i drove into a hotel and all the rooms had glass walls you could see in every room and people in their rooms had monkeys and were playing with them then the hotel turned out to really be a boat hotel and the section i was on broke free from the rest and it went into the middle of a bunch of other sections i'm generally of the opinion that imagery in dreams has meaning that tends to be important to the dreamer and the fact that you noticed the specific lake and mentioned it here would indicate that lake winnipesaukee has some importance or meaning to you however i'm not privy to that information so i can't suss it out if you were my client i would ask you to determine what meaning does this lake have to you what feelings does it draw forth for you do you have good feelings associated with it or good memories etc the fact that you're trying to get to your husband could mean that you are in fact trying to get closer to your husband in waking life or it could be that you want to be more like something that your husband represents to you for example strength kindness resilience independence again i'm not getting a clear picture because your husband doesn't appear again within the dream it could go either way here depending on many factors so i leave the interpretation up to you here the imagery of a hotel with clear glass walls is interesting you can see into every room and basically you're seeing the hotel's inner workings and secrets common thought on dream content is that it is a way for your subconscious to work out some of its issues and i think that is a good way of interpreting the imagery here i think the hotel here is you looking at yourself so to speak in fact it is very possible that the entire drea is one where you're engaged in some very deep self examination and every image is a distinct part of yourself when you are looking at the hotel you are looking deeply at yourself and seeing into your own head perhaps you have some fears that you are transparent to others or you have a wish to better understand yourself but find that your own motives are somewhat confusing that you're playing with monkeys personally i like that image and symbolism and when you finally get into the hotel it's not quite what you thought it was it was a boat and it broke free and went into a bunch of the other sections this part is somewhat unclear and i suppose this is normal for dream logic i think if we go along with my interpretation of it being a self examination dream that you have a sense of feeling a bit lost at times it does reinforce this with an actual image of you being adrift in the hotel personally i'd look at this dream as one about personal growth and you feeling as if you are perhaps wanting to take a bit of time to figure out where you are right now if this doesn't seem to make sense then i'd try picking the dream apart for yourself image by image and ask what each symbol means to you and what image represents to you most symbols have personal meaning as well as universal meaning and the content of dreams usually lies somewhere in between Philosophy of language Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Theory of conduct Unconscious mind Logic Lucid dreaming Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Dream Philosophical skepticism Variable Modal logic Supply and demand David Hume Determinism Ethics Friends Out-of-body experience Postmodernism Motivation W.I.T.C.H.
