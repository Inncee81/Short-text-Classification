last night i dreamt i went to this event wedding or something this woman wore the same evening dress as mine its a lilac dress with silver diamontes and beads all over it which i actually really do have in real life packed away in a box this woman in my dream wore the exact same dress as mine and i mean exact was almost like she deliberately wore the same the only difference was hers was a light pink colour mine was lilac so because she wore the same i remember feeling annoyed in the dream so she got changed into something else i'm not stupid and realise that dreams always end up meaning more to what you think it means it never ends up meaning the obvious like this doesn't mean in real life that when i wear this dress sometime in the future that some woman is going to end up wearing the exact same dress too cause that just sounds silly this definitely has a whole other different meaning behind it anyone think they might know i have no idea why my dreams are so weird why on earth i'd dream of this beautiful dress which i actually do have packed away in a box i do not know lol it could mean you arent comfortable with a certain life decision and wish you had chosen this 'pink dress' Eric Cartman God Emperor of Dune Japanese tea ceremony Avenue Q Clothing Kate Bush Code: Lyoko Monty Python Marie Antoinette Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cliff Richard Boy Scouts of America EastEnders The Marriage of Figaro Whose Line Is It Anyway?
