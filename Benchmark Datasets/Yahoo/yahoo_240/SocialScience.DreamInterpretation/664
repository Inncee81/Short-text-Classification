what does my dream mean to you i have recently had a dream about a friend that was rather hot and steamy i do not find this man attractive and i have a good looking man of my own in the dream we were sneaking away to a cottage on the beach and made love all the time it is crazy to me because i never thought of this guy as my type does this mean that i have a secret crush on this guy or am i just wanting a little more action in my life i have a good sex life but not the one that i would like sometimes right now i am happy with it help i am a little wierded out by this i am getting alot of good answers keep them coming i have not in real life been with this man would never even think about it he is the complete opposite of my man sex dreams are very rarely about sex and this one sounds the same i mean if you had a dream about sleeping with president bush it doesn't mean he's hot it has to do with power and intimidation of course i think that anyone who falls into that category needs help it seems you answered your own question and that is important since you know what is going on in your life and all the situations that are occuring there is no attraction to your friend he is just the manifestation of something new you said that things in your personal life are not as action filled as you would like and that your sex life is fine but you wish sometimes for more that is what your dream is about talk to your mate and see if there are ways to spice up the relatioinship a little you won't be plagued by having dreams anymore with other men you do not find attractive Avenue Q Jon Secada Friends Sexual orientation One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Lucid dreaming Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders Something Positive Sex Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 50 First Dates Theory of conduct Socrates Aesthetic Realism The Amber Spyglass Phoebe Buffay's songs Children of Dune Red Hot Chili Peppers Goodness and value theory Sex Pistols W.I.T.C.H.
