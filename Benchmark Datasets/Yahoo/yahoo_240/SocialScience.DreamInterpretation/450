my dreams often come true every weeks or so i get really vivid dreams where i'm in an everyday place and something happens e g a friend says something someone trips over it starts raining a few weeks sometimes months after these dreams come true and actually happen is this a premonition or a prediction by my brain is there a way in which i can increase these types of dreams it is not a precognition i think cause that would be when your brain sees something that is actually happening but somewhere else for example the magicians in tribal populations could see the white invadors arriving a long time before cause they'd see them on their way already but then it would take weeks or more for them to arrive in your case you might be making true some of the things you imagined when u find urself in a situation similar to the one in ur dream your subconscious remembers about it and 'creates it' makes it come true you can increase these types of dreams and also improve your controlling skills with lucid dreaming techniques Dream Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Unconscious mind Magic (paranormal) Philosophical skepticism D__j__ vu Hypnosis Autism Jon Secada Consciousness Telepathy Magic (illusion) Precognition Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Free will Psychosis Children of Dune Parapsychology Direct realism Therion (band) Astral projection Scenes from a Memory Aphasia Negima Miracle The Martian Chronicles Haibane Renmei Weather lore Infantilism Wheel of Fortune Storytelling Stuttering Freeters Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Minority Report (film) 50 First Dates Stroke Hypnagogia Emanuel Swedenborg Debugging Kimi Finster CPU cache Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants A Course In Miracles Cliff Richard I Have a Dream Falsifiability Traumatic brain injury Social rule Artificial neural network Stereoscopy Avenue Q John Berryman Left-handed Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Datalore (TNG episode) Remember...
