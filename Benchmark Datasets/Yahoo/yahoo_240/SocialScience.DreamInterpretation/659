i had this weird dream any thoughts two nights ago i had a dream that keeps bothering me i kept trying to climb up a grass covered hill at first the hill wasn't too steep but as i got higher it got steeper and harder to climb i slid to the bottom a few times i remember being scared to death when i was falling eventually i got up to the top of the hill and when i got up there there was a shoe store i went into the store and looked at shoes in my size but none of the shoes matched there were no pairs of shoes just single shoes i knew that there were no pairs but i kept trying to make pairs out of similar looking single shoes anyways as i was attempting poorly to match shoes i woke up and now i'm curious does this dream mean anything important thanks in advance for your input oh i just remembered this also a few of my friends were in the shoe store they all found showed me good pairs of shoes in their respective sizes different from my size and their pairs were like you'd buy in a store perfectly matched the hill is whatever your trying to succeed at a class your career whatever but you find it hard to keep focus on the goal you are afraid that this pursuit to your goal may not be exactly for you that you may be headed for the wrong domain that you may not fit in that life you chose for yourself seek other interests Shoe Mattress Shaggy dog story Mountaineering Glossary of climbing terms Cliff Richard Badminton Equine conformation Poker jargon Eddie Guerrero Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Socrates Heinkel He 112 Sin City X86 assembly language Jon Secada The Time Machine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 1957 World Series P-38 Lightning Extreme Programming One Tree Hill (TV series) Fast bowling Grade (climbing) Floppy disk Piccolo Junior Saga Carpenters Combine harvester Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Married... with Children Squidward Tentacles Volleyball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Holes (book) American Pie (song) Manifold Climbing route Marching band Irish dance Battle of Chunuk Bair Charles Goodyear American lobster Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Out-of-body experience Empire Burlesque Alex Ferguson MP3 Kate Bush Honey and Clover Knots Landing Gliding Glacier Digital photography Kurt Cobain W.I.T.C.H.
