creepy dream what could it mean so i was at a public pool when i seen this guy i know him in real life he passed away about months ago and i saw him walking beside the pool with another guy i just stared at him as he walked by i turned my head around to keep looking at him and all of a sudden i felt this very strong pull on my right side and when i looked up i saw his face it was all gross like a zombie type and he shouted in my ear watch your back honey and i woke up super scared and the whole right side of my body felt like pins and needles like when its asleep and waking up totally creepy oh and i was not close to this guy i didnt know him that well i just knew him from church what could this mean here is the analysis from zigmond froid's dream book the pool represents your mother or your birth water birth so maybe he was somehow related to her or your birthday or something like that walking beside the pool is easy walking a trip a trip death shouting might mean a cry for help or fear maybe he died in a scary way or maybe you are afraid of dying how he died etc the zombie face could be related to you seeing a similar face on tv a couple days before or talking about it with friends the physical pins 'n needles is completely normal after having an intense dream just remember that dreams are the minds way of clearing out your brains ram memory from the days or weeks events that's all in rare cases dreams can cross quantum worlds and provide incite about the past present or future Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story The Inside Prank flash The Amber Spyglass Dream Milton H.
