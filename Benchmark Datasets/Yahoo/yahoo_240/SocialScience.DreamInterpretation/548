stage dreams i had three dreams with a common theme dream i went somewhere to help someone i forgot who and why then arrived at my high school graduation only to have someone tell me i missed it dream all my family and friends are sitting facing a stage i arrive and sit with them and one of my friends is on stage introducing a production which all of us are going to be a part of i'm excited about it because i know i'm going to do a good job i think this took place at a carnival dream i'm on stage looking at a huge outdoor audience i'm supposed to give a speech and it's my high school graduation then this guy tells me i'm on in a few minutes i'm excited because i know my speech is going to be great i look out at the audience get ready to approach the podium but i wake up before i do i dont get to actually talk in front of the audience in any of these dreams and i had a sense of courage and excitement in all three what do you think these dreams mean to dream that you are helping someone indicates your willingness to compromise your beliefs toward a greater accomplishment it also represents your efforts to combine your talents or energies to achieve a mutual goal in particular if you are helping an enemy or someone you do not like then it suggests that you need to come to an understanding or some sort of middle ground in order to move forward and on with your life to dream that you are in school signifies feelings of inadequecy and childhood insecurities that have never been resolved it may relate to anxieties about performance and abilities you may also be going through a spiritual learning experience if you are still in school and dream about school then it will naturally serve as a backdrop to your dream world alternatively a dream that takes place in school may be a metaphor for the lessons that you are learning from your waking life to dream that you are at a graduation represents your achievements and a successful transition to a higher level of ability you are ready to move forward with your accomplishments and do more important things since you missed it perhaps you aren't ready to see your own family in high spirits in your dream symbolizes harmony and happiness to see them gloomy foretells of disappointment and sadness to dream that you are sitting indicates your indecision and not knowing what you want to do with yourself in the near future it may also suggest that you are just being idle and doing nothing to dream that you are at the carnival represents falsehoods and deception if you observe freakish sights then it denotes that there is lack of harmony in your domestic life much sorrow with arise in what were thought to be pleasant times to dream that you are in front of an audience represents the world around you and it is paying close attention to your actions alternatively it suggests your fears of having your personal feelings and private thoughts discovered or revealed is something holding you back from being happy it seems as though every time you're going to do something that excites you the dream goes away Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Meaning of life Miss Saigon Dream Philosophical skepticism Numerology Lucid dreaming Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience Volleyball Psychoanalysis Jiddu Krishnamurti Goodness and value theory Scientology beliefs and practices Infantilism Magic (illusion) God Emperor of Dune Reiki Summa Theologiae Karen Horney Religion K' Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Phaedo The nature of God in Western theology Force (Star Wars) Alcoholics Anonymous One Tree Hill (TV series) A Course In Miracles W.I.T.C.H.
