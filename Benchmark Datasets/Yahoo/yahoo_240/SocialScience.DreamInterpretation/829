if someone has dreamt about their own mother old enough not to have kids anymore about to have babies some of them have already been born whilst some others haven't what does this indicate the dreamer felt happy for the mother but the mother felt tired with the thought of having to take care of so many babies i know it's pretty specific the thing is the dreamer's father is having major problems with his health that he is currently admitted to a doctor a life and death situation i wouldn't like to think that the dream indicated that the mother would actually re marry it wouldn't make sense a good dream forum site will be appreciated too most dreamers do not dream prophetically babies represent new beginnings and or creativity is usually a number about travelling and writing but all this applies to the dreamer not the mother in the dream since the dreamer is happy about the mother's situation my guess is that the dreamer is looking forward to those new beginnings the mother is drained the dreamer is tired of his her responsiblities and is drained represented by the mother in the dream Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Lucid dreaming Carlos Castaneda Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Haven (TNG episode) About a Boy Happiness Infantilism Knots Landing AFI 100 Years series Goodness and value theory Kodocha Childbirth Care Bears Jon Secada Abortion debate EastEnders Radical Dreamers Kate Bush The Amber Spyglass Charles Dickens John Howard Yoder Scenes from a Memory Ethics Carl Jung The McGuire Sisters Alois Hitler Charmed Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard John Berryman Phoebe Buffay's songs Edgar Cayce Breastfeeding Pitaten Israel ben Eliezer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Leslie Cheung Kimi Finster Charles Goodyear Miss Saigon Frankie Vaughan W.I.T.C.H.
