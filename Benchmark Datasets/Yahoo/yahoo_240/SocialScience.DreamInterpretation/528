dreams about my ex the last time we were together was june and the last time i ever saw him was december we didn't even speak i saw him and his family at a wedding i have never heard from him ir saw him ever again from some friends i found out that he is now married which hurt me like hell but i know i have to be strong anywayz i always have dreams about him even before he got married i always have dreams of us in the same room and i am trying to find a way out or run away these dreams happen like once twice a month and it is hurting me so much i loved and wanted him so much but why do i always dream about me running away from him we ended on terrible terms and he doesn't think much of me so i can't speak to him to get closure etc how can i stop dreaming about him especially dreams of me trapped in the same area of him and now his wife and i am trying to escape i totally understand what you're feeling i didn't get closure from my ex either whom i last saw in we broke up because he was going back and forth between me and his girlfriend before me last week i was looking through old photos and saw one of us together which brought back bitter memories and that same night i had a dream about him he came looking for me but i didn't go out to meet him i was so relieved to wake up and realize it was just a dream my advice write about it keep a journal and let it all out on paper you'll feel close to him for awhile but if you can get closure for yourself you may even want to publish it online like at www postsecret com or something so you can forget about the past and move on good luck to you Scenes from a Memory Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story What Dreams May Come Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sharon Tate Miss Saigon Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Jon Secada Fancy Crane Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Cliff Richard Sin City Marilyn Monroe Blood on the Tracks Fiddler on the Roof Pok__mon Live!
