i have the craziest dream it is just me and i am in the middle of nowhere or better yet an infinite world filled with just water and sky no land at all and the sky is beautiful with a few clouds and it is so bright but there is no sun to be found anywhere in the dream i never move i am standing in still knee deep water that is so clear yet it does on forever there is no bottom when i look down i can see my reflection everything but my face then i notice my hands are bound behind my back and i just bend forward and dip only my face into the water when my face enters the water it lights up and i can finally see my face i am smiling then i wake up what could this mean your dream is from the lord jesus christ the water you were standing in represents the word of god the reason you can not see your face at first is because your true destiny in the lord has been hidden from you the true reflection of who you really are has not been unfolded to you your hands being bound represent that you are in bondage to sin in areas of your life when you dipped your face in the water it represents your identity being washed by the word of god bringing forth who you really are in the lord that's why your face lights up because now you are a reflection of the lord The Amber Spyglass Eastern Orthodox Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Trinity Sabbath Book of Mormon Jewish Messiah Christian eschatology Priesthood (Mormonism) Jon Secada Ragnarok Bhagavad Gita Angel Religion Vishnu The Pilgrim's Progress Soul Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Professional wrestling throws Christianity Salvation Paul Is Dead Roman Catholic Church Skateboarding trick Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sin Heaven K' Jesus S__ren Kierkegaard Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Horus The Subtle Knife Kain (Legacy of Kain) Origin belief Yu-Gi-Oh!
