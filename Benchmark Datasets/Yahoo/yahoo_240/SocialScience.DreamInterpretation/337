reccuring dreams followed by nose bleeds when i wake up meaning for the past nights i've had dreams about my neighbor whom up until recently i'd been very close to they always happen in the same place too out in front of my front lawn once i wake up each of the nights i got a nose bleed which i find very unusual the first dream was positive but the other three protrayed my neighbor in a very negative manner i feel like its my subconcious trying to tell me something i dont know does anyone have any insight i see this on two different levels one the dreams may be causing emotional excitement which raises your blood pressure and that can cause nose bleeds if that is the case then any excitement disturbance or stress may trigger the bleed the other is symbolic something in your psyche is telling you this neighbor has your nose bent out of shape Lucid dreaming Bleeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Carl Jung Cephalic disorder Stroke Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Unconscious mind Gestalt therapy Stress (medicine) Nosebleed W.I.T.C.H.
