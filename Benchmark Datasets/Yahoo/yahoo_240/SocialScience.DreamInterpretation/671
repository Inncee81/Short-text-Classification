i had a dream i had a tongue piercing does that mean i should get one i used to hate them until now last night i had a dream that i had a tongue piercing and i took it out and placed it next to me and then i decided that i didn't want to lose it because i had just got the piercing and hadn't bought any new ones yet so i tried putting it back in and i couldn't find the hole for a while but i finally found it and was really happy when i had it back in i have my own look and really like pale skin black eyemascara etc plump red lips classy hair and fab classy rock punk hip hop style clothing on me i never would have considered a tongue piercing until my dream last night should i get one i'm please help thanks xao p dream content is symbolic not literal so unless you want a tongue piercing in waking don't get it just because you got it in your dreams i could consider that the piercing would indicate something more along the lines that you are considering learning a new language or using language in a new and different way or that you're trying on different persona or styles in your life to see which ones fit you and your subconscious is telling you the best way to find out if something works is to try it on for awhile to see if it works basically you won't know what works for you until you try it first i doubt your dreams are telling you to get a tongue piercing Marilyn Monroe Knots Landing Body piercing Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Hip hop music W.I.T.C.H.
