spiritual dreams i keep having dreams where i am at church at a church youth camp or in a cemetery my dream last night i was with five friends three girls and two boys i can only remeber the boys and can't remeber the girls the two boys one was a friend and was a tv show character the girl seems like she was a friend of mine in the dream i was telling them about god and how they had al become different that they were changing i was in a cemetery with dead leaves trees ans stone benches it was dark like a storm was coming and at one pint i found a makeup compact that had a cracked mirror i picked it up and said look at what you've become the girl took the mirror and saud yeah im pretty hot and the male friend of mine looked in the mirror and said yeah im pretty adorable myself after that i took the mirror and it wa even more cracked what could this mean thank you i think the death part is about change or some part of your life is ending for a new part to begin the dream characters seem to think the the change is positive even though the mirror is cracking was your feeling that they were good people if not maybe they are focussed on the wrong thing appearances and its a warning not to stray from your spiritual path The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Kodocha Neil Gaiman Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cliff Richard About a Boy Marilyn Monroe Salad Fingers One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Jiddu Krishnamurti W.I.T.C.H.
