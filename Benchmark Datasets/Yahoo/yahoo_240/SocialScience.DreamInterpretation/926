weird combination in a dream i dreamt all these things yesterday one was where i was in a bastketball or netball team not sure and i couldnt even catch the ball then there was this other part where i was late for an appointmant then the other one where i was fighting or was disappointed with my brother and another one where my mother was telling someone that she was disspointed in me what does this mean i have seen these dreams seperately before also except for the brother thing i think couldn't even catch the ball losing control late for appointment stress anxiety fighting with your brother seeking for admiral guilty feeling being disappointed by mother regret low self esteem it could mean that once you are losing your control you will feel bad and you may be feeling guilty about things you cannot do or take charge and that caused anxiety and anxiety may lead to low self esteem and confidence and so you are losing control again putting them together you may be seeking for support in regaining control in life you don't want to feel low because you are not looked up on you want to take charge but some how you can't you may blame it for others for not praising you or encourage this may come from your mother in short you may need some encouragement Knots Landing EastEnders Narcissism Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Alex Ferguson Anxiety Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 History of Test cricket (to 1883) Sigmund Freud God Emperor of Dune Brian Close Norway national football team Indian Oil Cup 2005 Gordon Banks The Contender (television series) Strategic management Charlie Brown Cris Carter The Catcher in the Rye Cleveland Browns New York Giants Neville Chamberlain Obsessive-compulsive disorder Ben Johnson (athlete) Karen Horney W.I.T.C.H.
