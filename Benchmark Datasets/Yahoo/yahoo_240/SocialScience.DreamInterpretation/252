where can you get the meaning of dreams i keep havning the same dream over and over its not a bad dream but i am not sure what it means does anyone know where i can go on the web to interpret dreams some people believe that there are universal symbolic meaning in dreams but i'm not a proponent of this i think you could post them here and get multiple interpretations of them and you could get a more varied perspective there are many perspectives on interpreting dreams predictive psychological etc i tend to be fairly psychological in my dream interpretations for example other people tend to be very concrete others are more predictive etc looking at a broad spectrum of interpretations gives you a variety of dream interpretations to consider and some fresh perspectives personally i think the symbolic content is a mixed bag of some universal archetypes and more often a personal symbolic language if you really want accurate dream interpretation you're not going to get it from dream books and websites you're going to get it from interaction with a very good qualified analyst barring that someone with some good skills and study in jungian or freudian dream interpretation might be an excellent choice for psychological dream interpretation Carl Jung Analytical psychology Social psychology Symbol Autism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Predestination Psychology of religion Art Reality Sigmund Freud Jungian psychology Personality psychology Graphology Archetype Intelligence (trait) Asperger syndrome Eyes Wide Shut Transpersonal psychology Cognitive science Many-worlds interpretation Dream AQAL Logic Robert L.
