i had a strange dream in space i was not high fyi any ideas i had a dream a few nights ago that was so odd i could still remember it quite good i was in space just outside earth and i could see all these small missles heading towards earth and i could also see millions of these space land mines floating around so like a game i was simply pushing these incoming missles out of the way of these mines well one got by and i floated after it as quickly as i could and grabbed it before it hits the atmosphere but instead of simply redirecting it a threw it as far as i could but where i threw it i saw it flying fast towards a space land mine so i flew away as turbo fast as i could like light speed then i stopped in a weird of the galaxy and stood on top of this spaceship and looked inot the distance where milky way is i then saw a small red dot and saw it grow larger and larger i knew it was a massive explosion then i saw the explosion come towards me a turbo speed and it hit me hard i could see my body floating dead according to dreamcrowd to see or dream that you are in space represents exploration and independent thinking you are broadening your horizons and view alternatively the dream may indicate that you are spacing out you need to return your concentration back on your future and goals try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Solar system Robot Master Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Black hole Gamma ray burst Volleyball Space opera in Scientology doctrine Piccolo Junior Saga Jupiter Opportunity rover Professional wrestling throws Tenshinhan Milky Way Sun Unreal The Parting of the Ways Project Orion The Amber Spyglass Big Bang Time travel Moon Megatron Out-of-body experience Combine (Half-Life 2) General relativity The Legend of Zelda series enemies Supernova Parachuting Table tennis Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Planetary nebula Extraterrestrial hypothesis Mario series enemies Blood (computer game) Fermi paradox Skateboarding trick Space colonization Plate tectonics Open cluster Conker's Bad Fur Day Science fiction on television Gravity Special relativity Items in the Metroid series Colonization of the Moon Interstellar travel Turbocharger Titan (moon) The Time Machine Vacuum Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Futurama (TV series - season 5) Project Apollo Ecco the Dolphin Terran (StarCraft) Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Aerial (dance move) Transformers: Cybertron Halo: Combat Evolved Railgun Suplex Hubble's law Thermal power station Katamari Damacy Link (Legend of Zelda) Dark matter Super Mario 64 The Dalek Invasion of Earth Super Metroid Robert A.
