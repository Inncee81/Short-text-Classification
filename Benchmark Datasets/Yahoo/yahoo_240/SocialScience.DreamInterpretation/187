can anyone explain my dream it is rather weird lol hiya i had such a weird dream last night and i was wondering if anyone could explain it maybe i dreamt that i was in the gym as if and i was just bench pressing and using weights on my arms etc all night when i woke up no word of a lie my arms did feel as though i had been working out in the gym for hours it really spooked me out alix x thats not unusual your muscules would have been stimulated due to the dream and therefore had a bit of a real work out it the same situation when your being chased in a dream but can't run away it's because your actual body can't move as it's obviously asleep i had a dream that i won the london marathon i woke up and my feet and ankles ached so much it's just the chemical reation in your body according to your mind Dream Out-of-body experience The Amber Spyglass Lucid dreaming Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Sleep Avenue Q Miss Saigon Spanking Consciousness Professional wrestling holds Pok__mon Live!
