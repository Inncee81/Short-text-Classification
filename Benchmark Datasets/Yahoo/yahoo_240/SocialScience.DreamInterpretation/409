can anyone interprest this dream it is a dream from god everybody is welcome to intepret it but i would need someone who is a christian and understands biblical interpretation but here is my dream i was looking at a field and there was a large tree about ft long laying on it's side the tree was rotted and decaying i proceeded to the tree with caution looking for snakes i grabbed the top end of the tree and lifted it it was like a top layer of the tree came up and fell over onto the ground inside that first layer was nothing buy decaying tree fiber i grabbed it a second time and a second layer came off with nothing under it except decaying tree fiber then at the third layer i saw a huge earthworm which was about and half ft long and as big around as a coke bottle i notices that half of it was like destroyed or deflated i pulled the earthworm out and put it on the ground i said in the dream whoa everyone has to see this then i noticed something moving in place where the earthworm was it was a centipede the okay contiuing on the centipede was the same size as the worm i said again wow look at the size of this i took a stick and pried the centipede out of the tree and got it onto the ground i took a stick and held it's head down while i tried to grab it when i went to grab it it curled around my around and tried to bite me i was worried in my dream because i knew centipedes are poisonous i wrestled with it and it bit me anyway but the bite did not harm me finally i managed to grab it by it's head i had it in a awkward position i pulled on it's head but it dug it's claws into my arm i felt that i could have pulled it's head off but i felt some compassion some people appeared and asked me if i needed help they tried to pull the centipede's claws out of my arm but when they pulled one set out another went in then i felt a heart beating from the centipede since it was stretched across my back like a towel then the dream ended i woke up bothered in the bible numbers usually mean something the fact that you peeled the bark back three times through three layers may mean that you will make attempts to unconver something that is hidden the tree represents something that is rotting from within and you are searching for what is going on the earthworm represents something that had been protected but was attacked and is halfway defeated and devoured by satan the centipede represents satan who has destroyed this person or at least half of them and this tree over time it now seeks to devour you however you you are fighting he still clings to you and seeks to devour you yet you are struggling against him and he may be start to gain a foothold in your life as you can start to feel his heartbeat think about your church a close friend of yours your family something that could be rotting undernieth that you are not aware of once you expose what is going on the person you rescued the worm will be saved but satan will turn his vengence on you remember satan is the father of lies and the only power he has is his lies someone you know or perhaps many people may have been decieved perhaps something that has been passed down through generations or has creeped up seek the truth in everything you know something is being disguised here and you may be discovering a closely hidden or guarded secret that satan is going to fight like mad to be sure it isn t exposed the people watching and asking if you need help are people around you if they help they will be attacked too but you will need them and their prayers otherwise satan will overpower you Professional wrestling holds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Shaggy dog story Snake Tenshinhan Vegeta RuneScape quests Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Amber Spyglass Suplex Piccolo Junior Saga Incarnations of Immortality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist K' Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sin City Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kain (Legacy of Kain) Professional wrestling attacks Osiris Satan LaVeyan Satanism Dragon boat The Shining (film) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Tag Mattress Joseph (Hebrew Bible) God Emperor of Dune The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Naruto jutsu Escape from New York God The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Textile manufacturing InuYasha StarCraft Secret Missions Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piledriver (professional wrestling) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March StarCraft: Uprising Great Old Ones compendium The Curse of Fenric Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Pok__mon Live!
