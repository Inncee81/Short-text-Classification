nightmares dream interpretation murder any insight please i have had a strange dream last week and would like it interpreted if possible as it was very vivid and scary i have a dream book but it is not in there me and most of my family were walking down a street and down the bottom there is a hilly area my mum and sister were ahead and came back towards me saying there is a dead body down there i walk down and see a grassy area with a female dead body whose wrists are bound and she is on the ground in a foetal position faced away from me she has platinum short blonde hair and is naked she has a chemical poured over her body which i use as a scientist in my lab i phone the police but twice i couldnt get through finally i get through to someone and tell them my location i get a call back saying they cant locate me and where was i and to stay where i was my instincts tell me it is the killer i have no idea why and i am panicking to try and get out of there and tell my family we need to get out then i woke up well i havent seen a murder on tv recently i dont watch tv much anyway and i hate police or crime programmes yes it was vivid and scary as for the chemical it was potassium permanganate it wouldnt be on tv its a bleaching agent which may explain the whitish blonde hair and pale skin dream interpreter i did not see a killer in my dream as you have answered john m the first part make sense as for the second well i am a flirty confident person and attract male attention so this part doesnt make sense i would say that the dead girl in the foetal position is you putting away the last of your childhood but it's scary because whats in front of you ie your future is the unknown you are unsure how you want to move ahead is the job you have really what you want to be doing or do you want to do something else the nakedness is your vulnerability right now you are obviously intelligent you are a scientist but you have a lot of uncertainties are you thinking you need to move away from your family to progress possibly abroad if you go in this direction will you still be the same person and are you grown up and confident enough to handle a big leap forward not being able to contact the police is probably a feeling of not being able to talk to anyone else about this issue and the killer is your uncertainty you want to take your family with you but this is your leap forward not theirs if any of this rings true then make your move and go forward you will not regret it EastEnders The Inside Joker (comics) Shaggy dog story Sin City The Shining (film) God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Halliwell The Lovely Bones Columbine High School massacre Serial killer W.I.T.C.H.
