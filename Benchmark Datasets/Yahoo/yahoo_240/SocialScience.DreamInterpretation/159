my husband won't sleep because of his bad dreams his dreams are really bothering him and i think he needs to figure out what's at the root of them so he can deal with it get some sleep he can't hardly tell if he is awake or dreaming in them either so they really freak him out he thought they were real like our house was haunted or something until i figured out that he was definitely asleep once he had a dream that someone was banging on our front door but no one was there he went back to bed in the dream and started relaxing and the banging happened again no one there again the other night he had a dream that someone was outside on our deck walking around jangling keys then they came around to the back into the back door slammed it and ran to our bedroom door like they were going to burst in but there was no one there he says he feels helpless in these dreams and since he started having them he wants to get a gun he's also heard about b e's in various parts of the country where the people were home i think he's anxious about becoming a father and i also think he s overly concerned about protecting me our future baby the dreams started around the time we found out i was pregnant it was planned also it might be related to his first son being taken away from his mother by the state being put up for adoption he tried to get custody but to no avail what do you think lol big reader huh crystal d yep i'd bet dollars to donuts that the pregnancy has everything to do with his dreams he's clearly anxious of course to me the obvious symbolism at work is that your child is banging on the door of your lives to come in maybe it's more about whatever problems your husband is having dealing with the coming kid if he was hurt badly by his previous child being taken away from him maybe part of him is afraid to invest too much love in this next child being afraid the same thing will happen again if you look at it that way then the intruder is the kid trying to get into your husband's heart he she the kid is looking for the keys that will let him her in the normal way but lacking that will go around to a back door like nightmares to be let in to your husband's heart and mind and recognized as a reality i don't think a gun will help really maybe the b es he heard about only inspired his subconscious to use that as a symbol to say something to him sound like that might be reasonable Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Dream About a Boy W.I.T.C.H.
