do dreams have meanings if if you dream the same thing twice i had a dream today and i know that i dreamt it before long ago i remember what happened in my dream when i first had it and i stopped it from happening today my st dream excerpt i was on a wooden yacht with this guy name jonathan test i never heard of him or seen him and he was my boyfriend in my dream and then there were alot of other guys and the water was icy cold and i came out of this room with jonathan and my friend was talking on the phone then she said what can i give you to get my ticket and she hung up and took something out of her bag it was mine it was foiled up and inside it was these rare shells and i put it in her bag before cause i didnt carry a bag or anything and she takes it out and all of a sudden it turns into a ticket and we fight cause it was mine and she traded it with someone so she can get a ticket my nd dream its the same just not the ticket part i remembered this part it felt like de ja vu to me and i remembered when my friend was on the phone and i knew what was gonna happen so i took her bag and took my shells and stood next to my boyfriend then my friend that was on the phone started shouting and yelling where is the damn shells johnathan and i knew that i had it cause it was mine so i hid it behind me and she came to us asking where it was and johnathan stood up for me so instead he made a lie and asked his friends that was on the second floor up above to throw the shells they threw a little box and inside he put in of my shells and gave it to her she was happy and she got her ticket and i still had my shells then i went up to her and said those were my shells give it to me i wanted her to tell me sorry but she didnt she said what are you talking about those were mine and i slapped her and she said sorry does this have any meaning at all having the same dream and knowing what will happen so i prevented it it sounds to me like you have either lost something pressious to this friend in the past or you are afraid of it happening in the future but since you were able to stop it in the second dream perhaps you have done something to resolve the past event or you feel more securew with your friendship you boyfriend in the dream sticking up for you might signify that that new security comes from someone like him in your life is there someone in you life that acts like jonathan test if there is you may want to get to know him better your dream might be telling you that you feel safe around him also you friend doesn't seem that trustworthy or at least she seems stuborn i'd space myself from her if i were you hope this helps Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre The Inside Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ocean's Twelve Futurama (TV series - season 5) One Tree Hill (TV series) One Piece minor characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Lovely Bones The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 2) StarCraft: Uprising The Ashlee Simpson Show Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Pok__mon Live!
