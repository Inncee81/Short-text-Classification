how does the loading and firing mechanism of an ar work i recently came upon a video of the systema training weapon system which uses airsoft technology to simulate real weaponry unlike most airsoft guns however these weapons are modified to be as realistic as possible by doing things other airsoft guns cannot such as lock the trigger upon running out of ammunition which brings me to my point when loading in a fresh magazine is there a button or catch on the side of the ar series rifles that one can press to chamber in a round without pulling back the cocking handle i ask this because this is a requirement on the systema ptw yes the gas operated firearm locks its bolt back on an empty magazine upon firing the last shot there is a button a mechanical lever on the left hand side of the gun that releases the bolt under spring pressure shoving a bullet from another mag into the chamber eugene stoner is the man Airsoft Firearm M16 (rifle) Machine gun Heckler & Koch G3 Internal ballistics Air gun Revolver M60 machine gun Cartridge (firearms) Krag-J__rgensen M4 Carbine AK-47 Heckler & Koch MP5 AK-74 Pump-action Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Ammunition M1 Garand GLOCK Gun safety Mauser Springfield 1903 rifle Firearm action Bolt action Jarmann M1884 Beretta 92F/FS M82 (rifle) Handloading MG42 Carbine FN F2000 Crossbow Suppressor Concealed carry (USA) Kammerlader FN FAL Lee-Enfield Sniper rifle Paintball Sniper Speedloader Paintball marker Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Combine (Half-Life 2) Terminal ballistics Marathon (computer game) Personal weapon Pistol Punisher Heckler & Koch G11 SKS Heckler & Koch PSG1 Recoil operation Saiga-12 .44 Magnum Makarov PM M1 Carbine Rocket propelled grenade Archery AR-10 Colt Single Action Army handgun QBZ-95 Lewis Gun Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver Artillery Weapon Heckler & Koch G36 MP18 M1911 Steyr Mannlicher M1901 M249 Cowboy action shooting Game controller Perfect Dark La France M16K Tank .303 British .22 Long Rifle Columbine High School massacre Assault rifle Browning Model 1919 machine gun Wildcat cartridge .30-06 Springfield M3 Grease Gun Bubble Bobble SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Submachine gun 5.56 x 45 mm NATO
