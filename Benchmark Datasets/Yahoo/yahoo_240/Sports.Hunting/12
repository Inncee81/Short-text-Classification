at which velocity is an airgun pellet gun fatal to a human just wanna make sure i dont buy one thats too powerful humans are funny sometimes we are very hard to kill cent other times it is abnormally easy a normal pellet gun is going to shoot between fps that is enough to penetrate the skin normally that wouldn't be fatal the bullet does not have enough mass to cause tissue damage from impact you will bleed and it will hurt extremely bad but a shot anywhere on the body wouldn't kill you however it is possible to shoot someone in the head and kill them it would be very unlikely to get a hit in the temple or whatever place is most vulnerable plus even if you did it is not likely going to kill anyone i would say children are most susceptible to major injury occurring since they are smaller however unlikely it is i am quite certain it is possible to kill someone when something is moving that fast i mean i have heard of people who die from getting hit in the head from a baseball you'd think you would end up with just a welt but to some it can be fatal always be careful and know where that pellet is going to go Terminal ballistics Airsoft Shotgun Blood (computer game) Traumatic brain injury Railgun Carbine Motorcycle helmet Internal ballistics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Quake III Arena Pellet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Pain Rifle Hand grenade First aid Doom enemies Project Orion Paintball Natural Selection (computer game) Counter-Strike GunZ The Duel Domestic rabbit Gun safety Tribes 2 Handloading Fast bowling Trench warfare Domestic violence Shell (projectile) Cephalic disorder Intracranial pressure Diving Non-lethal force Cancer John F.
