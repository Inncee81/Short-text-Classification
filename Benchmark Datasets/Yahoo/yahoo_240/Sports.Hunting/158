hmr on coyotes i know that i am probably outgunned using this calibre on a yote but my question is which load manufacturer and gr would be best if i am going to use this gun on coyotes i have heard that the gr cci tnt is the best penetrating and retains more of its mass however the hornady v max gr are supposed to be good too will the v max penetrate a rib or skull out to yds or should i use the less explosive tnt round or another round perhaps even tho i still think you're using too small of a caliber for an effective and humane kill if you're set on using hmr i'd have to go with the vmax bullet to ensure as much energy displacement as possible Terminal ballistics .22 Long Rifle Shotgun Rimfire Ammunition Stopping power Shell (projectile) .45 ACP .17 HMR Cartridge (firearms) Explosive material 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Sniper Internal ballistics .357 SIG Firearm Rifle Varmint rifle Bullet 125 mm Smoothbore Rounds Carbine .17 HM2 Machine gun Suppressor M16 (rifle) Depleted uranium Revolver .22 WMR Tank gun ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity Anti-tank Anti-tank rifle Air gun M82 (rifle) Kinetic energy penetrator Airsoft Projectile Caliber Ton Mortar (weapon) Tank Assault rifle Personal weapon Kammerlader Trinitrotoluene Cannon External ballistics Artillery Mauser 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO 10 mm Auto M1 Carbine Coyote 5.7 x 28 mm 9 mm Luger .22 Long Gatling gun Marathon (computer game) T-72 Anchor AK-74 Handloading Gun barrel Krag-J__rgensen Flechette M242 Blank (cartridge) Orders of magnitude (energy) Webley and Scott 88 mm gun High explosive anti-tank ISU-122 Nuclear weapon design Land mine Ordnance QF 2 pounder Schwerer Gustav Max Payne 7.62 x 39 mm Alien races from the Godzilla films B-47 Stratojet Spark plug M60 machine gun Mass Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Eventing Railgun Sniper rifle Beretta 92F/FS Punisher Mini-14 Battlecruiser Wildcat cartridge .50 BMG M4 Carbine Battleship Gun safety Perfect Dark Lee-Enfield Metal Storm Trinity test
