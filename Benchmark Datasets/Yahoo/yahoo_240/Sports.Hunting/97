does anyone hunt deer with a pistol if so what caliber and how succesful have you been at plus meters i am thinking about s w mag i recently shot this and liked the feel of the weapon would it be considered overkill for a deer though centerfire rifles are not legal for deer where i live indiana and scopes aren't legal for all hunting i've gone boar hunting with my s w magnum i can tell you that you probably need something bigger than magnuma and the s w magnum should do the job handgun rounds are generally less powerful than rifle rounds the moves at a relatively low velocity so i would not consider it overkill a well place shot at the spine or the vitals will guarantee a takedown .44 Magnum Firearm Shotgun .22 Long Rifle Carbine Internal ballistics Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Rifle Assault rifle Desert Eagle 10 mm Auto Revolver Gun control in the United States (by state) Mini-14 Pistol Rimfire Varmint rifle Stopping power Bulletproof vest 7.62 x 39 mm Concealed carry (USA) Mauser Shotgun shell .38 Special Airsoft 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Krag-J__rgensen M1 Carbine Marathon (computer game) Air gun .22 WMR 9 mm Luger Punisher M82 (rifle) M60 machine gun Suppressor National Rifle Association Ammunition .40 S&W Fox hunting SKS Sniper Springfield 1903 rifle .500 S&W Professional wrestling throws Accuracy International AWM .30 Carbine Flintlock Heckler & Koch G3 North Hollywood shootout Machine gun M16 (rifle) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Jarmann M1884 ISSF shooting events Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Hunting Federal assault weapons ban .45 ACP Kammerlader Bullet Beretta 92F/FS M40 (rifle) Day of Defeat Caliber Archery Webley and Scott M240 .30-06 Springfield John Browning Personal weapon Lee-Enfield .50 Action Express AR-15 Jericho 941 Railgun Heckler & Koch MP5 Derringer Mortar (weapon) Paintball Shooting sports Gun barrel M4 Carbine Heckler & Koch USP Remington 870 Mossberg 500 Overkill (band) Sturmgewehr 44 Armour Bolt action Medium machine gun Israel Defense Forces Handloading Submachine gun AK-47
