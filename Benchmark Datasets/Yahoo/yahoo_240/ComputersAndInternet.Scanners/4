how would you scan a newspaper photo without getting so much grain i have a flatbed scanner and i need to scan a photo from a newspaper it's coming out incredibly grainy is there any way to reproduce the photo without so much grain i am not sure if you have set your scanner to the highest possible resolution during your scan if the resolution of the scanner doesn't help you much you need to use photoshop to make the scan more 'smooth' Image scanner Digital photography Pixel Barcode reader Magnetic resonance imaging Widescreen Photography Television Digital camera back Fax Computer virus Pan and scan Medical ultrasonography Anti-virus software Brain imaging Photograph Functional magnetic resonance imaging Geographic information system Konica Minolta LIDAR Aldi Digital video Optical character recognition Microchip implant (animal) Port scanner Knight Rider Positron emission tomography Photographic film Rootkit Adobe Photoshop Leather Interlace IPhoto Cathode ray tube Combine (Half-Life 2) Scanner (radio) Dots per inch Digital cinematography Core War Optical coherence tomography Symbol Technologies Biometrics Cash register Mimeograph machine PNG Aortic dissection Nude celebrities on the Internet Display resolution Radiation therapy Film speed Landsat 7 Refresh rate Statistical parametric mapping Luna 3 Barcode Danger Hiptop Scanning electron microscope Tagged Image File Format Photocopying Jeff Gannon Digital camera Medical imaging Scanning tunneling microscope Cardiac stress test Anamorphic widescreen William Carlos Williams Cineon Bob and George Stars!
