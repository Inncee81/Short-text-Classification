algebra equations help hi i have a summer math packet due on the first day of school and i'm stuck on these five problems we're supposed to give equations and answers for the problems i have the answers for each problem but not the proper equation work can you please help me with what i'm supposed to write down answers are at the end the sum of two numbers is the larger exceeds twice the smaller by find the numbers two employees have years of experience with their firm combined if one of them has been employed years longer than the other how many years has each been with the firm tom has in quarters and dimes he has more dimes than quarters how many of each does he have harry is twice as old as his brother four years ago he was times older than his brother how old is each find two consecutive odd numbers whose sum is answers x y x y q d b h x x an important first step is to identify the variables so let x the smaller number then x the larger number exceeding it by means since their sum is the equation is x x similar idea let x yrs of experience of one employee then x yrs of experience of the other combined x x this is harder because of the value of the coins but let x the number of quarters x the number of dimes now remember that quarters are worth so their value is the number of quarters and dimes are worth so their value is the number of dimes then the equation is x x clear decimals and distribute x x x x let x the brother's age now and x brother's age yrs ago then x harry's age and x harry's age yrs ago since yrs ago harry was times older the equation is x x x x x x let x the smaller number then x the next consecutive odd number x x x x that's it hope it helped Mathematics United States dollar Ordinary differential equation Polynomial Dirac equation Grade (education) Complex number Microeconomics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Algebraic geometry Probability Poker jargon Fibonacci number Mathematics of general relativity Surreal number Elementary algebra Joseph Louis Lagrange Economics Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Vedic mathematics Computer numbering formats Black hole Gaussian elimination Pi Heat equation Species Many-worlds interpretation Aberration in optical systems Riemann zeta function Elementary arithmetic Expected value Action potential Sea level rise SAT Calculus Fischer Random Chess Quantum mechanics Relational algebra Exponentiation Entropy Standard deviation Formal power series Jet engine Linear regression Irrational number Transformation problem Integral Stochastic process Gravity Wave packet Identical particles Quaternion Goldbach's conjecture Price equation Modular form P-adic number Newton's identities Combinatorics Equation of time Dime (U.S. coin) Halting problem New Orleans Mint Exterior algebra Diophantine equation Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm Matrix (mathematics) Numerical integration GED Quantum logic Bayesian inference Boolean algebra Archimedes Sydney Riot of 1879 Normal distribution IP (complexity) Inflation Function (mathematics) Doomsday argument Model (economics) Binary numeral system Quizbowl Numerical analysis Lebesgue integration Complexity classes P and NP Bayes' theorem Infinity G__del's incompleteness theorem Golden ratio Password Explosive material Mental calculation Number theory Luminiferous aether
