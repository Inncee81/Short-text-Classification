first to answer these simple questions right gets points thanks what is a subset what is a proper subset the larger of two consecutive integers is more than twice the smaller find the integers set b is a subset of set a if every element that belongs to b also belongs to a if b is a subset of a and b is not equal to a then b is a proper subset of a e g a b let x x be the consecutive integers x x x x x the numbers are and check Combinatorics Order theory Set Naive set theory Topology glossary Supremum Subset sum problem Matroid Group (mathematics) Surreal number Prime number P-adic number Quotient group Field (mathematics) Dynamical system Function (mathematics) CPU cache Ideal (ring theory) Open set Halting problem Countable set Complexity classes P and NP Compact space Commutative ring Lebesgue integration Sudoku Optimization (mathematics) Quadratic sieve Cardinal number Fuchsian group Elementary group theory Ramsey's theorem Partition of a set Boolean algebra Conjugacy class Glossary of graph theory Real number Infinity IA-32 Complete lattice Continued fraction Computational complexity theory Continuum hypothesis Natural number Prime ideal Banach___Tarski paradox Representation theory of finite groups Continuous function G__del's incompleteness theorem Universe (mathematics) Stochastic process Integer Linked list Total order Algebraic geometry Hash table Complex number Lattice (group) Equivalence relation Serial number Completeness (order theory) Series (mathematics) Boolean logic Zorn's lemma Hausdorff dimension Pontryagin duality Divisor Root system Recursion On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Integer factorization CPU design Integer (computer science) Belief revision Basis (linear algebra) Axiomatic set theory Central processing unit Sequence Abstract interpretation NP-complete Dihedral group RISC Multiset Forcing (mathematics) Semigroup Axiom of choice Lattice (order) Group action Filter (mathematics) Binary relation Ordinal number Empty set Cantor's diagonal argument Modular form Subgroup Polynomial State space (controls) Peano axioms Rational number Cardinality of the continuum
