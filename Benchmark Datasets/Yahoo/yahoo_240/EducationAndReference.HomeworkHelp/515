need help solving this math problem the original question was this jim can finish a job twice as fast as jack when they work together they can finish the job in hours find the time it would take each person to finish the job individually my answer was x x x x jim works x hours jack works x hours now the second part of the question is is it possible for either one of them to finish the job faster that if they work together i need help answering this second part of the question any help would be greatly appreciated thanks this is the type of problem that you have to memorize the formula when a number of people work at different rates the formula is as follows x y z t where t the time it takes for everyone and x y z etc is the time for one person now lets plug in the formula x y now y takes twice as long as x so y x therefore x x multiply by x gives x x y x that is the general formula this problem is simpler since jim is twice as fast as jack therefore jim jacks jacks take hours therefore it is obvious that one jack would take times as long or hours jim working twice as fast takes only half that time or hours Mathematics CPU design GED Complexity classes P and NP Combinatorics Calculus Computer IP (complexity) $ale of the Century 24 Hours of Le Mans CPU cache Numerical analysis Coriolis effect Series (mathematics) Quantum computer History of Formula One Expert system IPod Labour economics Speed of light Vedic mathematics You Don't Know Jack Complex number NP-complete G__del's incompleteness theorem Prime number Halting problem Compiler optimization Current teachings of Prem Rawat Multiplication algorithm Exponential growth Unemployment Bayesian inference Family Feud Economic inequality Quizbowl Transformation problem Extreme Programming Fast Fourier transform Discrete cosine transform Chess problem The Amazing Race Big Brother (USA TV series) Armored Core Pi Hypoglycemia Education in Romania Logarithm RISC The Princeton Review Newton's identities On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Electrophysiology Elementary algebra Hollywood Squares Galois theory Personal rapid transit Ordinary differential equation Social rule Computational complexity theory Collision detection Match Game Trigonometric function Whose Line Is It Anyway?
