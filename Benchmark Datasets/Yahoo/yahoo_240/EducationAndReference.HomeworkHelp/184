can someone please help me with this x x x x x x is this correct x x x x x x im confused after the first step help how is it x in the first one okay watch and learn o problem x x x x correct x x combine the and now subtract x from both sides because you want to get the x terms on the left side of the sign x x x x now combine like terms like this x x x x x now subtract from both sides like this x now combine like terms and you get x that's how you get the x now divide both sides by like this x and now solve for x the 's on the left side cancel leaving you with x and so you have x okay now you think you can do the nd one on your own try it i'll put the solution here so that after you try and you still are stuck you can check for a nudge in the right direction go back to your problem try some more and then compare your final answer as well as your steps to get the answer problem x x x x x x yes so far so good but it's not it's now the nudge you need combine all the like terms like this but when you combine you can only combine on the same side as the sign like this x x x original problem x x x x x x see what i'm doing x x now you want all the x's on one side of the 's sign and all the numbers on the other side of the 's sign so add x to both sides of the equation like this x x x x now combine like terms like this x x x x x x now add to both sides like this x combine like terms to get x that's the same as if you wrote x now divide both sides by x the 's on the left side cancel leaving you with x and you have x so x see Gaussian elimination Elementary algebra Dimensional analysis Vedic mathematics Cissoid of Diocles Roman arithmetic Two's complement Renormalization Trigonometric function Ordinary differential equation Square root Complex number Quadratic equation Method of complements Mental calculation Crossword Computer numbering formats Continued fraction Vector (spatial) Mathematics Negative and non-negative numbers Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brainfuck Conic section Numerical integration Sturm-Liouville theory Basel problem Euclidean plane isometry Eight queens puzzle Scientology beliefs and practices Debugging Apollo Guidance Computer Napier's bones IP (complexity) G__del's incompleteness theorem Complexity classes P and NP Recurrence relation Stairway Halting problem Newton's identities Quantum harmonic oscillator Computational complexity theory Binary numeral system Ruler-and-compass construction Path integral formulation Pretty Good Privacy Harmonic oscillator Shor's algorithm Rugby union positions Algorithm Artificial neural network Redundant array of independent disks Grover's algorithm Quantum computer Slide rule Fibonacci number Chess problem terminology Collision detection Chemical equation Computus Polynomial long division Cholesky decomposition Random walk X86 assembly language SAT Temperature Marching band Projective transformation Helicopter Computer Polynomial Figurate number Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Celestial navigation Prostate cancer Elementary arithmetic Arbitrary constant of integration Dirac equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Binary GCD algorithm Microeconomics Eyeglass prescription Quiz Call Division (mathematics) Fischer Random Chess Maxwell's equations Dynamic Systems Development Method Catalan number Simulated annealing Dynamical system Software engineering Bessel function Trigonometric identity Linear differential equation Cubic equation CPU design Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)
