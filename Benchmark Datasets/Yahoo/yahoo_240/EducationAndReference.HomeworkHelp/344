need help with hypothesis testing the historical production for workers at an industrial plant is shown to units produced a day with a standard deviation of following the introduction of a new flextime worker option a sample productivity reports for flextime workers reveals a sample mean of assuming your working at the level of significance has productivity increased state null and research hypotheses what is the value of the test statistic what is our observed value of z state conclusion i could really use the help we have a foolish prof who will not help us and the book he made us buy has little to no examples thank you step state given information population mean population standard deviation xbar sample mean n observations alpha step setup hypothesis has productivity increased units status quo which will be our null hypothesis the alternative hypothesis is asking if is greater than ho null hypothesis ha alternate hypothesis claim step select test statistic since the population standard deviation is given and n we assume a normal distribution therefore the test statistic is zcalc xbar n step find zcrit and state decision rule zcrit do a table look up on which gives a z value of the table should be in the appendix of your stats book if not you can view it here http rvgs k va us statman table a jpg this is a one tailed test and the decision rule is to reject ho if zcalc zcrit of otherwise accept ho step compute zcalc zcalc xbar n zcalc zcalc zcalc step state decision since zcalc of zcrit of we reject ho and accept the claim that productivity has increased p s your observed value of z is the same as zcalc oh btw what book are you using good luck in your studies mitch Quantitative marketing research Statistical hypothesis testing Doomsday argument Balassa-Samuelson effect Economics Bayesian inference Mann-Whitney U Pearson's chi-square test Likelihood-ratio test Margin of error Statistics Student's t-distribution Standard deviation Intelligence quotient Scientific method Student's t-test P-value Hardy-Weinberg principle Z-test Qualitative psychological research Race and intelligence Labor theory of value Control chart Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Parapsychology Efficiency wages Labour economics Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Software testing Industrial engineering Monopsony Model (economics) Life insurance Genetic algorithm Biology and sexual orientation Experiment Management information system Species ELO rating system Cancer Variance Fisher's exact test Marketing research Creation science Bayesian probability Binary classification Checking if a coin is fair Falsifiability Exponential family Many-worlds interpretation Psychology Item response theory Big Bang Special relativity Nuclear power Science Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Modern portfolio theory Decision making Hardware random number generator Decision theory Permutation test Philosophy of science Effect size Opportunity rover Logic Solar variation SAS System Gravity Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Corporate governance Supply and demand Expert system Transformation problem Autism Keynesian economics Unemployment Efficient market hypothesis Central limit theorem Kolmogorov-Smirnov test John Lott Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Paul Feyerabend Bell's theorem Prices of production General relativity Propositional calculus Regression toward the mean Annuity Biodiversity Duesberg hypothesis MP3 Nuclear proliferation
