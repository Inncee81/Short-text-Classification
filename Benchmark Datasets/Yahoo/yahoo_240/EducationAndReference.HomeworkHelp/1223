penn foster algebra i've done four of the penn foster algebra exams with my sister's help but i'm stuck on exponents and roots and algebraic fractions my sister doesn't understand it either and i don't have anyone else to help me with it if you've done these exams and could help somehow i'd really appreciate it these are the last two exams before i graduate so i really need help finishing them for algebraic fractions i don't understand the multiplying or dividing ok i hope you know math syntax an exponent is like a power its how many times your number is multiplied by itself meaning or two to the fourth power x x x x x x theres twos up there to the th ok roots they arent that bad i hate figuring the larger numbers without a calculator but they are easy really if you have say the number what times itself equals x your root is the root of is because times itself x think of all the double number multiples when dealing with roots x x x x x x x see what i mean here what part of algebric fractions adding subtracting multiplying or dividing Computer numbering formats Vulgar fraction Binary numeral system Elementary algebra Polynomial Complex number Elementary arithmetic Logarithm Napier's bones Multiplication Scientific notation Two's complement Vedic mathematics GED Numeral system Irrational number Vector (spatial) Grade (education) Mental calculation Quadratic equation Combinatorial species Continued fraction Gaussian elimination Exponential function M__bius transformation Quartic equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Large numbers Surreal number Ruffini's rule Real number Division (mathematics) P-adic number George Peacock Ideal class group Pi Mathematics Egyptian fraction Matrix multiplication Associative algebra ___1 (number) Poker jargon Negative and non-negative numbers Simon Stevin Floating point Order of operations Multiplication algorithm Pascal's triangle Determinant Fibonacci number Algebra Calculating the day of the week Commutative ring On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Golden ratio base Quaternion Joseph Louis Lagrange Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Exponentiation by squaring Slide rule Integral Preferred number History of mathematics Linear algebra Hyperreal number Fermat's last theorem Esperanto grammar Education in Romania Square root Dimensional analysis Partial fraction Calculator Decibel Golden ratio SAT Arthur Cayley Empty product Discrete Fourier transform Basel problem Maya calendar Riemann zeta function Units of measurement Mnemonic Interval (music) Invalid proof Inversion (music) Contract bridge Field (mathematics) Assembly language Figurate number Gross domestic product Binomial coefficient Names of large numbers Jaime Escalante Positional notation Fast Fourier transform
