a firms cost function for product x ac q q at what level of production of x will ac be minimsed whats that ac in front of the equation differentiate with respect to q and equate to zero and solve for q you will get values get second derivative of the equation plug in these values to check where the second derivative is positive that value of q will be the answer Ordinary differential equation Derivative Partial differential equation Numerical analysis Particle in a box Recurrence relation Microeconomics Trigonometric function Harmonic oscillator Holomorphic function Trajectory Green's function Lagrangian mechanics Nonlinearity Cournot competition Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Distribution (mathematics) Stackelberg competition Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Gauge theory Conic section Dynamical system Action (physics) Sturm-Liouville theory Force Noether's theorem Mathematics Linear differential equation Model (economics) Heat equation Separation of variables Mathematics of general relativity Transmission line Complex number General relativity Polynomial Hydrogeology Airy function Formal power series Kalman filter Black-Scholes RLC circuit Cubic equation Strategic management Numerical ordinary differential equations Schr__dinger equation Labor theory of value Polynomial interpolation Nondimensionalization Boundary value problem Exponential function Derivation of the partition function Artificial neural network Classical mechanics Secant method Trigonometric identity Newton's method Finite element method Maximum likelihood Stationary point Projective transformation Optimization (mathematics) Navier-Stokes equations Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Exact solutions in general relativity Linear regression Wave equation Function (mathematics) Supply and demand Welfare economics Quantum harmonic oscillator Yield curve Arbitrary constant of integration Bessel function Measurement in quantum mechanics Congruence (general relativity) State space (controls) Path integral formulation Dimensional analysis Fluid dynamics Connection form Astrodynamics Economics Computational chemistry IP (complexity) Algebraic geometry Examples of differential equations Riemann zeta function Transformation problem TI-89 series Dirac equation Interest Lie derivative Gas in a box Elementary algebra Fractional calculus Geodesy Operational amplifier Exponential family Calculus
