i need help with algebra my question is can you give me ordred pairs that are solutions to the equation y x thank you i am stuck i'd like to help you think through the process too start with x pick a number keep it small so it's easy to work with i'll choose now follow your order of operations multiply divide add subtract so multiplying by should be done before subtracting or and now subtract is your y value ordered pairs mean x y so we just found one is here's two more for you Elementary algebra Gaussian elimination Complex number Vector (spatial) Two's complement Elementary arithmetic Quartic equation Binary numeral system Polynomial Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Combinatorial species George Peacock Mental calculation Ordinary differential equation Napier's bones Computer numbering formats Vulgar fraction Continued fraction Vedic mathematics Numeral system Joseph Louis Lagrange Fibonacci number Quadratic equation Real number Cissoid of Diocles Linear differential equation Exponentiation Prime number Contract bridge Roman arithmetic Pascal's triangle Galois theory Doomsday rule Negative and non-negative numbers Riemann zeta function Trigonometric function Matrix subtraction Orthogonal matrix Surreal number Quaternion Trigonometric identity Quadratic sieve Square root Dimensional analysis Division (mathematics) Hyperreal number Formal power series Matrix (mathematics) Operational amplifier Recurrence relation Scientific notation Figurate number Renormalization Fischer Random Chess Golden ratio base Finite field arithmetic Extreme Programming Kernel (algebra) ___1 (number) Basel problem Associativity Exterior algebra George Boole Adjoint functors Synthesizer Mnemonic Inequality Arbitrary constant of integration Egyptian fraction I Ching divination Function (mathematics) Large numbers COBOL Algebraic geometry Infinity Calculator Boolean algebra Polynomial long division Decibel Clifford algebra Group of Lie type Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Preferred number Distributivity History of computing hardware Matroid Euclidean plane isometry RISC Order of operations Projective transformation Logarithm IP (complexity) X86 assembly language Computer Slide rule Numerical analysis Calculating the day of the week Transcendental number Dirac equation Brainfuck
