help me please x x x help me with the steps i'm in th grade ok here's how to solve this equation step by step x x x the first thing you want to do is to clear the parenthesis to do this you multiply each term in the parenthesis on the left side by and each term on the right side in the parenthesis by x x x now we simplify by doing the multiplying inside the parenthesis next x x x now we add or subtract the like terms x x x x x now we want to get x by itself on one side of the equation so we'll subtract from both sides of the equation first x x x x now we'll add x to both sides to get x on one side of the equation x x x x x now to solve for x we'll divide both sides by x x now to check your answer put in for x in the equation we simplified it to in step x x so you know your answer checks out x final answer Quartic equation Elementary algebra Gaussian elimination Vedic mathematics Projective transformation Quadratic equation Trigonometric identity Linear differential equation Complex number Dimensional analysis Roman arithmetic Cissoid of Diocles Two's complement Trigonometric function Sturm-Liouville theory Napier's bones Slide rule Square root Conic section Polynomial Separation of variables George Boole Computer numbering formats Ordinary differential equation Multiplication Recurrence relation Chemical equation Vector (spatial) Riemann zeta function Continued fraction Navier-Stokes equations Exponentiation Microeconomics Associativity Binary numeral system Abstraction (computer science) Mathematics Vulgar fraction Bracket Matrix (mathematics) Circle Invalid proof Quantum harmonic oscillator Order of operations Particle in a box Cubic equation Examples of differential equations Egyptian mathematics Combinatorial species Nondimensionalization Apollo Guidance Computer Gross domestic product Synthesizer Binary GCD algorithm Finite field arithmetic Green's function Roman numerals Risk management Membrane potential IP (complexity) Elementary arithmetic Lagrangian mechanics Ruler-and-compass construction Irrational number Negative and non-negative numbers Catalan number Boolean satisfiability problem Basel problem Sheffer stroke Universal Product Code Random walk Collision detection Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Classified information Dirac equation Exponential function Joseph Louis Lagrange Euler's formula Inequality Coriolis effect Fischer Random Chess Newton's method Planetary orbit Transformation problem LU decomposition Lambda calculus Dynamical system Money creation Discrete cosine transform Gravity Reverse Polish notation On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Basis (linear algebra) Trajectory Renormalization Action (physics) Group (mathematics) Calculator
