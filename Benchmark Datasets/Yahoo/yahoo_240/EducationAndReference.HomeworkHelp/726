physics problem solving magnitude and deceleration please with solution asap a skydiver sows from m s to m s in second her parachute opens calculate the magnitude of her deceleration assumed constant and the distance falls while the parachute is opening ok i think you put the problem in wrong it should probably be slows down from m s to m s in the time her parachute opens i'm going to go with this setup for the problem we need to list our known variables and our unknown variables a t s v m s initial velocity final velocity d we have to use a couple of equations here that'll allow us to find both of the answers we're seeking lets first start with the distance travelled as her chute opens in this case so we'll use the equation d vi vf t d m s m s s d s d m s s d m final answer to solve the acceleration we use the equation vf vi ad now we can rearrange it using algebra rules to isolate our unknown and we come up with the following vf vi d a a m s m s m a m s m s m a m s m a m s final answer Kepler's laws of planetary motion Classical mechanics Parachute Planetary orbit Gravity General relativity Acceleration Derivative Spacecraft propulsion Navier-Stokes equations Torque Faster-than-light Dark energy Calculus Hubble's law Ordinary differential equation Explosive material Two-body problem M__bius transformation Numerical analysis Coriolis effect Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Frame of reference Particle in a box Perturbation theory Force Hydrogeology Speed of light Partial differential equation Equation of motion Modified Newtonian dynamics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Trajectory Time travel Jet engine Action potential Astrodynamics Mathematics of general relativity Collision detection Determinism Special relativity RLC circuit Gaussian elimination Heat equation Exact solutions in general relativity Terminal velocity Harmonic oscillator Fictitious force TI-89 series Hamiltonian mechanics Elementary algebra BASE jumping Kalman filter Mass Black hole Mathematics Lagrangian mechanics Random walk Zeno's paradoxes Algebraic geometry Path integral formulation Electromagnetic radiation Space elevator Momentum Halting problem Wave State space (controls) Joseph Louis Lagrange Large numbers Computational fluid dynamics Damping Formal power series Recurrence relation Black-Scholes Hohmann transfer orbit Newton's method Supersymmetry Polynomial Quartic equation Examples of differential equations Scramjet Plasma (physics) Rocket Simplex algorithm Orthogonal matrix Linear equation Complex number Renormalization Genetic algorithm Action (physics)
