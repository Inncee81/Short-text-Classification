what is controlled variable and controlling variable with examples definition a controlled variable would be a variable you could adjust and or keep fixed such as temperature a controlling variable would be one that creates a desired change by adjusting the controls such as the accellerator in a car Spacecraft propulsion PID controller Phase (matter) Derivative Continuously variable transmission Supply and demand Automatic transmission Jet engine Turbocharger Inflation Homeostasis Electric motor Transformer Resistor Class (computer science) Control theory Function (mathematics) Climate change Microeconomics Calculus Process control E85 Propeller Navier-Stokes equations Lighting Phase transition Voltage regulator Sea level rise Constant capital Variable valve timing Production theory basics Variable Frequency Drive Monetary policy Potentiometer Combine harvester Feed-forward Common Lisp Transmission (mechanics) Statistical mechanics Circuit design Car handling Species Accelerator effect Reinforcement Free variables and bound variables Manifold vacuum Oscilloscope Linear regulator Units of measurement Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Objective-C Negative feedback Diesel engine Variable speed of light BZFlag Abstraction (computer science) Chain rule Circumscription Climate Partition function (statistical mechanics) Flight controls Gross domestic product Cascading Style Sheets Quantitative marketing research Mercedes-Benz A-Class Measurement Motorcycle Fuzzy logic Standard deviation Random variable Orthogonal matrix QCD matter Alfa Romeo Twin Spark engine Lathe Production function Phase-locked loop Compiler optimization Causality Drifting (motorsport) Engine Control Unit Biofeedback Artificial neural network Entropy Smalltalk Marginal cost Variable star Global climate model Information warfare Visual Basic Programming language Global warming and agriculture Loudspeaker Variable Lisp programming language JavaServer Pages Solar variation Analog computer Renormalization group
