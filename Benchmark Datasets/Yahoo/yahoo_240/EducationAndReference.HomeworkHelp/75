what's the difference between questions that ask find dy dx and find the derivative of y i found these two questions on a math competition test i'm just curious dy dx is the derivative of y with respect to x that is y f x y f x if you say find the derivative of y it is likely that y f z or y f k or y f x y being a function of z or k etc depending on the question Derivative Mathematics Normal distribution Ordinary differential equation SAT Dynamical system Welfare economics Covariant derivative Formal power series Convergence of Fourier series Calculus Distribution (mathematics) Finite element method Cournot competition Physics Natural deduction Statistical mechanics Special relativity Local hidden variable theory Sex and intelligence General relativity Password Aikido Trigonometric identity Prime number Bayesian inference Anti-racist mathematics Recurrence relation Complexity classes P and NP Lebesgue integration Richard Feynman Model (economics) C plus plus Lie derivative Qualitative psychological research Question mark function Biology and sexual orientation TI-89 series C programming language Extreme Programming Authority Art Expert system Action (physics) Hydrogeology Software testing Quizbowl CIE 1931 color space Noether's theorem Transformation problem Integral Western philosophy Labor theory of value Fractional calculus Halting problem Symmetry of second derivatives The Princeton Review Stackelberg competition Alignment (role-playing games) Turing machine Chain rule Diaeresis Transmission line Mathematics of general relativity Science Bowl Appeal Marilyn vos Savant Polynomial interpolation Estimation theory Scientific method Gemara APL programming language Labour economics Auto racing Trigonometric function Guns, Germs, and Steel Australian English JavaScript Graduate school Elliptic curve Carmichael number Decision theory MAME Ubykh language First Amendment to the United States Constitution Child sexuality Particle in a box Bayes' theorem Consciousness Linear regression Morality Extinction Molecular systematics Antidepressant Hyperreal number On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Debate Economic inequality Derivation of the partition function GED
