algebra question a rectangle has the perimeter of feet and an area of square feet what are the dimensions of the rectangle can anyone please tell me how to solve the problem and the answer to it it comes down to knowing the geometric properties of a rectangle for this problem it is really nothing fancy except knowing that a rectangle has opposite sides equal so the lengths and widths we will call them so this gives you two pairs of sides in other words you should also know the basic formulas for finding the perimeter and area of a rectangle if l is the length and w is the width the perimeter can be defined as l w the area is simply the length times the width or lw so from here you can set up your equations l w lw for the top one you can make things easier by factoring out a and dividing by to cancel it out l w so now we have a system of two equations in two variables l w lw i would try substituting l for w into the top equation l l express l as l l and you can add the fractions together easily l l multiply both sides by l l l you are going to end up with a quadratic equation here so you need to set it equal to zero l l before messing around with completing the square or the quadratic formula first see if you can factor into two binomial terms in this case you can l l so the value of l can either be or so now if l is either or we can go back and substitute these values into the other equation lw so if l were equal to w w but if l were equal to w w so the way i would write my answer is that it is a x rectangle if they ask for further clarification you can say that if the shorter side is than the longer side would have to be hope this was helpful Elementary algebra Quartic equation Quadratic equation Polynomial Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Complex number Ordinary differential equation Golden ratio Trigonometric function Projective transformation Clifford algebra Pi Pascal's triangle Square root Quadratic sieve Function (mathematics) Determinant Vedic mathematics Derivative Dirac equation Joseph Louis Lagrange Exponentiation Vector (spatial) Trigonometric identity M__bius transformation Prime number Ruler-and-compass construction Lebesgue integration Partial fraction Manifold Units of measurement P-adic number Geometry Continued fraction Quaternion Force Optimization (mathematics) Normal distribution Mathematics Dimensional analysis Cissoid of Diocles Fibonacci number Fundamental theorem of calculus Microeconomics Quantum harmonic oscillator Formal power series Matrix (mathematics) Galois theory Particle in a box Binomial coefficient Cubic equation G__del's incompleteness theorem Quintic equation Parabola Algebraic geometry Path integral formulation Riemann integral Orthogonal matrix Discrete Fourier transform Ruffini's rule RLC circuit Many-worlds interpretation State space (controls) Standard deviation Transformation problem Number theory Pythagorean theorem Large numbers Area (geometry) Aberration in optical systems Modular form Z-transform Probability Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Newton's identities Quadrilateral Nondimensionalization Linear differential equation Binary numeral system Sturm-Liouville theory Catalan number Sudoku Tensor Calculus Basel problem Numerical integration Fourth dimension Dynamical system Kalman filter Preferred number
