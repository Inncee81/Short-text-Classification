linear equation help ok i got a packet but i forgot how do it need help goes like this find the slope of a line parallel to the graph of the wquation y x y x y x y x y heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase thnx for the slope ignore the constants for any equation y ax b the slope is a b is not relevant y x a therefore slope is y x a therefore slope is y rewrite as y x a therefore slope is x y rewrite as y x a therefore slope x y rewrite as y x a therefore slope Derivative Trigonometric function Slope Conic section Polynomial Ordinary differential equation Exponential function Parabola Projective transformation Calculus Simplex algorithm Linear Elliptic curve Incidence (geometry) Cissoid of Diocles Tangent Supply and demand Microeconomics Quadratic equation Trajectory Maxwell's equations Yield curve Action potential Legendre transformation Line at infinity RLC circuit M__bius transformation Logistic function Recurrence relation Mathematics of general relativity Cournot competition Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Quantum harmonic oscillator Linear least squares Heat equation Magnetic field Newton's method Harmonic oscillator Force Dirac equation Potential flow Production theory basics Production function Linear differential equation Line (mathematics) Z-transform Algebraic geometry Correlation Quantum mechanics Jacobi field Gaussian elimination Momentum Natural logarithm Computer algebra system Geographic coordinate system Glacier Einstein's field equation Partial differential equation Function (mathematics) Curve fitting Linear logic Dynamical system Nondimensionalization Phonon Minkowski diagram DVD Moment of inertia Square root Angular velocity Fitts' law Ruffini's rule Control system Andes Discrete Fourier transform Mathematics Electromagnetic radiation Cubic equation Mount Vesuvius Welfare economics Integral Bessel function Exogenous growth model Modified Newtonian dynamics Examples of differential equations Resistor Special relativity Random walk Geodesic (general relativity) Netfilter/iptables Sturm-Liouville theory Computational fluid dynamics Dimensional analysis Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Wind Multiple integral Schr__dinger equation Little Round Top
