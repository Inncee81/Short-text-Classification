are there any positive aspects about the society in orwell's i'm supposed show the positive aspects of the society with specific examples but as far as i'm concerned the society in the novel is negative and the author made it seem completely oppressive for a reason i'm assuming the pormpt means positive from normal peopls view positive views that is not a negative or oppressive society so basically not from the dicatator's view positive from who's point of view that's the question from a leader's perspective there's all sorts of positive aspects the people are obedient unified easily controlled and manipulated orderly etc is a dictator or fascist's dream come true even if not from a dictator's point of view the populace is united ordered obedient etc all at a price of course but these are still positives the difference is that most er make that some of us today don't feel that it's worth giving up things like basic human rights privacy etc in exchange for security and order but things like security order and societal unity are still positives Externality Anti-communism Postmodernism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Philosophical skepticism Microeconomics Alignment (role-playing games) Labor theory of value Objectivist philosophy A Course In Miracles Coercion Theory of conduct Democracy Civil rights Infantilism Capitalism Ethics God Religious pluralism The nature of God in Western theology Postmodernity Religion Conservatism Biblical inerrancy John Howard Yoder Classified information Inflation Power (sociology) Simone Weil Economics Social justice Individual rights Liberalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transformation problem Abortion debate Brave New World Wealth Human nature Single Transferable Vote Military science Feminism Women in Islam Technocratic movement Ten Commandments Opus Dei Sexual orientation Exchange value Utilitarianism Social psychology Political philosophy Gender role Cyberspace Discordianism Privacy Age of Enlightenment Goodness and value theory Lincoln-Douglas Debate Second language acquisition Philosophy of language Digital rights management Political economy Modernism Jewish principles of faith Anarchism and society Ownership Value system Religious Society of Friends Aikido ELO rating system Natural deduction Anarchism and capitalism Voter turnout Atheism English grammar Fundamentalism Anatomy of Criticism Music Pacifism Right-wing politics Friedrich Schleiermacher Epistemology Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Extreme Programming Evil Anarcho-primitivism Predestination Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meme Cultural relativism Creationism Kashrut Leadership Philosophy of mathematics Frankfurt School Altruism Nationalism
