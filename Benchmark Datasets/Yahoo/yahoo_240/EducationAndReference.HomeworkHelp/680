using sensory language this is one of my summer assignments using sensory language write a character sketch of your best friend how do i go about this am i supposed to say how my best friend tastes or feels or smells i understand sight and sound but that doesn't make for such a long paper i need help thanks when you write a character sketch you are trying to introduce the reader to someone you want the reader to have a strong mental image of the person to know how the person talks to know the person's characteristic ways of doing things to know something about the person's value system character sketches only give snap shots of people therefore you should not try to write a history of the person a good way to write a character sketch is to tell a little story about one encounter you had with him or her if you do that you could describe a place briefly hopefully a place that belongs to the person you are describing focusing on things in the scene that are somehow representative of the person you are describing describe how the person is dressed then simply tell what happened as you spent time together from time to time describe the person's gestures or facial expressions it is important to put words into the person's mouth in direct quotations as you work on this paper you should decide what kind of emotional reaction you want the reader to have in relationship to this person what kind of details can you select to create that emotional reaction avoid making broad characterizing statements instead let the details you give suggest general characteristics let the reader draw her own conclusions excellent example can be found at remove spaces from link http www engl niu edu wac grandma html use the sensory items to give an overall impression of the encounter you're describing about this person of them but also their environment and personality sensory items in this example sight wrinkled hands environment old white wooden cupboards hearing she shuffled slightly environment squeaky door smell lavender perfume faint whif of moth balls environment rancid aroma of over cooked coffee touch feel she placed a wet smack on my turned cheek soft loose flesh of her sagging arms environment the cracker turned soft taste crackers butter coffee hope this helps best wishes to you Autism Meaning Milton H.
