please help what similarities and differences do you see between functions and linear equations are all linear equations functions is there an instance in which a linear equation is not a function create an equation of a nonlinear function and provide two inputs they both have x and y coordinates but graphs of linear functions are straight and have no breaks are continuous where function graphs may be curved or have breaks the only kind of linear equations that are not functions are those of the form x c where c is a constant these are vertical lines and so are not functions non linear functions just throw in x or x and pick values for x Linear equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Linear Polynomial Trigonometric function Derivative Dynamical system Slope Nonlinearity Maxwell's equations Linear regression Supply and demand State space (controls) Parabola Recurrence relation Perspective (graphical) Least squares Lebesgue integration Continuous function Finite element method Cellular automaton Normal distribution Projective transformation Conic section Manifold Mathematics of general relativity Nomogram Einstein's field equation Discrete Fourier transform M__bius transformation Partial differential equation Trajectory Mathematical model Fibonacci number Aliasing Sturm-Liouville theory Elliptic curve Affine transformation Circuit design Artificial neural network Ellipse Complex number Bessel function Vector field Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Tensor Schr__dinger equation Linear transformation System analysis Determinant Gauge theory Wave equation Production theory basics Calculus Polynomial interpolation Dynamic programming Operator Chaos theory Production function Cournot competition World line Mercator projection CIE 1931 color space Path integral formulation Multiple integral Hydrogeology Line (mathematics) Halting problem Newton's method Ricci flow Spline interpolation Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) RLC circuit Exogenous growth model Logistic function Optimization (mathematics) Simplex algorithm Analog-to-digital converter Basis (linear algebra) Polarization Biomechanics Analog computer Spline (mathematics) Gamma correction Linear differential equation Distribution (mathematics) Complex system Cubic equation Self-adjoint operator Operational amplifier Extrapolation Linear algebra Dimensional analysis Aberration in optical systems Exponential growth
