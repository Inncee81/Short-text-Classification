need help in math problem the perimeter of a rectangle is meters find the dimensions of the rectangle that will contain the greatest area could you guys please help me with this problem and please put your solution in or an explanation on how did you do it please i really need to answer this well you have a rectangle say the bottom and top are length x and the sides are length y now you know the perimeter is so the perimeter of our rectangle is x x y y so x y y x y x now the area is something you need to maximize and you do this by taking the derivative of the equation of area and finding where it equals which is essentially finding the absolute max the area of our rectangle is x y a where a is the area now you need to make this one variable so you can take the derivative so using y x x x a x x a now you take the derivative of a and set it equal to to find the max a' x x x x so you know x the base is plus this into your equation to find y y x y y so x y it's a square this will always be true for any rectangle of a given perimeter the maximum area will always be a square Lebesgue integration Triangle Numerical integration Orthogonal matrix Riemann integral Fundamental theorem of calculus Calculus Complex number Area (geometry) Dirac equation Square root Polygon Sudoku Optimization (mathematics) Smalltalk Quadratic equation Particle in a box Normal distribution Archimedes Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Dimensional analysis Golden ratio Quaternion Philosophy of space and time Gravity Integral Isoperimetry Translational symmetry Planetary orbit Maxwell's equations Pi Ordinary differential equation Kepler's laws of planetary motion Mathematics Hydrogeology Apollonius of Perga Hipparchus (astronomer) Fibonacci number Exponentiation Colours, standards and guidons Many-worlds interpretation Prime number Action potential Dynamical system Transformation problem Trigonometric function Partial differential equation Henri Lebesgue Slide rule General relativity Special relativity Quadrilateral Derivative Einstein-Cartan theory Collision detection Multiple integral Random walk TI-89 series Quartic equation Flag of the People's Republic of China Mathematics of general relativity Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Timeline of mathematics Welfare economics Cissoid of Diocles Karnaugh map Trajectory Algorithm Cellular automaton Path integral formulation Infinity Newton's method Diamond cut Nondimensionalization Parallax Joseph Louis Lagrange Principle of maximum entropy Galois theory Wallpaper group Statistical mechanics Artificial neural network Irrational number Quantum harmonic oscillator Force Heat equation Sturm-Liouville theory Black-Scholes Numerical analysis Geodesy Fourth dimension Determinant Gaussian elimination Regression analysis Modular exponentiation Planck units John Wallis Lagrange multipliers
