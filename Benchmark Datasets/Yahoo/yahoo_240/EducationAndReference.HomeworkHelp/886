how long will it take the second ship to catch the first a ship leaves the dock moving at mph hours later a second ship leaves heading in the same direction but going mph you will use the formula distance equals rate multiplied by time d rt for the first ship the rate is and time is t so its distance traveled is always t for the second ship the rate is and the time is t so its distance is always t now we want the distances to be equal so we have the equation t t distribute the t t subtract the t from both sides and add the t divide by t the time will be hours it's hours because mph is miles per hour Coriolis effect Gravity Speed of light Elementary algebra Tide Calculus Ship Dimensional analysis Quadratic equation Quartic equation Circle Fast bowling Trigonometric function Speed limit Longitude Trigonometric identity Cissoid of Diocles Complex number Matrix (mathematics) Two-body problem Speed Gaussian elimination Indian Railways Warp drive Radar International Date Line Vector (spatial) Mechanical advantage Navigation Conic section Transformation problem Hyperdrive 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Binary numeral system Torque Sonar Explosive material Velocity Vedic mathematics Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Proper time Time zone Decibel Temperature Norwegian Campaign Planetary orbit Celestial navigation Trip distribution Units of measurement Highway Interstate Highway Inequality Contract bridge Wind power Force Electromagnetic radiation Continued fraction Riemann zeta function Power (physics) Time travel Vulgar fraction Money supply Auto racing Horizontal coordinate system Black-Scholes Heart rate Transmission line Map projection Astrodynamics Exponential distribution Polynomial Combinatorial species Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Slide rule Tsiolkovsky rocket equation 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Faster-than-light Bussard ramjet Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Autogyro Frame of reference Zeno's paradoxes Mental calculation Rainhill Trials Trajectory Furlong Rigging John Bull (locomotive) Microphone Spacecraft propulsion USS San Francisco (CA-38) Freeway Lens (optics) Negative and non-negative numbers Geomagnetic storm Battle of Calabria Heat equation Computus Labour economics Hiawatha Line
