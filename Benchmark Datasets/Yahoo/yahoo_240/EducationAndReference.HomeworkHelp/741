chemistry can someone pls answer my questions my midterm exam is about to come and yet i don't have the answers to these questions i really need help badly how come the metallic properties of the elements in the periodic table decreases as you go across and increases as you go down how come the atomic size of the elements in the periodic table decreases as you go across and increases as you go down how come the ionization energy of the elements in the periodic table increases as you go across and decreases as you go down how come the electron affinity of the elements in the periodic table increases as you go across and decreases as you go down i'm not sure about metals occur when atoms form overlapping orbitals because of pauli's exclusion principle and i don't know how that correlates to atomic size or electronegativity but i'll guess they're going for an easy answer since it's as you go down a group the atomic size gets larger and the atoms have less attraction to the valence electrons hence it becomes easier for them to be delocalized like in metals as you move across the atoms get smaller and hold onto their electrons more increasing as you go down is because you are adding energy levels to the electrons as you go across you are staying within the same energy level and you are adding more protons so the protons pull the electrons in a little closer so the atom gets smaller the ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove an electron and the larger the atom is the easier it is because the electrons will be further from the nucleus so as you go down a group atoms get bigger the ionization energy drops as you go across a period the atoms get smaller and the ionization energy increases the way i think about this one is that atoms don't like to have extra or missing electrons it's unstable to have a large amount of extra charge in a small space so to add an extra electron it helps to have enough space so that it can spread out think of trying to babysit kids with babysitters if you add an extra kid it makes a big difference especially if they're all hyperactive but if you had kids and babysitters adding kid wouldn't be so bad so as you move across a period atoms get smaller and it's more difficult to add electrons as you move down a group atoms get larger and it's easier to add electrons extra note if you know the size trends all of the other ones can be rationalized using that Ionization potential Atomic orbital Nuclear fusion Hydrogen Chemistry Electron configuration Semiconductor Ionizing radiation Electronegativity Helium Ion Periodic table Covalent bond Carbon Atomic nucleus Orbital hybridisation Nuclear fission Mass spectrometry Uranium Nuclear magnetic resonance Neutron Solar cell Water (molecule) Solar variation Pauli exclusion principle Explosive material Inertial confinement fusion Electron Metal Iron Radiation hardening Lithium Computational chemistry Stellar evolution Plasma (physics) Electrical conduction Isotope Timeline of the Universe Gamma ray Hydrogen bond Chemical element Vacuum Nuclear reaction Corona discharge Phase (matter) Neutrino Supernova Rocket fuel Plutonium Chemical bond Spin (physics) Ozone depletion Identical particles Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Acid Nuclear explosion Magnetometer Lanthanum Fine-tuned universe Ionic bond Antimatter Aluminium Internal ballistics Ruthenium Gravity Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Magnetism Nuclear fuel cycle Vacuum tube Compact star Ozone hole Spark plug Electrophysiology Lutetium Biochemistry Subatomic particle Planetary orbit Entropy Sulfur Corrosion
