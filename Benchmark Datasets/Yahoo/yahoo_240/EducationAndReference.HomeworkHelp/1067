probability math i know this is easy but im stuck i want solve this without listing all the possibilities is there a formula to find the desired over the possible outcomes take a look a fair coin is tossed times what is the probability that at least of the tosses will come up heads well there's an easy way and a less easy way less easy let p the probability of success in a single trial and q the probability of failure in a single trial for one toss the probability that you get heads is p and the probability of getting tails is q so if you want the probability of three tosses being heads and one being tails you combine probabilities by multiplying probability p p p q p q now there are many different ways you could get three heads and one tail there's a chance that you could get three heads in a row and then the tails or maybe the tails would be first and three heads after that each way you could get three heads and a tail contributes p q to your total probability the number of ways you can arrange getting k outcomes from n trials is nck n n k k in your case you're trying to see how many ways you can arrange getting three heads out of four total tosses so your final formula for calculating the probability of getting three heads out of four tosses is c p q then you have to set it up again to find the probability of getting all tosses as heads once you find that add it to the probability of getting heads and that's your total i strongly recommend that you understand how why this works and that you get comfortable doing it the long way before you use shortcuts like the one below easier way this whole concept is called the binomial distribution and you can use pascal's triangle to solve it much faster consider that p the probability of success and q the probability of failure since the total probability is p q must equal raising the quantity p q to the power and expanding p q out to get all its terms would give you p q p q p q p q p q where the coefficients are on the fifth row of pascal's triangle in real life words the terms you get from expanding p q n each tell you the probability of getting some number of successes out of n trials p is the probability of getting successes out of trials p q is the probability of getting successes out of trials and so on where the exponent on p is the number of successes remember that since p q equals the expansion of p q n also equals so all the terms you're getting give you probabilities that finally add to they represent all possible outcomes since you want the probability of getting at least heads just keep the p q p q part of the equation that's the combined probability of getting successes in all trials all heads or getting just successes in trials heads you already know the values of p and q see above so plug those in to get your answer for any problem like this you can use pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of the expanded terms remembering that the terms always go from p n q n starting at n as the power of p and subtracting one as you move to the next term hint use excel's binomdist function to check your answer Pascal's triangle Binomial coefficient On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Bayesian inference Gambler's fallacy Temperature Negative binomial distribution Complex number Quartic equation Normal distribution Polynomial Dice Bayes' theorem I Ching divination Coin flipping Microeconomics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Riemann zeta function Mathematics Fischer Random Chess Pi Exponentiation Maximum likelihood Trip distribution Catalan number Gaussian elimination Matrix (mathematics) Continued fraction Principle of indifference IP (complexity) Checking if a coin is fair Projective transformation Trigonometric function Computer numbering formats Quantum computer Halting problem Lebesgue integration Quadratic equation Ordinary differential equation Cumulant Path integral formulation Blaise Pascal Principle of maximum entropy Combinatorics Binomial theorem Elementary algebra Random variable Martingale Newton's identities Prior probability Random walk Taylor series Transformation problem Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Large numbers Expert system Derivative Vedic mathematics Stochastic process Poker jargon Binary numeral system Napier's bones Pointer Ruffini's rule Recurrence relation Expected value Quantum harmonic oscillator Many-worlds interpretation Particle in a box Probability distribution Dimensional analysis Derivation of the partition function Complexity classes P and NP Redundant array of independent disks Exponential family Pascal's Wager Likelihood principle Strategic management Timeline of mathematics Information entropy M__bius transformation Central processing unit Inflation Contract bridge Basel problem Quadratic sieve Poisson distribution
