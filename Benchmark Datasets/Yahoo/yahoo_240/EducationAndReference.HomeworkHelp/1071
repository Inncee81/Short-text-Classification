i need help with my physics homework guys i don't understand these kind of problems a unifrom electric field with a magnitude of n c is directed in the positive x direction a c charge moves from the origin to the point cm cm what is the change in the lectrical potential energy of the system as a result of the change in position of this charge what is the chage in the electrical potential energy in a lighting bolt of c of charge travel to the ground from a cloud km above the ground in the direction of the field assume the electric field is unform and has a magnitude of n c eek this doesn't look fun do you have a textbook it might help you if not i think sparknotes com has a physics help section good luck Classical mechanics General relativity Electric field Action potential Energy Quantum mechanics Newton's laws of motion Electric potential Membrane potential Flux Lightning Antiparticle Potential energy Maxwell's equations Electricity Electromagnetic radiation Luminiferous aether Dirac equation Electromagnetic field Dipole Momentum Force Gravity Radar Physics Double layer Current (electricity) Magnetic field Directed-energy weapon Langmuir probe Electrophysiology Faster-than-light High-voltage direct current Renormalization group Nuclear fusion Magnetism Planetary orbit Dynamical system Sun Photoelectric effect Coulomb's law Fusion power Light Special relativity Magnetohydrodynamics Resonance Vector (spatial) Galileo spacecraft Wave Spin (physics) Electric charge Entropy Spacecraft propulsion Mass Exotic matter Temperature Corona discharge Phonon Supersymmetry Noether's theorem Peltier-Seebeck effect Gauge theory Diode Renewable energy Solar cell Vector field Capacitor Antimatter Thermodynamics Transformer Lightning rod Tide Permittivity Particle in a box Electrostatics Tests of general relativity Escape velocity Quantum electrodynamics Capacitance Robert Millikan Volt Phase-shift keying Classical electromagnetism Semiconductor Centimetre gram second system of units Nuclear power Alternating current Tank Tether propulsion Quantum harmonic oscillator Time travel Dark energy Electrical conduction Electric field screening Derivation of the partition function Fusor Computer numbering formats Harmonic oscillator Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)
