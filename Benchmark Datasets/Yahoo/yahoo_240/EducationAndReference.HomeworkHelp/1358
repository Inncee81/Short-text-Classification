oh no i have to think for myself up until now the homework assignments that i've had have involved looking up information and providing references this assignment i have now i'm not sure how to go about it because it requires a little independent thinking i'm throwing it out here to get some ideas of what to include in my paper ok i have to write paragraphs on what the motivation is to learn medical terminology the argument is if you are unfamiliar with a word you can just ask the doctor or look it up in a medical dictionary or go online and find the answer what is the purpose behind trying to memorize pages and pages of medical terms i'm supposed to provide the reasons why you would learn medical terminology for your job in the medical field the only thing i can think of is it would make your job harder if you had to stop and take the time to look up words in the dictionary everytime you encountered one but that doesn't take up paragraphs any other ideas ok first paragraph someone actually taking the time to learn the definition of medical terms would greatly benefit over the person that chose to take the easy way out by asking what does that mean with conversations they will encounter in the work place first it will open more doors for the person that takes the time to learn the medical terms because an employer will be more impressed with someone they aren't going to have to explain everything to next learning medical terms will be beneficial if that person ever decides to become a nurse or even a doctor that person will be one step ahead of the ordinary person that didn't bother learning the terminology finally just the comfort of not having to stop and look up every word will increase speed and production which in turn might lead to a well deserved pay raise i personally feel that learning medical terms will benefit me in the job i am seeking now and ones that might become available in the future Theory of conduct Economics Plame affair A Course In Miracles Sexual orientation Alcoholics Anonymous CPU cache Philosophy of language Predestination Milton H.
