help please hello i really need help with closing arguments that i have to write to the jury in this assignment they're are putting george on trial for murdering lennie and i have to choose whether george is guilty or not guilty of murdering lennie i think that he is guilty because if prerhaps he would have not killed lennie and he would have been excused pm grounds of lack of mental competence and may have been given a better life than had with george so what i need help with is how to start my closing arguments and a few points to back my arguement i will truly appreciate your help i'm not being lazy ihave been working on this assignment for a long time and i desperatley need help now thank you once again different writing assignments are given to help you figure out how to set your tone and pick your arguments for different purposes here you aren't supposed to be writing a cold dispassionate argument for an academic you are trying to appeal emotionally and intellectually to an average person who has someone's fate resting in their hands so you need to ask yourself what emotions or facts would cause the average person to be reluctant to agree with you remember in this case that you've got an author who has done a lot of groundwork to make us understand and excuse the killing so you have to counteract that one way you could do that is to use even stronger emotions against the killing right to life no matter what give examples that humanize the victim and make the jury identify with his innate struggle to live no matter what the hardship another route you could choose is an appeal to avoid emotion at all murder is defined as the elements of the crime are and set forth in a precise way how each of the elements of the crime clearly happened remind that jury that emotion has no place in determining whether the crime has taken place remind the jury that if we leave justice up to whether or not we like or identify with the accused then lots more murders will take place each person thinks in his or her own mind that the world would be better if this or that person were killed but that way lies anarchy set forth examples of how the accused was a very alert aware conscious person fully aware of what he was doing there is no exception in the law for good intentions nor should there be nobody appointed the accused as judge jury and executioner for the victim or you might combine the two approaches be clinical in evaluating the crime but emotional when humanizing the victim in the jury's mind Theory of conduct Appeal Murder Jury trial Abortion debate Jury Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law & Order Torture Bayesian inference Presumption of innocence Scots law Capital punishment O.
