two integers have a difference of and a sum of what are the intergers hey for this question you will have to make a simultaneous equation let one integer be x and the other y first equation x y or x y second equation x y substituting from the st equation y y or y or y x x hope this helped Diophantine equation Ordinary differential equation Function (mathematics) Binomial coefficient Joseph Louis Lagrange Dynamical system Continued fraction Welfare economics Naive set theory P-adic number Goldbach's conjecture Exponentiation Recurrence relation Trigonometric identity Matiyasevich's theorem Square root Prime number Polynomial Polylogarithm Number theory Group (mathematics) Heat equation Polymorphism (computer science) Quantum mechanics Integer Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Sturm-Liouville theory Diffraction Discrete Fourier transform Basel problem Formal power series Theta function Z-transform Functional equation Sobolev space Negative and non-negative numbers Modular form Einstein's field equation Torque Riemann zeta function Pi Fundamental theorem of calculus Fibonacci number Spin (physics) Path integral formulation Determinant Gaussian elimination Fermat number Complex number Mathematical model Permutation Big O notation Trigonometric function Numeral system Hurwitz zeta function Absolute value Nondimensionalization Electrical network Hypergeometric differential equation Figurate number Algebraic geometry Central processing unit Elliptic curve Exponential function God Timekeeping on Mars Riemann integral Imaginary unit Transcendental number Stochastic process On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Finite element method Identical particles Prices of production Real number Lagrangian mechanics Exact sequence Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges Calculus Leonhard Euler Hipparchus (astronomer) Conic section J-invariant Mental calculation Boundary value problem Mathematics Shor's algorithm Debye model Astrodynamics Weierstrass's elliptic functions Harmonic oscillator Fermat's last theorem 1729 (number) Bohr model Abelian group Type inference Linear differential equation Lift (force) Siphon
