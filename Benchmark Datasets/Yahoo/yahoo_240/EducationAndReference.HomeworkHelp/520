physics problem solving speed and velocity with solution please asap pleaseee a student in tallahassie drives to fort landordale for spring vacation by first going km east to pick up a friend in jacksonville and then km south to fourth lauderdale the whole trip takes hours calculate a student's speed and b velocity a speed only concerning about distance total distance km speed total distance time km hr b velocity concerning distance and direction resultant distance sqrt km direction arctan degree or degree to south east velocity v resultant distance time v v km hr with direction degree Escape velocity Trajectory Speed of light Faster-than-light Trigonometric function Velocity Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Harmonic oscillator Classical mechanics Semi-major axis Torque Plasma (physics) Planetary orbit Verlet integration Random walk Warp drive Tide Electromagnetic radiation Michelson-Morley experiment Comoving distance Proper time Kepler's laws of planetary motion Momentum Zeno's paradoxes Explosive material Kinetic energy Special relativity Spacecraft propulsion Pi Modified Newtonian dynamics Coriolis effect Force Orbital speed Speed Hipparchus (astronomer) Black hole Gravitational slingshot Hubble's law TI-89 series Particle in a box Dispersion (optics) Aerodynamics Coordinates (mathematics) Gravity Lagrangian point Astrodynamics Two-body problem Inertial guidance system Longitude Latitude Calculus Project Orion Radar Wave Orbital period Hohmann transfer orbit General relativity Interstellar travel Complex number Action potential Dark energy Phonon Measurement in quantum mechanics Newton's laws of motion Four-stroke cycle Time dilation Motorcycle Angular momentum Jet engine Sagnac effect Collision detection Speed of sound Langmuir probe Energy Impedance Great-circle distance Trigonometric identity Brachistochrone curve Time Anemometer Sonar Normal distribution Specific impulse Radius of convergence Florida State Road A1A Acceleration Luminiferous aether Bloodstain pattern analysis Gas in a box Lift (force) Florida World line Maxwell's equations Dynamic programming Parallax Sound Aberration of light M__bius transformation
