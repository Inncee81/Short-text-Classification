an airplane flies between two cities that are miles apart traveling with a wind of mi h when going and and traveling against it when retuning the trip out takes mintues less time than the retuning flight what is the speed of the plane please need this question basic distance formula distance speed time notice that hour and minutes are differencet unit minutes hr let a be the speed of the wind when the airplane travels with the wind its resultant speed is a resultant means sum now that the airplane returns it travels agains the wind the resultant speed of the airplane is a now for the time let t be the time it takes the airplane to travel one city to another in the same direction of the wind the trip out takes mintues less time than the retuning flight tells you the time it takes the airplane to return is minutes hr more than it takes to travel out thus the time is t traveling out a t return a t solve for t a t t a plug t back in the for t in the other equation a t a a distrubute a a a a multiply both sides by a a a a a a distribute a a a a a combine like terms a a subtract a for both sides and subtract for both sides a a a a so the speed of the airplane is mi hr Fixed-wing aircraft Trigonometric function Complex number Speed of light Glider Vedic mathematics Coriolis effect Torque Airport Boeing 747 Aviation history Trajectory United Airlines Flight 93 Elementary algebra Autogyro Astrodynamics Tide Calculus Planetary orbit Sailing Trip distribution Zeno's paradoxes Cissoid of Diocles Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Decibel Jumpstart 3rd Grade Model aircraft September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Wind Clyde Pangborn Radar Transformation problem Conic section SR-71 Blackbird Helicopter 1925 serum run to Nome Projective transformation Flight controls Airship Ziad Jarrah Gravity Michelson-Morley experiment Celestial navigation Transatlantic flight Quartic equation Jet aircraft Combinatorial species Classical mechanics Quadratic equation International Date Line Paragliding Eddie August Schneider Transmission line Douglas Skyrocket Riemann zeta function Airplane!
