calculus question finding amp period and phase shift y cos x pi y tan x pi what is the amplitude period and phase shift of each the standard formula for the equations is y asin bx c d where sin can be sin cos tan etc amplitude is always the a value so for the first problem the amplitude is the formula to find the period of a sine or cosine equation is pi b note that in the second problem tangents and cotangents use the formula pi b so substitute your b value in and you get pi for sine cosine tangent and cotangent the equation for phase shift is c b in the first problem that would be pi which reduces to be pi remember if the equation has c you take the opposite because the original equation shows bx c first distribute the then use the same steps from above amplitude period pi b pi phase shift pi Trigonometric identity Amplitude modulation Tangent half-angle formula Hyperbolic function Phase-shift keying Discrete Fourier transform Euler's formula Quaternion Trigonometry Alternating current Ordinary differential equation Timeline of mathematics Harmonic oscillator Cissoid of Diocles Trajectory Basel problem Discrete cosine transform Triangle Tangent Laplace transform Map projection Impedance Complex number Polarization Prosthaphaeresis Mathieu function Beat (acoustics) Quantum tunneling Fourier transform Frequency modulation Integral Fourier series Newton's method Multiple integral Normal mode Standing wave ratio Orthogonal matrix Taylor series 3D projection Madhava of Sangamagrama WKB approximation Integration by parts Particle in a box Circle Kepler's laws of planetary motion Coordinates (mathematics) Mathematics of general relativity Coherent state Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Wave Roman surface Bessel function Al Battani Phase (waves) Color Path integral formulation RLC circuit Phasor (electronics) Angle Derivative Cubic equation Modified discrete cosine transform Trigonometric rational function Slope Ellipse Uses of trigonometry Wave equation Calculus Astrodynamics Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Absolute magnitude Versine Pendulum Cotangent bundle Gibbs phenomenon Generating trigonometric tables Pi Vector (spatial) Parabola Tangent space Power (physics) Single-sideband modulation Action potential Coordinate rotation Phase-locked loop NTSC Fresnel equations Slide rule Dynamical system Geometry Proper time TI-89 series Vector field Joseph Louis Lagrange Legendre transformation Boundary value problem
