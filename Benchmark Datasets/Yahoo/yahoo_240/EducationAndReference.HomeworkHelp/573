horizontal range a ball is projected horizontally at m s from an altitude of m what is its horizontal range what would be its horizontal range if it was projected from teh same altitude but at an angle of deg below horizontal g the gravitational acceleration usually taken to be m s near the earth's surface theta the angle at which the projectile is launched v the velocity at which the projectile is launched y the initial height of the projectile d the total horizontal distance traveled by the projectile when neglecting air resistance the range of a projectile will be d v cos theta g v sin theta sqrt v sin theta gy Trajectory Pendulum Parabola Astrodynamics Trigonometric function Planetary orbit External ballistics Proper time Coordinates (mathematics) Escape velocity Scalar potential Great-circle distance Space elevator Snell's law Schwarzschild coordinates Brachistochrone curve Coordinate rotation Ellipse Sphere Polarization Lorentz group Scramjet Multiple integral Black hole Angle Conic section Space fountain Gravity Altitude Projective transformation Frame fields in general relativity Geographic coordinate system Complex number Semi-major axis Terminal ballistics Railgun Orthogonal matrix Gee Internal ballistics Force Wind turbine 3-sphere Torque Potential flow Kinetic energy Vector field Artillery Harmonic oscillator Geodesy Roman surface Horizontal coordinate system Clementine mission Schwarzschild metric Vector (spatial) Saturn V General relativity Cissoid of Diocles Boy's surface Centripetal force Triangle Items in the Metroid series Mass Latitude Parallax Elliptic integral Versine Spontaneous symmetry breaking State space (controls) Shell (projectile) Specific orbital energy Terminal velocity Speed of sound Pascal's theorem Pentagon Map projection Orbit equation Dot product Space Shuttle program Jacobi's elliptic functions Inertia Spacecraft propulsion Geostationary orbit Stefan-Boltzmann law Sagnac effect Tide Project Orion Diffraction M__bius transformation Special relativity Mercator projection Jet engine Equivalence principle Two-body problem Cassini-Huygens Laplace operator
