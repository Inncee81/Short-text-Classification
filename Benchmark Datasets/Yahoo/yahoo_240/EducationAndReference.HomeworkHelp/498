how to solve this math problem write slope intercept form of equat of each line given slope y intercept slope y intercept hmm i think it is y x y mx b is the formula where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y intercept hope that helps Linear equation Slope Cissoid of Diocles Ordinary differential equation Mathematics Trigonometric function M__bius transformation Polynomial Derivative Trajectory Calculus Aberration in optical systems Curve fitting Projective transformation Algebraic geometry Conic section TeX Cournot competition Runge-Kutta methods Welfare economics G__del's incompleteness theorem Modern portfolio theory Length of an arc Special relativity Elementary algebra Quadratic equation Haversine formula Discrete Fourier transform Physics Numerical analysis Partial differential equation Tangent Celestial navigation Kalman filter Complex number Force Linear Atiyah___Singer index theorem Slippery slope Mean value theorem Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Apollonius of Perga Siphon Chemical equation Joseph Louis Lagrange Circle Line at infinity Legendre transformation Einstein's field equation Vedic mathematics Exponential function Prime number Pi Richard Feynman Sturm-Liouville theory Newton's method Microeconomics Numerical ordinary differential equations Luminiferous aether Generating function Functional equation Angle Matrix (mathematics) Quartic equation History of computing hardware Hidden Markov model Heat equation Production function Fibonacci number Astrodynamics Andes Super Bowl XXVI Exponentiation Leonhard Euler Navier-Stokes equations Solar thermal energy RSA Planetary orbit Cleveland Browns Clay Mathematics Institute Catenary Function (mathematics) JPEG 2000 Quintic equation Galois theory System of linear equations Cholesky decomposition Brahmagupta Duality (projective geometry) Goldbach's conjecture General relativity Parabola Binomial coefficient Sim__on Denis Poisson Recurrence relation Equation solving New York Jets Torque Transmission line Two-body problem
