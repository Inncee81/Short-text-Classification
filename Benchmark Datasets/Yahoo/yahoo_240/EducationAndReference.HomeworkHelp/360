help me please a b b this is supposed to be an area of a trapezoid cna someone help me with steps because i am totally clueless that equation will only work for a particular trapezoid the universal formula is a h b b for this formula h is the heigth which is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides b and b are lengths of the two parallel sides Circle Triangle Cissoid of Diocles Area (geometry) Quadrilateral Numerical integration Map projection Pendulum Pythagorean theorem Descriptive geometry Haversine formula Series and parallel circuits Parabola Torque Frenet-Serret formulas Conic section Buckling Trigonometric function Coordinate rotation Orthographic projection Quartic equation Analytic geometry RLC circuit Ellipse Moir__ pattern Multiple integral Kinetic theory Reflection (mathematics) Polygon View camera Non-Euclidean geometry Traffic Polarization Mechanical work Euclidean plane isometry Special relativity Dot product Josip Plemelj Standard deviation Trigonometric identity Astrodynamics Coriolis effect Heron's formula General relativity D-brane Gravitational radiation Cross product Numerical analysis Geometry Slope Stress (physics) Ruler-and-compass construction Quadratic equation Complex number Collision detection Parallel postulate Euler-Bernoulli beam equation Leonhard Euler Wallpaper group Huzita's axioms Sextant Great-circle distance Duality (projective geometry) Coordinate system Geodesy Chemical formula Euclidean geometry Differential geometry of curves Square root Dimensional analysis Archimedes Sundial Euler's formula Parking Local hidden variable theory Random walk Luminiferous aether Vedic mathematics Vector (spatial) Chemical equation Plasma (physics) Angular velocity John Wallis Distance Volleyball Numerical ordinary differential equations Ship Gravity Two-body problem Moment of inertia Rational trigonometry Mathematical logic Orthogonal matrix Axiom Geography of Africa Energy Kepler's laws of planetary motion Geographic coordinate system
