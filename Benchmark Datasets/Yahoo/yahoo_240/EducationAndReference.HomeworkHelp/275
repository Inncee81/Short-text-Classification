statistics a factory's management team claim that the mean time that each of its factory's machines is idle per week is over hours which is too high the factory manager does not a gree with thins when a random sample of machines is observed the mean weekly idle time was found to be hours from past experience it is possible to assume that the idle time of a machine during the week is normally distributed with a standard deviation of hours at teh level of significance is the contention of the management justified can someone show me how to solve this form of problem step state given information population mean hours population standard deviation hours xbar hours sample mean n observations alpha step setup hypothesis ho hours null hypothesis ha hours alternate hypothesis claim step select test statistic since the population standard deviation is given we can use a z distribution therefore the test statistic is zcalc xbar n step find zcrit and state decision rule table lookup z distribution zcrit this should give you a zcrit value of this is a one tailed test and the decision rule is to reject ho if zcalc zcrit of otherwise accept ho step compute zcalc zcalc xbar n zcalc zcalc zcalc step state decision since zcalc of zcrit of we accept ho and reject the claim that the idle time is greater than hours good luck in your studies mitch Quantitative marketing research Normal distribution Null hypothesis Doomsday argument Bayesian inference Standard deviation Scientific method Likelihood-ratio test Mann-Whitney U Hardy-Weinberg principle P-value Student's t-distribution Randomness Genetic algorithm Pearson's chi-square test Margin of error Statistics Balassa-Samuelson effect Economics Intelligence quotient Parapsychology Z-test Kalman filter Digital circuit Hardware random number generator Bayesian probability Likelihood principle Web crawler Bell's theorem Checking if a coin is fair Bayes' theorem Gravity Student's t-test Control chart Experiment Exponential family ELO rating system Turing machine Fisher's exact test Big Bang Race and intelligence Many-worlds interpretation Efficient market hypothesis Domain Name System Quicksort Median Qualitative psychological research Sampling (statistics) Hash table Prime number Efficiency wages Model (economics) Falsifiability Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices Biology and sexual orientation Bell test experiments Regression toward the mean Decision making Decision theory Logic Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Linear regression Exponential distribution Industrial engineering Opportunity rover Mean Cancer Effect size Daylight saving time Causality Management information system Expert system Mode choice Prior probability Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Philosophy of science General relativity Species Intelligent design G__del's incompleteness theorem Artificial neural network Kurtosis Creationist cosmologies CPU cache Science Martingale Law of value Failure rate Tobacco smoking
