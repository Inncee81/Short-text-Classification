what is the end of the muscles science lah i think it depends on which of the three types of muscle you are talking about i think you probably are referring to tendons but read the following or go to the web site indicated below muscle is mainly composed of muscle cells within the cells are myofibrils myofibrils contain sarcomeres which are composed of actin and myosin individual muscle fibres are surrounded by endomysium muscle fibers are bound together by perimysium into bundles called fascicles the bundles are then grouped together to form muscle which is enclosed in a sheath of epimysium muscle spindles are distributed throughout the muscles and provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system skeletal muscle is muscle attached to skeletal tissue distinct from heart or smooth muscle it is arranged in discrete muscles an example of which is the biceps brachii it is connected by tendons to processes of the skeleton in contrast smooth muscle occurs at various scales in almost every organ from the skin in which it controls erection of body hair to the blood vessels and digestive tract in which it controls the caliber of the lumen and peristalsis cardiac muscle is the muscle tissue of the heart and is similar to skeletal muscle in both composition and action being comprised of myofibrils of sarcomeres cardiac muscle is anatomically different in that the muscle fibers are typically branched like a tree branch and connect to other cardiac muscle fibers through intercalcated discs and form the appearance of a syncytium Biomechanics Sarcomere Muscle contraction Cardiac cycle Skeletal muscle Humerus Bone Heart Motoneuron Circulatory system Skin Eye Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Scapula Arm Motility Biochemistry Aortic dissection Tendon Cell (biology) Elbow-joint Lung Puberty Protein Radius (bone) Weight training Action potential Blood vessel Anatomy Cartilage Pain Muscle spindle Artery Atherosclerosis Myocardial infarction Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Cardiac pacemaker Stomach Skeleton Peripheral nervous system Chlorophyta Lymphatic system Coronary heart disease Insulin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human anatomy Animal Cardiac stress test Cephalic disorder Tibia Cancer Stem cell Medicine Ulna Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sexual differentiation Leaf Enzyme Actin Massage Stopping power Death Textile manufacturing terminology Head Spinal cord Traumatic brain injury Eukaryote Diabetic neuropathy Spatial disorientation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Dietary fiber Sea star Hand Multiple sclerosis Signal transduction Cardiac arrhythmia Orgasm Cardiology Atheroma Human physiology Crocodilia Cell growth Tesla coil Acanthocephala Adrenal gland Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human biology Wood Abdomen Tachycardia Respiratory system Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome
