help with my homework i'ts all about science this is my homework what are the processes involved in the nitrogen cycle effect of population size on relationships in ecosystem luvyankees has a great answer get a chance to beat luvyankees nice one luvyankees http en wikipedia org wiki nitrogen cycle processes of the nitrogen cycle nitrogen fixation conversion of n assimilation ammonification nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation to further learn on the nitrogen cycle as well as see a diagram click on the link above the ecosystem is a very fragile system human beings have witnessed this when they affect it with things such as oil spills or hunting so much that it puts an animal on the endangered species list population determines the relationships in the ecosystem because the number of creatures affects the food chain which basically determines everything pop size can mess with the greenery in an ecosystem and the carnivorous animals that live there the bigger the population the bigger the ecosystem must be to provide for all those creatures it has to have more plants so it can supply energy and food to the herbivores who supply food and energy to the carnivores and so forth Ecology Soil life Nitrogen fixation Soil Nitrogen Biogeochemical cycle Eutrophication Sewage treatment Nitrogen cycle Metabolism Trophic level Biodiversity Photosynthesis Organic farming Explosive material Biology Environmental concerns with electricity generation Biochemistry Food chain Bacteria Vegetation Nutrition Agriculture Compost Redox Brown Bear Domestication Carnivorous plant Evolution Carbon dioxide Biodiesel Wetland Sulfur Plant Ammonia Antarctic krill Gray Wolf Origin of life Dinosaur Petroleum Alternative biochemistry Global warming Protein History of ecology Carnivore Extinction Carbon cycle Shifting cultivation Cellular respiration Fauna of Australia Human Desertification Fire Mitochondrial genetics Ozone depletion Extreme Programming Aquarium Livestock Expert system Fish farming Europe Tooth Natural gas Economics Energy development Ferret Ozone hole Future energy development Internal combustion engine Dog Central processing unit Noah's Ark Dairy Hydrogen sulfide Coal Green Revolution Hydrogen Towra Point Nature Reserve Species Deforestation Renewable energy Fertilizer Earth Water (molecule) Vegetarianism Gaia theory (science) Wealth Helium Nutrient Soil pH Marine aquarium Marine biology Overpopulation Ammonium nitrate Life Brain
