can someone explain to me how to solve an equation with three variables like this x y z which variable do i solve for first and how do i go about isolating it thanks you cannot obtain values of three variables x y and z from a single equation you need as many equations as you have unknown values you can rearrange this equation to get x in terms of y and z or y in terms of x and z but that is all x y z subtracting y from each side x z y dividing by x x y x y z subtracting x y z x dividing by y z x Quartic equation Dimensional analysis Conic section Trigonometric identity Gaussian elimination Trigonometric function Ordinary differential equation Quadratic equation Complex number Recurrence relation Quintic equation Separation of variables Vedic mathematics Equation solving Particle in a box Function (mathematics) Heat equation Two's complement Nondimensionalization Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Nonlinearity RLC circuit Inequality Cissoid of Diocles Numerical analysis Partial differential equation Linear differential equation Mathematics Temperature Polynomial Path integral formulation Derivative Computus Projective transformation Sturm-Liouville theory Linear equation Navier-Stokes equations Newton's method Figurate number Economics Dirac equation Exogenous growth model Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) Riemann zeta function Gravity Harmonic oscillator Price equation Experiment Holomorphic function Joseph Louis Lagrange Instrumental variable Computational chemistry Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Mathematics of general relativity Galois theory Astrodynamics Gr__bner basis Exact solutions in general relativity Entropy Potentiometer Least squares Schr__dinger equation Variance Nuclear magnetic resonance Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Numerical ordinary differential equations Functional equation Linear regression Black-Scholes Strategic management Basel problem Quantum mechanics Root-finding algorithm Units of measurement Two-body problem Variable Fundamental theorem of calculus Microeconomics Combinatorial species Square root XSL attack Perturbation theory Cubic equation Electrical network Bose gas Density functional theory Arbitrary constant of integration Continued fraction Binomial coefficient Circumscription Newton's identities Lagrange multipliers System of linear equations Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient Prior probability Model (economics) State space (controls) Hamiltonian mechanics Maxwell's equations
