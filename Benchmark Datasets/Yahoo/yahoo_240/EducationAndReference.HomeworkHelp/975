explain in your own words how to reverse foil when factoring a polynomial of the form ax bx c when a please help me first your first term is ax but a so ignore the a that leaves you with x which can only be x x so the first term in each pair of parentheses is x last what are the factors of c in this example they will both be positive numbers outside inside your factors of c have to sum to c and add to b for example if c were and b were your factors of c would be and if c were and b were your factors of c would be and Polynomial Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Fibonacci number Pascal's triangle Binomial coefficient Prime number Polynomial ring Glossary of graph theory Number theory Quadratic sieve Complex number Partial fraction Formal power series Bracket On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Linear differential equation Big O notation Ideal (ring theory) Complexity classes P and NP Function (mathematics) Root of unity Determinant Quartic equation Real number Catalan number Elementary arithmetic Characteristic polynomial Binomial type Negative and non-negative numbers 1 (number) Daubechies wavelet Lattice (group) Discrete Fourier transform Reverse mathematics Exponentiation Factor analysis Spline (mathematics) Modular form Linear regression Statistical mechanics Multiplication algorithm Trigonometric function Rational number Addition Bernoulli polynomials Degree (mathematics) Fermat number Newton's identities Galois theory Quantum computer Irreducible polynomial Ruffini's rule Trigonometric identity Riemann zeta function Elliptic curve Projective transformation Bernstein polynomial Sequence Local ring Cumulant Multiplication Finite field arithmetic Special number field sieve Irrational number Euclidean plane isometry Secret sharing Perfect number Divisor UBASIC Stirling number Shor's algorithm Manifold Von Neumann algebra Polynomial interpolation Even and odd permutations Integer factorization Naive set theory Complex conjugate Polylogarithm Car handling Basel problem Adjoint functors Taylor series Bayesian inference Meson Hypergeometric series Switch Quaternion Biology and sexual orientation Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm IP (complexity) Chebyshev polynomials Microphone Duodecimal Euler-Maclaurin formula Curve fitting Dynamical system Generating function
