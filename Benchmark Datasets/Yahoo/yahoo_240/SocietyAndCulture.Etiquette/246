do people realize that waitress don't make minimum wage we make less i live here on oklahoma and we make an hour plus tips when the wage goes up again next year we still won't get a raise yet some people not all think it is ok to leave little or no tip i do give good service to my costumers i don't know if people don't realize it or don't care is the legal min in this state of servers and i am trying to get back into college i start next week but waitressing is what works when you have kids i have a friend who worked as a server in a nice restaurant and was an excellent server she said she couldn't believe cheap tips people would leave i guess it's a matter of conscience and how one perceives a server servers are not a slave to the patrons they are there to serve you but not your slave i have seen some people behaving very rudely to a server and i am embarrassed for them the customer i always tip and more for unusually good service i also take into consideration that many things customers become irate over are not the fault of the server but the kitchen you know what i wish someone would do is open a restaurant with no tipping and pay the servers a decent hourly wage they can cover the extra expense by what their prices are in the menu my theory is if you are going to go out plan on spending that extra money for a decent tip or don't go out i also think people who don't tip properly are showing their ignorance Tip Waiter Minimum wage Wal-Mart Restaurant MMORPG Domain Name System Labor theory of value Capitalism Social rule Theory of conduct Copyleft Keynesian economics In-N-Out Burger Microeconomics Unemployment Insurance Economic inequality Tennis Poker jargon Labour economics Gross domestic product Knots Landing Health insurance Web hosting Friends Spam (electronic) The Apprentice 2 Value added tax Badminton McDonald's Satchel Paige Team Fortress Classic Hell's Kitchen (television) Kitchen Hyperinflation E-mail spam School of Salamanca National Weather Service Inflation Great Depression Serve (tennis) Apprenticeship Hard disk X Window System Strap-on dildo Volleyball Mach kernel Final Fantasy XI Anarchism and capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of the United States Supply and demand New Deal FairTax John Edwards Free trade Ultima Online Salary Chopsticks Methos Common criticisms of Microsoft Life insurance Craps Deflation (economics) Live 8 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tariff Philosophical skepticism DisneySpeak Athenian democracy Server ITunes Music Store Altruism Taxation in the United States Birthday Sweatshop Monopsony Economy of Russia Day care The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Efficiency wages Jon Secada Public policy Medicare (Canada) Rich Mullins America Online The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pulp Fiction Social Security (United States) Law of value Humphrey Bogart Tesco Password The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tax
