how do i stop a fellow student from constantly emailing the whole department instead of only her class a fellow student in my university department is repeatedly abusing the email system by emailing the entire department when in fact she is only addressing the few students who share her major i have asked her several times to stop doing so but she either doesn't care or doesn't know how to do it otherwise i don't want to report her to the computer admins but it is annoying as she is basically spamming my inbox any advice well her last response was i didn't have time to set up a contact list of just us in this case not enough time was a whole school year the problem obviously isn't just me it's the whole department receiving her emails so filtering her won't make her stop ask her if she would like some help setting up an email group so that her emails only go to the people she intends remind her gently that people dislike receiving emails that have nothing to do with them if she refuses your help and continues to abuse the system then you have no choice but to report her Stopping e-mail abuse Spam (electronic) E-mail spam Spam Prevention Early Warning System E-mail Gmail Make money fast Email authentication Plame affair Phishing Internet fraud SCO-Linux controversies Sender Policy Framework Bayesian filtering Advance fee fraud DomainKeys Hashcash Anonymous remailer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer virus Theory of conduct Whois Microsoft Outlook Facebook (website) Open mail relay Direct marketing America Online Internet Relay Chat Denial-of-service attack Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix E-mail address Webmail Blog News.admin.net-abuse.email Bayesian inference DNSBL Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Pitaten Blue screen of death Traumatic incident reduction LiveJournal Mozilla Application Suite Viral marketing Past teachings of Prem Rawat 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Esperanto as an international language Common criticisms of Microsoft AmigaOS The Best Page in the Universe Mozilla Thunderbird Windows XP The Amazing Race Karl Rove Malware Windows 2000 CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Password Logo programming language John Lott Domain Name System SpamAssassin Transactional analysis Grade (education) GED National Health Service 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Danger Hiptop Python programming language Opera (web browser) Search engine optimization Angela Davis Graduate school Captcha Hermione Granger Hard disk British national identity card Surveillance Alan Keyes Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule David Bohm Nick Berg Common Unix Printing System PLATO Domestic violence Outlook Express Bayesian probability Education in Japan Self programming language Downing Street memo Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Knots Landing Caulfield Grammar School Expert system Internet forum 2channel Getting Things Done Internet troll Alexander Technique Public domain
