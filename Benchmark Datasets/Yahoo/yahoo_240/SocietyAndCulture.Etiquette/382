death and weddings my husband and i were married a little while ago because of the military but we've decided to have an actual celebration with our friends and family finally about two years ago my best friend died i want to invite her boyfriend at the time but i know he is still very muchly depressed and i sense he doesn't want to come because it will be too sad for him he was planning to propose before she passed i don't know how to handle the situation and let him know that we love him and want him to come without making things worse for him or making him feel more even more saddened obviously we would never not invite him what kind of savages would we be i just want to know how to go about talking to him apart from a simple written invitation to make him feel more at ease with the situation i spoke with him on the phone and when i mentioned the possibility he was not at all excited in fact he sounded quite saddened as if i had reminded him of the loss in which case how when we send the actual invite do we talk to him about it give him a heads up write a letter call e mail and just tell him you are having a wedding celebration you love him and want him to attend but will understand if he can't attend due to his sorrow tell him the invite is coming unless he says not to send it i hope his sorrow has lessened enough to allow him to attend in the two years since his loss he may have resigned himself to attending weddings ask him if he wants a job at the wedding something that will keep him so busy he won't have time to think of his loss manning the guest register where he asks each and every guest to sign it or usher just might do that it is a tradition to remember departed loved ones at weddings in a community near mine a candle is lit by the bride and groom and next to it is a picture of the departed not a word is said sometimes a seat is left empty with a rose or a ribbon there to mark it it depends on you and your feelings to your departed friend would she be right beside you in your plans and at the ceremony and if you care to do this in my community this is not done sometimes it helps to recogognize grief and deal with it though that is not for everyone good luck and my sympathy to your friend and to you on not having her here at this important time Fiddler on the Roof Friends Pitaten White wedding God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct EastEnders Avenue Q Rent (musical) Mojave people Reaction to the assassination of John F.
