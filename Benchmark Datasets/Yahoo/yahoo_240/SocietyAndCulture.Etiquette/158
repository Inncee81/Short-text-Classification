what do you think of having a drivers ed for bike riding but its free i see so many people riding on the wrong sides of the road toward traffic and not following what we know as the rules maybe if someone taught a class to tell us what the right rules were then maybe everyone would be lots safer and they'd give you a bike license like a drivers license but it states that you been to that class classes and its safe for you to be on the road year olds won't have to go they'll have an age where you have to do it that would certainly help but i think that we can provide better training for car drivers as well i live in a city with a lot of cyclists and most of them know the rules of the road i see many more drivers being rude to them hogging the road or breaking traffic laws than cyclists Bike lane debate Vehicular cycling Driver's license Rules of the road Critical Mass Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle Bicycle helmet Effective Cycling Utility cycling Cycling Transportation of Los Angeles Motorcycle Road traffic accident Freeway Cycle path debate Hitchhiking Road safety Bicycle lighting Mountain biking Recumbent bicycle Traffic calming Traffic Sport utility vehicle Road bicycle racing Sustrans Tour de France Union Cycliste Internationale Speed limit Automobile Traffic light Cycling in Melbourne Tom Simpson Motorway Grand Theft Auto (game) Jaywalking Seat belt legislation Automatic number plate recognition Bus rapid transit Cycling team Lane Lance Armstrong Light rail Racing bicycle Roundabout Transport in Hong Kong Road School bus Track cycling Level crossing Public transport Trail Drunk driving (United States) Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China Drag racing Park and ride Vehicle registration plate Bicycle-friendly Curb extension Hour record Eddy Merckx Honda Highway Dual carriageway West Side Highway High-occupancy vehicle Hubert Opperman Boston transportation United States Grand Prix Road-rule enforcement camera Rail transport in Ireland Mario Cipollini TGV Formula One Cyclo-cross Stephen Roche Texas State Highway Loop 360 Tamar Bridge Graeme Obree Toyota Prius Chris Boardman Individual time trial Single-speed bicycle Personal rapid transit Car safety Star Wars: Battlefront Sutton Park Interstate Highway Pulaski Skyway Street Climbing specialist (cycling) London Congestion Charge Zebra crossing Hillclimbing REAL ID Act Car and Driver King City, Ontario Universal Serial Bus Group B
