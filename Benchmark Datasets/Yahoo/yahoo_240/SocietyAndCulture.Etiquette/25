did i do the right thing there's a woman in my department that has been condesending and short with me when i was training and would sometimes refused to help me even though she was supposed to do the training very two faced one minute she's cool the next she's talking crap about you behind your back she's treated me like an idiot today when everybody left the office and it was just her and i she called human resources to complain about how she's treated badly and that our boss has favorites all because she wants to start getting off work earlier on our busiest day i called my boss on her cell and told her what i heard ofcourse she was very upset do you think what i did was mean or wrong that will show her to treat people like idiots this clearly shows she's the bigger asshole for judging others too quickly and you work for your boss not her so don't feel guilty about it i'm sure if she was in your position she would of done the same or even worse good luck Shit Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct American Idiot Craps Sin City Friends Shaggy dog story Pok__mon Live!
