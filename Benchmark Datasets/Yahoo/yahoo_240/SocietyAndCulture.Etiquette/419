grocery guilt yesterday i went grocery shopping and one of the baggers helped me out with my groceries even though i told him that i could take them out myself that i didn't have anything to tip him with ect he said that it's a service which the grocery store provides and he didn't need a tip he was very sweet but i left feeling guilty the reasons why i feel guilty is that a i'm perfectly able bodied and b even if a tip's not expected i would sort of feel better if i could tip him should i feel guilty i thanked him repeatedly told him how nice he was no you should not feel guilty in fact it annoys me when people insist on helping me when i tell them no thank you i'll get it myself if i wanted help when it was offered i'd say thank you where i live i think it's store policy not to allow baggers to accept tips but a few people do lure them out to their cars to tip them which is nice but definitely don't feel guilty Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Knots Landing Plame affair Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina EastEnders Target Corporation Supermarket Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an George Costanza Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Sharon Tate Tip Mojave people Roxette Bon Jovi Leo Frank Henry Lee Lucas Neighbours Eric Robert Rudolph Theory of conduct Guilt Little Britain Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Sears Holdings Corporation Karl Rove Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Tesco Mumia Abu-Jamal The Lovely Bones Transactional analysis Barbra Streisand On Her Majesty's Secret Service Infidels Internet troll Clinical depression Phil Hendrie Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Questionable Content West Memphis 3 Humphrey Bogart The Inside Wall Street Goldfinger One Piece minor characters Pet Sounds Marilyn Monroe Meijer Late Night with Conan O'Brien Aldi W.
