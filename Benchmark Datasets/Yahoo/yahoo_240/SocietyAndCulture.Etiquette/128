do people not know they have to tip or even tip correctly im a great server but people come in sometimes and do not tip the right amount which is of the whole bill like today i had a table they were pretty nice their bill was dollars they tipped me yes a smiley face thats what they wrote on their slip who are these peopel i give speedy and friendly service been serving for years and people should definitely tip because the servers have to tip out according to their sales to the bussers bartenders runners etc if they dont tip the servers are walking out with gas money i hate when people say they dont have to tip yes you do if you dont then you mind as well call yourself a cheap o and dont go out to eat or you can go out but serve yourself go to buffets ugh sorry i just did not like some of the responses below oh and the smiley face table i was good with them because they complimented me but then again they didnt really speak english very well responde to aussie yeah you dont have to tip i guess but your attitude suggests you have no compassin let alone a heart for those who make a living out of serving and most if not all servers are students so i do go to school please die tomorrow thanks let me start off by saying that i always try and tip what i can and if the serve did an exceptional job i'd leave a better tip in fact i feel guilty if i don't leave one here's the thing some people have never worked as a server or in the restaurant retail world their ignorance tells them well the food cost us so much so why should we have to give more it's all about putting yourself in the other person's shoes which those type of people do not it's ironic but i usually find that the people that have less money and were not raised ultra privileged give more some take things too personal and think well i didn't get a rd refill so no tip for him her these people just realized that it's a human being that is helping them and people make mistakes on the other hand as long as you tried your best the majority of people will recognize this and tip it's a possibility that those people with the bill forgot to tip hey it happens believe me people know that if it's a sit down restaurant you are supposed to tip out of courtesy but of course it's not required i always try to give a little over myself hey best of luck and don't take it personal did i get the best answer chris k Social rule Theory of conduct Little Britain Tip The Apprentice 2 Singlish Whose Line Is It Anyway?
