honesty that is not asked for does any hate people who just blurt out whatever comes to mind without you asking them and then they make excuses like free speech or i was just being honest this is just plain rude if someone did not ask don't say it i think people would be better of not saying anything that might offend someone even if they beleive it to be the truth it's only their opinion anyways however if they ask then you should give your honest opinion but don't make the mistake of talking about things that you were not invited to discuss or comment on i personally find it aggravating when you know someone is thinking something and they talk about it to everyone but yourself they don't want to hurt your feelings but they don't mind trashing you to everyone else Theory of conduct Social rule Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Honesty Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sydney Riot of 1879 Anti-Mormonism Hate speech U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Plame affair Cindy Sheehan Ann Coulter Homophobia Jon Secada Religious Society of Friends Bill O'Reilly (commentator) One Tree Hill (TV series) Agnosticism Polyamory Lie American Psycho Freedom of speech Rick Santorum Fahrenheit 9/11 Transactional analysis Autism rights movement Bullshit Another Side of Bob Dylan The nature of God in Western theology Epistemology Scrooge McDuck Slander and libel Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Time Out of Mind The writing of Principia Mathematica Alcoholics Anonymous Noam Chomsky Prem Rawat Milton H.
