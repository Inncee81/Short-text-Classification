is this ok my boyfriend is out of town until sunday i asked him if it would be ok if i went over to his apartment to swim while he is gone i don't have a pool at my house he said yeah that's fine you can do whatever you want i already have the key to his apt my question is this would it be ok if i invited a girlfriend over to swim with me and made some margaritas with our own booze not his to hang out he has met her and he likes her but he didn't specifically say this was ok because i didn't think to ask and he will be out of communication until he gets back we would of course clean up any mess we made is this ok i can't call him and ask because he is across the nation and his phone network does not cover that area i can't get ahold of him and by 'girlfriend' i mean one of my female friends not a 'leg licker' wtf you're not supposed to lick their legs anyway lol i don't think your boyfriend would have a problem with you and your friend hanging out at the pool but i am worried about any concerns the apartment complex might have i wouldn't want your boyfriend to get into trouble because you were violating some apt complex rule some complexes can be really strict and enforce all kinds of rules so maybe once you get to the pool discreetly check things out like drinking poolside to make sure it's okay don't want to sound like your mom but don't want you to get into trouble julie Social rule Avenue Q Friends Seinfeld Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Sin City The Ashlee Simpson Show The O.C.
