why do lazy people insist on using the motor carts in the supermarkets leaving the real disabled people to walk around the store when i take my grandmother to the market she always has to walk because the motor carts are always being used by someone else well today when we were leaving out this lazy women drove the cart to her car which was next to mine she had no cane no trouble lifting her grocery's this women was even able to lift the front of the cart to move it out of her way so that she could pull off there was obviously nothing wrong with her or atleast nothing that would stop her from walking around picking up grocery's my grandmother on the other hand can barely walk with a cane why are people so inconsiderate the motor carts are there for people with disablities i wouldnt be so angry if the women actually needed it but she didnt and i see this all the time you guys are right but had i not seen her do all those things at her car i wouldnt be so angry starrrrgazer both asthma and artritis give off physical symptoms if you are having an asthma attack you obviously are not going to be lifting the front of a motor cart the same thing with artritis the only that makes since that any of you people have mentioned is a heart condition which you never wish to see the physical side affects of but if you cant walk around to long with out having problems with your heart i seriously doubt you can lift the front of a motor cart those things are fairly heavy so that leads me back to my conclusion she was being lazy unless there is some other disablity that you all want to tell me about that seems like the general theme that has become so common in america the easiest way is always the best way if the store is only a block away people want to drive a car anyway because it's easier instead of parking in the first spot they find which may be further away they drive around to look for the closest spot to walk the shortest distance they're taking it even a step further by taking away the motor carts for disabled people because it takes a slight amount of effort to push the cart obviously they have no excuse for this so i would go as far to have an employee make an announcement saying we have a person who needs mobile assistance in the store anyone who does not require the aid of a motor cart who is on one please return it to the front of the store maybe it wouldn't work but you might as well fight for fairness Aerial (dance move) Indianapolis 500 Shopping cart Equine conformation Supermarket Trailer Park Boys Toyota Prius Golf Escalator Professional wrestling throws Textile manufacturing Volleyball Operation Market Garden Hard disk Asthma The Apprentice 2 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Jackass: The Movie The Time Machine Drowning Recumbent bicycle School bus Bicycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Target Corporation Drag racing Jam (TV series) Captain Thunderbolt Mental retardation Motorcycle Combat stress reaction Breastfeeding Champ Car Swimming Electric vehicle Autopsy Tesco 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Bubble Bobble Urinary incontinence Escape from New York Shaggy dog story Married... with Children Hearing impairment Roller coaster Social rule Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hybrid vehicle Personal rapid transit Public transport 1957 World Series Armoured warfare Narcolepsy Wal-Mart The Contender (television series) Neighbours Eddie Guerrero Automobile Sin City Babe Ruth Traffic light Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cerebral palsy Traumatic brain injury Stuttering Manual transmission Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Tank Mojave people Ammunition Table tennis John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Battery electric vehicle Vehicular cycling Knots Landing Car handling Expert system Insurance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Inflation Skateboarding trick Milton H.
