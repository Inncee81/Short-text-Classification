why is someone going to all my answers and giving thumbs down i have been noticing just a meanness directed toward me lately and i think this is not the place for personal vendettas if it is because i reported someone who was not only violating y a policy but the law again shame on you and bless i did the hide thing thanks i am a nice person and have given a lot of help and very good answers for the mean ones again bless i guess it is a big deal because a system means something and it didn't start until recently and if someone doesn't speak up about wrongs then it will be letting bullies go on without doing anything about it this is a nice community of thinking people and there are always those who attempt to ruin somethng good contradictory bless your enemies is an age old philosophy and if i fight hate with love that is my way hello i know you personally and i think you should just not worry about it it is obvious that it bothers you and i know that you are a very kind person with much knowledge in many areas who ever it is obviously believes that you are a kind hearted person too and by doing something as such to you knows it would upset you my saying for circumstances such as this is if you don't feed it it can't grow our old friend randy says be like a duck and just let it roll off your back i haven't been on yahoo answers long so i'm still not up with knowing all the stars points etc but surely others can look at your q a's and see that you obviously have a good record here also seems the yahoo leaders or who ever is in charge of this should be able to tell if someone is trying to make you or anyone look bad they can and sometimes do track all the ip addresses of every user almost all web pages have that capability whether we know it or not modern technology so you know you are a good person and your friends know you're a good person don't give this person the pleasure of it upsetting you please continue to share your opinions and knowledge for those that want it and may need it all storms do pass and eventually the debri gets picked up and thrown away and it'll seem as though it was never there know that what goes around comes around keep up the good you do share who knows you may just be this persons angel someday we never know what we may learn from others have a super blessed day and pray for this person Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Predestination Phaedo Social rule Goodness and value theory Epistemology Plame affair Piccolo Junior Saga God Emperor of Dune Sin City Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism New York Giants Contract Jon Secada Jumpstart 3rd Grade Current teachings of Prem Rawat Evil Free will Blood on the Tracks Nicomachean Ethics One Tree Hill (TV series) Highway 61 Revisited Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philosophical skepticism Angels in America Muslim ibn Aqeel Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories EastEnders Philosophy of language Poker jargon Sampling (music) Jacob Password The Smoking Room CPU cache Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina True Crime: Streets of LA Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis Friends Avenue Q Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The nature of God in Western theology Shen Gong Wu The Ashlee Simpson Show Sheepshead StarCraft Episode VI Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.
