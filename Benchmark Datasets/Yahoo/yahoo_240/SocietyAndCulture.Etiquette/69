how do you tell the difference between an awkward silence and a comfortable one well it's kind of hard to explain i guess it depends on the situation you are in when there is an awkward silence i feel strange do you ever have guests over and they sit with everybody just talking well sometimes there is nothing to talk about and everything goes quiet it always feels awkward to me i can't really explain what comfortable silences are like i guess it's just when everything is silent and it feels good to be quiet for a while or maybe everybody is doing there own little thing or in their own little world that nobody talks 'cause they get so caught up into things sometimes you just feel ok and don't notice the silence when i am in comfortable silences i am doing something or just sitting and it feels good not awkward or strange when i am in awkward silences everybody is doing nothing and it's all quiet and you really notice it that it feels weird sorry if my info didn't help i don't explain things very well but if i did help i am glad i could help good luck finding a good answer Social rule The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The nature of God in Western theology Milton H.
