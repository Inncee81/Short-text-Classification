my co worker is in love with this guy but he's in love with me everyday at work she talks all dreamy about this guy he's a patient at the doctors office i work for she has already told him that she likes him and keeps asking him to take her out he's polite to her but he won't let her take him out and constantly calls the office asking for me whenever she aswers the line he disguises his voice i am married but he won't respect this and still tries to get me to go on a date with him meanwhile she's asking my advice on what to do to get him to date her i feel bad for her because she's been through so much in her life and i feel that telling her this news could push her over the edge what can i do this guy has had flowers sent to me with a false name he sends me cards almost every week to the job he won't give up this guy has had flowers sent to me with a false name he told me later that he sent them he sends me cards almost every week to the job he won't give up conceited did you read the question i have no interest in this guy and i never pay him any attention i am married and i love my husband i wish he would leave me the heck alone frankly is there anyone out there willing to answer my question without sarcasm understand i do not flirt with him when he comes to the office i make myself disappear and then he calls asking why he's like a friggin stalker i am married and happily i don't care if i never see that guy again in life don't you get it it's very considerate of you to think of how this would affect your co worker while trying to deal with this guy i think you're right there's no need for her to know why not try to point out another guy that might actually be interested in her or better yet take her to happy hour after work one day hope she meets someone else to obsess over as far as this guy unfortunately you might have to be a little more blunt with him i understand trying to be polite and not wanting to hurt someone's feeling when letting them know your not interested but he is being very disrespectful to you he knows your married ok i understand if he couldn't help himself asked you out once to give it a shot but once you said no that should've been the end of it you may have to just confront him and tell him it's not ok make it clear your not interested at all if it doesn't stop after your talk with him you might have to talk to your boss you don't have to put up with this at work just because he's a patient he has no right to harass the staff Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Social rule The Smoking Room The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Survivor (novel) Phoebe Halliwell Milton H.
