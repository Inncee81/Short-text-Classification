how would you feel if everyone in your office forgot your birthday well that basically happened to me and i'm kinda sad about it o last year i didnt mention anything because that's not exactly a proper thing to do but when i told them a few days after it they said why didnt you tell us we would have taken you out for lunch so this year i told them ahead of time but in a discreet way ya know and yet still they somehow forgot and didnt realize what i was saying they didnt even tell me happy birthday i turned last sunday the th there were other august birthdays so far in our suite and their bosses did cake lunch for them but i got nothin' o i feel soo unloved it's a total bummer that no one remembered my birthday o the last job i had i probably wouldn't care and would have expected it from most people because i worked with a bunch of self important a holes in your situation i probably would have been a little upset especially if i'd made an effort to contribute to other people's birthday celebrations and made an effort to wish them a happy birthday it's probably a bit of butthead move but in the future don't bother with other people when it's their birthday if they can't be bothered with you then why make the effort with them i know it sounds a bit petty but that's the way office politics work so long as you celebrated and had a good time with the people that actually matter to you then who cares right Social rule Friends Pok__mon Live!
