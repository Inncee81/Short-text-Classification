gmail problem w chatting yeah i know i'm asking this on my yahoo account anyway the first time i chatted i was able to have smileys but now everytime i chat all it says is pop out how can i get it back to the way it first was when you type the smilies it should automatically rotate for example if you do it should animate itself turn right side up and change into a smiling person the pop out button is just so you can have the chat as its own separate window Emoticon Gmail MSN Messenger Internet Relay Chat Opera (web browser) Google Talk Danger Hiptop Smiley Smiley Smile Mouse (computing) Prank flash PHP Internet slang Google Desktop Miranda IM GameFAQs SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Windows XP Hotmail Wild Honey Manual transmission Hall & Oates Chobits Gramophone record E-mail Webmail Visual Basic AOL Instant Messenger Diablo II Microsoft Windows BZFlag Glossary of ballet terms Comparison of instant messengers Yahoo!
