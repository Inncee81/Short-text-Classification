new runner with a sore hip hey i've recently started running about two months back because i figured i should be doing more exercise and i thought it'd be a fun hobby i really enjoy it and am thinking of running km and km fun runs at some point i'm not fast at all but i'm working on it i currently run something like a minute km anyway i've been having some issues with my right hip it tends to get sore if i run for a while improves if i stay away from running for a while and worsens if i run more partly i think this may be the inconsistency with which i run but there's probably some things i'm missing i'll concede it might be my shoes i've reverted to an old pair cause the others would give me bad blisters and they weren't really meant for running can anyone recommend any good stretches advice i know i'm probably just going to have to cross train for a while until i can afford new shoes ps i warm up for minutes stretch run warm down and stretch again consiste k in minutes is pretty respectable i race about once a month though mostly k and h m and i've seen plenty of k competitors finishing well beyond minutes yep shoes are important have a look at the link below if you're wearing the wrong type of shoes that could be the cause of your problem if you're running a circular route try reversing it the fact that the pain is only on the right side could be due to the camber of the surface the slope that stops rainwater collecting i put a second link from the runners world site which is about runners hips which might help but if not there is a load of other medical sports injury articles on their site Marathon (sport) Equine conformation Weight training Iliotibial band syndrome Mattress Softball Massage 1957 World Series Triathlon Drag racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Climbing equipment Diving Fast bowling High-heeled shoe Denis Law Norway national football team The Amazing Race Shaggy dog story Andr__s Galarraga Exercise Boxing Domestic rabbit 2005 Iditarod Pointe shoes Ben Johnson (athlete) Iditarod First aid New York Giants Repetitive strain injury Swimming Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tour de France Extreme Programming Car handling Homestar Runner Avalanche Swingout Theory of conduct Babe Ruth Chicago White Sox Corset Poker jargon Professional wrestling holds Hiking Whose Line Is It Anyway?
