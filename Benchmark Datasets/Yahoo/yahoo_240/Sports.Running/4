what is the life of my running shoes i bought shoes late april and run around miles a week when should i replace them i generally replace my shoes after to miles usually by that time they start to fell flat i e the cushioning doesn't seem as good anymore most shoes today are so well made the uppers still look great after miles but the shoes really aren't protecting your joints well anymore it's fine to wear them for walking around just don't run in them anymore note the above assumes that the shoes are only used for running and not used for other sports or wore during the day for other purposes if not the shoes can be useless for running after a month in addition for low mileage runners i recommend replacing shoes after months of use regardless of mileage some shoes wear unevenly at the heals if you wear completely through the outer black sole it's also time to replace the shoes Shoe Marathon (sport) Tire Equine conformation High-heeled shoe 1957 World Series Stress fracture Horseshoe The Computer Wore Menace Shoes E85 Triathlon Upholstery Disc brake Barefoot Freddy Fender Carburetor Cliff Richard Running Softball Baseball Billboard Hot 100 Diving Athletic shoe Auto insurance Glossary of climbing terms Reebok Foot Shadow the Hedgehog Iliotibial band syndrome The Beatles discography Blackjack Stairway Social rule Climbing equipment Saint Nicholas Paul Is Dead Interstate Highway Sprint (race) John McDouall Stuart Adidas Trail running Nike, Inc.
