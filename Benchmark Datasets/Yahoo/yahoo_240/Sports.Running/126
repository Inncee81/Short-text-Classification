sprained ankle yesterday while running in the woods i rolled my ankle on a root i landed on the outside of the ankle and it hurt for about a minute and then my coach camp counselor who was with me told me it was best to keep running in order to keep the blood circulating after hobbling for a few steps i regained a semi normal stride and finished the mile run at a fast pace i iced somewhat and elevated but i had a six hour van ride later that day and mostly my ankle was kept still not really taken care of today i have a day off from running but this morning i woke up with extremely limited range of motion in my ankle i have to walk with my foot turned outward in order to be able to move at all it is as if my achilles tendon is also affected even though only the outer ankle is swollen it is as if my achilles will not bend fully in order to let me walk normally what the heck is wrong with my ankle and when will it get better should i ice it or heat it i think you were given some terrible advice to keep going in june i was at the gym at an outdoor fitness class and i rolled my ankle on a pebble i rolled it on the inside and the outside i sat down immediately and they went and got some ice i went straight to urgent care and it turned out i had partially torn ligaments they put my foot in an immobilizer for weeks and then i stepped down to a small brace as i need it now when i go to the gym or riding bikes with my kids etc the one thing that the dr told me is that when i rolled my ankle the worst thing i could have done is to keep going your body has been injured and it sends you signals pain inflammation and swelling you should have stayed off of it and immediately iced it you need to go see an orthopedic specialist as soon as you can and no more running until you do i hope you didn't make it worse by running on an injured foot do not heat it heat makes inflammation worse not better icing it every min to an hour and staying off of it will help also taking ibuprofen advil mg twice a day will help with the swelling and the pain i still have trouble walking flat footed without my brace and it has been weeks going down stairs is very hard it takes time and lots of taking care of it if you ever want to be able to have the physical ability you had prior to your injury today if i were you i would find an urgent care center and go see a dr then make an appt with a specialist on monday Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Osteoarthritis Carpal tunnel syndrome Aerial (dance move) Pain Iliotibial band syndrome Weight training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
