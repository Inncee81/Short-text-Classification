i went for a run yesterday for the first time in a while and today my thigh aches a bit should i run again thighs are not aching really bad but not sure whether to rest or run i want to be able to start running everyday eventually should i just go for it or rest my legs for a day how much aching is too much aching or does that not exist for joggers i e just jog it off i think you should keep running when you are out of shape when you start running you pull these tiny muscles it will hurt for awhile while these muscles are pulled new ones form you will pull these too but while this is happening your muscles are getting stronger so i recommend running still and drinking lots of water good luck Running Weight training Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Biped Diving Triathlon Breaststroke Social rule Aerial (dance move) Horse Marathon (sport) Fecal incontinence Mr. Olympia Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling holds Muscle Tyrannosaurus rex Black widow spider Backstroke Urinary incontinence Witches (Discworld) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Trumpet Luck Breech birth Front crawl Pitaten Pittsburgh Steelers Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Glossary of ballet terms Tide Puberty Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fast bowling Post Polio syndrome Professional wrestling attacks Double bass American lobster Anatomical terms of location Paget's disease of bone Embouchure Piccolo Junior Saga Babe Ruth Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Drill bit Brian Close Legionellosis Norway national football team Theory of conduct Osteoporosis Teen Girl Squad Chris Amon Jean Schmidt First aid Vegeta Dog Bodybuilding Soleus muscle Cardiac pacemaker Powerbomb Cricket Pain Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Iliotibial band syndrome Cramp Dieting Jam (TV series) Wood carving Restless legs syndrome Dundas Square DDT (professional wrestling) Swimming Ham Hiberno-English Autonomic nervous system Poliomyelitis Carburetor Torquay United F.C.
