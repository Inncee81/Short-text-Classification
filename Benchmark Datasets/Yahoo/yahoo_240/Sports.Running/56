what should i do to minimize soreness i'm ' over the last month or so i've begun working out running about times a week plus some crunches and dumbells at home i've dropped about lbs over that time and have feel pretty good sunday i had a triple header softball game and here i am two days later i'm still extremely soar specifically in my upper legs i realize that i wont usually be playing games in a row or exercising to this extent often but are there specific excercises i could be doing to help prevent this also is it wise to excercise run when you are soar like this or should i wait it out before running again my friend it may not sound like this makes sense but it works for me whenver i am sore especially in my legs running is usually a cure well more like a fast jog and for a short distance enough to get the blood pumping through your legs it helps the soreness becuase it brings oxygenated blood back to the muscle sitting round makes it worse because it doesn't get the oxygenated blood as fast a very good exercise to combat fatigue in your thighs i forget the name you take weights in both hands preferably something around hold them straight to your sides then take a step forward and bed at the knee till the opposite knee touches or comes close to the floor then slowly come back to a standing position and repeat with other leg if your legs feel like they are going to fall off afterwards you are doing it right after a week or two of these you will see a very big improvement in strength and endurance good luck Equine conformation Weight training Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Swingout Softball Horizontal bar Professional wrestling attacks Fast bowling Parade (military) Powerbomb Iliotibial band syndrome Glossary of ballet terms Skateboarding trick Running Breaststroke Dog training Mixed martial arts Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling aerial techniques Poker jargon Swimming Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury Repetitive strain injury Baseball Diving Chair Sport rowing Backstroke Chronic fatigue syndrome Casualty lifting Glossary of climbing terms Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Umpire (cricket) Deadlift Neckbreaker Double bass Batting (cricket) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Muscle Fecal incontinence Suplex New York Giants Rugby union positions Prostate cancer Piledriver (professional wrestling) Tetrapod Dialysis Radiation therapy Andr__s Galarraga Marching band Knee Atherosclerosis Team Fortress Classic Strap-on dildo Mattress Stomach cancer Dairy Horse Fencing Norway national football team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 1957 World Series Horse gait Glossary of American football Side pass (dance move) Characters of Naruto GunZ The Duel Diabetes mellitus Massage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Piccolo Junior Saga Mr. Olympia Knife Butterfly stroke Textile manufacturing 24 Hours of Le Mans Babe Ruth Sniper Archery Water polo Kodocha Bodyline Triathlon Charleston (dance move) Squat (exercise) Marathon (sport)
