for everyone who has done cross country and track which one did you like better i do both and i definatly like cross country alot better first of all im more of a long distance runner and at my school track only goes up to mile and i didnt like track because during meets you have to sit out side all day to wait for your event at the middle school championships for track i did events the maximum at my school and the meet lasted hours and it was in may and im in florida so it was really hot and cross country i like better for one the races are longer and thier is only one race thats about miles and you get the run in grass up hills and through mud and everything and its alot more fun in my opinion i like it much better but it all depends some people like sprints and the field events better and some people like just running and thats what i like i dont like having to run more than one race because ill give it everything i have on one race and then ill be burned out for the next race Athletics Sprint (race) Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Cross country running Marathon (sport) Auto racing Paula Radcliffe Long-distance track event Cricket Indianapolis 500 Fell running Baseball Triathlon Drag racing Belmont Park Ben Johnson (athlete) Hurdling Sport rowing Iditarod Tony Stewart Adventure racing Softball Cross-country skiing Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Billy Mills Dog agility Peachtree Road Race Interstate Highway Haile Gebrselassie Watkins Glen International 2005 United States Grand Prix Steeplechase U.S. Highway 1 Elvan Abeylegesse Belgian Grand Prix Zola Budd Dirt track racing Olympic Flame Cyclo-cross Fanny Blankers-Koen Tour de France Dogsled racing Carl Lewis Nordic skiing World Championships Horse racing N__rburgring Alan Webb Swimming Hillclimbing Inline speed skating Track cycling Road running V8 Supercar Running Breeders' Cup Debate Tag Stairway Florida State University Badwater Ultramarathon Canoe racing Kokoda Track James E.
