has anyone had any bad experiences with the migraine drug maxalt i was prescribed this yesterday and did a little research on the side effects some include cardiovascular effects which sound scary i was just wondering if anyone has had these effects to compare with the clinical study and if so the severity and frequency i have been on maxalt for yrs for migranes and i have not had any side effects at times it felt like i could not live without it i guess you will just need to weigh the benefits to the potential and rare risks good luck Migraine COX-2 inhibitor Haloperidol Chlorpromazine Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rofecoxib Tocopherol Clomipramine Lamotrigine Prostate cancer Propranolol Chronic fatigue syndrome Paroxetine Tianeptine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bupropion Maprotiline Cardiovascular disease Growth hormone treatment Meditation Bipolar disorder Cancer Diazepam Omega-3 fatty acid Antidepressant Stroke Hormone replacement therapy Clinical depression Pharmaceutical company Cannabis (drug) Atherosclerosis Duesberg hypothesis Psoriasis Clozapine Stomach cancer Folic acid Growth hormone deficiency Clinical trial Medical cannabis Trazodone Malaria Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Electroconvulsive therapy Psychosis Addiction Topiramate Androgen insensitivity syndrome Multiple sclerosis Adverse effect (medicine) Ibuprofen Medicine Growth hormone Aspartame Psychopharmacology Schizophrenia Herpes simplex virus Atrial septal defect Methamphetamine St John's wort Common cold Orgasm Anorexia nervosa Doxepin Isotretinoin Obesity Alzheimer's disease Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Epidural Tobacco smoking Word of Wisdom Local anesthetic Antipsychotic Psychology Low density lipoprotein Medical analysis of circumcision Acute respiratory distress syndrome Raw food diet Neurofeedback Fibromyalgia Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cocaine Coronary heart disease Glucocorticoid HIV vaccine Atkins Nutritional Approach Paracetamol Trimipramine Antiretroviral drug Homeopathy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Statin Venlafaxine Ulcerative colitis Hypoglycemia Simvastatin Turner syndrome Cluster headache Epilepsy Oral contraceptive
