i am having severe upper back pain i was just wondering what are good treatments for this type of pain i am a yr old female around lbs ' the pain seems to be the worst in the evenings as i lay down it is so intense for the first min if i have my husband massage it with pain relieving gel the pain sometimes radiates to my ribs i am pretty sure i don't have a heart problem i have had two children just fine w o any complications regular births w epidurial for the pain i just want something more effective then taking ibuprofen all of the time and having pain cream on my back i need something more permanent to help the pain it gets so bad that i feel dizzy almost if i don't lay down also whats the best position to sleep in for this pain thank you anything will help since you say this happens mostly in the evenings i would guess this is muscular what i don't know is it like a pencil being driven through your back rib out of place go to a chiropractor or across your bra line probably related to posture issues maybe sitting at a computer or lifting children muscular seek a good massage therapist there really is no good way to sleep with this since you probably can't breathe too deeply or comfortably but flat on your back would be best Massage Childbirth Repetitive strain injury Equine conformation Reflexology Fecal incontinence Back pain Carpal tunnel syndrome Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Psoriasis Asthma Milton H.
