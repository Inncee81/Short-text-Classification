weird pains lying in bed when im lying in bed i have pains in my chest and heart and i feel really anxious for some reason why is that ' im male and a heavy cannabis smoker im also depressed because of hoodie being after me and terrorizing me and me not being able to do anything go out fight back ect and im really paranoid this pain you are suffering in your chest and heart is possibly a physical condition brought on as a result of your anxiety problem you are more than likely suffering from panic anxiety attacks as i can't see any other possible physical condition that may bring this up this is pain brought on by your own body's fight or flight reflex or the release of epinephrine adrenaline in your system because of the fact that your brain is overworking too much by constantly thinking of stressful events i recommend that you go see a doctor and be sure to inform him that you are suffering panic attacks he will more than likely prescribe a light dose of a benzodiazepine probably lorazepam which will help slow down the firing of your brain cells or 'calming' your brain good luck Clinical depression Anxiety Panic attack Cannabis (drug) Traumatic brain injury Stress (medicine) Diazepam Myocardial infarction Psychosis Clomipramine Multiple sclerosis Tobacco smoking Chronic fatigue syndrome Drug addiction Addiction Meditation Doxepin Bipolar disorder Breastfeeding Stroke Cocaine Parkinson's disease Lorazepam Urinary incontinence Methamphetamine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Epinephrine Hypoglycemia Transsexuality Pain Alcoholism Out-of-body experience Anorexia nervosa Maprotiline Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Opioid Sleep Drowning Psoriasis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Spanking Haloperidol Antipsychotic Balance disorder Medicine Psychiatry Hypnosis Fibromyalgia Post-traumatic stress disorder Cancer Multiple chemical sensitivity Omega-3 fatty acid Childbirth Charles Darwin's illness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Schizophrenia Propranolol Lung cancer Health issues and the effects of cannabis Migraine Alexander Technique DSM-IV Codes Drug abuse Medical cannabis Alprazolam Angina Muscle Atherosclerosis Aspartame Tai Chi Chuan Prostate cancer Psychopharmacology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Nicotine Borderline personality disorder Human adaptation to space Pneumonia Brain Weight training Post Polio syndrome Baldness Agoraphobia Philipp Melanchthon Topiramate Francis Crick Electroconvulsive therapy Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Cordelia Chase Bupropion Trimipramine Folic acid
