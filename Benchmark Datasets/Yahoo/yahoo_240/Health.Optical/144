is it true that wearing glasses will make your eyes smaller i started to wear glasses near sighted and my mom told me that wearing glasses all the time will make my eyes go in and shrink up like its dried or something is that true wearing glasses won't make your eyes smaller but i don't recommend you to wear it the whole time because u would rely on it and you couldn't do anything if u don't have ur glass and u look weird when you don't have them on i no i wear my glass for about ten years the whole time and my eyes changed now that my eye seem to be pop out a little more than usually so i change to contacts wearing glasses too long would make your eyes look like the gold fish's eyes so i suggest you wear them when you need them like doing your homework etc but don't wear it on regular bases when i was little i put it on the whole time but i regret it now Sunglasses Glasses "Weird Al" Yankovic Contact lens Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Stereoscopy Paul Is Dead The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Parallax RuneScape quests Jon Secada YuYu Hakusho Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Shen Gong Wu Happy Tree Friends Whose Line Is It Anyway?
