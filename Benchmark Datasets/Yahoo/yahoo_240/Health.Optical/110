what will happen at my contact lense consultation hi i'm and just over the last year my eye sight has worsened a little a couple of months ago i went for a eye test and the opition said i was slightly short sighted and that i needed glasses i bought a pair then and there she gave me lenses that were the weakest strenght so my eyes could get use to my new sight and told me to wear them for a month or two then on my next opintment she'd give me the strenght that i needed in glasses or contacts i've decided to go for contact lenses as i really don't like glasses and have booked an opintment for monday can someone please tell me exactly what will happen at my appointment i get quite nervous in optitions dentists or anything like that so i'd like to know what the opition will do thanks in advance to everybody that answers i went through exactly the same thing has she told you whether you're having hard or soft lenses i don't know if it's still standard but my optician started me off on hard because there's less chance of infection and they give slightly sharper vision anyway if she has your eye curvature already you'll be able to have a quick go at wearing contacts when i went she put them in for me first time which feels very weird just try to relax into it if they're hard contacts you may not be able to open your eyes fully for a while while your eye gets used to the contact your eyes might water quite a bit and your vision will not be anything near as good as when you get used to them so don't worry i had soft contacts later on and they feel soooo comfy its unbelievable i don't know whether it was cos i'd had hard lenses before but i didn't feel them in first time at all she will then test your sight in them and maybe check the fit by looking through some equipment at them i then got given a routine building up wear over the next few weeks and to practice putting them in Contact lens Glasses Intraocular lens Eye Social rule Eyeglass prescription Sunglasses Parallax Keratoconus Stereoscopy Eyepiece Presbyopia Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Apollo 8 Shaggy dog story Strap-on dildo Lens (optics) Movie projector Equine conformation Eye contact RuneScape quests God Emperor of Dune Myopia Binoculars Tai Chi Chuan Stuttering Tenshinhan EastEnders The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines LASIK Aberration in optical systems Gamma ray burst Diabetic retinopathy The Smoking Room Prostate cancer Tire The Lovely Bones Ultraviolet 2000 Australian Grand Prix History of telescopes Piccolo Junior Saga View camera Extreme Programming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Nystagmus Sharon Tate The Contender (television series) Haven (TNG episode) Ocean's Twelve The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Brian Close Bicycle lighting Blood on the Tracks Syphon Filter M16 (rifle) About a Boy Jennifer Lopez Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Airsoft Dentistry Frogman Photographic lens Lensman Manual transmission Slow Train Coming Humphrey Bogart Nuclear weapon design Totally Spies!
