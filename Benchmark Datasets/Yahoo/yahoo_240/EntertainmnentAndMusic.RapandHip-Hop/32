response to jena question from benevolence i find it funny how one day people are like quit blaming the white man for our struggles this is not the 's and 's read this one first http answers yahoo com question index ylt aktxujubdemsao oa v jty ix qid aatzfmc show profile info ast hy aa and then the next day those same people are like it's a shame racism still exists today in this is proof right here this som bull etc etc now read this http answers yahoo com question index ylt arzwowvzdq t leuxqn lsy ix qid aa r nj yes racism has not gone no where it is still here today just cause it's don't mean a damn thing it's just not as blatant as it used to be but black people are struggiing everyday to come up a few years ago they did some study in chicago i believe where resumes with black sounding names were not even considered i can't stand to hear people especially black people try and cover it up and say it doesn't exist duh of course they are separate issues but are they inter related hell yeah no the jena issue is just one of many prime examples and that was my point just because it's don't mean s hit it don't have to be the 's or the 's for there to be racial discrimmination no we should not blame the man for our problems and even if there are some folks in the black community that still blames the man you can rest assure their complaints are not being answered so that's irrelevant altogether and most blacks do not blame whitey for everything there are hardworking blacks who have gone to school who do not have police records and who are good parents but still can't come up due to institutional racism in and less opportunities to advance such as being locked up and put on trial for nonsense while whitey can do the same exact thing and nothing happens to him my point is it doesn't have to be the 's or the 's to still feel the affects i just think it's hypocritical to strug off such questions about racism and automatically generalize a whole group of people by assuming they always blame the white man than the next day have sympathy to those who got a raw deal america is fuked up face it no we can't depend on the white man to save us but we certainly can't lay back an pretend that we all live in utopia and this society is color blind when it comes to hiring practices judicial decisions college acceptance and that everything is separate but equal because it is not i dare you to walk up to any elementary school in east baltimore and tell me that that is an acceptable learning environment for a child you'd get eaten by the roaches before you step foot off of campus oh but it's not the 's and 's anymore we can't continue to blame the white man for our stuggles bulls hit yes i do blame him and i keep it real i'm not afraid to say it crankdatfred it's not about manning up who said anyone wasn't manning up it's about being fair to begin with we shouldn't have to man up and become some bionic force to get treated fairly hnic i'm not on here to gain points i am yrs old this is not a freakin game to me unlike some people i have a life outside of y as i don't need to spend endless hours sitting in front of a computer trying to win you act like you're trying to win a house or something c j you're so young dumb and immature it's pathetic oh and good answer about someone is trying to imitate my avatar yeah right you are pathetic thanks to the last answerers now we have some educated folks who actually know what their talking about wow i see this got a little heated i guess i missed all the fun as wicked as this debate seems to have gotten it does appear that everyone is on the same page but there are probably some personal issues involved causing the separation of ideas ok seriously i actually do understand where you are coming from to a certain extent perhaps out of frusteration your point may not be conveyed in the best way is racism still alive and well in modern america yes it is present in every sector of the american society you are correct it is just not as blatant as far as blaming the man i'm going to have to disagree with most of the other responders for the most again most part i don't think black people walk around saying it's because of him that i can't get a job or it's because of him that i have to sell crack to survive you may get some nutcase or neighborhood gangbanger or even some comedian on bet who might blurt some nonsense out every now and then but i don't believe this is the majority however there are legitimate cases like jena for example where we need to blame him the key to understanding how institutional racism works is through education and research a person that is not from the ghetto couldn't possibly imagine what the mentality is like and how children are forced to live on a daily basis i want to emphasize children because that's really where the cycle starts we children are all products of our environment and unfortunately here in america poverty schools and children are not a top priority and i know this is going to come out very blunt but the darker your community is you will be even lower on the totem pole it's an ugly thought i know but nontheless very true remember katrina yes your description of the baltimore schools are very real and i have to disagree with you c j education is vital and having a proper learning environment should be default the problems with these schools are much bigger than the roaches teachers who have a college education make minimal and can't afford to fix problems like this how do you expect low income families to rectify this i live in the bay area and you should see how the schools look in east oakland then ride accross town to danville white side and those schools look like state of the art museums in comparison that's not by coincidence dear i urge anyone to read a book called amazing grace by jonathan kozol i read it in college in and couldn't put the book down here is just one excerpt from his book and i'll share the link below almost anyone who visits in the schools of east st louis even for a short time comes away profoundly shaken these are innocent children after all they have done nothing wrong they have committed no crime they are too young to have offended us in any way at all one searches for some way to understand why a society as rich and frequently as generous as ours would leave these children in their penury and squalor for so long and with so little public indignation is this just a strange mistake of history is it unusual is it an american anomaly even if the destitution and the racial segregation and the toxic dangers of the air and soil cannot be immediately addressed why is it that we can't at least pour vast amounts of money ingenuity and talent into public education for these children bottom line should we depend on the man for anything that will benefit blacks of course not but i think we do need to hold him accountable for a lot of things that have assisted the black community in it's demise perhaps people who live in inner cities aren't educated enough to properly communicate this except by saying it's because of the white man ever think of that all i ask is that people don't judge and remain compassionate to our struggles people need to do the research and understand that it's not always about
