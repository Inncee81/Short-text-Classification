average life of semen sperm i've heard days maybe days but i've heard days what's the average life if sperm in the vagina like there is no egg so say you had sex on monday and she ovulated on friday no sperm no baby and days seems kinda long i've always heard would that fertile fluid be around about days before the time of ovulation okay here's the deal the vagina is normally not a sperm friendly environment vaginal conditions are designed to keep out bacteria and for all intents and purposes sperm is seen as an invader because of this sperm actually only lives for matter of hours under these conditions most sperm die off within a few hours some may last a bit longer however when a woman is entering her fertile phase the conditions in her vagina change she begins to produce fertile cervical fluid or mucous this particular cervical mucous is very sperm friendly creating an environment that allows sperm to thrive not only does fertile cm allow sperm to live longer but it helps it to swim better with fertile cervical mucous sperm can now live anywhere from days in the female reproductive tract the long and short of it is how long sperm lives depends on where the female is at in her cycle but sperm never lives days or more under any conditions hope this helps good luck Menstrual cycle Birth control Semen In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Sexual intercourse Vagina Puberty Infertility Female reproductive system (human) Oral sex Gonorrhoea Pregnancy Orgasm Fertilisation Cervix Menstrual cup Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Male reproductive system (human) Spider Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovary Intersexuality Niddah Parthenogenesis Earthworm Epididymis Cervical cancer Coitus interruptus Old wives' tale Human sexual response cycle Urinary incontinence Human sexual behavior Safe sex Gynaecology Estrus cycle Miscarriage Sex Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Condom Vaginal lubrication Penis Moss Douche Endometrium Abortion debate Sex assignment Alternation of generations Gamete Tampon Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bird Sex organ Breastfeeding Cervical cap Soil life Vulvovaginal health Sterilization (surgical procedure) Artificial insemination Progesterone Shark Ploidy Diaphragm (contraceptive) AIDS Sexual differentiation Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Group sex Lactobacillus acidophilus Cannabis sativa Sewage treatment Bee Swimming Chimera (genetics) Testicle Hermaphrodite Grasshopper American lobster Human Cat Intersex surgery Ejaculation Ovum Intact dilation and extraction Species Sperm Whale Estradiol Marine biology Anal sex Homosexuality and medical science Hebrew calendar
