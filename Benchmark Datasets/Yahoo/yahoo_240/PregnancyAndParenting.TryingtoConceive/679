a question about pregnancy and ivf my girlfriend and i are trying for a baby but we don't want to take any chances we feel that ivf would offer us the greatest opportunity to get pregnant rather than simply leaving it to chance has anyone had any experiences of ivf i would have thought that it's not available on the nhs but how much does it cost what's involved what are chances of a multiple birth sorry i realise i am very naive on the subject but i would really appreciate your advice thanks i have had ivf icsi cycles and iui treatments and i can tell you it is not an easy option ivf does not offer you any more opportunity to get pregnant in fact it offers at best the same chance as a natural cycle and often the chances of achieving a pregnancy are less the chance of getting pregnant during a natural cycle is approx whereas some ivf treatments only offer a to success rate if there is no medical reason for you and your gf to not be successful in achieving a natural pregnancy then i would urge you not to consider ivf and to keep trying i am one of the fortunate ones in that fertility treatment worked for me and i have a fabulous month old daughter however the emotional cost was huge my life was totally different to now i had no confidence i was miserable all of the time but trying to put on a brave face i lost friends due to my depressed state of mind this nearly cost me my marriage too i put weight on because of the drugs i couldn't face going to certain family events i had no hope at all and i could go on and on about how awful it was even now when i think back to that time in my life i could cry but to answer your questions ivf treatment is very intrusive indeed you sniff drugs for approximately weeks to down regulate you menstrual cycle this means the doctors have control over your cycle during this time you go to the clinic for regular internal scans and blood tests to see how you are responding to the drugs when your body is ready you need to inject drugs to make the ovaries produce more than follicle the sac that holds an egg again you are scanned regularly to see how things are going if you poduce too many follicles it can lead to a condition called ohss which is life threatening when the follicles are the correct size you have to inject a different drug which matures the eggs ready to ovulate hours after this injection the eggs are collected by the clinic you are awake during egg collection but drugged so you don't feel much the doctor uses an ultra sound probe and a needle to aspirate each follicle in the ovaries to find if there is an egg inside the eggs and sperm are left overnight to do the business the next day you have to phone the clinic to see how many if any have fertilised the next day you attend clinic again to have the embryos inserted this is a painless procedure which can be lovely as some clinics will show you the embryos on screen usually only embryos are inserted the next part of the treatment is the worst really you wait for almost weeks analysing every twinge ache and mood durinf this time you support your body into believing it is pregnant by inserting vaginal pessaries daily after the wait you attend clinic for a blood test to see if you have been successful each stage feels like a hurdle you need to overcome and the nurse assigned to me told me to think of treatment in stages if i down regged i could inject if i produced follicles i could have eggs collected if there were eggs they could be put with the sperm if they eggs fertilised then they would put them in me everything was if and the treatment could have quite easily have failed at any hurdle i had cycle abandoned which was horrendous there is a high chance of multiple births as embryos are put back and each one could possibly split in two to make twins at my first scan when i was pregnant was at weeks there were sacs but only one with a heart beat costs range depending on the type of treatment you need but an ivf cycle is about most people with fertility porblems can have at least cycle on the nhs we were lucky and had but it depends on where you live any way if you have got to the end of this post well done
