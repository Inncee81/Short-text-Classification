i started clomid last month of course i didn't get a period yet and i took a few pregnancy tests and they was negative so i started the clomid again days ago now i'm startin to bleed a little bit and it looks like its gonna be my period i haven't had a period in months since this was my rd day of clomid i was just wondering do i need to wait and redo it or what doctor's offices are closed and i am gettin a lil worried i just want opinions no smart answers plz generally you don't take clomid unless you have already started your period if you take it before your period starts it won't help you ovulate for future reference if you are supposed to start clomid and your period hasn't started you need to wait until it does or get your doctor to prescribe you provera to make it start i would stop using the clomid and call your doctor when he gets back into the office let him know what happened and see what he suggests doing Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Milton H.
