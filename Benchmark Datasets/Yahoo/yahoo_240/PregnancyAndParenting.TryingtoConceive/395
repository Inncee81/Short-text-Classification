severe implantation pain i have undergone ivf's and fet all very difficult cycles with much pain and complications pg's resulted m c each successful cycle i was awoken from sleep with incredibly severe cramping and pain days after retrieval which is correct for implantation it lasts several hours and is so severe i cannot speak move or gain comfort and vomiting at times i have searched for information regarding other women who experience this level of pain during implantation but found none most don't feel a thing nor can any dr help with any answers i have always correctly known which cycle was successful and which was not i have suffered severe endometriosis pco since teens undewent surgeries incl laparotomies i am wondering if anyone out there knows of anyone who has experienced this level of pain during implantation could it perhaps just be due to how sensitive my body is and the pain level i usually endure due to the endo my pg was also vey difficult i have never heard of anyone else having that sort of pain during implantation but i have a strong feeling it is related to your endo it seems that for those women with endo the uterine lining overreacts to a lot of different stimuli so the pain and cramping could definitely be related to the disease it seems like your lining is really sensitive even to the relatively small amount of hcg an early embryo produces i am also guessing it plays a role in your recurrent miscarriages as cramping and clotting can result in early losses i post on a support group called fertile thoughts and it is a great resource this is the link to the endo board http www fertilethoughts com forums forumdisplay php f maybe one of the threads will have an answer for you or if not you can repost this question there Endometriosis Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Ectopic pregnancy Childbirth Infertility Obstetrics Stomach cancer Clinical depression In vitro fertilisation Scientology beliefs and practices Ovarian cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion debate Stroke Oral contraceptive Abortion Grief Urinary incontinence Adjustable gastric band Epilepsy Breastfeeding Apollo 8 Bipolar disorder Migraine Dysmenorrhea Crohn's disease Acupuncture Endometrium Diabetes mellitus LSD Hip fracture Pain Cancer Hypoglycemia Twin Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Weight training Sleep Human cloning Breast implant Autism Psychosis Addiction Charles Darwin's illness Sexual intercourse Obesity Emergency contraception Cluster headache Endometrial cancer Anorexia nervosa Birth control Hypnosis Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hysterectomy Dialysis Insulin Rocky Mountain spotted fever Penis enlargement Progesterone Intersex surgery Adverse effect (medicine) Post-traumatic stress disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fertility awareness Ovulation Atkins Nutritional Approach Breast cancer Myocardial infarction Ulcerative colitis Artificial consciousness Traumatic incident reduction Human Cryptorchidism Lung cancer Dehydration Asperger syndrome Embryo transfer Bowel obstruction Fecal incontinence Internet troll Gastroesophageal reflux disease Human sexual behavior Aortic dissection PHP Carpal tunnel syndrome
