if you have egg white cm does mean you are definately ovulating i am just wondering can someone have the egg white like cervical mucus for about days and never be actually releasing an egg ovulating if you weren't ovulating would you not see the egg white cm basically can you have an anovulatory cycle and still see the egg white cm yes you can get ewcm and not actually ovulate alot of women have seen one or two good long patches or ewcm without actually making ovulation sometimes especially if you are under stress like that of ttc for instance you can actually stop ovulation from happening normally your body will retry again but it's still possible that even after the next attempt it doesn't pull off ovulation if you are cahrting your bbt basal body temp you should be able to know without a doubt if you have ovulated because your temps will rise pretty significantly however you still need to chart your cm because by the time your temps rise the egg is long gone just assume that all patches of ewcm are fertile until you have the temp rise to know you've passed your window of fertility for the month Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Emergency contraception Infertility Flowering plant Pregnancy Puberty Progesterone Birth control Oral contraceptive Estrus cycle Temperature In vitro fertilisation Conifer cones Ovum Carpel Sexual reproduction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Kodocha Anovulation Cervix Glossary of partner dance terms Endometrium Female reproductive system (human) Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Niddah Stem cell Eggerland series Fruit Non-human animal sexuality The Star Wars Holiday Special Ovarian cyst Chicken Estradiol Tide Miscarriage Flower Human chorionic gonadotropin Egg (biology) Premenstrual stress syndrome Multiple birth Spider Toronto Transit Commission Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Tobacco Autonomic nervous system Species Sonic the Hedgehog Human cloning Electrophysiology Tsetse fly Shark Twin Dragons (Pern) Egg white Fertilisation Schistosomiasis Human papillomavirus Toronto Subway and RT Blue screen of death Arizona State University Beetle Time Pachypodium brevicaule Compiler optimization Weight training Domain Name System Gynaecology Toronto Streetcar System Theory of conduct Pachypodium baronii In Search of Lost Time Earthworm Pollination Charmed Cellular differentiation Action potential Angling Pachypodium ambongense Coconut crab Arizona Bodybuilding Pachypodium bicolor Social rule Computer virus Pregnancy test God Emperor of Dune Mucus Tuatara NX bit Spore Morphogenesis Extreme Programming G__del's incompleteness theorem Pedophilia Philosophical skepticism
