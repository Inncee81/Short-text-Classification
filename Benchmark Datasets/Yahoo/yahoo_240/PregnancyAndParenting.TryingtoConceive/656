what is the best position to concieve a girl i have two boys and we really want to try for a girl any suggestions we are looking at trying within the next mts check out the shettles method but it is not scientifically proven the method teaches that the girl sperm is slower but lives longer and the boy sperm is faster but doesn't live that long depending on your cervical fluid inside the girl sperm can possible live days so if you have sex few days before ovulation depending on the fluid inside of you the girl sperm can get to the egg if you have sex close to ovulation or on that day the faster boy sperm can get to them faster also if you use lubricant like ky jelly astroglide saliva etc this can kill the sperm i would suggest using preseed which is something like a lubricant but you insert it in your vagina minutes before sex you can check out www preseed com and if you read the posts a lot of ladies have gotten pregnant from it because preseed allows the sperm to live longer in that fluid as mentioned above the shettles method isn't proven but it's very popular so it doesn't hurt to try you can read more about it by google ing it also if you have your spouse bf drink coffee min before sex it makes the sperm swim faster another myth but it's worked for a lot of ladies more myths from the back boy because if you're about to ovulate it gets the sperm closest to the cervix so since the boy sperm are faster they're more than likely to get to the egg faster from the front girl good luck Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Birth control Sexual intercourse Puberty Sexual reproduction In vitro fertilisation Strap-on dildo Sperm Whale Condom Fertilisation Oral contraceptive Personal lubricant Ovulation Menstrual cup Prostate cancer Pornographic movie Emergency contraception Friction Spider Masturbation Pregnancy Vagina Infertility Safe sex Semen Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Niddah Abortion debate Female reproductive system (human) Urinary incontinence Vaginal lubrication Swimming Obstetrics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Child sexuality Action potential Diaphragm (contraceptive) Intact dilation and extraction Friends Human sexual behavior Cat Ovum Drug test Orgasm Sex toy Sex and the City Ovary Housefly Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Artificial insemination Shark Pitaten Spermatozoon Anal sex Intersex surgery Drosophila melanogaster George Costanza Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dialysis Internal ballistics Human Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Theory of conduct Male reproductive system (human) Archery Moss About a Boy Speed of light Electrophysiology Parachuting Little Britain Jam (TV series) Bird Coffee The Catcher in the Rye Twin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Old wives' tale Penis Something Positive Cervical cancer Whaling Earthworm Pregnancy test Freenet Tampon Gonorrhoea The Shining (film) Kurt Cobain Cervical cap Marilyn Monroe Miscarriage Motor oil Heinkel He 100 Grasshopper
