when to test what is the most reliable time to do a test on the day of your missed period days after it is late or even longer i took only two days after i was late its now days and i'm unsure if i should test again the majority of women can get a positive the day their period is due taking a test days after you were late should have been pretty reliable hcg doubles in your system every hours in early pregnancy so if you tested again now it should be more than accurate it sounds like you may have ovulated late this cycle ovulating late means that your period would be due later or if you conceived that you would have to test later too you didn't mention having any other signs besides a missing period so i'm wondering if you just ovulated late i would test again using first morning pee if it's still negative give it one more week and test again if it's still negative and no period go to the doctor for a blood test good luck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Pregnancy test Fertility awareness Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Miscarriage Estrus cycle Niddah Ovarian cyst Ovarian cancer Drug test HIV test Obstetrics Childbirth Oral contraceptive Progesterone Maya calendar Ravi Shastri Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood type Urinary incontinence Cytomegalovirus Prenatal diagnosis Infertility Coeliac disease Chris Amon Birth control Aortic dissection Paul Is Dead Ron and Fez M16 (rifle) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Prostate cancer Julian day Hebrew calendar Diabetic retinopathy Reliability engineering Immanuel Lupus erythematosus New Morning Prolactinoma Cheating in Counter-Strike Hipparchus (astronomer) Central processing unit Abortion Stroke Time Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 False negative Puberty Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Anemia Social rule Blood on the Tracks UK Singles Chart Sexual abstinence Gonorrhoea Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Month Numerology Group A streptococcal infection M60 machine gun Breast cancer Tide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Failure rate Extreme Programming Chinese New Year English cricket team Sleep apnea Lou Gehrig Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Decca Records Blackjack Chinese character STS-62 British Rail Class 86 Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Cephalic disorder Apollo Guidance Computer Entropy W.
