endometriosis and trying to conceive i am asking this question on behalf of a goof friend of mine does anyone have any stories about getting pregnant when suffering from endometriosis my friend has had it for quite a few years she is being treated and the last time they had a look inside her she was told that there is no blockage in her tubes she has been ttc for a year but no success blood tests indicated she is not ovulating but a home test indicated she is does anyone out there have personal experience of this condition thanks many women with endo are still able to get pregnant if she has been trying for a year with no luck i would think her dr would start to run some tests personally i would put more faith in the blood test than the home test but i would think her best course of action would be to see a fertility specialist have him run tests and if all looks good with her and her sig other and still no luck i would be looking to blame the endo there are some pretty varied opinions about this and she should choose what's right for her but she may have the choice to have another lap to see if the endo is causing some blockage i know you said that wasn't the case in her previous lap but trust me it is possible for the endo to have grown back especially if she didn't have it excised thereby blocking her tubes now and unfortunately sometimes it can grow back in a matter of months another option that may be given to her is the lupron shot i personally would never take lupron as i believe it carries too much risk but some women have gotten pregnant after their course of treatment if this was something she would consider she should research it very well before trying it as it is a pretty powerful drug i would personally have a lap with a dr who specializes in endo if endo is preventing her from becoming pregnant having surgery with a dr knowledgable enough to excise all of the endo would give her very good chances of conceiving it has for lots of women but the first step should be figuring out what if anything is preventing her from getting pregnant and then choose the option she sees best for her i wish her luck Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infertility Acne Stroke In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Lung cancer Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Cancer Folic acid Oral contraceptive Psoriasis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Medicine Prolactinoma Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep apnea Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Stem cell EastEnders Animal testing Ovarian cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Spina bifida Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cytomegalovirus Hypoglycemia Blood on the Tracks Abortion debate Roe v.
