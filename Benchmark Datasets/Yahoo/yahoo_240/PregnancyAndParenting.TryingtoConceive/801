after miscarriage a year ago it seems too hard to get pregnant again why we've been married for year and still no baby we consulted an ob gyne and have us worked out after two months and i get pregnant on the nd month on my nd pre natal check my ob can't hear my baby heart beat we waited for another week but still no heartbeat i had to undergo d c on my th week that was may since then we've been trying again but up to now still no baby need help i've been where you are it is miserable but don't give up after my second miscarriage which was much like yours i didn't even want to try again i just couldn't face any more grief and disappointment so my husband and i decided to take months off no counting days no scheduled sex no checking temperatures no talking about getting pregnant or having a child we did couple things candlelit dinners a weekend away things for only two and that's when it happened just as we were ready to start thinking about trying again we found out we were expecting our son i can't tell you this will work for you all i can say is that being relaxed and not anxious or obsessing about conceiving seemed to be the key in our case and it sure can't hurt your relationship to give yourselves a break and some us time i wish you and your husband the best of luck and i hope you will soon hold a lovely baby in your arms god bless Miscarriage EastEnders Pregnancy Neighbours Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Days of our Lives Marriage Street-Legal Knots Landing Sex and the City 2004 Republican National Convention Hollyoaks Jon Secada Phoebe Halliwell Sharon Tate Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Rais massacre Leo Wyatt The Inside Hall & Oates Amy Grant Melanie Wilkes Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Frankie Laine One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory Heartbeat (television) Piccolo Junior Saga 1957 World Series Charmed Jam (TV series) Abortion debate Fancy Crane Miss Saigon Alois Hitler Boston Public Sami Brady Niddah Amy Dumas Good Times Laura Schlessinger Ayyavazhi mythology Anne Boleyn Quarashi Jean Grey Slow Train Coming Characters of Lost Fiddler on the Roof Cliff Richard Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John the Baptist History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Star Wars Holiday Special Alf Stewart Pitaten Beatles for Sale Theory of conduct Childbirth Futurama (TV series - season 5) Lauren Bacall Blood on the Tracks Birth control Mary Shelley Married... with Children She Loves You Little Britain Time Out of Mind Mojave people John Sheridan (Babylon 5) One Life to Live Jennifer Lopez Operation Market Garden Virgin Mary in Islam Joe DiMaggio Hey Jude Los Rold__n Haven (TNG episode) Satchel Paige Full House 2000 Australian Grand Prix Free will Futurama (TV series - season 2) Big Brother UK series 6 Situation comedy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist C__line Dion Tupac Shakur Major League Baseball television contracts Ron Weasley The Chemical Brothers Past characters (Neighbours) Irna Phillips Fertility awareness
