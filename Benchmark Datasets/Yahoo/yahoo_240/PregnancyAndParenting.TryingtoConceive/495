early periods ok so i asked this somewhere else but no answer anyways i had a horrible uti about a week ago and once i started taking the antibiotics i started bleeding kinda like a period but it only lasted days and wasnt as heavy could it have been from the uti or just an early period i never had a uti b so i didnt know wut really expect from it if it could be an early period wut would cause thar it was almost weeks early i read up on urinary tract infections and i didn't see anything that says anything about it affecting your period you should probably ask a doctor it's probably nothing but better to be safe than sorry Urinary tract infection Medical analysis of circumcision Urinary incontinence Urinary system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hip fracture Cystoscopy Urine Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Stomach cancer Cephalexin Group A streptococcal infection Oral contraceptive Common cold Breastfeeding Diarrhea Miscarriage Ebola Menstrual cycle Endocarditis Genital integrity Replacement joint Psoriasis IgA nephropathy Vulvovaginal health Pharmacology Schistosomiasis Childbirth Vitamin C Anthrax Ehrlichiosis Antibiotic Cellulitis First aid Crohn's disease Epididymitis Escherichia coli Circumcision advocacy Tuberculosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ciprofloxacin Pregnancy USS Toledo (CA-133) Gastroenteritis Slayers Reiter's syndrome Climate of the United Kingdom Prostatitis Cystic fibrosis Bearberry The writing of Principia Mathematica The Empty Child Aminoglycoside Muscle Escherichia coli O157:H7 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Trimethoprim Endometrium Ben Johnson (athlete) Nephrology Co-trimoxazole Pseudomonas Chronic fatigue syndrome Smallpox Bubonic plague AIDS ECW One Night Stand Medicine Roswell UFO incident Ulcerative colitis Upper respiratory tract infection Pneumonia Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Infectious disease Diabetic neuropathy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Joke Influenza Acute renal failure Endometriosis Slow Train Coming Medical prescription The Apprentice 2 Dialysis Serratia marcescens Needle aspiration biopsy Protein-energy malnutrition Radiation poisoning A Canticle for Leibowitz Pelvic inflammatory disease Multiple sclerosis Diverticulitis Rabies Echovirus Father's Day (Doctor Who) Pyelonephritis Julian day Le Malade imaginaire
