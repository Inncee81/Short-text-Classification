when would my ovulation occur i have a pretty consistent day cycle and i was wondering would my ovulation occur around days after the start of mi previous period and is it true that you have a better chance of getting preggers a few days before ovulation thank you veryy muchh yep you'd ovulate somewhere around there you can type ovulation calculator in the search engine and it should pull up some sites that can give you a list of days you'd ovulate you can also track it with cervical mucus and basal body temperature research that as well as far as better chances a few days before its my rule that every other day is a good way to go around that time just to make sure you hit it best of luck and baby dust to you Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Estrus cycle Emergency contraception Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Birth control Flowering plant Carpel Maya calendar Spice Girls Human papillomavirus Ovarian cyst Temperature Cancer Niddah Pachypodium baronii Chinese calendar Tank Ice age Puberty Stomach cancer Legal research Sun Computus Explosive material Tide Avalanche Social rule Premenstrual stress syndrome Estradiol Expert system Infertility Mucus Hebrew calendar Full moon cycle Poker jargon Paleoclimatology Pachypodium brevicaule Apollo 8 Jet engine Conifer cones Cilium Age of the universe Airbag Pachypodium ambongense Norway national football team Cliff Richard Solar variation Pachypodium bicolor Entropy Pulmonary alveolus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chinese New Year Ra (board game) Formula One Sleep Nicolas L__onard Sadi Carnot Spacecraft propulsion Collision detection Astronomy on Mars Weight training Spore Fruit Human chorionic gonadotropin Comet Roxette UK Singles Chart Fertilisation Sunspot Paul Is Dead Knife Gonorrhoea Calendar Moss Ja Rule Cystic fibrosis Sea level rise Julian day Aladdin (1992 film) EastEnders Pok__mon Abilities Eclipse cycle Gambling 24 Hours of Le Mans Internal combustion engine Infantilism Rambutan Solar power Hipparchus (astronomer) Gynaecology Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Civilization III Jon Secada Salvia divinorum
