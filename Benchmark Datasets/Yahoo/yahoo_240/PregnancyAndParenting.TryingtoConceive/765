conceiving problems my husband and i are having no luck conceiving naturally and we are due to go to gp to start looking in to it can i ask those who have done the same how it affected them as a couple was it one or the other of you who had the problem did you find out who had the problem how did you deal with that as a couple did you decide to go further with treatment or accept that you might not have children we are coming up to the point where we are going to start having to make decisions and its 'slightly' daunting my husband and i have started this process and have so far just had some tests done all of which came out normal it felt good to get some answers but it was frustrating to not get any diagnosis that we could fix to help us get pregnant we are in the unexplained infertility category right now and just hoping that time will be the answer if you do not find a problem you can't fix it so i am glad we at least put forth the effort it's defenitely an emotional experience and it will either mess up your relationship if you let it or make it stronger luckily my marriage has only gotten stronger because we have really had to extend each other alot of extra support and talk through alot of what ifs good luck in your journey and i hope you achieve your dream soon Infertility Marriage Autism Friends Social rule Divorce 2000 Australian Grand Prix Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Hypoglycemia Grief Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Transsexuality Controversies in autism In vitro fertilisation Legal aspects of transsexualism Asperger syndrome Stroke Narcissism Sexual orientation Prenatal diagnosis The nature of God in Western theology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dyslexia The Contender (television series) Social justice Jet engine Phoebe Halliwell Birth control Friedrich Schleiermacher Risk management Human cloning Cancer God Emperor of Dune Cyprus dispute T'Pol Mystique (comics) International Olympic Committee Gravity Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Malaria Prolactinoma Multiple sclerosis Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fertility awareness Stomach cancer Adult attention-deficit disorder Childbirth Growth hormone treatment Mental illness Expert system Post-traumatic stress disorder EastEnders Chronic fatigue syndrome Polyamory Therion (band) Laura Schlessinger Carl Jung One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Stuttering The Ashlee Simpson Show Pregnancy Ethics Characters in the Smurfs Jean Grey Abortion debate Polygamy W.I.T.C.H.
