i have pcos and i have been trying to get pregant but no luck i have been trying to get pregant now for about years and no luck i dont have any health insurance so the med's method is out my doctor told me to eat healthier but what iam suppost to eat i was just wondering if there is another way besides the meds or any website that i can go too if you can please help that would be great thanks i myself have pcos and i am currently nine months preggers i tried to get preggers with out meds for over five years with no luck as for eating better i'm sure your doctor is talking about the diabetic diet or at least that's what my doctor first suggested however no diet will cause you to ovulate which is the common problem and main symptom of pcos i suggest you talk to your doctor about using something like metformin and or clomid metformin costs very very little about bucks a month or less and clomid will cost you about bucks per cycle both can be very effective in bringing on ovulation i myself only needed clomid for one cycle and got preggers so it cost me bucks to conceive my amazing little miracle which is way cheaper then even an ovulation detection kit even if you did have medical coverage most will not cover fertility drugs such as clomid so either way its gonna have to come out of your pocket but i'm sure you can afford bucks a month when a child is going cost you sooo much more and its agonizing waiting year after year best of luck baby dust for you Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetes mellitus Metformin Stomach cancer Fertility awareness Migraine Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Hypoglycemia Alternative medicine Insulin resistance Nutrition Childbirth Growth hormone treatment Ovulation Medicare (Canada) Homeopathy Asthma Canadian and American health care systems compared Natural Hygiene Prolactinoma Addiction Quackery Medical analysis of circumcision Puberty Bipolar disorder Schizophrenia Insurance Pharmaceutical company Atkins Nutritional Approach Cancer Anorexia nervosa Drug addiction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hypertension Common cold Antipsychotic Alzheimer's disease Dieting Guinea pig Chocolate Mental illness Emergency contraception Pneumonia Oral contraceptive Alcoholism Autism Tobacco smoking Adjustable gastric band Phimosis Organ transplant Gastroparesis Health care in the United States Life insurance Terri Schiavo Wal-Mart Spina bifida Medicare (United States) Birth control Miscarriage Healthy eating Methylsulfonylmethane Low-carbohydrate diet Mesothelioma Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rabies Veganism Insulin Weight loss Adverse effect (medicine) Binge eating disorder Colorectal cancer Multiple birth Flowering plant Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Science fiction on television Rush Limbaugh Urinary incontinence Crohn's disease Dog Clinical depression Medical record Metabolic syndrome
