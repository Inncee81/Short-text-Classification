absolutely frustrated ok first of all this is a rant not a question i just want to go back in time and kick my own behind i thought how great it would be to track everything and know exactly when i got pregnant as my first two children were a happy surprise my dh i planned for two years before we decided to go ahead and give it a try started sept ' but here we are still no baby on the way one thing i can stress is not to tell anyone that you have decided to ttc as i am so sick and tired of hearing my mother and everyone else ask any luck yet we thought we were doing it smart by getting everything in line before the baby now we are stuck with all of these hurtful reminders that there is no baby and maybe never will be ex the crib that we bought because the crib i used for the older two i had given away the mini van we bought to accomodate another child the extra bedroom that we made sure was in the new house we bought to make room for baby i'm at my wits end i know people go alot longer than what i have been ttc but it doesn't help the fact that i feel broken and i just wanted anyone else who is currently ttc to know that you are not alone in your hopes and all the ups and down you are facing i feel like i am letting my husband down every month even though i know he will be happy with the family we have it's just absolutely frustrating i would take a surprise baby anyday over going through all of this again i am only and i have been to the doctor already he has said that it can take up to six months for m y birth control to be completely out of my system but six months has definately come and gone i thank everyone for chiming in the main focus of this post was to let anyone ttc know they are not alone in their struggles i totally feel your pain on this i have been trying to concieve since june ' everybody still asks me month after month if i am pregnant yet it feels like the whole world is pregnant or carrying babies around when you can't get pregnant i have no children and a beautifully decorated baby room gathering dust my husband teaches high school and all the kids ask us constantly when we're having kids so they can babysit we've been married for years in terms of all the people questioning your pregnancy i sent this link to all my family and close friends to help them understand what i am going through right now it has really helped them understand where i am emotionally and know what not to say www tearsandhope com months were the hardest for me psychologically or emotionally do your best to stay positive and focus on the things you can control in this situation EastEnders Pregnancy Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Abortion debate Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sharon Tate Social rule Everwood Theory of conduct Hollyoaks Infantilism The Catcher in the Rye Transactional analysis Breastfeeding Neighbours Toronto Subway and RT One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q The Contender (television series) Charmed Paradox Haven (TNG episode) Happiness Melanie Wilkes Poker jargon The Death Gate Cycle Blood on the Tracks Toronto Transit Commission Jam (TV series) About a Boy Baby Blues Alois Hitler Oh My Goddess!
