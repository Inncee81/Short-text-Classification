im trying and need help me and my boyfriend have been trying to conceive for a long time now weve been trying extra hard this month the past two days ive been getting pains very similar to period pains but im not due on for another two weeks could this b a sign of pregnancy or am i just thinking too much and being hopeful and no we're not married so please dont pass judgement on that i dont really think it matters nowadays we are very much in love and know we can look after a child and plan to get married in the future i just have to comment because it seems as if more people are focusing on you not being married than on the question you asked i do agree that if you think about it too much you might psyc yourself out to believing that you are pregnant just stay calm and relax try to do things that take your mind off of it and when or if you miss your period go take test good luck Pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Sharon Tate Miscarriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Jennifer Lopez Knots Landing Abortion debate Obstetrics Menstrual cycle Friends Time Fertility awareness Autism Childbirth Big Brother UK series 6 Days of our Lives Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Urinary incontinence Tribulation Qiyamah Miss Saigon Phoebe Halliwell Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Stoicism Abortion Elvis and Me Person The nature of God in Western theology Le Malade imaginaire Neighbours Kodocha Guinea pig One Life to Live Children of Dune Anne Boleyn Breastfeeding Sex and the City God Emperor of Dune Time Out of Mind Aikido Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Predestination Oh My Goddess!
