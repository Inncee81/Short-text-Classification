i took an ovulation test yesterday the line was faint today there is no line at all whats happening i just started my period on the th though so i thought i was early in testing would i have ovulated so soon sorry different tests one yesterday and then another one today oh please tell me i havent already ovulated you probably missed your surge sometimes it happens in between when you take the tests so you never get a positive next month try taking it at about pm and again at pm on the days you suspect to get a positive i hope you tested before yesterday as well and i'm guessing there was no line the only other reason would be that your body geared up to ovulate but didn't but that's probably not the case act like you got a positive yesterday and have sex today and tomorrow good luck Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Puberty Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Dispensationalism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cliff Richard Drug test Pregnancy Heinkel He 100 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Modal auxiliary verb Free will Emergency contraception Amiga Power Human chorionic gonadotropin Niddah Estrus cycle Jean Grey Oral contraceptive January 2005 in Britain and Ireland Jon Secada Do As Infinity Paul Is Dead AFI 100 Years series Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Pop punk Yesterday (song) Birth control Social rule Luck Sharon Tate Philosophical skepticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Singlish V2 word order HIV test The Beatles discography I Want to Hold Your Hand Teen Girl Squad Brian Close Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Steven Wright Infertility Pornographic movie Conifer cones Ovarian cyst Debugging GED PRS Guitars President of Germany Kasparov versus The World The Lovely Bones Chris Amon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Supremes Timekeeping on Mars Modal logic 2000 Australian Grand Prix Futurama (TV series - season 5) Robert Goddard (scientist) Ovarian cancer John F.
