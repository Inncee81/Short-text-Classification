feeling pregnant but not you ladies will probaly think i'm stupid for posting this but you never know i had been trying to get pregnant for a while but eventually gave up for a while here comes the stupid part i have not had sex since march i have also been having my periods right on time days long and heavy and have not missed but i feel pregnant you know still the only symptoms i have are a bubbling tummy which everyone tells me is gas tests are all negative am i forcing myself to see things that aren't there is it really possible to feel pregnant without actually being pregnant any advice hi there first of all your question isn't stupid at all what you're feeling is very real whether you are pregnant or not there's a few possibilities here either you have a hormone imbalance which would mimic pregnancy in some cases or you're having a phantom pregnancy a phantom pregnancy is when a women is so convinced she's pregnant that she starts having symptoms some women go so far as to start producing milk and having their bellies protrude the other possibility is that you are pregnant and are one of those women who continue to bleed throughout pregnancy there are also women who just don't show positive on urine tests i'm leaning more towards phantom pregnancy because i feel if you really were pregnant you'd have other symptoms besides an upset stomach especially if you conceived back in march what i strongly suggest is that you have an ultrasound done i don't think any pregnancy test would convince you otherwise have them do an ultrasound of your female parts and believe me if there's a bambino in there growing they will see it especially at this stage if there's no fetus there's no pregnancy you will find out one way or the other when you look at that ultrasound screen good luck Pregnancy Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Cytomegalovirus Stomach cancer Friends Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Gonorrhoea Childbirth Breast cancer Birth control Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Coeliac disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Spina bifida Prolactinoma Knots Landing Endometrial cancer Premature birth Guinea pig Stroke Puberty Anemia Cephalic disorder Ovarian cyst Folic acid EastEnders Social rule Haloperidol Kodocha Human chorionic gonadotropin Omega-3 fatty acid Marilyn Monroe Roe v.
