ovulation and cervical fluid timing i usually have the egg white like cervical fluid for about four to five days my question is when approximately do i ovulate during that time is it at the end when it dries up or the last day i see it i know nothing is exact but what is most common i am trying to time it accurately because my husband and i have limited time to baby dance due to our current work schedules start doing the baby dance on the first day you see eggwhite cm you just want to keep at it until it dries up because the eggwhite cm dries up within hrs after ovulation so if you wait too long you could miss it Fertility awareness Ovulation Menstrual cycle Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Gonorrhoea Emergency contraception Egg white Hour Tide Pachypodium bicolor Birth control Flowering plant Multiple birth Chiropractic Estrus cycle Miscarriage Puberty Pachypodium brevicaule Oral contraceptive Childbirth Ovarian cancer Niddah Vertebral column Maya calendar Abortion Spinal cord Dialysis Infertility Ovary Pachypodium ambongense Carpel Gallon Conifer cones Cervical cancer Fruit Carbon dioxide Autonomic nervous system Dehydration Pachypodium baronii Female reproductive system (human) Human cloning Transformer Ovum Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Infantilism Sexually-transmitted infection Sea level rise Remix STS-62 Egg (food) Unix time Bee Jon Secada Brownian motion Whitney Houston Progesterone Capercaillie Yoshi Porosity Battle of the Bulge AIDS reappraisal Jennifer Lopez Casting Spina bifida Drug test Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Crohn's disease Mississippi John Hurt Estradiol Viscosity Comanche Roche limit Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cyst Gynaecology Failure rate Donna Summer Breastfeeding Beatmania IIDX Human papillomavirus Weather forecasting Medical prescription Dry cleaning U2 (band) Radiation therapy Sandworm (Dune) Navier-Stokes equations Origin belief Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
