what could this be im confused implantation bleeding or something else ok im ttc just started this month my last period was around july i have been having unprotected sex with my husband almost everyday well for the last week i have been feeling funny okward i was wearing white shorts a week ago of course they cant stay white and i went to the bathroom and noticed a spot on them in the crotch area it wasnt red like blood it was like a really light rusty color and no i didnt sit on anything but my underwear went colored at all like it went right threw then last mon i was in the wis dell and wore gray shorts with my swimsuit and noticed the spot again so i have been wearing paintyliners since and nothing for the past days i get a light pain in my lower back and feel like i do the day i get my period but i dont get it for like a few more days i dont know if this is enough info to get anything out of but its all i got now so any answers that might help me please let me know also fri i was lightheaded for awhile too i think its too early for preg test and i know i asked this q before i only got answers out of it so i thought i would post again with a different title i dont know if this has to do with anything but for the last like month i think i have been craving pickles and icees slushies and just recently frensh fries with ketchup on them well the spotting does sound consistent with implantation spotting since it is not bright red and is brown that indicates old blood and that's what i had when i was pregnant with my son i thought my period was starting but it never came since this was over a week ago i would take a pregnancy test as within a couple days of implantation there is enough hcg in the urine to be detected by an early pregnancy test you will also get period like cramps and such as your uterus stretches a lot of women get positive pregnancy tests at days past ovulation and it you take one and it comes up negative then just wait until your period is late and take another you might have ovulated sooner than you thought too i don't think you'd have food cravings yet but i remember being super thirsty and tired before i knew i was pregnant good luck this first month may have been the charm Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Pregnancy test Endometriosis Miscarriage Abortion Obstetrics Emergency contraception Prostate cancer EastEnders Oral contraceptive Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Urinary incontinence Birth control Ocean's Twelve Ovarian cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Undergarment Tour de France Prenatal diagnosis Coeliac disease Big Brother UK series 6 Ovulation Endometrial cancer Social rule Diabetic retinopathy Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Breastfeeding HIV test Marilyn Monroe Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toronto Transit Commission Childbirth Psoriasis Piccolo Junior Saga Abortion debate Puberty Progesterone In vitro fertilisation Billboard Hot 100 Twin Ben Johnson (athlete) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez Anal sex Rosa Parks Niddah New York Giants Blood on the Tracks The Shining (film) Polycystic ovary syndrome The Inside Drug test Capercaillie Folic acid Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Avenue Q Cytomegalovirus Knots Landing Professional wrestling slang Gynecologic hemorrhage Estrus cycle Lucille Ball Columbine High School massacre Futurama (TV series - season 5) Singlish Red Hot Chili Peppers Guinea pig Pittsburgh Steelers Katelyn Faber Sin City Horse Neighbours Sauna Pelvic inflammatory disease Satchel Paige Characters of Naruto Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dog Social aspects of clothing Sexual intercourse The Venture Bros.
