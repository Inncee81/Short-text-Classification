basal body temperature i have just started recording my bbt each morning the instructions say to try and record it at the same time each morning but my sleeping pattern is quite unpredictable so i don't want to set my alarm to get up at each morning to take my temp however if i set it for later that am the chances are that i'll wake up earlier which is what happened yesterday like i am sitting here now wide awake and i probably won't sleep until about am is it necessary to take it around the same time every day or could i base it on how much sleep i have i e if i had hours sleep yesterday and i go to sleep at am today could i then take my temp at am which means i've had hours sleep like yesterday i am really sorry if this sounds confusing thanks for me i see a bigger difference in the number of hours i have been asleep versus the time i take it for example one morning i'll wake up at am and take it after hours of sleep then the next day i'll wake up at am after hours of sleep and the temp will be the same so for me it is the number of hours of sleep not the time of day i also take my temp vaginally to reduce cold readings from my mouth being open during the night that caused more rocky mountain temping then waking up at different times Fertility awareness Sleep Urinary incontinence Temperature Insomnia Daylight saving time Narcolepsy Out-of-body experience Thermoregulation Shaggy dog story Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March The Amber Spyglass Siesta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Day Dream Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Paul Is Dead Canonical hours Yesterday (song) Delayed sleep phase syndrome STS-62 Lucid dreaming Cliff Richard Jet lag The Beatles discography Milton H.
