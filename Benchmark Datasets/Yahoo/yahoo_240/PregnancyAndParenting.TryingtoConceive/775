any ttc'ers surprised at bfp i'm just curious if anyone ttc'd for months on end seeing the endless negative hpt's and at one point became such an expert at your own body that you no longer really looked forward to testing day because you knew you weren't pregnant every cycle felt like the last one and then you expected af like every other cycle and it didn't show and you got bfp none of the pg sxs you'd been searcing for in the beginning of the ttc journey and were really surprised to be pregnant yes i was definitely surprised by my this pregnancy even though we had been trying for years when i got pregnant with my first she is now years old we were not trying to conceive but we were not preventing it either i knew i was pregnant when i got out of the shower late one night and there were prominent blue veins under the skin on my breasts it was a week before my period was even due i went to the store we live in a rural area and it was late on a sunday and came home and tested positive i was not surprised really i was happy and scared all at the same time btw ultrasound later confirmed that i was indeed right about my dates when we started ttc again our daughter was about a year and a half old it took about four months but i knew i was pregnant i swear i felt implantation occur i waited until the day my period was due to test because in the months prior i had wasted so much on tests the test seemed unnecessary really because i knew i was pregnant so i tested and it was negative i was devastated i actually had a temper tantrum then after i calmed down i was on the way out the door and i decided to go look again and there was the faintest positive i took it to the pharmacist in a ziplock bag and had him take a look at it too lol but i was not surprised our son is now years old well now i am expecting my third child next month we started trying to conceive again when our son was about a year and a half so it took nearly five years this time i can not tell you how much money i spent on pregnancy tests i have literally taken hundreds we had taken some measures that we were comfortable with but were not willing to go any further as far as infertility treatments were concerned so it started seeming like it would never happen i still hoped however in december of last year my period started it was several days early i remember that with the holidays and everything going on that month we did nothing to ttc except obviously fit some intercourse in there a couple of times but conceiving was not on our minds i did not temp i did not check cervix nothing but for some reason in january on the day before my period should have started i tested habit i was a definite pee on a stick addict i had absolutely no symptoms just thought i should test it was so faint i did not think it was there i was sure i was imaging things i looked at it up close i held it at a distance i looked in dim light and bright i scanned it and used photo editing software to change the contrast i sent it to friends so they could tell me if they saw something i still did not believe it i went to the store and bought more tests because that first one was the last test strip i had in my house faint positives but they certainly could not be real after nearly five years of trying and i tested again and again after approximately three dozen tests of various brands three blood tests and four ultrasounds i was convinced i was pregnant there was a scare in there as the baby was not initially visible on ultrasound and one of the tests i got at a doctor's office was negative after several home tests were positive all of these tests were in a one week period btw yes i was shocked i still am but i sit here feeling her move and it is my own schock and awe i could not be happier Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness EastEnders Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Friends Prostate cancer Knots Landing Childbirth Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Shaggy dog story Milton H.
