has anyone ever takin a hpt and it comes out neg and then a few days later get a positive im just wondering cuz i stopped taking the pill like a month and a ago and had unprotected sex with my husband like practicly everyday sorry and im pretty sure im supose to get my period this week and i think i might be preg but not sure cuz there are really no symptoms i only have a light stomach ache now and then and a headache one day and was light headed another but there are many explinations for why i had them but back to my q i took a hpt clear blue digital and it said not pregnant days ago and i was just wondering if anyone has takin a test and it showed up negative and then a few days later show up posetive how many days between and after your missed period please tell me whatever you know and are willing to share with me and other readers of my q thanks to everyone who answers this and sorry for making this sooo long hey hun apart from the first time i was pregnant which i didn't realise until weeks in i have tested before my period was due and got negatives then tested as my period was due or just before and got weak positives then had confirmation of pregnancy via blood test with my doctor but i seem to always know like a week before my period is due its kinda annoying because i've wasted so much money on hpts over my four pregnancys anyway i really advise waiting until the day your period is due because there is unlikely to be enough hgc hormone in your urine for the test to pick it up its a threshold remember so if you buy a test it might only detect mg or even a mg which you wouldn't get till after your period is late my biggest symptom throughout all was breast tenderness before period was due tiredness and nausea i understand how you feel though my period is due on monday and i'm sure i'm pregnant and of course my hpt is negative so im just going back to my doctor on monday to get a blood test good luck Pregnancy Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics Stomach cancer Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Emergency contraception Neighbours Pregnancy test Prolactinoma Endometriosis Drug test Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Cancer Miscarriage Jon Secada Migraine Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Group A streptococcal infection Folic acid Cytomegalovirus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood on the Tracks Ebola Abortion Haloperidol Ocean's Twelve Hypertension Big Brother UK series 6 Prenatal diagnosis Doxepin Sulfasalazine Marilyn Monroe Trazodone Billboard Hot 100 Gonorrhoea Clomipramine Time Out of Mind Chronic fatigue syndrome Pitaten Cliff Richard Dialysis Futurama (TV series - season 5) Charles Darwin's illness Traumatic brain injury Gastroparesis Tocopherol Cephalic disorder Stroke Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus AIDS Maprotiline Paracetamol Diabetic retinopathy UK Singles Chart Hyperprolactinaemia Morning sickness Puberty Alcoholism Turner syndrome Dehydration Rosa Parks Caffeine Lucille Ball Pornographic movie Hepatitis Malaria Frankie Laine 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Contender (television series) Guinea pig Knots Landing Masturbation Amiodarone Daz Dillinger HIV Multiple sclerosis Married... with Children Human chorionic gonadotropin Vitamin C Sleep Acne Father's Day (Doctor Who)
