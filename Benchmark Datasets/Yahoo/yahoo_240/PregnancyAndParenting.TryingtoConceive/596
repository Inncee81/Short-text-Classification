pregnancy tests confusing i took a pregnancy test that read positive about days before my missed period i am days late and took another one today and it read negative i feel pregnant and am having some of the symptoms how long can you keep testing negative before it shows up positive a negative result can mean that you are not pregnant you took the test too early or you took the test wrong pregnancy tests vary in their sensitivity how soon they can detect the hormone hcg and you may not have given your body enough time to produce enough hcg hormones that will show up on the test also if you let a test sit for too long after the instructions on the box tell you the test is invalid it is best to follow the instructions and wait until you have missed a period before taking the test some women show up accurately on a test the day they miss a period while others may not show up positive until weeks after a missed period we encourage women to test after a missed period if the result is negative they should wait a week and test again if a normal period has not started http www americanpregnancy org gettingpregnant pregnancyfaq htm Pregnancy Pregnancy test Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Miscarriage Prostate cancer HIV test Obstetrics Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion Breast cancer Coeliac disease Oral contraceptive Human sexual behavior Gonorrhoea Prolactinoma Polycystic ovary syndrome Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Haloperidol Hypoglycemia Birth control Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spina bifida Diabetes mellitus Psoriasis Guinea pig In vitro fertilisation Clinical depression Anemia Ben Johnson (athlete) Human height Ectopic pregnancy Transsexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone treatment Abortion debate Progesterone Insulin Folic acid Ovarian cancer Chemical abortion Hyperprolactinaemia Ovarian cyst Tocopherol Blood type Twin Aortic dissection Diabetic retinopathy Child sexuality Puberty Hypertension Breech birth Sharon Tate Childbirth Antiphospholipid syndrome Cryptorchidism Postpartum depression False negative Morning sickness Oscilloscope Neighbours Autism CPU cache Endometrial cancer Falsifiability Chronic fatigue syndrome Thyroid SAT Pedophilia Tour de France Debugging Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Group A streptococcal infection Gender role RISC Friends Cardiac stress test Emergency contraception Paget's disease of bone Narcolepsy Pelvic inflammatory disease Acne Sleep Heartworm Stroke STS-62 Pornographic movie Pneumonia Atherosclerosis Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone deficiency
