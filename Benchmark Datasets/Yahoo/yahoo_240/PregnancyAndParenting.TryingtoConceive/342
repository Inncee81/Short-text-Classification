long lh surge ok i have been testing withopk and got a positive lh surge the test line was darker than control line i tested again hours later and it was still a very positive result is this normal i thought the surge was sudden and could easily be missed as ive been told by numerous amounts of people so is it possible to have a positive result over a day period as its still positive im confused as it says ovulation should take place around hours later i am healthy and do not have pcos any info would be very helpful hi there this is totally normal not every woman is the same some have very short surges where they literally have to test twice a day or they miss it some will have a positive result for a couple of days and others will have a positive result until their period comes all of it is normal the main thing to remember is that once you get that positive you ovulate anywhere from hours later so even if it stays positive for days you would have ovulated a day or two after you initially turned positive this is why once you get a positive there is no need to keep testing good luck Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertility awareness Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovulation The Amazing Race Pregnancy test Nuclear fallout Akuma (Street Fighter) Pregnancy Emergency contraception 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Hurricane Rita HIV test USS Wahoo (SS-238) Urinary incontinence Gonadotropin-releasing hormone In vitro fertilisation Snooker Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Narcolepsy Social rule Birth control Experiment Breastfeeding SL-1 Color blindness Fluorescent lamp Ovarian cancer Infertility Poker jargon Sydney Riot of 1879 Lonely Among Us (TNG episode) Billboard Hot 100 Sleep debt Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Flood Oral contraceptive History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Big Brother UK series 6 Explosive material Jet engine John F.
