im trying to conceive ive been off bc for a week just wondering if it can happen right after or a month had sex thursday aug what are the chances im preg this is a complex question and no one on here is going to know this answer for sure and neither will a doctor the reality is that you have a chance at getting pregnant your first month but it is a low chance its something like chance to conceive during each cycle even if you ovulate and everything is perfect i have been ttc for months now and i didnt even ovulate my first month off bc the best thing to start doing is using the ovulation predictor kits and bbt charting as well as examing your cervical mucus for changes i know that sounds gross but your body has a way of telling you that you are ovulating you just have to know what those signs are but dont get frustrated if it doesnt happen right away the statistics are that of couples get pregnant in the first year if you havent had any luck in a year then its time to see the doctor most doctors wont even see u if u havent been trying for a year i hope all this helps good luck to you Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Oral contraceptive Birth control Pregnancy Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Atomic Kitten CPU cache Puberty In vitro fertilisation Social rule Game show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Miscarriage Estrus cycle Autism Luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Chiropractic Pregnancy test The Five Doctors Progesterone Abortion debate Jennifer Lopez Boom Town (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Neighbours She Loves You Scarlet Witch Ontological argument Simone Weil Intelligent design Numerology Urinary incontinence Childbirth Phoebe Halliwell Human chorionic gonadotropin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sharon Tate Estradiol Alanis Morissette Friends Fertilisation R.
