telling people about pregnancy i have some friends that are having trouble conceiving i am very fortunate to be pregnant with baby and i would like to start sharing the news with people but i don't want to upset anyone is there anyone out there that has been in this situation or maybe has been on the other side of it ttc while another friend does first how should i share the news i actually have different friends that are having fertility problems i struggled with infertility it took years including failed iuis an ivf procedure finally resulted in a pregnancy in that time all of my friends who started trying after i did got pregnant and had their babies it was so hard going to each of their showers visiting them at the hospital holding their babies i was so frustrated that there was something wrong with me and it felt like i failed at something again and again i have other friends who have gone through infertility and this is a common feeling we share the thing is even though i was going through all of that i still was very happy for those who could get pregnant so i congratulated them and was genuinely happy for them i talked to them about their pregnancies and their babies although it was hard at times to do that i cried a lot it seems that because you are asking this question you must be sensitive to what they are going through they must know this and if they are good friends they will be happy for you and share in your joy just be as sensitive as possible when telling them start by saying something like i have something to tell you although i know this might be hard for you emphasize that you are hoping for them praying if you are religious and that you are there for them hoping that they too can share the same news with you someday it would help to do this in person and share hugs and maybe even a few tears if you have good friends they will be so happy for you even if it also brings a little sadness for their own situation In vitro fertilisation Friends Pregnancy Infertility Pitaten EastEnders Boston Public Melanie Wilkes Knots Landing The Smoking Room Breastfeeding Kodocha Abortion debate Roe v.
