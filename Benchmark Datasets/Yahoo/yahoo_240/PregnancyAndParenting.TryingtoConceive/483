otc ovulation test help help lol i have been using an over the counter ovulation testing kit and earlier today there was no line but tonight there was its faint not as strong as the control line does this mean i just started ovulating i dont usually wait as long as i did tonight to read the result so im concerned i missed my window already any personal experience would be great concerning these things thanks i guess i should mention that this morning i also had the ewcm that is why i was so confused that the ovulation test came up negative and why im thinking the one tonight could be correct we've been trying for a few months now this is the first month with an ovulation kit so hopefully this is it lol that would still be considered a test it has to be as dark as or darker than the control line what brand are you using i may have a pic of a test to show you if you are just starting to get a line then it should get darker in the next few days everyone i know gets best results with opks around pm in the afternoon since the lh surge starts in the mornings and fmu won't be accurate Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Ovulation HIV test Pregnancy Emergency contraception Polycystic ovary syndrome Jon Secada 10cc Estrus cycle Daylight saving time Apollo 8 Liquid crystal display Sydney Riot of 1879 Pure Pwnage B3ta Experiment Jennifer Lopez Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ovarian cancer Conifer cones Nashville Skyline History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) CPU cache Slow Train Coming 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Rei Ayanami Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Artificial consciousness STS-62 BBC Radio 4 Bayesian inference Mountain Gorilla GED History of Test cricket (to 1883) Embedded system Scientific method Theory 97.3 Forth One Telepathy Arsenal F.C.
