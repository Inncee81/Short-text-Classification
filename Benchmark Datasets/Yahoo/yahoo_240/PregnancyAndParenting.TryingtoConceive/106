when your ovulating do you have period like cramps i am suppose to ovulate today and i am so far light bleeding and cramping does this make sense yes the cramps are called mittleschmerz and the light bleeding is called ovulatory spotting ovulatory spotting occurs during ovulation when estrogen levels drop suddenly causing blood vessels in the uterus to release small amounts of blood estrogen is high right before ovulation and dips when the egg is released and then within a matter of hours progesterone starts to be secreeted in high amounts but during the couple of hours or so that the estrogen is low and progesterone is just starting to climb a little blood may be released so the spotting should occur immediately after ovulation but for some women it will take a few hours before they see the spotting on their panties or when wiping so by the time you see the spotting you have already ovulated but ewcm mixed with blood is still considered extremely fertile so it's a good time to bd however if the bleeding becomes more than spotting and lasts longer than just today then it may actually be your period coming sooner than expected probably from an anovulatory cycle Ovulation Oral contraceptive Puberty Fertility awareness Estrus cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome Ectopic pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Emergency contraception Birth control Ovary Pregnancy Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy Endometrial cancer Endometrium Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovarian cyst Ovarian cancer Urinary incontinence Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Stroke Miscarriage Premenstrual stress syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Estradiol Childbirth Blood pressure Swyer syndrome Embryo transfer Testosterone Niddah First aid Uterine fibroids Sexual differentiation Diabetic retinopathy Coagulation Breast cancer Turner syndrome Jet engine Eye Dialysis Infertility Gynaecology Conifer cones Cholesterol Tsetse fly Sexual reproduction Professional wrestling slang Non-human animal sexuality Bleeding Traumatic brain injury Earthworm Hyperinflation Estrogen Twin HIV test Amenorrhoea Pregnancy test Fertilisation Anabolic steroid Cancer Cramp Prolactin Professional wrestling match types Intracranial pressure Stomach cancer Delayed puberty Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Decompression sickness Hemorrhagic stroke Spider Carbon dioxide Carburetor Von Willebrand disease Progesterone only pill Abortion Tide Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cup Rocky Mountain spotted fever Ovum Hyperprolactinaemia Breastfeeding Flowering plant Osteoporosis Dead zone Vaginal bleeding Intravenous therapy Tocopherol Massage Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
