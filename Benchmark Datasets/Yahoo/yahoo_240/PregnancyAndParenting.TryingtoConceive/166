my pregnancy test showed a very faint line like an evaporation line but a couple of hours later it darkened considerably and is now decidedly looking like a bfp and is coloured blue like the test line is this wishful thinking or could it be for real i can't wait til tomorrow to try again i just wanna know now i am dpo ttc for months it was there but so so faint in the minutes when i took it it just got darker over a couple of hours i guess i'll have to wait until the morning thanks for your fast answers dpo days post ovulation my period is due in days hence why it would be faint if it is positive i'm so excited only trust a test that is taken and looked at when you have aloud the right amount of time to pass after that the lines can get affected by the air and crap in it if you had a line when you took the test and that line indicates pregnancy then i would assume you are pregnant hopefully a congrats is in order Pregnancy Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy test Apollo 8 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gamma ray burst Obstetrics Solar eclipse Childbirth Birth control GED Family Feud Toronto Subway and RT Jeopardy!
