what equipment would be good for making movies computers programs cameras i was thinking of getting a sony camera because they never really let you down any specifics what about a macintosh computer they're so much money if something were to happen to them i'd be lost in nothing also the pro only has up to gb i think witch dosn't seem like that much to store lots of things on and i've had a bad experiance with an imac but it was one of them old ones with the clear backs for a program i was thinking of final cut express the one that comes in a bundle with all them other programs remember price is an issue too thanks in advance toodles depending on how involved you want to get for the low end cheapest way refurb macmini from apple new you would also need a monitor to go w it i would suggest searching buy com and finding a nice lcd for around imovie free w apple computers i would get either a sony or a canon camera and would get a minidv format not dvd hd etc in time the hard drive cameras will be the way to go but for now minidv is readily available inexpensive and reliable no matter what computer you get i would recommend a large external hard drive gb firewire preferably to back up your projects onto final cut express is a very good program and will allow you to do much more than imovie but also is much more expensive when compared to free IMac Apple Computer Camcorder High-definition television Floppy disk ITunes DV PlayStation 2 IPod 8 mm video format Digital photography PowerBook Hard disk Mac OS X Computer HDV IBM PC compatible FireWire Independent film USB flash drive Microeconomics Laptop EMac Personal computer Apple II family IBook Microsoft NeXT DVD MP3 Universal Serial Bus Power Mac G4 Cube Digital video Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 64 Desktop computer Energy development Mouse (computing) QuickTime PlayStation 3 Commodore International Timeline of computing 1990-forward PlayStation Portable Videotape IMovie Final Cut Pro Digital camera Atari 8-bit family Digital cinematography Bluetooth Atari ST Windows XP Xbox 360 ISight Computer and video games Stereoscopy IPod photo Sony Digital cinema Microsoft Office Power Macintosh G3 ITunes Music Store Logic VHS RISC Digital8 David Pogue Apple Lisa Spyware CPU design Windows Vista Bicycle lighting Digital circuit X Window System Nintendo Screenshot Walkman Blu-ray Disc Computer virus Macromedia Flash Virtual memory History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Data General Surveillance Pretty Good Privacy Sound Blaster Apple IIGS Pornography
