computer help again ok i thought that the last question i asked fixed my comp but apparently not ok here's the deal for some reason my computer will sometimes shut down and not be able to turn back on it's almost like it goes in sleep mode but i can't wake it up i have to unplug it and replug it back in i have avg antivirus and i've scanned it and it says nothings wrong any ideas that can help thanks in advance i was going to say the same as above with regards to power supply or heat issues and the above is good but also check in the bios with regards to settings on temperature as there is a setting in most bios's that allow you to make the computer shutdown at a certain temperature i would suggest you check what the max temp you can have your cpu run at and increase or lower the temp if the temp is set too low then you can obviously increase the max temp before shutdown other then that your computer has too many devices and needs a new power supply unless its a windows bug then you may need to do a windows update if that does not help open up event viewer control panel admin tools event viewer and post back with any errors relating to shutting down of the machine or powering off or power or anything that you may think is related then we can go from there if you look in system or application section of event viewer Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Vista Central processing unit Computer virus Temperature Linux kernel Embedded system Blue screen of death C programming language Booting Power-On Self Test Debugging IBM PC compatible RISC Redundant array of independent disks NX bit Nuclear reactor Virtual memory Microsoft Windows Apollo Guidance Computer Rootkit Btrieve CPU design Personal computer 2003 North America blackout Oscilloscope Atari 8-bit family BIOS Architecture of Windows 2000 Atari ST Windows 3.x Computer multitasking Microprocessor Apple Macintosh Computer security Turbocharger Floppy disk Linux OS/2 Mach kernel AmigaOS History of Microsoft Windows Shutdown 64-bit MIPS architecture MDAC Transistor X86 Sinclair ZX81 Visual Basic Game programming PaX X Window System Commodore 64 Password Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apple IIGS Microsoft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Thermostat Buffer overflow Compiler optimization Internet Explorer Plan 9 (operating system) Spacecraft propulsion Compiler Hard disk The Star Wars Holiday Special PowerPC MAME Computer Emulator Thread (computer science) Computer forensics Opera (web browser) Space shuttle main engine IMac Modem Expert system Overclocking Windows Server 2003 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Carburetor System 7 (Macintosh) Motorola 68000 Pressurized water reactor Logic Toyota Prius USB flash drive MSX Mozilla Firefox CP/M
