is this normal for a computer i am running windows xp with a amd sempron processer now according to everest my motherboard temp is c f the processor is running at c f and harddrive is at c f i am not gaming just have the internet going and my messengers i only have processers running in total and the side of my pc is off how can i cool things down a bit as i think its very hot to be safe the mb and hdd temps are not a problem but the cpu is high for a machine on idle what reading is everest giving from the pwm temp have you checked that the cpu fan is clean and spinning free might be worth giving it a blast with compressed air if you have some is the room you are using it in hot daft as it might sound having the side of your pc off might not be helping case design tends to force air in through the front and side and direct it out the back creating a through draft by taking the side panel off the air no longer circulates and instead just recycles itself try putting the side panel on and see what you get CPU design Central processing unit Athlon CPU cache RISC Microprocessor AMD Virtual memory Windows XP IBM PC compatible Overclocking Sempron 64-bit PC motherboard Super Nintendo Entertainment System IBM PC Athlon 64 Opteron Atari ST CDC 6600 Front side bus Pentium 4 AMD64 Commodore 128 IMac Celeron AMD K6-III Cyrix Personal computer Commodore 64 Emulator Timeline of computing 1990-forward Data General Nova Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer multitasking VIA C3 Vector processor Embedded system Graphics processing unit MIPS architecture Computer case Cray-1 Motorola 68000 History of Microsoft Windows MOS Technology 6502 PowerPC Windows 3.x Linux PlayStation 3 Computer bus Acorn Computers Thermal power station Operating system MAME Computer workstation SIMD Skype Symmetric multiprocessing Computer cooling INMOS Transputer Windows 2000 ATI Technologies AMD K6-2 Intel iAPX 432 Desktop computer Wintel PlayStation Portable Linux kernel Ethernet Solar power Pentium D Apple Computer Duron Clock rate PlayStation 2 Read-copy-update Sinclair ZX81 IA-32 ARM architecture Compiler optimization Spark plug Sega Dreamcast Pentium M CPU cooling Computer Northbridge (computing) Distributed computing MP3 CPU electrical consumption Casting Redundant array of independent disks
