reformatting hard disk on windows question i am reformatting my hard disk on my dell windows desktop computer it's a pretty old computer it's already formatting and i just realized that my files are getting erased and i would like to get those files back is there any way to backup those files now or is it too late i tried aborting it since i know all of the ms dos prompts is it possible to do it now it depends on how you're reformatting your hd if you're using format from the command prompt or the equivalent from the win ui then it's unlikely you'll be able to recover your files as i suspect the fats file allocation tables will have been trashed already that's why it gives you those warning messages along the lines of if you do this all data on the disk will be lost are you sure you want to continue if you're not just formatting but repartitioning fdisk the prospects are probably even worse if you're using something like partition magic you should be able to repartition your disk without losing files similarly if you're running the fat converter supplied with win you shouldn't lose any files i did this years ago after upgrading from win to win with no problems though aborting the process part way through would be a bad thing basically if the formatting process has already overwritten the fats then you're screwed because even the best disk recovery utilities won't know which sectors belong to which files if it hasn't you should still see some files on the disk and a good disk utility may be able to help you recover some of the deleted ones but i'd be quite surprised if that was the case it's much more likely gone forever File Allocation Table Floppy disk Hard disk Disk formatting File system Computer virus NTFS Redundant array of independent disks Data remanence Windows 2000 Backup Disk cloning System 7 (Macintosh) Apple II family Windows XP Pretty Good Privacy WordStar DOS Fdisk Atari 8-bit family Linux AmigaOS CIH virus Virtual memory Enterprise content management IBM PC compatible Computer forensics Atari ST Macintosh Finder Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Object Desktop Dd (Unix) Plaintext File format Btrieve USB flash drive Library (computer science) Data recovery Windows 95 DragonFly BSD Windows 3.x Booting Apple Macintosh OS/2 Logo programming language Windows Me Personal computer System/34 Digital photography CP/M Embedded system Ghost (software) MDAC Malware Files-11 Filename extension HFS Plus FreeDOS Screenshot Laptop Norton Utilities Forth programming language Shred Blue screen of death Flash memory IPod Linked list Operating system SAM Coup__ Defragmentation Sound recording BASIC programming language Password Hierarchical File System Novell NetWare Gmail Cache Computer security Common Unix Printing System Master Control Program Knoppix C programming language CPU cache Page table Microsoft Jet Database Engine Compact disc ZIP (file format) RSTS/E
