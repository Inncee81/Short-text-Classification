what is the biggest gig processor available for a desktop computer please list the gig not the number like etc what do you mean the gig the ghz rating between amd processors and intel processors isn't the same and doesn't tell you much since the newer chips run at lower clockspeeds but are more efficient for amd processors the number before the plus sign like is what tells you how fast they perform relative to older pentium chips with the newer intel chips you have to look at model numbers like e e the days when just the ghz rating tells you how fast a processor runs are looong gone you'd have to check benchmarks to see how they really perform for example amd's x runs at ghz but it's way faster than a ghz pentium d the rating means it runs slightly faster than a ghz pentium d the intel core duo runs at ghz but it's even faster than amd's x processor now that said i think the fastest desktop processor is the intel core duo e which runs at a stock speed of ghz but of course people overclock it higher the quad cores are for workstations and servers Opteron Overclocking AMD RISC Pentium III Microprocessor PowerPC Pentium Pentium D PR rating VIA C3 CPU design CPU cache Pentium Pro IA-32 Athlon 64 64-bit Cyrix AMD64 Clock rate Computer workstation MIPS architecture X86 AMD 5x86 Pentium II Windows XP Dual-core Central processing unit Transmeta IBM PC compatible NX bit AMD K6-III Symmetric multiprocessing Laptop DEC Alpha Benchmark (computing) AMD K6-2 Radeon Cell (microprocessor) Wintel CPU electrical consumption AltiVec Intel History of Microsoft Windows AMD K6 HyperTransport Mac OS Northbridge (computing) ThinkPad AMD K5 Intel 80486 IA-64 Linux kernel MOS Technology 6502 Silicon Graphics Personal computer Mac OS X Novell NetWare Itanium 2 Athlon 64 X2 GeForce 6 Series ATI Technologies Bluetooth SGI Visual Workstation Intel i860 Duron Montecito Timeline of computing 1990-forward Computer Sun Microsystems Moore's law Operating system PlayStation 3 Branch predictor Am386 VIA Technologies DDR2 SDRAM Conroe 3dfx Power Mac G5 Cisco PIX IMac PDP-11
