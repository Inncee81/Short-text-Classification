press f or del which one do i do i have a problem with my pc when i start up it goes the cmos screen where it says motherboard name processor name and spped amount of ram hard drive types and jumperssettings and it says press f to continue or del to enter set up then i have to press f to load into windows vista why can't it run straight into windows vista with out having to press f have you had this computer long if not then take it back to the store from where you bought it or get in touch with their tech support under the warranty if you recently upgraded a computer that you have had for a while then check that the date is right i think it may be your cmos battery it should be replaced every one to two years depending on the amount of times the computer is switched on if this battery fails or is discharged when the computer starts up it cannot access the bios and you will have to replace the battery it's usually a cr about from maplin in the uk if you feel confident enough to replace it use a folded kitchen tissue to handle the battery as touching it with your bare fingers is enough to discharge quite a sizeable charge from the battery thus wiping it out if you know it's not your battery then enter your bios as the computer starts up using del or f according to the message on the screen then you want to find the restore defaults or optimal settings and confirm this before restarting maybe something got a bit messed up at some point Windows XP Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible IPod CMOS Laptop BIOS Embedded system Booting Apple Macintosh CPU cache Virtual memory AmigaOS History of Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk Personal computer 64-bit Computer virus Modchip X86 Digital photography Commodore 64 IBM PC Atari 8-bit family X86 assembly language Windows Vista Apple Computer Mouse (computing) Ethernet Toyota Prius Computer forensics Emacs NX bit Mainframe computer Nonvolatile BIOS memory System/36 Apple IIGS Knoppix Hard disk CPU design Commodore 128 TRS-80 Microsoft Windows RISC Battery (electricity) System/34 Mach kernel Motorola 68000 PC Engine USB flash drive ZX Spectrum Linux Radiation hardening Windows Server 2003 Overclocking NeXT Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis System 7 (Macintosh) PowerBook Library (computer science) Sinclair ZX81 Read-only memory TRS-80 Color Computer History of operating systems Hybrid vehicle Windows 95 MDAC Compiler optimization IMac Non-volatile memory Mac OS X Windows 3.x AMD64 PlayStation 3 Advanced Technology Attachment File Allocation Table Danger Hiptop Unicode Central processing unit Modem Macintosh Finder Timeline of computing 1990-forward PlayStation 2 Apple II family Palm OS Digital Microprocessor Java programming language Gmail PDP-8
