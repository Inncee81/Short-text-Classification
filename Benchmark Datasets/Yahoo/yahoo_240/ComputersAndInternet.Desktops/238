my pc system won't start at all after i changed my fsb speed from to i lowered my fsb speed because i was having trouble installing wow and i saw an answer from a support site that said if i lowered my fsb speed it would load it did load and everything looked fine and the game started but when i shut it off and turned it back on to change the settings back it never booted now what i can't get back in to change my bios back try clearing the cmos jumper on the motherboard there should be a pin header with a jumper on it labeled clear cmos or clear rtc move the jumper from pins to pins wait a few seconds and move it back then try it again either that or unplug the computer and remove the little coin battery from the motherboard either of these will load the bios defaults if it does not post after that then you might have fried something Nonvolatile BIOS memory CMOS Universal Serial Bus Front side bus Modchip Booting BIOS Computer forensics Ethernet Hard disk Floppy disk Windows XP Advanced Technology Attachment Commodore 64 Athlon Pentium D Knoppix USB flash drive Digital photography Redundant array of independent disks Jumper (computing) Computer bus Windows 2000 RS-232 Nintendo Entertainment System AmigaOS Dog agility Personal computer Celeron Thermal power station MOS Technology 6502 Read-only memory Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family ATI Technologies IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ATX Sega Saturn Pentium 4 Bluetooth MSX Motherboard X86 assembly language Integrated circuit Mouse (computing) Embedded system MOS Technology Southbridge (computing) PC motherboard NForce4 Cisco PIX AMD ZX Spectrum Domain Name System Fischer Random Chess High jump Duron Apple Desktop Bus Apple IIGS Parachuting Field-programmable gate array NX bit MIPS architecture Power-On Self Test Overclocking Pinball Data General Nova Kurt Angle KIM-1 Zilog Z80 Wire wrap BS 1363 Armored Core Apple Intel transition Protoss Modem Dynamic random access memory Pittsburgh Steelers Toyota Prius Amiga Apple Macintosh Partition (computing) TRS-80 Color Computer FreeDOS Nintendo GameCube Equine conformation Hybrid Synergy Drive GRand Unified Bootloader PlayStation Portable HyperText Transfer Protocol ABIT Fritz-chip Gordon Banks Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Commodore 128
