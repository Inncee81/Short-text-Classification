i need you badly i am goin to die well some guyson the net and websites been saying that the dell dimension c is a bad computer but the tech specs say other wise look i beg you my components amd athlon x dual core genuine windows vista home premium gb dual channel ddr sdram at mhz dimms gb serial ata hard drive rpm w databurst cache x dvd rw drive mb ati radeon x integrated channel audio dell usb keyboard and dell optical usb mouse no floppy drive included k pci data fax modem is this a really suck computer and cant play games and cant do studd like civ and the lates pc games and cant do basic stuff answer me yes or no i need you ty for you time ps will the lates games and civ sims empire earth golden etc work on the vista program installed on my pc ty for your time it does not necessarily suck it just is not a higher end gaming system a dell xps series system would be a better choice for gaming if affordable the cost can quickly mount up to several thousand dollars if you get the latest greatest technology with all the fancy bells and whistles included the rule in buying gaming machines is to get the best that you can afford you will just have to check the specific minimum system requirements for each game to determine if they will work with your system and are vista compatible vista still has a lot of compatibility problems to address for now some games software components and periphreals simply will not work on a vista system vista is not yet really ready for some of the higher end games either many games actually run slower on vista than they do on windows xp also vista uses more memory but gbs should be sufficient for now however vista comes with directx backward compatible to c which some newer games utilize for better graphics and sound the processor should be adequate for most current games and some newer ones the mb ati radeon x although supposedly certified for vista is an older video card that may be borderline for the next generation games again you will just have to check the games minimum system requirements to determine if they will work with this card or save up for a better one later for gaming if there is a choice i would recommend using windows xp until microsoft works out some of the compatibility problems and releases their first service pack sometime next year microsoft is really pushing vista even though it still has problems after the end of this year microsoft will no longer allow oem manufacturers of new systems such as dell to install or sell xp by the way service pack for windows xp may be released early next year if the current pre beta testing goes well they will not commit to any approximate release date for vista service pack so it may be awhile Microsoft Windows Linux Mac OS X Atari ST 3dfx DDR2 SDRAM IBM PC 64-bit Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound Blaster Microprocessor Amstrad CPC Microsoft Bluetooth CPU design Windows 3.x Windows Server 2003 AmigaOS DVD Sega Dreamcast Amiga The Sims 2 IBook GeForce 4 Central processing unit CPU cache Secure Digital card History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Nintendo GameCube Computer VIA Technologies IPod Apple Computer Computer and video games AMD Pentium 4 Mouse (computing) X Window System Sega Saturn MIPS architecture PowerBook Commodore International Apple IIGS Athlon Desktop computer Radeon X Series PlayStation Portable Athlon 64 RISC Doom 3 X86 PC motherboard Overclocking Copy protection Blue screen of death TRS-80 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Opteron Commodore 128 TRS-80 Color Computer Cyrix System/36 MS-DOS
