what does it mean to overclock overclocking is essentially setting the speed of the cpu in your bios to run faster than it is supposed to it typically runs as a multiplier of the system bus speed ex x bus speed something like that and then causes the processor to run at the new multiplied speed internally this increases performance but can be risky if you dont know what you are doing you may also have to adjust voltage to make up for more power that will be needed Front side bus Athlon Central processing unit Celeron Microprocessor CPU design RISC IBM PC compatible Pentium 4 MIPS architecture Computer bus Opteron CPU cache AMD 5x86 Data General Nova CDC 6600 Hard disk Northbridge (computing) PowerPC VIA C3 INMOS Transputer Apple Macintosh Emulator Vector processor Radeon Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Personal computer Commodore 128 Clock rate IBM PC Motorola 68000 Oscilloscope Operational amplifier Tandem Computers Cray-1 Microprogram Pentium M Athlon 64 64-bit Apollo Guidance Computer Computer architecture Redundant array of independent disks Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Field-programmable gate array Computer cooling Mach kernel HyperTransport Pentium Pro HP 9000 Hybrid vehicle Intel i860 Supercomputer Spacecraft propulsion Advanced Technology Attachment Digital circuit Assembly language PR rating PDP-8 PC motherboard Pentium D AMD K6-III CMOS ARM architecture Pentium Computer Universal Serial Bus Cyrix Super Nintendo Entertainment System Cray-2 CP/M SCSI Control Data Corporation SETI@home Embedded system Sega Saturn DDR SDRAM NeXT Superscalar ABIT Pentium III Micro Channel architecture Risc PC X86 Wintel Pentium II Zilog Z80 Dual-core AltiVec IA-64 Power Macintosh G3 3dfx TRS-80 Color Computer Low voltage differential signaling PDP-11 Computer workstation X86 assembly language MAME
