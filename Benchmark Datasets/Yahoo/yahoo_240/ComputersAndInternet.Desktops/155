i left my computer on all night when it shut down it worked just fine but when i turned it on it won't wor i just turned my computer off after it had been on all night and then i turned it on again and it won't load past the dell logo at all and this is the first time it's happened what should i do either a particular component fried possibly the processor or somehow a virus or hacker got onto your computer and really screwed things up since you see the dell logo that means the bios should have loaded successfully an operation completely independant of the processor so maybe your problem is the processor in any event depending on how computer motivated you are i would consider taking out the hard drive and scanning it for viruses on a different computer if your computer is still under warranty then have dell look at it before you open it yourself hope that helps good luck IBM PC compatible Computer virus Windows XP Booting Floppy disk Computer security CPU cache Dell, Inc.
