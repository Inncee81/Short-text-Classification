i have a gateway desktop that i want to restore can i use the recovery disks from my hp laptop to do it my gateway desktop needs to be restored and i can not find the recovery disks for it i recently bought a hp laptop and have the recovery disks for that will it work to use them first thing you need to know was your desktop using the same version of windows as the laptop example windows xp home or pro sp example windows xp home or pro sp second does the desktop have a windows genuine product key sticker on the side of it's case if it does have it's own product key that product key will only work on the version of windows that was originally installed on the desktop so lets say your desktop came with windowsxp media home sp and your laptop came with windows xp home sp the key for the desktop will not work on the disk that came with the laptop the product and version have to be exactly the same you should not use the product keycode from the laptop on the desktop because it will need to be activated that key is already registered to the laptop both machines will need a seperate product key for it's os if both machines were using the same version of windows and you have two product keys after you install the hp disk to the gateway you are going to have to go over to the gateway website support drivers section put in the make model of the gateway and download all the drivers for that machine because the hp disk will not have them are you sure your gateway came with disks it might be possible that the gateway came with a windows image recovery which is located on the d partition of the hard drive when you boot up the gateway and it's on the black bootup screen do you see an option to press example f for setup if you see that option on the black boot up screen then use that option if it asks for a disk then your s o l if it brings up a recovery screen follow the directions on how to recover it using the windows xp image recovery good luck Windows 2000 Windows Vista Hard disk IBM PC compatible History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Laptop AmigaOS Blue screen of death Linux System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Windows Atari ST SUSE Linux Floppy disk Bluetooth USB flash drive Knoppix Stardock Booting Windows Server 2003 File Allocation Table PowerBook Redundant array of independent disks Mac OS X Macintosh Finder Partition (computing) Desktop computer Object Desktop IBook TRS-80 Apple Computer NTFS Steam (content delivery) Mandriva Linux LiveCD ThinkPad PlayStation 2 ATI Technologies Atari 8-bit family WordStar Personal computer Apple II family Windows 3.x Windows Me Computer forensics DOS NeXT Commodore 128 Radeon File system Architecture of Windows 2000 Copy protection Microsoft BIOS VAIO Screenshot IMac Commodore International Mouse (computing) Power Macintosh G3 MAME IBM PC DR-DOS Television Kazaa Microprocessor OS/2 GNOME Symbian OS Wi-Fi X Window System Backup Windows Mobile Forth programming language Google Desktop Macromedia Flash Creative Zen OpenBSD Microsoft Office Pretty Good Privacy Kaypro Desknote Acorn Archimedes QuickTime Boot image FreeDOS Common Unix Printing System Computer hardware
