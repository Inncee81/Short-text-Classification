what is the difference between the intel core duo and the intel core extreme apple is using in its imacs apart from the clock speed also are they both bit the core duo extreme processors are unlocked if you want to overclock a extreme the multiplier and fsb can go much higher than a core duo i wouldn't try to overclock a imac but if someone out there is into extreme overclocking try a core duo extreme make sure you use a really good cpu fan or water cooling the extreme processor will give you a lot more processing power when gaming or multi threading and by the way both processors are bit the guy above me was wrong check apple com Overclocking Pentium 4 Athlon Celeron Central processing unit Apple Macintosh RISC IMac Apple Computer CPU design CPU cache Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Power Mac G5 Pentium III 64-bit Athlon 64 PowerPC G4 Opteron Xeon AMD VIA C3 Motorola 68000 Radeon Northbridge (computing) Mac OS X PowerBook PowerPC Clock rate Dual-core GeForce 6 Series ATI Technologies NX bit Computer workstation CDC 6600 Itanium 2 Hyper-threading MIPS architecture Montecito ARM architecture Power Macintosh G3 Pentium II Apple Intel transition Timeline of computing 1990-forward MOS Technology 6502 Sempron PR rating IBM PC compatible CPU cooling Desktop computer Cell (microprocessor) Symmetric multiprocessing IA-64 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer X86 Watercooling Radeon X Series AltiVec Intel i860 PC motherboard IBM PC Mac OS X v10.4 Distributed computing Field-programmable gate array Pentium Pro Intel XScale Multicore NVIDIA AMD 5x86 NForce4 Simultaneous multithreading IBM POWER Xbox 360 AMD K6-III Linux kernel Computer cooling PlayStation 3 EMac Windows XP Compiler optimization Moore's law ABIT Operating system Power Mac G4 Conroe Intel iAPX 432 Silicon Graphics Wintel Intel 80486
