which processor is faster intel core duo ghz or inter core quad ghz the ghz processor is just basically processors at ghz total but the ghz is quad so x basically is a lot faster the intel core quad is much faster in a nutshell the is faster but technically speaking the quad is you're better off with the Xeon PowerPC VIA C3 Pentium III Celeron Athlon Pentium M Opteron Itanium 2 AMD PR rating PowerPC G4 Pentium D Central processing unit PC motherboard Northbridge (computing) RISC Intel iAPX 432 PowerBook Cell (microprocessor) AMD64 Duron SGI Visual Workstation Microprocessor CPU design Power Mac G5 CPU cache Intel i860 NVIDIA Montecito Clock rate Bluetooth MIPS architecture Moore's law Mac OS X v10.4 64-bit PlayStation 3 Pentium Pro Silicon Graphics EMac Wintel Transmeta PearPC Apple Macintosh ThinkPad 3dfx Quadrics Speed of light Computer Pentium IBM PC Zilog Z80 ARM architecture Athlon 64 Xserve GeForce 6 Series IEEE 802.11 X86 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Apple Intel transition Athlon 64 X2 DEC Alpha The Sims 2: Nightlife Intel XScale Mac OS X Front side bus Conroe AMD K6-III WiMAX Simultaneous multithreading Intel i960 Amstrad CPC Overclocking IBM POWER CPU electrical consumption IA-32 Hyper-threading ATI Technologies Dual-core Advanced Scientific Computer Wireless LAN MAME Cyrix MOS Technology 6502 Xbox Intel Timeline of computing 1990-forward AMD K6-2 Dynamic random access memory Roller skating SPARC OpenGL Operating system Microsoft Windows Mac OS NeXT IA-64 Benchmark (computing)
