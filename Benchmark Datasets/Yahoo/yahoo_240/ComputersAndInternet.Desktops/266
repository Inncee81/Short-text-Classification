is this okay for a gaming pc i'm planning to buy a desktop and it's for gaming purposes from what i've chosen these are the basic parts amd athlon x gigs of ddr ram geforce gt gigs of hard disk from the components i've picked is this okay because it's just nice for my budget as for other things such as power supplies and which motherboard is better can anyone tell me which should i choose for the sli and overclocking part i have totally no idea what they're talking can anyone please explain to me here finally is this pc able to go for the long run because i wouldn't want it to be outdated so soon for the gaming purposes do not get gb ram because your computer will only recognize gb ram if you run bit operating software you could run bit os but it is definitely not compatible with alot of games if you are on a tight budget amd products are a good thing to stick with but intel's core duo series are much much faster than equal amd x series so you may want to spend some extra bucks geforce gt is fine for a budget pc it won't run your newest games at high setting though and it sure wouldn't last more than year as well get if you are using windows xp or for windows vista is much cheaper though and is a power consuming hog you need w power supply for w for and w for hard disk drive is fine make sure it is brand manufacturer like samsung seagate or western digital i prefer samsung in my own opinion due to it being the quietest for motherboard go for either asus gigabyte or evga products make sure they are amd compatible if you are getting athlon getting these motherboards with nforce northbridge series is a plus if you are looking for a sli mode later on sli is basically putting two same sli compatible geforce graphic cards into sli compatible nforce northbridge motherboard double the power but double the power consumption and much hotter system you shouldn't try to sli it if your computer case do not have enough case fans overclocking means just making your components usually cpu graphic card or ram run faster than it is suppose to be running we call it stock speed overclocked components often perform better than stocked one but they get much hotter so you need a very decent cooling sytem to your components like better fans and heatsinks mind ya overclocking is for expert only it will kill your system very quickly if you don't know what you are doing your pc assuming you are using gb ram with bit os will last about years after years if you change your graphic card assuming you still went for gt and add one more gb ram it will probably last another years hope this helped good luck with your new system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NForce4 64-bit PC motherboard Apple Macintosh CPU design Athlon 64 Opteron Windows XP Front side bus History of Microsoft Windows AMD64 Northbridge (computing) Redundant array of independent disks PlayStation 3 Commodore 64 Graphics processing unit Timeline of computing 1990-forward Laptop X86 CPU cache Dynamic random access memory IBM PC Microsoft Windows Wintel Amiga Computer workstation Computer GeForce 4 RISC VIA Technologies Central processing unit Commodore 128 Windows 2000 Linux Windows Vista AmigaOS Cyrix IMac Xbox PowerPC IA-32 Flash memory ZX Spectrum Desktop computer DDR2 SDRAM Apple IIGS PlayStation 2 NeXT Atari 8-bit family Pentium D Graphics card X86 assembly language Sound Blaster USB flash drive Computer cooling Amstrad CPC MSX Universal Serial Bus NForce2 GeForce 2 PlayStation Portable Apple II family Windows 3.x MS-DOS VIA C3 Xbox 360 AMD K6-III Doom 3 GeForce 7 Series Virtual memory Socket 939 INMOS Transputer BIOS History of computing hardware (1960s-present) GeForce FX GeForce Pentium M Commodore International File Allocation Table
