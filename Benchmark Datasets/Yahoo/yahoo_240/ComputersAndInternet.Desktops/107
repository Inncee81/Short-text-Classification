can i run windows xp and vista on the same computer yes in fact that's called a dualboot it's where the hard drive is partitioned into two or more sections where an operating system can be installed on the separate sections so first use a partition manager like one made by norton or you can just use one the windows installer disc anyway partition it up into two sections and imo give the bigger section for vista all right now the critical part remember to install xp first on the smaller part if you made said part smaller thats the important thing to remember xp first after that install vista on the second section and the vista bootmanager will recognize xp and make the boot screen where when you start the computer a screen will ask whether to run vista or an older version of windows you can change that to saying just windows xp but that's another thing so do that and you're done Windows XP Microsoft Windows Partition (computing) Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible File system Booting Windows Vista DOS File Allocation Table Knoppix NTFS Linux Windows Server 2003 USB flash drive AmigaOS DragonFly BSD MS-DOS Dual boot Virtual memory Computer virus Disk cloning Windows 3.x History of the graphical user interface FreeDOS System 7 (Macintosh) Apple Macintosh Hard disk Kernel (computer science) Ghost (software) Operating system LiveCD DirectX Mac OS X Windows 95 Windows API Drive letter assignment PlayStation 2 Microsoft NTLDR Macintosh Finder X Window System IPod Portable Document Format Quicksort Redundant array of independent disks Emacs Internet Explorer Btrieve Atari ST Comparison of file systems Fritz-chip BIOS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows registry Apple II family Windows Me NeXT HP-UX Xbox NX bit GNOME OpenGL ReactOS Copy protection WindowBlinds Puppy Linux Mandriva Linux Modchip Rootkit Floppy disk Library (computer science) Visual Basic Stardock OS/2 SUSE Linux Riemann integral Modem Macromedia Flash X86 DOS Comparison Object Desktop QuickTime MIPS architecture DR-DOS Mach kernel Graphical Environment Manager Windows Media Player Hello world program Laptop Apple Computer Computer forensics MAME Sega Dreamcast Fdisk Mac OS history IA-32 Amiga Blue Gene
