my father put windows vista on my computer i hate it how do i get it off my computer i would like to got back to windows xp any suggetions on how i can do this myself you can get a hold of an old windows xp cd and reformat the computer with it usually when u put the cd in and boot up your computer it asks if you want to boot from the cd so you do that and it pretty much takes it from there all you have to do is watch and hit a couple buttons and configure the computer and tell it to format the hard drive but doing so will cause you to lose everything on your computer like your software you have loaded on your computer and word files pictures and music but it will also run alot faster after so do so at your own risk IPod Windows XP Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Linux Mouse (computing) Booting USB flash drive IBM PC compatible Computer virus Windows 2000 File system Partition (computing) Apple Macintosh Apple II family Screenshot File Allocation Table BIOS Disk cloning Windows Vista Hard disk Windows registry FreeDOS Sony Computer forensics Personal computer Windows Server 2003 NTFS Windows 3.x DOS Floppy disk Microsoft System/36 System 7 (Macintosh) History of Microsoft Windows Portable Document Format MS-DOS Dual boot Redundant array of independent disks ITunes History of the graphical user interface Mac OS X v10.4 Mac OS X Virtual memory Library (computer science) MIPS architecture Windows 95 Knoppix Xbox Embedded system Apple Computer Blue screen of death NeXT Atari 8-bit family Mandriva Linux Computer software Hello world program Server NTLDR MAME Atari ST Operating system PlayStation 2 Ebook Data remanence Macintosh Finder WordStar Kernel (computer science) Filename extension Digital photography Common Unix Printing System Stardock RAM disk Btrieve Proxy server OS/2 Classic (Mac OS X) Fritz-chip Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Computer and video games Forth programming language Thread (computer science) Data General Nova SAM Coup__ NX bit ZX Spectrum Emacs Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IMac PlayStation Portable Object Desktop Commodore 64 Computer program Appliance Acorn Electron GRand Unified Bootloader Computer Macromedia Flash IA-64
