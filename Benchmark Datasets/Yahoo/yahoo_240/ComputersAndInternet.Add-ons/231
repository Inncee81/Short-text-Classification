nothing on monitor after installing new video card ideas i had to buy a new pc it came with vista yuk and it had an onboard video adapter or something vista is bad enough as far as memory goes so i bought a nvidia geforce gt w mb pci e to help free up my pc some btw if you run vista you better have gb ram ok so i installed the new card loaded the new drivers from the cd which were the same as the latest on the web believe it or not and then rebooted fine i didn't even think about switching where my monitor was plugged in from the motherboard to the new card but maybe it doesn't matter anyway it booted up fine and i had the nvidia control panel available but it seemed like it locked up on occasion yesterday after a lockup reboot i didn't see the nvidia cp i checked the card resituated it to make sure it was fully inserted correctly but then device manager did not recognize it so i reinstalled the drivers but when i plug my monitor into the card i see nothing on my screen why sounds like your onboard video card is taking priority over your new video card try going into bios and turning the onboard card off and then save and reboot your computer make sure your monitor is switched from your onboard to your new card after you do the bios switch and reboot Windows 2000 ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Booting 3dfx Personal computer Modchip Universal Serial Bus Graphics card Apple Macintosh BIOS Radeon Commodore 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Knoppix Apple II family Graphics processing unit AmigaOS Fritz-chip GeForce 7 Series Xbox Blue screen of death PlayStation 3 Commodore 128 IPod Power Macintosh G3 Microsoft Windows Sega Dreamcast Atari 8-bit family Amiga FreeDOS Computer bus IMac PCI Express Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System History of operating systems Upper Memory Area System/36 GeForce 4 Computer hardware PC motherboard NForce4 Overclocking ZX Spectrum Atari ST Desktop computer NForce2 Surveillance Windows Server 2003 Apple IIGS Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Scalable Link Interface NForce Sound Blaster Floppy disk GeForce FX System/34 Secure Digital card Computer forensics History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 Sega Saturn Game Boy Advance Federal Standard 1037C Advanced Technology Attachment Color Graphics Adapter GeForce 2 Ethernet DirectX OpenGL Mac OS X Windows 3.x Sound card Computer virus Device driver Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bluetooth PlayStation Portable System 7 (Macintosh) Hard disk Computer Peripheral Component Interconnect Old World ROM Cyrix STS-61 Power-On Self Test
