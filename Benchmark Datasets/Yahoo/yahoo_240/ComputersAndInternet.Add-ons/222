how come quad core processors aren t making their way into commercial desktops yet the only companies that make quad core desktops that are affordable and ibuypower and velocity micro velocity micro is barely affordable but quad core chips are for a ghz chip so cheap nobody really wants to fry eggs on their desktops at this time basically quad core is struggling massively with things as the first line in my answers suggests they are hot little bunnies in a commercial dataroom this isn't much of an issue as they tend to be air conditioned and super cool anyway at home in your bedroom under a desk they become a neat way of making an insurance claim home software just isn't designed to take advantage of even dual core in a big way let alone quad the applications and os need to know how to get at the additional processing power otherwise there really is just no performance advantage we'll see them in time but to be perfectly frank i would rather run a dual board with dual gpu than spend the money on quad cores Microprocessor Central processing unit AMD Supercomputer CPU design ATI Technologies 3dfx PowerPC RISC Dual-core Floppy disk IMac Cell (microprocessor) Radeon IBM PC compatible Athlon VIA C3 GeForce 6 Series Laptop History of computing hardware (1960s-present) PlayStation 3 Computer Apple Macintosh NVIDIA PowerPC G4 Transmeta Graphics processing unit Celeron Desktop computer Sun Microsystems Personal computer 64-bit Xeon CPU cache Home computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System MIPS architecture Nintendo Revolution Pentium D Acorn Computers Xbox 360 Pentium Pro IBM POWER Apple Intel transition Windows XP Overclocking Extreme Programming Power Mac G5 Transistor Embedded system Mac OS X v10.4 Mac OS X Gas turbine Commodore International X86 Apple IIGS Commodore 64 Desktop publishing W.
