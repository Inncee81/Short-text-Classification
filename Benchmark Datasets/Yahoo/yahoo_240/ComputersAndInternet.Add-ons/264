a quick queston about my wireless router hi everyone after today's thunderstorm my wireless router has gone dead i've tried unplugging and replugging it but it is stll not working i was wondering if i needed to get a new one or there were ways to fix it first thought is it got hit by over current or voltage spike will it turn on at all you could check to see if the ac adapter is what got damaged check the voltage of the adapter and see if you have another like it important to match the voltage exactly if you can do that and the router still will not work then i would have to say that it is damaged and you will need to buy a new one while you are at it you should have a good surge protector on all your computer equipment not the ones but spend at least it will be worth it in the long run tripp lite makes some nice products http www tripplite com products suppressors protectit cfm Universal Serial Bus Federal Standard 1037C Cisco Systems Router Wi-Fi Volt Lightning rod Electricity Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Circuit design Web crawler Overvoltage Differentiated services Operational amplifier CMOS Poker jargon Embedded system Denial-of-service attack Transistor Impedance Oscilloscope Wood router Diode Radiation hardening Nickel-cadmium battery Tesla coil Network address translation Xbox Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cathode ray tube IEEE 802.11 Lightning Welding Impedance matching Membrane potential Transformer Electricity meter Vacuum tube Electric power transmission Overclocking M16 (rifle) Circuit breaker 3Com Corporation Hewlett-Packard Floppy disk Spark gap Internet protocol suite Communications protocol Lightning safety Debugging Telegraphy Personal computer Switched-mode power supply Internet Alternator Incandescent light bulb Galactic Civilizations Overhead powerline Potentiometer CPU cache Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Lineman (occupation) Spark plug Nintendo DS Gauge theory Dimmer SCSI Electronic amplifier Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Battery electric vehicle MAC address Internet Group Management Protocol Mobile ad-hoc network Paintball Wireless LAN Power strip Electrophysiology GunZ The Duel Bluetooth Internet fraud Global Positioning System Electrical generator PlayStation Portable Fuse (electrical) Transmitter LAN party Wind turbine Final Fantasy XI Capacitor plague Drill bit Overhead lines Action potential Chess 2005 Kashmir earthquake Chess strategy and tactics Microprocessor Battery (electricity) HyperText Transfer Protocol Password Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
