uses for an old computer with linux what would be some cool things i could convert this old computer to using linux currently i am thinking of a combination printer server webcam server regular server also i am unable to run more than one camera at a time i am guessing because of usb speed because i only have usb ports so would it work to install a usb pci card as for using linux on it great idea i've had linux running on just about anything currently using ubuntu on my laptop but i've gotten dsl linux running great on my old pentium mhz mb ram w no usb ports you could probably host a camera on it as well as a print server but networking linux pc's to windows pc's is sometimes confusing though i can print from ubuntu to a windows vista hosted printer but i've never tried the other way around as for the usb i'm sure you could connect two usb cameras to the same computer and get two streams most likely it's not usb that's causing it but the computer is too slow to run two cams at a time much less serve them over a network internet USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh Laptop Bluetooth Windows XP Linux Common Unix Printing System Novell NetWare Sharp Zaurus IBM PC compatible PowerPC IMac Timeline of computing 1990-forward PlayStation 2 Damn Small Linux Digital camera Hard disk Digital photography Linux kernel Windows Server 2003 History of Microsoft Windows X Window System Microsoft Windows IPod Windows Vista Xbox Mac OS X AirPort Windows 2000 LiveCD Mandriva Linux FireWire ReactOS IBook Desktop computer Personal computer Operating system Peripheral Component Interconnect Computer PlayStation Portable ATI Technologies Microprocessor Wi-Fi USB mass storage device class Secure Digital card Computer virus Computer bus Softmodem Mach kernel 64-bit Commodore 64 PC motherboard Proxy server RS-232 Bootable business card MicroATX Sequent Computer Systems Xbox 360 Digital video recorder Atari ST Streaming media Quake Internet Ubuntu Linux Radeon ZX Spectrum Timeline of computing IBM PC Dongle Redundant array of independent disks Power Macintosh G3 VMware Xserve MSN Messenger SUSE Linux PS2 Linux Knoppix Device driver QEMU Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Apple Computer SCSI Voice over IP Secure Shell StepMania Cheating in Counter-Strike Skype Pentium M Computer forensics PC card
