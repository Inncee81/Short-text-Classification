my external hard drive spins down after minutes of inactivity how to keep that from happening i have a gb wd my book connected to my vista pc via firewire and i use it frequently it works fine but it can take around seconds for the drive to spin back up out of power save mode and during file operations related to the drive applications freeze until it has had time to spin back up i would ideally like to control the amount of time that elapses prior to it spinning down because i assume the power save mode extends the life of the drive as well as saving power wd says the spindown delay is set at minutes and is not configurable so does anyone know of an application that will periodically write a small amount of data to the drive so it won't spin down thanks in advance note windows does not provide power management options for external drives through control panel also i'm pretty sure you cannot control settings for an external device such as a firewire hard drive through system bios unfortunately this is supposed to be a clever move by wd and cannot be changed we had exactly the same problem for our back up drives by the time the back up was run the drives had spun down so the back up failed unfortunately wd are no help we created a txt file on each drive and scheduled a command file to run and write to the drive every minutes are you familiar with writing cmd files i have to go now apologies will try and pop back later ok i've got minutes keep drive alive now f alive txt is the command we use obviously this will change depending on your drive letter choose file save as keep alive cmd create an alive txt folder on your drive create a scheduled by start all programs accessories system tools schedule tasks in the run part type c keep alive cmd the actual path of your command and enter the time frame you want the command to run at ie minutes this will be done on schedule advanced hope i've made a little sense there i've confused myself Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Windows Vista Floppy disk Hard disk IPod File Allocation Table NTFS Domain Name System Windows XP Mouse (computing) File system System 7 (Macintosh) System/36 IBM PC compatible Common Unix Printing System Mac OS X Embedded system Architecture of Windows 2000 Linux Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive Advanced Technology Attachment FireWire Computer Filename extension Macintosh Finder System/34 COMMAND.COM Btrieve AmigaOS CPU design CP/M Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer virus Apple Macintosh Blue screen of death File Transfer Protocol Master Control Program Virtual memory Screenshot Cmd.exe Partition (computing) ITunes Booting Object Desktop Debugging Thread (computer science) Windows registry Mach kernel Visual Basic Spring operating system Digital photography File format Data General Nova Microsoft Windows IMac Launchd Emacs Atari 8-bit family Control Panel (Windows) Forth programming language Expert system Time travel AS/400 Command Language Apple typography Modem Oscilloscope Palm OS Apple IIGS Computer bus Digital circuit DOS System 6 History of Microsoft Windows Windows 3.x MS-DOS Central processing unit Windows Me Ethernet CPU cache FreeDOS Diablo II Library (computer science) PlayStation Portable Windows Server 2003 Air traffic control Mac OS history Bluetooth Graphical Environment Manager NTFS junction point Computer multitasking
