format drive c i have partitions on my hard drive c d e and i want to format drive c to be able to reinstall my os can i format drive c alone without affecting drives d e please show me how to do it im using xp but what if i want to have a clean install of vista on that partition will it work vista system requirements is not a problem hmmm this question indicates to me that you are not sure what you are doing so a full system backup all partitions is essential here so you can undo what you did if it all goes wrong first question is do you really want to format the partition it is possible to simply delete all the data and then install over the top reformatting a single partition shouldn't be necessary for an os reinstall simply allow the os install program to handle the fixing of any problem data if you really want to format then the following assumes that you are using xp as you do not specify os make sure your bios is set to boot from cd as a first choice put xp cd into drive shut down pc using software shutdown restart pc allow cd to run it's course until you have an option select install choose c as your partition to install to agree to format sit back and wait Booting Redundant array of independent disks Knoppix Partition (computing) Floppy disk Disk formatting Hard disk Windows XP Linux Virtual memory File Allocation Table AmigaOS Disk cloning Ethernet Computer virus Windows 2000 NTFS System/36 Windows Vista Expert system Backup CPU cache File system IBM PC compatible System 7 (Macintosh) BIOS IPod Blue screen of death Embedded system DOS Copy protection History of Microsoft Windows Dual boot Enterprise content management DragonFly BSD MDAC Debugging Architecture of Windows 2000 MAME Malware Page replacement algorithms IA-32 Mach kernel Windows registry Advanced Technology Attachment Microsoft Windows Common Unix Printing System Ontology (computer science) Unicode Fritz-chip DVD Windows Me Quicksort Btrieve NX bit X86 assembly language Modchip Data remanence Macintosh Finder Extreme Programming IBM 700/7000 series Spyware Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Modem CP/M Portable Document Format FreeDOS System/34 CPU design Dd (Unix) Computer forensics Kernel (computer science) Steam (content delivery) Page table Collision detection Master Control Program Mac OS X Apple Macintosh Atari 8-bit family PaX PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay TRS-80 Copyright infringement of software Domain Name System E-mail Burroughs B5000 Mozilla Firefox Xbox Spring operating system Database Mouse (computing) Ebook Windows Server 2003 Toyota Prius Year 2000 problem Anti-virus software Musical Instrument Digital Interface Appliance Computer security
