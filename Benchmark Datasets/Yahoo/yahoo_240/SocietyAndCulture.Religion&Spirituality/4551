how can we prevent religious ideas from closing our minds and stunting our ability to see color in the world i am referring to how certain religious ideas close people's minds and prevent them from seeing obvious truths or seeing things from multiple points of view religion particularly a lot of members from the abrahamic religions that i see seem to have a big problem when it comes to understanding the world from multiple points of view they see black and white when it comes to certain issues it seems obvious that certain issues such as gay or transgender issues have a scientific explanation for happening yet religion seems to hinder people's acceptance of these things because they aren't keeping an open mind they are not allowing enough information to be passed through their wall of most people within the fences of religion see it as a source of love and tolerance and that might be mostly true but how do we help those who are victims of ignorance religious people are already blinded and their minds are already closed what can we do about it try to educate people more the only hope to get them out of their ignorance is education education education Sexual orientation Religion Atheism Supernatural Scientology beliefs and practices Fundamentalism Theory of conduct Coercion Transsexuality Free will Idolatry Ten Commandments Teach the Controversy Phillip E.
