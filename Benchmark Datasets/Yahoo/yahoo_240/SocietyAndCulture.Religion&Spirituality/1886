i so like all the jewish people i've met where does the likeability factor comes from i mean it here may be unpleasant unfriendly people jewish or from israel but i hve never met any i am not jewish myself i'm half catholic and half orthodox lebanese weird my year old niece once said oh uncle ward you are the most fascinating man i have ever met to which i quickly replied you haven't met many men have you there is in the statistics of large numbers a normal curve if you have sampled a thousand christians muslims jews knights templar or dogs you will find a few that are very brillant likable or short and a few that are just the opposite my long winded answer merely suggests you need a much larger sample before you will see the bell shaped curve reveal itself from the mist what makes them likable i would say the ones you enjoy are probably acting like teachers and not pompous ones at that and i would say that they are perfectly willing to criticise their own errors and laugh in public about their own foibles that is certainly a start on the road to likeability Hebrew calendar Christianity Israeli Arab Nation of Islam Book of Daniel Jew Intelligence quotient Palestinian Lebanon First Crusade Normal distribution Lebanese Civil War Messianic Judaism Who is a Jew?
