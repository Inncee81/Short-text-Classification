how do wiccans or witches put energy in to an object ive seen witches who sell or give away items in which they have placed certain energies or sometimes spirits for example i use a ouija board so i bought a ring that was blessed with a spell to keep evil away ive had it for months and its worked im just wondering how or why does it work how does a witch put a spell or spirit in an object so that it will work for soemone else is there a certain process or spell thank you for your hlp bb im not messing with ouija boards i understand they are a toold that need to be used carefully i only use them to talk to spirits who have something they need to say my grandmother for instance i dont go looking for spirits the ring works because you believe it works if you were to hold your hands fingers towards fingers but not touching and focus on the space between them you can feel energy in that space putting energies into an object is using the same principle only you focus that energy into an object most energies put into objects is used for protection some do it as a reserve energy supply so now this is how it's done no big secrets here anyone can do it with a little willpower and faith blessed be Wicca Ouija Magic (paranormal) Charmed Witchcraft Holy Spirit Phoebe Halliwell Shaman King Reiki Magic (illusion) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Green Lantern Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Wiccan Rede Guild Wars Force (Star Wars) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief YuYu Hakusho RuneScape quests The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Alaga__sia Animism Warlock Eastern Orthodox Church Mass Dualism (philosophy of mind) E 1999 Eternal Salad Fingers Scarlet Witch Amulet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Idolatry Milton H.
