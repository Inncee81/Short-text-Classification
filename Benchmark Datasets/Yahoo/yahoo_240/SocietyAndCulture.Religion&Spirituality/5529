can a person really pray the gay away and if it doesn't work does that mean god just isn't listening and doesn't care jp if it's hard wired what about bisexual people this is an interesting question because it is a bit of a catch if you say that homosexuals cannot change their behavior then the implication is that people are basically wired to behave particular ways and free will flies out the window on the other hand if you say that they can change then you are anti gay i suppose on the one hand it is arguable and believable that a homosexual could use religious faith as the conduit by which they are able to modify their behavior though i'm inclined to believe that the mechanism is more psychological than divine however i do not see any reason for homosexuals to do this as i don't think there is anything wrong with their behavior Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Gay Bisexuality Theory of conduct Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Homophobia Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Homosexuality and Judaism Theodicy Heterosexuality Atheism Transsexuality Pedophilia Choice and sexual orientation Free will Anal sex LGBT Gender role Infantilism Religion and sexuality Church of Christ Morality Prayer Soul Reparative therapy Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Religion God Homosexuality in China David Hume Social psychology Asexuality Causality Biology and sexual orientation The nature of God in Western theology Jewish principles of faith Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bi-curious Effeminacy Evil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Argument from morality Ex-gay Predestination Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Zoophilia Domestic violence Heteronormativity Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Lawrence v.
