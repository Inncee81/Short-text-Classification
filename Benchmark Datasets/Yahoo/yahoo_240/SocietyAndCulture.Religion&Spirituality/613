why do xians keep saying that only their god is real and that mine are merely myths do you really imagine i don't have direct spiritual experiences with freyr odhinn and thor are you so arrogant as to think my practice of the ancient ways does not improve my life why else would i be doing this rebellion puh leeese i've been both you know and several other religions besides while heathenry and xianity incorporate vastly different ideas about what religion is and what deity does we don't have a cosmic santa claus and don't need redemption your constant assertions that what i believe isn't real are ridiculous why is it so hard for you to understand how real the old ways and elder godhs really are batgirl good can you read above a th grade level where exactly have i said only my godhs are real unlike xianity i don't need to be the one right way only the way of my folk chieko i am ranting at the xians who tell me this darling you're all right here oh and false gods responders one two and i think three says who your god bit convenient wouldn't you say p lightningelemental thank you that's what i've been trying to get at but you're so much more succinct and scholarly about it and i deeply appreciate it yes absolutely religion myth but myth does not equal false there's literal factual historical scientific truth and then there's powerful cultural metaphorical spiritual truth trying to turn one into the other causes all sorts of problems trying to turn the latter into the former shortchanges those who do so like trading a beautiful poem for a crescent wrench and a lump of coal please sir calm your temper maybe one day they will realise that their beliefs are not necessarily shared by others to me all gods of all kinds are real as they exist they exist in the beliefs of the people who believe in them as i respect all people i respect that their truths are different from mine and therefore accept their god gods or godesses i find that it is quite unlikely that anybody is going to learn a different truth every time a question is posted it is argued by those who do not share that particular belief is an argument not a form of ignorance and closed mindedness this is my belief taking shape i believe that i must rid myself of things like closed mindedness this is the reason why i accept and love all people may the elder gods go with you along with peace throughout your life God Religion Origin belief Mythology Atheism Reality Supernatural Religious pluralism Animism Simone Weil Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Ontological argument Philosophical skepticism Creationism Evolutionary creationism Goodness and value theory Religion and mythology Biblical inerrancy Epistemology Meaning of life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Human Intelligent design Philosophy S__ren Kierkegaard Theory of conduct Idolatry Reincarnation Resurrection of Jesus Determinism New Age Truth Voodoo Cultural and historical background of Jesus Ten Commandments Scientology beliefs and practices David Hume Soul Existence of God Creation-evolution controversy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Hell Christianity Strong atheism Neopaganism Moral relativism Stoicism Theology Ramakrishna Confucianism Eastern philosophy Postmodernism Philosophy of language Buddhism C.
