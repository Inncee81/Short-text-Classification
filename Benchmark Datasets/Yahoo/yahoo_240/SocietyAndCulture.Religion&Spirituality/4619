does it matter to god what your image is or what you have inside of you lady morgana i am one who believes that god is male and not same sex oriented as a faithful christian i refuse to call him a she because in my own eyes and out of my own faith i would consider that disrespectful towards him on the other hand in response to your answer i am one who believs image does matter to him only because the image of god whom is jesus christ is a good image to look up to he was beaten and killed for being himself he wasn't vengeful mean and he didn't preach wickedness his teachings are all good for all people to live by with which leads to his beloved holy spirit in that the spirit he left in this world is all of good fruits to remember always when it comes to image which is on the outside and what one has on the inside i believe that it matter to god more what one has on the inside one can have a wicked image but be pure and good on the inside when one is that way with a wicked image but good on the inside god will look at the soul first and toss out the image he wouldn't and does not judge people by their image he judges them by there innards by what they have inside i am sure god can look at an image and know what that image is about but i believe the life of someone goes a lot deeper than image to get ahold of all that is deeper than the image it must be done from what one has inside under the image i look at this through what i have learned from the holy bible when i take a look at the trinity who is god the father god the son and god the holy spirit god the father who is the soul being of god he can be a vicsious god when people don't obey him god the son whom is jesus christ the image of god is the complete opposite the forgiving merciful and loving all one the holy spirit is the kind of rich fruitful spirit god left people with when he died on the cross with that i know and can clearly see with god the father and god the son image can and will only go so far that is what he says also is that he is the judge when people leave this earth that is god speaking through his beloved image jesus christ with the image of god i think that it is only right to say that image does only go so far because when once a person takes the image of gof for granted it is god the father they will have to deal with and i do believe that it works the other way around as well a person can have a good image but be full wickedness on the inside when god judges people like that he is all about what one has one the inside those are the kind of people that are hell bound because obviously they work themselves up to create a good image for themselves but be full of wickedness on the inside those kinds of people are all about nothing but deception which is pure evil it works both ways you are exactly right swindled god isn't shallow at all edit i meant to say that i do not believe god is a he she god doesn't care what you look like because he knows your outward appearance is perfect we were all made in his likeness and image we were all fearfully and wonderfully made so god doesn't worry about your outer image god cares that your heart is pure and your heart belongs to him that your heart is clean clean of hate and full of love that's what god cares about Holy Spirit Justification (theology) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trinity Sin Hell Ten Commandments John Howard Yoder Eastern Orthodox Church Soul Infant baptism Merit Summa Theologiae Book of Mormon Athanasian Creed Rich Mullins Christian eschatology Devil Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Apostles' Creed Charles Grandison Finney Predestination Original sin Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Roman Catholic Church A Course In Miracles Religion Christian views of Jesus Repentance Christianity Theodicy Evil Alan Campbell (pastor) Contrition Jesus Heaven Martin Luther Catechism Resurrection of Jesus Origen Mormonism God the Father Articles of Religion (Methodist) Paradise Lost Abrahamic religion Religious perspectives on Jesus Purgatory Sabbath Opus Dei John Wesley Jewish principles of faith Qiyamah Catholicism Church of Christ Prophets of Islam William M.
