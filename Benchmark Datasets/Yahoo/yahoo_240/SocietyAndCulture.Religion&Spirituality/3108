eve we established had the dog to protect her from the devil for years how was the dog made thank you for your patience in this question i will show great proof as to how the dog was made and why you should not have him inside your homes only as medical reasons not for companionship the dog is a protector of man he is mans best friend that is true yes your right they are companions because you trained them that way that is not the intention of the lord so you trust me cause my information is proven you ever seen a dog with rabies oh you who don't believe get ready for the scaries thing we have put yet sahar it as barnaba that told us about jesus and the bat your right you are very close keep digging salam barnaba gave us so much they didn't want to accept into the docterine of the bible proof of jesus making the bat the angels making the dog as stated when will you christians return to barnaba and what he said instead of voting on what you think was from jesus and what was not from jesus and making version and so on and then never giving clear proof of such things is just as much error as believing he even had a son astugfarallah azeem i get sick everytime i think of the absolute one creating so called offspring its just not possible the creator can't be created and nor can the created by any part of the creator other than when he says be and then it so is as his own will so he gave jesus the holy spirit and fashioned him with gifts just like he did all the rest but jesus was the best doctor and he didn't speak much not like us the dog was made when the devil infested and possessed the lions and came after eve cause he was truly totally pissed off and when the lions spit fell on the ground from the earth like us but with the froth of the devil so its not like us at all once that hit the lord created with the angels doing all the work of course allah swt is all mighty and high he is absolute he needs not do the work you so keep asking him to do he has unbending angels that cannot fall from grace its impossible or they all would leave like some are leaving grace surely there is clear signs to see angels are made from the light of allah swt he said be there too and when he made adam he said be and he did many things like that for you all to see the proof and he gave you a book that is only from him so you can choose if you like or you can not choose that is totally up to you salam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holy Spirit Mary, the mother of Jesus Devil Justification (theology) Satan The Pilgrim's Progress Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Original sin Biblical inerrancy Angel God Adam and Eve Abrahamic religion Fallen angel Demon Sabbath Paradise Lost Infant baptism Salvation Soul Great Apostasy Michael (archangel) Book of Isaiah Genesis Priesthood (Mormonism) Urantia Religious perspectives on Jesus Theodicy Didache Evolutionary creationism Adam-God theory Jesus Merit Apocrypha Christmas Christian eschatology Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Apostle Qur'an Book of Mormon Ten Commandments Church of Christ, Scientist Baptism Religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Virgin Mary in Islam Biblical canon Binitarianism Resurrection of Jesus Roman Catholic Church Summa Theologiae Slow Train Coming John Wycliffe Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Divine grace Free will Eastern Orthodox Church Anselm of Canterbury Eucharist Alan Campbell (pastor) Prophets of Islam Qiyamah Aramaic of Jesus Exorcism Paul of Tarsus History of the Latter Day Saint movement Intercession of saints Criticism of Mormonism The nature of God in Western theology Ontological argument Prophet Idolatry Rapture Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Acts of the Apostles Supernatural True Jesus Church David Chosen people Young Earth creationism Origin belief Charismatic Nation of Islam Saint Perseverance of the saints Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Religious pluralism
