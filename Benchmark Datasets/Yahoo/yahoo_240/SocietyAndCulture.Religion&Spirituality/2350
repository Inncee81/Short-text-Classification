why do i keep seeing my birthdate everywhere is it a sign my birthday is march and for the last two years i have seen the numbers all over the place here are some examples when getting gas i looked at the cheapest grade which i always get and the price per gallon was when i signed onto priceline com to view a flight an ad popped up on the sight saying flights as low as while i was driving a bmw cut in front of me the car had this on the right side of the trunk i yesterday while at the insurance agent she quoted me my renter's policy without hurricane coverage last three numbers i numerized the alphabet a z etc and spelled out my complete maiden name bryanne elise seymour the total came to no kidding i am constantly looking at the clock and day or night the time is often there are tons more examples but after i recently watched the number i started to wonder if there was some truth to it ps the 's add up to which in numerology is wow i am really disappointed in the level of answers from the community i meant the question with honesty and earnestness gas in hawaii is for the cheap grade sorry i wrote ' tons more answers' i will make sure to be more literally correct when i write a question there have been many many times besides what i wrote that i have seen the numbers however i only listed because i have a character limit i don't think i am a prophetess of any sort just wondering if anyone who was into numerology new what that could mean yes i just saw the number days ago ordered it on netflix i have a husband and kids don't get a lot of time to see shows again what a shame about the maturity level of the answers if you just want to be demeaning or condescending please piss somewhere else thank you michael m for your answer it wont let me pick best answer yet but you've got it by and far have a great day first do people like cynical chick just 'vomit' answers to become a 'top contributor' anyway it's happened to me whether it's my birthday and no i'm not counting the guy at the football game who raises the sign john the number etc i do agree it's a cool coincidence but i also believe that there is no such thing as random luck but instead i believe that everything does happen for a reason i have a life full of it if anything it shows that you are far more observant than most people most people never realize anything that's happening around them and if you do believe there is something behind it i say believe it who cares what others think 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Discordianism $ale of the Century Crossword Birthday Social rule Life insurance Doomsday argument Contract Gasoline Billboard Hot 100 Kyoto Protocol Jet engine Wheel of Fortune Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Number of the Beast (numerology) Downing Street memo CPU design Singlish Mathematics Humphrey Bogart Literacy Game show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Surveillance Global warming Pittsburgh Steelers U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Expert system Euphemism Luck Yugo Deconstruction Diesel engine Microeconomics Filling station Major League Baseball television contracts About a Boy Norway national football team Friends Sudoku Garfield Arabic alphabet Apollo 8 The Price Is Right Blockbuster Video Infantilism Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Pop punk Philosophical skepticism Prophet E85 Ozone depletion War of the Worlds (2005 film) RuneScape quests Hiberno-English Rod Stewart Tropical cyclone Spanish verbs New York Giants The Emancipation of Mimi Intelligent design John F.
