the trinity i grew up christian and always prayed in the name of the father son and holy spirit but to be honest i didnt know christians believe that god jesus and the holy spirit are one there were some watch tower people they dont call themselves christians btw that came to my house once thats when i found out and they said they believe the father son and holy spirit are separate what are your beliefs about the trinity and having faith in general whatever the case am currently questioning but not bashing my belief in the whole christianity thing i feel like there is a higher power though how about just being a good person the trinity can be explained by water water god the father frozen ice jesus christ boiling water making a vapor holy spirit all three are one in the godhead but are separate persons yet you must understand that jehovah's witnesses are false in their teachings about jesus christ and are considered a cult in the scriptures of the holy bible and being a good person jesus says you must be born again and those that do the will of my father will enter into heaven read the scriptures daily and find a church where the holy spirit is also welcomed and jesus christ is glorified Trinity Holy Spirit Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Justification (theology) God Baptism Christianity Godhead (Mormonism) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Binitarianism Nontrinitarianism Church of Christ, Scientist Jehovah's Witnesses Salvation Book of Mormon Mormonism and Christianity Sola fide Mormonism A Course In Miracles New Testament Soul Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Athanasian Creed Coptic Christianity Oneness Pentecostal God the Father Church of Christ Monotheism Arianism John Howard Yoder Religious perspectives on Jesus God and gender Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Sabbath Filioque clause Eucharist Articles of Religion (Methodist) Christian views of Jesus Dispensationalism Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Great Apostasy Resurrection of Jesus Messianic Judaism Catholicism Charles Taze Russell Christian denomination Criticism of Mormonism Protestantism History of Christianity Predestination New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Pentecostalism Tertullian Nicene Creed Liberal Christianity Christ Paul of Tarsus Homosexuality and Christianity Divine grace Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Fundamentalism Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses William M.
