how many creation stories are in the christian bible there are two stories one names god elohim the other names god yahweh i have heard that in the actual hebrew text difference between the two is even more stark if these stories were taken literally in a chronological fashion they would contradict each other the yahweh version says land before water the elohim version implies water before land the yahweh version seems to have a more humanistic narrative while the elohim version is more about exact catagories i think the seven days of the elohist creation are catagories and are used to make certain points example is the fourth day it makes the point that the sun and the moon are just objects they are not gods to be worshipped like other peoples did in the bronze age here is the passage from the the new jerusalem bible genesis god said 'let there be lights in the vault of heaven to divide day from night and let them indicate festivals days and years let them be lights in the vault of heaven to shine on the earth ' and so it was god made the two great lights the greater light to govern the day the smaller light to govern teh night and the stars god set them in the vault of heaven to shine on the earth to govern the day and the night and to divide light from darkness god saw that it was good evening came and morning came the fourth day the sixth day described land animal life including the human animal it also states that god created humans both male and female the yahwist version says male first then female from male probably implying why the human male is dominant it doesn't say how the english versions refer to the human ape as created in god's image and likeness does that mean god looks like a super duper ape nope because the original hebrew word yes a single word is a describer of function and innate ability not appearance it is that function and ability that gives the human ape its special nature the word is b'tselem thus the phrase is b'tselem elohim that is its ability to have a spiritual relationship with god but the human ape will still behave in an ape like manner just take a look at the schoolyard bully the playground is the starkest reminder of homo sapiens's simian brain and body personally i think the bible may be inspired by god but it is not inerrant any bible not in the original hebrew aramaic and greek is most definitely not inerrant if one says that one needs the holy spirit to truly get the actual data then he or she must explain why there are many sects how does that person know that his sect is the whole truth nobody can really know the whole truth whether with news or philosophical debates or any thing else every source is biased and every source will only tell part of the truth New Testament God and gender Biblical inerrancy Bible Documentary hypothesis Sabbath Angel Elohim Book of Isaiah Ten Commandments Jesus Devil Abrahamic religion Idolatry Young Earth creationism Storytelling Old Earth creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul El (god) Origin belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Day-Age Creationism Holy Spirit Book of Mormon A Course In Miracles Genesis Pharisees Historical Jesus Satan Exodus Prophet Evolutionary creationism Judaism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Resurrection of Jesus Abraham Allah Biblical canon Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philo Infant baptism Christian eschatology Historicity of Jesus Baal Kabbalah Moses Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Original sin Hell New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures History of creationism El (Canaanite god) Predestination Creation (theology) Divine grace Justification (theology) Eastern Orthodox Church Balaam Jewish principles of faith Henotheism Binitarianism Gospel of Matthew Theology Adam and Eve Aramaic of Jesus Homosexuality and Christianity Aristotle Book of Daniel Priestly source Noah's Ark Jehovah Qur'an Mythology Sefer Yetzirah God the Father Christian views of Jesus Christianity Names and titles of Jesus Biblical Magi Modern geocentrism Noah Flood geology Mormonism and Judaism
