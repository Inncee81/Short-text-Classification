what do you think of this new outlook on christians i'm an atheist and have been annoyed for pretty much my whole life with the pushiness restrctiveness contrilling behavior and holier than thou attitude of christians it is not the way i want to live and i hate that there are people that think i will actually burn in hell for this but the culture and faith that strikes fear into my heart is islam muslims are backward intolerant even when they come to the usa to live with us violent and dead set on forcefully coverting killing everyone that gets in their way of taking over the world i am not saying that all muslims or even close to all of them are like this but they are growing in numbers and it is not a good thing britain is done for they have it secured there are more muslim youths in britain than any other faith and i fear for the usa as do many people that are educated on this subject so that being said i think christians will be the ones fighting for their beliefs and keeping usa free opinions it is for that reason that i direct my efforts towards making christians wake up it has been my experience that they are far more reachable than muslims and we're going to need their help to secure peace in the world if you think christians like to stick their fingers in their ears and scream you should see the muslims go visit a muslim forum be respectful but question their beliefs see how quickly you are banned Ten Commandments Religion Christianity Islam Creationism Nation of Islam Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Fundamentalism Sharia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Atheism Afterlife Anti-Semitism Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Religious pluralism Prayer Discrimination Soul Holy Spirit InterFaith Status of religious freedom in Iran Salvation Status of religious freedom in France Rastafari movement Islamophobia Resurrection of Jesus Jewish views of religious pluralism Culture of France Pacifism Status of religious freedom in Sudan Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Dhimmi French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Justification (theology) Qiyamah Apostasy in Islam Patriotism Abrahamic religion Evolutionary creationism Religious conversion Islamist terrorism Saint Sola fide Zionism Criticisms of Christianity Judaism Origin belief Sexual orientation Freemasonry Muslim ibn Aqeel Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pascal's Wager Christian right Idolatry Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Abraham Religion and sexuality Predestination Fasting Homophobia Theodicy A Course In Miracles Evil Homosexuality Opposition to cults and new religious movements Islam as a political movement Islam in Turkey Original sin Book of Isaiah Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Arab-Israeli conflict Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yehuda Halevi Exorcism Conservatism Historical persecution by Christians Islamic philosophy Sikhism Unitarian Universalism Jihad Aurangzeb Persecution of Christians Social psychology Religion in Israel John Wycliffe
