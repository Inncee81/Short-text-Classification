ask yourself are these serious questions or are you just asking it to try to disprove someone's belief system i mean come on people why do you have to ask such i'm sorry to sound judgmental stupid questions i really got on this forum to learn new things but it seems to me that people are just trying to beat each other's beliefs up why can't we just live and let live and ask questions that we genuinely want to know the answers to what is the purpose of bashing each other with our mean spirited questions the purpose of me asking this question is because i genuinely want to know just in case anyone wondered finally someone else who thinks the same way people get on here and ask an atheist something just so they can argue with them and atheists ask christians the same stuff they're not looking for an answer they think they'r eright ans have to prove it i'll admit i've done it a couple times but i'm aware of it now and know exactly where you're coming from so i'll be honest yes i'm guilty i did realize earlier today that that is what most people are doing hence the reason i call this section a war zone besides what's the point of defendin your faith we shouldn't have to our lives should mirror christ so that our lives defend our faith not our lips Atheism God The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Soul Resurrection of Jesus Afterlife Religion A Course In Miracles Supernatural Existence of God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian apologetics Apologetics Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Justification (theology) Christian eschatology Intelligent design movement Eastern Orthodox Church S__ren Kierkegaard Agnosticism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Roman Catholic Church Creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion Transcendental argument for the existence of God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Catechism Apology (Plato) Fundamentalism Jewish principles of faith Evolutionary creationism Exorcism Creation-evolution controversy Anthroposophy Sola fide Strong atheism Theology Philosophy Slow Train Coming Scientology beliefs and practices Intelligent design Charles Grandison Finney Salvation Phaedo Evil Pascal's Wager John Howard Yoder Apostasy Deconstruction Answers in Genesis David Hume Altruism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Trinity Numerology Meaning of life Nontrinitarianism Scenes from a Memory Summa Theologiae Reinhold Niebuhr Phillip E.
