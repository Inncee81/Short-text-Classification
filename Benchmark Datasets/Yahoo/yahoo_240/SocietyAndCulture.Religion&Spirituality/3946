does a best answer after the question influence your decision about a religious issue i only ask because i've been told certain groups are contacting their y allies to ask for votes when a question goes to group voting as for me what matters most is what's written in the question and answers everyone knows best answer is subjective and anyone with a sincere desire for information is not going to allow that to influence their thinking i guess influencing a best answer outcome in this way is a fun time filler for people with nothing better to do but i doubt it really makes anyone who is reading for information think differently what do you think no and i'll tell you why look at the questions sent to vote almost all of the best answers chosen were the first person to answer often times it is a yes or no answer to a very complex question and far from a true best answer people in this section are very lazy and are more interested in getting their point for voting and moving on rather than reading and selecting a truly good answer very often the best answer to any question is the last person to answer and that's because they took their time typing out a lengthy response if a question with more than answers is sent to vote the last people to answer rarely receive a vote at all the first person to answer is voted for overwhelmingly if you don't believe me go to the questions up for vote now pick one with a lot of answers vote for a good one and you'll then see the current results as well as the fact that i'm probably right this would also explain why you see many people type a period as their answer so that they can secure the top spot for the answers to any given question and then they type out their answer later on so that they can potentially receive more thumbs up anyone that i see type a period for the first few answers automatically receives a thumbs down from me that is cheap and sad on their part point whores that's all they are these days a top contributor badge for r s is about as valuable as one for polls and surveys for a section populated with people who pride themselves on being intelligent regardless of their belief they are equally as lazy it's embarrassing Plame affair Same-sex marriage in Canada Opinion poll Expert system U.S. Electoral College Theodicy U.S. presidential election, 2000 Sexual orientation Creation-evolution controversy Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Canadian Senate Social rule Intelligent design Margin of error Deconstruction Predestination Supernatural Voter turnout Canadian House of Commons A Course In Miracles $ale of the Century Socrates Journalism ethics and standards Scientology beliefs and practices Originalism SAT Bowl Championship Series Religion Atheism Meaning of life Consensus decision-making Corporate governance Psychology Family Feud U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Human sexual behavior Principal-agent problem 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Discordianism The Apprentice 2 Bayesian inference Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus British national identity card ROC presidential election, 2004 Parliament of the United Kingdom Match Game Single Transferable Vote Classified information Wheel of Fortune Tic-Tac-Dough GED Ethics Head of state Politics of Canada Whose Line Is It Anyway?
