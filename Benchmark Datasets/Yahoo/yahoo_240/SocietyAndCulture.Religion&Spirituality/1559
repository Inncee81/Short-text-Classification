does missionary work actually convert i have seriously never been able to udnerstand this and would like to which faiths have missionary work do they actually convert successfully or just do good samaritan work if you've done missionary conversion work did you wonder how it would feel if someone did the same thing to you with a different faith you didn't follow i honestly want to know i'm curious it always seemed to em that religion is a bit liek cheesecake offer it to me and make it look nice and i might go for it but shove it down my throat and i will just puke it back to you with that in mind it always confused me how anyone would be converted but i suppose i was forgetting the violent force factor christianity is pretty much the only religion that finds it necessary to run around converting innocent gullible little souls yes they have successfully converted many times even if i were a christian i would never do missionary work however i was taught from an early age that it's rude to try to change someone's mind about their religious beliefs i think i would feel horrid doing it anyway what if i were wrong and i had coincedentally led all those i converted straight to hell i wouldn't be able to live with myself Religious conversion Abrahamic religion Christianity Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity and anti-Semitism Religion Baptist Evil Immortality Pacifism Zoroastrianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism History of Christianity Christianization Paul of Tarsus Charles Grandison Finney Missionary Idolatry Great Apostasy Separation of church and state Church of Christ Monotheism Afterlife Jewish principles of faith Status of religious freedom in Sudan Soul Milton H.
