anyone else think that church is outdated first of all i would like to say that i am religious and have gone forced to go to church for much of my life when my parents finally let me decide to go or not i didnt really go anymore because i feel that if i live my life as a good person then god won't care if i go to a building once a week i feel like church was invented wayyyy back when people had no form of entertainment or really anything to do except tend to fields it was a chance for them to get together as a community and a break from their daily lives we have lots of forms of breaks from our daily lives now and i'm not sure that praying in a church is like times more powerful than praying anywhere else there are online forums to post people you want to pray for i am not saying that people who go to church should stop i am just asking if people think we should change it a little and bring it into the st century i know the older generation would be morally opposed but what about you it's a valid question if you're experiencing true fellowship with your online forums or other means then you're effectively replacing the intent of a bricks and mortar church Religious Society of Friends Roman Catholic Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Evangelicalism Pentecostalism Goodness and value theory Church of Christ, Scientist Ethics Charles Grandison Finney Past teachings of Prem Rawat Fundamentalism Infant baptism Scientology beliefs and practices Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Internet troll Canonical hours Constitution of Ireland Poker jargon Ten Commandments Alcoholics Anonymous John Howard Yoder Separation of church and state in the United States Church of Christ Theology Pacifism Sabbath Summa Theologiae Liberal Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Wesley Homophobia Transsexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baptism Priesthood (Mormonism) Theory of conduct Infantilism Eucharist Conscience Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Blog Polyamory Religion God Autistic community Alignment (role-playing games) Art Jewish principles of faith Anglicanism Birth control Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Amazing Race Something Awful Theodicy Anabaptist Divine grace New Testament Religious pluralism LaVeyan Satanism Newbie Internet forum Velvet Revolution Abortion debate Utilitarianism Confession Sacrifice Clemens Maria Hofbauer A Course In Miracles Holy Orders S__ren Kierkegaard Monk Separation of church and state H2G2 Homosexuality and Christianity Charles Darwin's views on religion Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Sexual orientation Socrates Charismatic Simone Weil Family First Party Baptist Morality Rudolf Hermann Lotze Opposition to cults and new religious movements Social rule Eastern Orthodox Church Minister of religion History of Christianity Cheating in Counter-Strike Coercion Free will Local churches Laura Schlessinger Protestant Reformation Prayer Friedrich Schleiermacher It's Walky!
