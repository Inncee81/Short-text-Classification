christian girls are you ever tempted like me i'm single go to church regularly and have a relationship with god however just like any other christian there's always that one area that is more challenging to control than others in my case instead of it being gossip stealing or lying to people i struggle with my singleness specifically since i desire to keep myself pure for my spouse i have refrained from living a promiscuous lifestyle and do not have relations with girls nevertheless i find that my flesh needs satisfying so sometimes i will take care of my own needs through self pleasure masturbation and mental stimulation fantasies do you christian girls masturbate too because you're horny and you feel that it's the lesser of two evils also do you ever feel like you can't talk to another sister or anyone at the church about it because they won't understand because they're either married act holier than thou or due to your shame my intention is not to bash the church being single is hard for me yes i feel the same way at times you're not alone Child sexuality Sexual abstinence Masturbation Religion and sexuality Polygamy Cybersex Homosexuality and Christianity Original sin Ten Commandments Mortification of the flesh Sexual orientation Zoophilia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman Catholic Church S__ren Kierkegaard Fasting Minister of religion Trinity Gay slang Church of Christ, Scientist Buddhism Female genital cutting Bondage (BDSM) A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Evil Jewish views of religious pluralism Birth control Same-sex marriage Christianity Love Christian view of marriage George Fox Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Marriage Clerical celibacy Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Prostate cancer Gnosticism Priesthood (Mormonism) Strap-on dildo Christian anarchism Unification Church Circumcision John Howard Yoder History of sex Pedophilia Sola fide Merit Friedrich Schleiermacher Theology Utopianism God and gender Christian-Jewish reconciliation Eucharist Theory of conduct LaVeyan Satanism Sant Thakar Singh Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Alignment (role-playing games) The Amber Spyglass Children of God Happiness Saint Eastern Orthodox Church Infant baptism Didache Baptism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Catholicism Mary, the mother of Jesus Sexual arousal Asceticism Civil unions in the United Kingdom Michel Henry Holy Spirit Free will Annulment Sexual addiction Yami to B__shi to Hon no Tabibito Iago Narcissism Adam and Eve Human sexuality Prayer Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Homosexuality and Islam Anal sex BDSM Joseph of Arimathea Indulgence Witch trial Margaret Sanger Child sexual abuse Great Teacher Onizuka Religious Society of Friends
