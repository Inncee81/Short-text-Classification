religion vs science how many times has religion won what is the score ok there was the earth in the center of the universe science won rainbows were miracules science won etc etc seriously has there ever been a debate that science has lost those who think that science is apples and oranges maybe you should ask galileo i think he felt the reality of the debate science studies gods' creation and it's rules the tool of science assumes there is an orderly and natural cause that can be repeated it does not explain things if the cause is supernatural it cannot explain historical things well since the experiment cannot be repeated science has been incorrect before also religion is people's attempt to connect with god this can obviously fail there are many religions and they contradict each other indeed at best one can be right either jesus is god or he is not either their is just one god or there isn't etc the bible is god's attempt to connect with people if it's true it should not fail people's interpretation could be incorrect but what god is actually saying should not prophesies should come true history should be accurate they can be combined there are lots of early scientists that were christians and did so to study god's handiwork it's my understanding that galileo believed in god and he's the one that showed that the earth wasn't at the center of the universe Supernatural Creationism Religion Intelligent design Existence of God History of creationism Church of Christ, Scientist Biblical inerrancy Young Earth creationism Resurrection of Jesus Creation science God Atomism Theology Teach the Controversy Historicity of Jesus Science Fundamentalism Miracle Origin belief Prophet Meaning of life Phillip E.
