what do you think of this saying only a god can worship a god it means we must find in ourself the level of conciosness and love that the deity epitomizes and symbolizes when we do we are worshiping that deity the church we belong to has nothing to do with religion it depends on our level of awarness and your concious contact with the deity the worship is becoming like the deity does your church teach you how to be like the god you worship or does it act like an extension of your police department giving out rules and handing out consulation and offering a reward if the rules are followed and punishment if they are not so i guess tryong to be like christ is blasphemy to some christians what a shame how sad that that there is no growth where talking about god and you bring up grammer what an uptight relgion you must have did you learn that from your second grade grammer guru i believe that the essential portion of our being the atman is identical to the essential portion of god though perhaps in smaller measure therefore we are all identical to god i must stress that i have not realized this but take it on faith and take great comfort that there are those more spiritually advanced than i who i believe when they say that it has been realized by them i also have faith in the ancient scriptures the vedas as well as the gita and the upanishads and the yoga sutras of patnanjali the gita states the case for the atman teachings quite forcefully and its truth is easily discernible in the upanishads and indeed it is the goal of the yoga sutras so my belief differs a little with your assertion in that i believe that we are already one with god we just do not know it so we are able to worship just not with full realization or perhaps full appreciation anyone with faith can worship fruitfully i am more with the sage ramanuja on this point than with sankara Vedanta Mantra Brahman Religion Guru-shishya tradition God Upanishad Holy Spirit Adi Shankara Eastern philosophy Guru Christianity Vishnu sahasranama Smartism Monotheism Moksha Sant Mat Vishnu Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Ishta-deva Indian caste system Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bhakti Idolatry Sri Aurobindo Hindu scripture Roman Catholic Church Hindu deities Trinity Brahmanism Ramanuja Karma in Hinduism Avatar Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Tantra Bhakti yoga Soul Dvaita Henotheism Reincarnation Krishna Narayana Guru Baptism Urantia Hindu Vedas A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ayyavazhi Sola fide Ramakrishna Catholicism Karma Yoga Prayer Adi Da Ten Commandments Religious Society of Friends Eastern Orthodox Church Fundamentalism Christian eschatology Aum Shinrikyo Vedic civilization Eucharist Raja Yoga Saint Salvation Arjuna Anglicanism Philipp Melanchthon Nirvana Magic (paranormal) Theosophy Divine grace Mormonism and Christianity Confucianism Scientology beliefs and practices Pantheism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Karma Church of Christ Origin belief
