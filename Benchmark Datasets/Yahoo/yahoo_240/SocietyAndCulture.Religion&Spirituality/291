where do you go wen u die where do you believe you go wen u die i think all people go heaven all people are equal and we are god's kids he would never put us hell your opinion well now concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection behold it has been made known unto me by an angel that the spirits of all men as soon as they are departed from this mortal body yea the spirits of all men whether they be good or evil are taken home to that god who gave them life and then shall it come to pass that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness which is called paradise a state of rest a state of peace where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care and sorrow and then shall it come to pass that the spirits of the wicked yea who are evil for behold they have no part nor portion of the spirit of the lord for behold they chose evil works rather than good therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them and take possession of their house and these shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and this because of their own iniquity being led captive by the will of the devil now this is the state of the souls of the wicked yea in darkness and a state of awful fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of god upon them thus they remain in this state as well as the righteous in paradise until the time of their resurrection that's sort of a good explanation there could be better but that's the one that stands out for me basically when a person dies they go to the spirit world there they are until the resurrection and final judgment here is what awaits us after that judgment http scriptures lds org en dc that's the best i can do right now study ponder and pray always Hell Heaven Christian eschatology Devil Soul Demon Sola fide Divine grace Michael (archangel) Original sin Psychopannychism Book of Mormon Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Lamanite John the Baptist Reincarnation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harrowing of Hell Justification (theology) Summa Theologiae Noah Fallen angel Salvation Ayyavazhi mythology Merit Jewish eschatology Paradise Lost Matthew 5 Baptism Qiyamah Vishnu sahasranama Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Book of Isaiah Religion Endowment (Mormonism) Gospel of Thomas Alan Campbell (pastor) Immortality Gabriel Eastern Orthodox Church Repentance Azazel Zohar Duties of the Heart Ten Commandments Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Outer darkness Satan Eschatology Zoroastrianism Dispensationalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity End times John Howard Yoder Amidah Mormonism and Christianity Catechism Bhagavad Gita Purgatory Holy Spirit Jerusalem Sin Death (personification) Apocalypse Blacks and Mormonism Afterlife Apocalyptic literature Ezekiel Jewish principles of faith Christian and Missionary Alliance Adam-God theory Exorcism Mary, the mother of Jesus Rich Mullins Israel ben Eliezer Tribulation Hades Animism God Immanuel Mormonism and Judaism Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Angel Sanctuary Godhead (Mormonism) Evil Phaedo Kain (Legacy of Kain) Requiem Philo
