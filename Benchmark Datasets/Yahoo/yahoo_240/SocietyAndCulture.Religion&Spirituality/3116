if your an atheist do you have a problem with the pledge of allegiance the one nation under god part two part answer part one i don't care for the under god portion because i don't pledge allegiance to my country because of god i pledge allegiance to my country because of the freedoms my country affords me one of those is not being required to believe in a god so why should i have to say it why should anyone have to say it that doesn't mean it should be taken out it simply shouldn't have been inserted in the s anyway but if i ever have to say it i just stay silent during that portion or i say under dog in my head part two i have a problem with the entire pledge i answered this in another question about the pledge but basically comedian lewis black once said that the only time we are required to say the pledge is as public school students particularly elementary school students and no elementary school student comprehends what the pledge is actually about it seems like pointless indoctrination now before anyone accuses me of being unpatriotic there are thousands of ways to express patriotism i would never propose to get rid of the pledge i just find it unnecessary i don't need to force my kids to wave flags and say the pledge to teach them to appreciate and love their country they don't have to show outward displays of patriotism to be patriotic all they have to do is show the country respect i could go on and on but i'll stop there Pledge of Allegiance Patriotism Separation of church and state Separation of church and state in the United States 2004 Democratic National Convention Theodicy Bart chalkboard gags Elk Grove Unified School District v.
