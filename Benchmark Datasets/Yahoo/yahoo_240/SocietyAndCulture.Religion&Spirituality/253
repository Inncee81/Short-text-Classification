why bharath was not informed for anything whatever happened in ayodhaya for five days before king's death bharat when came back to ayodhaya from kaikai he fired on kakai even he said to his mother that i could have been killed you if you would not have been women it means he had the capability to convince the kaikai to avert her boons given by the king dasharatha why no body informed bharath about the severe incidents were going on in ayodhaya society was in love with the lord so why no body thought to call bharath who had the potential to change the situation sir ji if time communication was the factor then how much time would have been taken by messanger to go to kaikai and then bharatha to come back and after coming back he had seen the dead body of king means about days how it is possible to keep the body for days that time i do not know it may be possible but i am asking that sir is it true or not ie written in ramayana or not because i have been started ramayana and i really do not have any knowledge it is true sir sorry just mere dimang main jo question ya sansay hai o likha hai to aap log nahin clear karoge to kaun karega being younger i am objecting your answers please mujhe maaf kar do friend it is a beautiful question to tell you all that while reading the epics or scriptures or great religious books of any religion our limited intelligence and intellect should not come in the way yopu should not analyse and ask our knowledge is very limited so use intellect to transcend intellect to realise the ultimate now where was bharata at that time he was in his maternal uncle's home there were no cell phones or wireless networks etc in those days even if there were they sure would have gone dead for a week or so these are divine designs if you read the scriptures you know why rama takes birth what for he comes who his brothers are etc so every things fits in just like in a zigsaw puzzle bhatrata even if the fastest rider goes takes at leat days to come so was the times effect then these types of questions take us away from the real meaning of ramayana if rama is made king then who will do tataka vadha maricha vadha finally raavana vadha kaikeyi could have asked to go to simply a forest without naming but she says years sree rama shall go to dandakaaranya why there is a purpose behind every action she knows she is going to remain as a wicked lady wicked mother in history but for the sake of people she obeys devatas ans rishis and acts and takes the heavy burden real she is a great lady edit yes the body of king dasaratha was kept in large quantities of oil they knew that any thing put in oil will be there in tact for more than several months please kindly read original ramayana by valmiki with commentary ramayana really happened it is not a story you will be convinced if you read if you read cheap translations or see motion pictures you will get wrong ideas like this so i ardently pray you tokindly read ramayan original bby valmiki you will be surprised to note the knowledge contained there in you willbe benifitted by reading sundara kanda may god bless you Hinduism Mahabharata Rama Summa Theologiae Sanskrit literature Ayyavazhi mythology Ravana Hanuman Hindu scripture Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bharata Bhagavad Gita Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Raghuvamsa Christian eschatology Sant Thakar Singh Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Avatar EastEnders Meaning of life Hindu Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Vishnu Friedrich Schleiermacher Valmiki Mantra Religious Society of Friends Vishnu sahasranama Socrates Buddhism Origin belief Diwali Jewish principles of faith Victor Cousin Roman Catholic Church Philosophy Dasaratha Book of Mormon Creationism Devil Zohar Sabbath Paradise Lost Goodness and value theory God and gender Simone Weil Mary, the mother of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Soul Ganesha Epistemology Phaedo Bhakti Raamcharitmaanas John the Baptist Atomism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Ten Commandments Narayana Guru God Emperor of Dune Krishna A Course In Miracles Angel Sita Devi Predestination Book of Isaiah Yoga Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Abortion debate Jiddu Krishnamurti Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Existence of God Genesis Bible Sola fide Adi Shankara Nicomachean Ethics Arjuna Free will Christianity Theory of conduct Church of Christ, Scientist Determinism Merit Immortality Yusuf al-Qaradawi End times Advaita Vedanta Islamic philosophy Fundamentalism Jan Hus
