who here has had an experience where they felt contact was made with a deceased person just curious i often hear people tell me stories about how they saw a loved one in their dreams or heard their voice or whatever my best friend died in january she was years old i have not heard one single solitary peep out of her which leads me to believe that she is either not capable of contacting me or just plain dead obviously i want to believe she is still in existence somewhere but i guess there's no way to know just wondered if any of you had lost someone and then heard from them somehow my identical twin sister died in she and i were mirror twins and have never been apart for more than a week when she died we were telepathic after she died i had a dream in this dream i was asleep in my bedroom she came to me woke me up and told me that she needed to talk to me we went to her room she told me that she was no longer in pain she had cancer andit was horribly painful she described the beautiful place where she was she told me that jesus was with her she described our daddy and our grandmother as well as others who had died she told me not to worry about her she said she was happy she told me she'd come back a few weeks later i had almost the identical dream this time though she told me that she did not want to leave to come visit she said that although she loved me and always would she did not want to leave to come back to visit since then i have only dreamed of speaking with her times and it has been almost years these dreams comforted me more than i can ever say The Shining (film) Scenes from a Memory Sin City W.I.T.C.H.
