muslims i'm confused women menstruation quran when a woman menstruates i know she does not have to do salat she can't but at that time can she listen to recitation of quran can she read quran touch quran recite quran at all how can you stay connected if you cannot do any of those things mentioned during a time such as the time after childbirth allah reward you all one more question what is she reads it off a computer screen weird my question should read menstruation not mens parlance mind your own business i love the religion i have chosen for myself my religion does not allow me to be ashamed of my body i am not unclean it is ritually unclean like the jews everyone loves jews but forgets that they have these rules as well some where in the old testament it is written that our self righteousness is like dirty rags menstral rags that is how god sees our self righteousness but what the lord has made clean is clean indeed so when i go to church i make sure i smell clean to the best of my ability we have better type of hygene material for us today than years ago when i am on my period i have the freedom to pray to god read the bible etc i am not under law but am under grace of god i am made the righteousness of christ by his shed blood only even one sin will keep me out of heaven jesus paid the price for me i am born of his spirit cleansed by his blood joint heirs with king jesus part of the family of god so i am made the righteousness of christ to be absent from this body is to be in heaven with the lord so when i come before god i pray to my abba father because god doesn't look at me as a sinner he looks at me as the righteousness of christ because when i am born of his spirit i am made the righteousness of christ it doesn't matter if i am on my period or not i can go to church praise god in worship service i feel receive gods love joy i listen to the pastor preach i learn more of gods word and all this it doesn't matter if i am on my period or not in islam people are still under the law of sin death to go by all the rules so if i were you just don't read the quran etc when you are mentruating or after a child birth but that shouldn't stop you from praying to god who created us this way just thank jesus for his shed blood for the remission of all your sins then you can pray to heavenly father in spirit truth because your sins are covered may yahweh elohim be with you Baptism Angel Qur'an John the Baptist Jesus Soul Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Virgin Mary in Islam Church of Christ Abraham Sin Divine grace Hell God the Father Infant baptism Religion Sabbath Book of Mormon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Idolatry Roman Catholic Church Salah Prophet Predestination Repentance Charles Grandison Finney Trinity Articles of Religion (Methodist) Religious conversion Paul of Tarsus Religion and sexuality Chosen people Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Judaism Islam Christianity Summa Theologiae Religious pluralism Dispensationalism Names of God in Judaism Urantia Blood atonement A Course In Miracles Devil Jewish principles of faith Religious perspectives on Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Jehovah's Witnesses Fundamentalism Eastern Orthodox Church Nation of Islam Endowment (Mormonism) Heaven Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eucharist John Howard Yoder Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Mass (liturgy) God and gender Baptist Purgatory Criticisms of Christianity Qiyamah Mormonism and Judaism Catholicism Gospel of Barnabas Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Satan Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Unclean animals Demon Resurrection of Jesus Fallen angel New Testament Reincarnation Merit Rastafari movement Great Apostasy Coptic Christianity Legalism (theology)
