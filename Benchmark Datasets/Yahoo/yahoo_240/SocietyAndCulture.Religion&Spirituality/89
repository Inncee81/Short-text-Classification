why fear hell the bible's description of it doesn't sound so bad there seem to be numerous accounts of it being flamey and hot a few of it being dark and some of apparent dryness since i happen to like the dark that isn't an issue fire would probably hurt but then hurt is just experience and without it leading to demise as is inevitable in life there is no reason it would be to be feared i set myself on fire for fun sometimes i can be a bit of a masochist or maybe the fact that i simply don't care so no big deal dryness i dislike water more than i dislike the lack thereof besides without needing it to stay alive it is hardly going to be a problem and then there are the folks who say it is a place without god since i am in a place without god already i wouldn't even notice the difference there so honestly how am i supposed to consider hell a threat even if for whatever reason the christians happened to be right hell would be better than brown nosing god forever no i don't believe in heaven or hell but i just felt that i'd mention being as i'm not one of the conventional athiests that even if i did i would be more afraid of heaven than of hell and mr jesus loves you the darkness sounds like the best part the notion of not even being able to find the ground sounds great and lonliness hah i'm aspergian social isolation is bliss incidentally regarding that gnawing worm i kinda pity it if it is always hungry like that and never satisfied no matter how many people it gnaws on since time immemorial it must be living out a pretty bleak existence i suppose it is free to gnaw on me as much as it likes if it might provide it with any relief but as skinny as i am i doubt it will find much to gnaw on ok buddy enjoy hell Heaven Theory of conduct Soul The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Merit Sant Thakar Singh Christian eschatology Biblical inerrancy God Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meaning of life Eastern Orthodox Church Miracle Alcoholics Anonymous Satan Reincarnation Ten Commandments Johnny the Homicidal Maniac The Amber Spyglass Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Religion Church of Christ, Scientist Avenue Q Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Social rule Gospel of Thomas Slayers Futurama (TV series - season 5) Judas Iscariot Afterlife Book of Mormon Demon Characters of The Sandman Philosophical skepticism Supernatural Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Cliff Richard Dualism (philosophy of mind) Sola fide Sin Sin City Asperger syndrome Christianity and anti-Semitism Idolatry Purgatory Rich Mullins Problem of Hell Euphemism Kyle Broflovski Acts of the Apostles Divine grace Transcendental argument for the existence of God Historicity of Jesus Atomism Goodness and value theory Abrahamic religion Origin belief Tears for Fears Storytelling Creationism Atheism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religious pluralism The Death Gate Cycle Bangsian fantasy Friedrich Schleiermacher Hip hop rivalries Free will Sabbath Creation according to Genesis Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Liberal Christianity Piccolo Junior Saga Bible and reincarnation John Titor Church of Christ Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Recurring South Park characters Jesus Philipp Melanchthon Mary, the mother of Jesus Ron Weasley Narcissism Black Sabbath Shot of Love Ontological argument Polyamory Urantia
