what is jewish service like in a synagogue i know how mass goes in a church i am curious what yall do and what yall's traditions are great question i'll give you an answer as soon as i compose the whole thing i'll give you the reform perspective mine and also my observations from having been to orthodox services i'll let someone else do the conservative and or reconstructionist and or renewal perspectives this'll take a few minutes though so i'll get back to you edit about the best i could do is to cut and paste from a terrific website the site link below also references a book called to pray as a jew by rabbi hayim halevy donin which is a tremendous book anyway the cut and paste below gives a lot of information what i'll add first is some general impressions of a synagogue and then some thoughts on the service from a reform perspective i'm reform the core of any synagogue is the sanctuary this is where community prayers take place the sanctuary itself varies enormously from synagogue to synagogue and can be anything from a relatively plain room to an extremely ornate high domed space with balcony seating many have stained glass but not all at the front is the ark where the torah s are held torahs are very expensive and many congregations only have one we are lucky enough to have five they're completely handwritten take about a year to complete and run in the tens of thousands of dollars above the ark is the eternal light which burns continually in front of the ark and between the pews where we sit is the bimah a raised area where the rabbi cantor and other people sit the rabbi leads the service and the cantor sings or rather chants a good part of it in the old days during what was called high reform the rabbis and cantors all wore long black robes to blend in with this country's other religions but that's not true any more except on the high holydays when they must wear white garments what i've pasted below is the entire structure of a traditional service in reform congregations this is considerably shortened usually most of the shemoneh esrei prayers are left out as well as chanting many of the psalms most reform synagogues only have services on the evening and morning of shabbat and they generally last or minutes respectively my synagogue also has a more traditional service tuesday morning i would say the majority of the service is in hebrew about or so the amount of davening bowing see below varies from place to place i personally daven more than most other reform jews but i really enjoy it men and women sit together in a reform service and both sexes can wear kippot yarmulkes and tallitot prayer shawls whether one does or not is a matter of personal choice i wear both just a quick note on orthodox services men and women sit separately because tradition says that mixing the sexes can interfere with one's concentration on prayer they are separated by a visual barrier so that men and women can't look directly at one another men always wear kippot and always wear prayer shawls in morning services jews do not wear a tallit for evening services the davening is more than in a reform synagogue and there is very little english i have been to reform conservative and orthodox services and can only say that the service itself is always quite moving whether or not the sermon which the rabbi delivers is inspiring or not depends upon the rabbi now for the cut and paste observant jews daven pray in formal worship services three times a day every day at evening ma'ariv in the morning shacharit and in the afternoon minchah daily prayers are collected in a book called a siddur which derives from the hebrew root meaning order because the siddur shows the order of prayers it is the same root as the word seder which refers to the passover home service central prayers undoubtedly the oldest fixed daily prayer in judaism is the shema this consists of deut deut and num note that the first paragraph commands us to speak of these matters when you retire and when you arise from ancient times this commandment was fulfilled by reciting the shema twice a day morning and night the next major development in jewish prayer occurred during the babylonian exile th century b c e people were not able to sacrifice in the temple at that time so they used prayer as a substitute for sacrifice the offerings of our lips instead of bulls as hosea said people got together to pray three times a day corresponding to the three daily sacrifices there was an additional prayer service on shabbat and certain holidays to correspond to the additional sacrifices of those days some suggest that this may already have been a common practice among the pious before the exile after the exile these daily prayer services continued in the th century b c e the men of the great assembly composed a basic prayer covering just about everything you could want to pray about this is the shemoneh esrei which means and refers to the blessings originally contained within the prayer it is also referred to as the amidah standing because we stand while we recite it or tefilah prayer as in the prayer because it is the essence of all jewish prayer this prayer is the cornerstone of every jewish service the blessings of the shemoneh esrei can be broken down into groups three blessings praising g d thirteen making requests forgiveness redemption health prosperity rain in its season ingathering of exiles etc and three expressing gratitude and taking leave but wait that's and didn't i just say that this prayer is called one of the thirteen requests the one against heretics was added around the nd century c e in response to the growing threat of heresy including christianity which was a jewish sect at the time but at that time the prayer was already commonly known as the shemoneh esrei and the name stuck even though there were now blessings many non jews upon hearing that there is a blessing like this assume it is much more offensive than it actually is here is what it says for slanderers may there be no hope and may all wickedness quickly be destroyed and may all your enemies be cut off swiftly the intentional sinners swiftly may they be uprooted broken cast down and subdued swiftly and in our days blessed are you l rd breaker of enemies and subduer of intentional sinners another important part of certain prayer services is a reading from the torah first books of the bible and the prophets the torah has been divided into sections so that if each of these sections is read and studied for a week we can cover the entire torah in a year every year our leap years are weeks long regular years are or so we double up shorter portions on a few weeks in regular years at various times in our history our oppressors did not permit us to have public readings of the torah so we read a roughly corresponding section from the prophets referred to as a haftarah today we read both the torah portion and the haftarah portion these are read at morning services on shabbat and some holidays in addition at monday and thursday morning services we read part of the upcoming shabbat's torah portion about to verses the first aliyah of the week's portion the torah and haftarah readings are performed with great ceremony the torah is paraded around the room before it is brought to rest on the bimah podium it is considered an honor to have the opportunity to recite a blessing over the reading this honor is called an aliyah for more information see torah readings that's the heart of the jewish prayer service there are however many additional prayers leading up to these things and following these things there is a long series of morning blessings at the beginning of the morning service some people recite these at home they deal with a lot of concerns with getting up in the morning and things we are obligated to do daily there is a section called p'sukei d'zimra verses of song which includes a lot of psalms and hymns i like to think of it as a warm up getting you in the mood for prayer in the morning some people don't show up for services until after that warm up there are also a few particularly significant prayers the most important is the kaddish one of the few prayers in aramaic which praises g d here's a small piece of it in english may his great name grow exalted and sanctified in the world that he created as he willed may he give reign to his kingship in your lifetimes and in your days and in the lifetimes of the entire family of israel swiftly and soon may his great name be blessed forever and ever blessed praised glorified exalted extolled mighty there are several variations on it for different times in the service one variation is set aside for mourners to recite the congregation only providing the required responses many people think of the kaddish as a mourner's prayer because the oldest son is obligated to recite it for a certain period after a parent's death but in fact it is much broader than that someone once told me it separates each portion of the service and a quick glance at any siddur daily prayer book shows that it is recited between each section but i don't know if that is its purpose another important prayer is aleinu which is recited at or near the end of every service it also praises g d here is a little of it in english to give you an idea it is our duty to praise the master of all to ascribe greatness to the molder of primeval creation therefore we put our hope in you l rd our g d that we may soon see your mighty splendor on that day the l rd will be one and his name will be one on certain holidays we also recite hallel which consists of psalms many holidays have special additions to the liturgy see yom kippur liturgy for additions related to that holiday outline of services there are a few other things but that's a pretty good idea of what's involved here is an outline of the order of the daily services evening service ma'ariv shema and it's blessings and related passages shemoneh esrei aleinu morning service shacharit morning blessings p'sukei d'zimra shema and it's blessings and related passages shemoneh esrei hallel if appropriate torah reading mondays thursdays shabbat and holidays aleinu ashrei psalm and other closing prayers psalms and hymns not on shabbat and holidays recited at the end of musaf instead on those days additional service musaf shabbat and holidays only recited immediately after shacharit shemoneh esrei aleinu and other closing prayers psalms and hymns afternoon service minchah ashrei psalm shemoneh esrei aleinu this is based on the ashkenazic service but the sephardic service has a very similar structure they use different music and have a few variations in choice of psalms hymns and prayers see ashkenazic and sephardic jews for more information a regular weekday morning service in an orthodox synagogue lasts about an hour the afternoon and evening weekday services which are usually performed back to back are about a half hour a shabbat or festival morning service which includes shacharit and musaf runs three to four hours but what else are you doing on shabbat the service starts early in the morning and runs through to lunch time the evening service on shabbat that is friday night and festivals are also somewhat longer than on weekdays variations from movement to movement the above is from the orthodox prayer book the reform service although much shorter follows the same basic structure and contains shorter versions of the same prayers with a few significant changes in content for example in one blessing of the shemoneh esrei instead of praising g d who gives life to the dead they praise g d who gives life to all because they don't believe in resurrection the conservative version is very similar to the orthodox version and contains only minor variations in the content of the prayers instead of praying for the restoration of the temple with its offerings and prayers they pray only for the restoration of its prayers see movements of judaism for more on the theological distinction between orthodox conservative and reform there are a few significant differences in the way that services are conducted in different movements in orthodox women and men are seated separately in reform and conservative all sit together see the role of women in the synagogue in orthodox and usually conservative everything is in hebrew in reform most is done in english though they are increasingly using hebrew in orthodox the person leading the service has his back to the congregation and prays facing the same direction as the congregation in conservative and reform the person leading the service faces the congregation most of the time conservative and reform are rather rigidly structured most people show up at the same time or if they don't they simply pick up where the group is and do the same thing at the same time orthodox is somewhat more free form people show up when they show up catch up to everybody else at their own pace often do things differently than everybody else for example different people may have different customs about when to stand when to bow and so forth this is terrifying if you don't know what you're doing but once you've got a handle on the service i find it much more comfortable and inspirational than trying to stay in unison navigating the siddur if you've never been to a jewish religious service following along can be quite a challenge even if you are experienced it's possible to get lost at times in fact a friend of mine tells me she once heard a song called the i don't know what page we're on in the siddur blues in most synagogues the person leading the service will periodically tell you what page they are on particularly when portions of the service are skipped in some synagogues they even have a flip board with the page numbers on it here are a few hints to help you stay with the group even if the leader isn't providing such assistance the biggest trick is being aware of the structure of the siddur itself the siddurs most commonly used in orthodox and conservative synagogues include within a single volume all of the prayers for all four prayer services shacharit musaf minchah and ma'ariv make sure you know which service you are attending normally services are held at two times of the day morning shacharit and musaf and early evening minchah and ma'ariv the morning services are generally at the beginning of the siddur while the afternoon and evening services are normally in the middle most siddurs include weekdays shabbat and most festivals in a single volume exception rosh hashanah and yom kippur have such extensive additions that they have their own separate siddur called a machzor to save space the sections are not laid out exactly in the order they are recited so you may need to skip around the book a bit for certain sections usually the prayer leader will tell you when you are skipping around but sometimes they will not watch for notes in the siddur that will tell you to skip to different sections depending on whether it is shabbat a festival i e non working day chol ha mo'ed intermediate days of festivals rosh chodesh the first day of a jewish month or a weekday most of the major skips will occur at the breaks in sections described above under outline of services above for example a shabbat morning service on rosh chodesh the first of the month in my siddur would begin with a generic morning blessings then would skip pages forward for a shabbat festival p'sukei d'zimra shema and shemoneh esrei then forward pages to pick up hallel which is recited on rosh chodesh then back to where i came from for the torah reading followed by the musaf shemoneh esrei and the closing blessings another skip that is confusing for most newcomers is the shemoneh esrei also called the amidah at the beginning of the shemoneh esrei the congregants stand they read through the entire prayer silently skipping the kedushah blessing and the priestly blessing this is a very long prayer pages in my siddur the process may take as much as five minutes and the end is not always clearly marked watch for oseh shalom may he who makes peace in his heights make peace for us and for all israel and let us say amen the shemoneh esrei ends with the paragraph after that one the leader of the service then begins repeating the entire shemoneh esrei aloud and you must flip back to the beginning to read along with it note the shemoneh esrei is not repeated at ma'ariv what to say and what to do another source of confusion for newcomers is what to say and what to do when do i say amen when do i stand or bow here are a few of the more common things to watch for there are a lot of these and not all of them are easy to spot the first time saying amen as a general rule you say amen whenever someone else says a blessing it's sort of the hebrew equivalent of saying ditto when you say amen it's as if you said the blessing yourself whenever you hear someone say barukh atah get ready to say amen the amen may be at the end of the current sentence or at the end of the current paragraph keep in mind that you only say amen when someone else says a blessing after all it would be silly to say ditto after something you yourself said there are a few other places where amen is said if the leader says v'imru amen let's say amen you join in on the word amen so watch for the word v'imru this comes up several times in the kaddish prayer there is also an additional amen within kaddish right at the beginning after sh'mei rabbah other responses to prayer on many occasions when a person says barukh atah adoshem others who hear him interject barukh hu u'varukh shemo this is generally recited very quickly and often sounds like barukh shemo and some people say it that way however you do not do this all the time and i'm not sure how to explain the pattern of when you do and when you don't there are several congregational responses in the kaddish prayer we noted above the many amens within kaddish in addition after the first v'imru amen the congregation recites y'hei sh'mei raba m'varakh l'alam ul'al'mei al'maya may his great name be blessed forever and ever also after sh'mei d'kud'sha in the next paragraph the congregation joins the reader in saying b'rikh hu blessed is he all of this is usually clearly marked in the siddur i have provided a text of the mourner's kaddish where you can see this all laid out whenever someone says bar'khu et adoshem ha m'vorakh bless the l rd the blessed one the congregation responds barukh ha m'vorakh l'olam va ed blessed is the l rd the blessed one forever and ever there are two times when this happens the bar'khu prayer a formal summons to prayer after p'sukei d'zimra and at the beginning of ma'ariv and as each person blesses the torah reading during the repetition of the shemoneh esrei when the leader recites the three part priestly blessing may the l rd bless you and safeguard you may the l rd illuminate his countenance for you and be gracious to you may the l rd turn his countenance to you and establish peace for you the congregation replies kein y'hi ratzon so be it after each of the three blessings standing you should stand at the following times when the ark is open when the torah is being carried around the room during the shemoneh esrei from the beginning of the silent portion until after the kedushah during the reader's repetition kedushah is the part that includes the kadosh kadosh kadosh holy holy holy blessing during the aleinu prayer near the end of any service there are a few other prayers that require standing but these are the most notable in addition in orthodox synagogues it is customary for everyone to stand when kaddish is recited except for the mourner's kaddish where only the mourners stand the prayer is usually rather clearly marked as kaddish and begins yit'gadal v'yit'kadash sh'mei raba may his great name grow exalted and sanctified however i have noticed in some non orthodox synagogues that the congregants do not stand during regular kaddishes or sometimes stand during mourner's kaddishes bowing judaism has a special procedure for bowing during prayer first you bend the knees then you bend forward while straightening the knees then you stand up see the animation at right bowing is done several times during the service during the aleinu prayer when we say v'anakhnu korim u'mishtachavim u'modim which quite literally means so we bend knee and bow and give thanks four times during the shemoneh esrei at blessed art thou l rd in the beginning of the first blessing at blessed art thou l rd at the end of the first blessing at we gratefully thank you at the beginning of the modim blessing and at blessed art thou l rd at the end of the modim blessing there is also a special bow during the oseh shalom blessing at he who makes peace in his heights bow to the left at may he make peace bow to the right at upon us and upon all israel bow forward during the bar'khu blessing after p'sukei d'zimra and at the beginning of ma'ariv the leader recites the bar'khu blessing during which he bows the congregation responds with barukh ha m'vorakh l'olam va ed and bows during torah readings when a person recites a blessing over the torah this same bar'khu and it's congregational response are recited with the same bowing often the bow here is less obvious seated congregants just sort of lean forward out of their chairs kissing the torah in any service where there is a torah reading there is ordinarily a torah procession a congregant holds the torah and carries it around the synagogue as the torah passes congregants they touch the cover with their hand or sometimes with a prayer book or with their tallit and then kiss their hand or whatever they touched it with in orthodox synagogues where the torah procession often does not encompass the women's section women generally reach out in the direction of the torah then kiss their hands after a torah reading the torah is held up in the air with its words facing the congregation it is traditional to reach out toward the torah usually with the pinky finger while reciting the congregational response v'zot ha torah then kiss the finger
