do you believe in a theory that a person gets ill when he has problems in his soul and he does wrong things did you have any experience like this that would prove this theory no i believe people get ill when they are not following the path they want but are surrendering to what others want whether that be their religion their job their conscience their decisions their beliefs their strongest desires etc i believe our bodies accept illness to tell us we are going against our needs and better judgment sometimes you know a better job will get you more money but suddenly you start getting aches and pains or acid reflux or stress which is your body telling you screw the extra money if you're going to kill yourself trying to earn it or maybe you're letting others run your life and suddenly you catch a cold that you hang onto for months or perhaps you feel guilty about something and you trip over the rug and break your wrist i think it's our body listening to our conscience because we aren't to get our attention sometimes drastic measures must be taken lol if you consider this idea and follow your heart instead of your wallet or boss' family or friends' desires if your health returns you'll know you made the right decision just my pov Conscience Sexual orientation Religion Theory of conduct Socrates EastEnders Abortion debate Alignment (role-playing games) Sigmund Freud Simone Weil Chronic fatigue syndrome Transsexuality Hypnosis Transactional analysis Determinism Dead Like Me David Hume Reincarnation Sant Thakar Singh Alcoholics Anonymous Psychoanalysis Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Utilitarianism Fasting Social rule Self-harm Meaning of life Kain (Legacy of Kain) Social psychology Baptist Sadism and masochism Days of our Lives The Apprentice 2 Charles Darwin's illness Michael Garibaldi Reparative therapy Carpal tunnel syndrome Panic attack Clinical depression Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Suicide Human sexual behavior Buddhism Religious Society of Friends Friends S__ren Kierkegaard Soul Homophobia Christian eschatology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Love Free will Dualism (philosophy of mind) Francis Crick Angel Spiritism Scouting Friedrich Schleiermacher Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Peter Singer Evil Procrastination Scientific method Current teachings of Prem Rawat Anorexia nervosa Mortification of the flesh Brainwashing American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) One Tree Hill (TV series) A Course In Miracles Religious conversion Subud Stoicism Sin City George Costanza Altruism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Immortality Hulk (comics) Reiki Narcissism Bible and reincarnation Capitalism Ten Commandments Psychology of religion Phoebe Halliwell Urinary incontinence W.I.T.C.H.
