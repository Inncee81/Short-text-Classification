do evolutionists owe christians an apology now what with the new evidence and all who has egg on their face now i'm sorry i don't have the link it'll be on the news scientists have discovered that man did not 'evolve' from apes but that early man and early apes developed simutaneously and lived along side each other that's essentially the gist of it i see the evolutionists scrambling to regroup i'm going to put this question to a vote to see which insult the evolutionists like best lol your characterization of the article as saying that 'man did not evolve from apes' is completely innacurate did you even read the article the findings described in the article have no impact whatsoever on the 'theory of evolution' what it does is improves our understanding of the particular evolutionary pathways that culminated in humanity this is a good thing here are a few things that it is important to understand dna does not evolve it experiences mutations organisms do not evolve organisms are essentially the 'proxies' for altered dna playing out the 'game' of survival procreation in 'meat space' dna whose proxy organisms manage to procreate get to move on to the next round kind of like jeopardy it is the genetic makeup of populations of organisms the 'gene pool' that 'evolves' changes over time in science 'theories' occupy a higher level of importance than mere 'facts' theories explain facts the 'theory of evolution' provides an explanatory framework for the observed fact that the genetic makeup of populations of organisms changes over time evolves the theory identifies two mechanisms which account for such changes genetic drift statistical variations in allele frequency within a local population over time natural selection the non random replication of randomly varying replicators there may be other mechanisms in play which have not yet been identified and accounted for and various scientists continue to quibble about that but none of what i have described above is in dispute within the scientific community claims to the contrary by creationists are nothing more than a red herring designed to bamboozle their scientifically ignorant constituency the 'comic book' version of science and evolution one of the saddest lessons of history is this if we've been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle we're no longer interested in finding out the truth the bamboozle has captured us it's simply too painful to acknowledge even to ourselves that we've been taken once you give a charlatan power over you you almost never get it back carl sagan regarding religion for those that say that evolution does not account for new species nonsense examples abound both in the 'world' and in the laboratory one of the most interesting examples and the most enlightening has to do with a kind of bird plovers if my memory is correct that occupies adjacent habitats all the way from siberia to britain because of environmental differences in these adjacent habitats topology food availability competitor species predators vegetation natural selection has produced genetic differences between the populations in these adjacent habitats birds in adjacent habitats can still mate with each other and produce offspring the genetic differences are small however the birds from the eastern most reaches of siberia can not produce offspring with those from britain over the reach of many habitats the accumulation of genetic differences makes them a different species much to the consternation of biologists who are involved with trying to classify the danged critters your question reveals that the foolishness that serves you as a substitute for knowledge and reason is a logical fallacy a flaw in thinking known as the argument from incredulity which is a sub category of the argumentum ad ignorantiam argument from ignorance it goes something like this i can't conceive of or imagine how this might have come to be therefore god did it that does not point to a limitation of nature rather it illuminates a limitation of your knowledge and or intellect and reasoning powers also it is intellectually dishonest since it does not as scientists do acknowledge the limitation of knowledge it merely invokes the fanciful idea of a supernatural creator entity to manifest the illusion that your ideas correlate to 'facts' 'faith' wishful magical thinking is a substitute for evidence 'belief' the internalized 'certainty' that you are privy to the 'truth' pertaining to some fundamental aspect of existence and or reality is a substitute for knowledge i e the illusion of knowledge faith belief self delusion and willful ignorance the greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance it is the illusion of knowledge daniel boorstin when
