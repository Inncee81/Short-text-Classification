did jesus do enough to save us really think about it i as a sinner deserve to have my flesh burned in hell for eternity jesus supposedly walked in and took my punishment on the cross for me but did he suffer enough to save me to save all mankind let's look at the facts as god i presume that jesus had a far greater capacity to endure pain than i have so whatever pain i should receive he should receive a zillionfold just to amount to the same physical torment somehow the pain sensitivity of his nerve endings should be supernaturally amplified to compensate for this problem also jesus would have to suffer this for every sinner basically his body would have to be cloned a few billion times with all these bodies' nervous systems somehow linked to a unique brain that of jesus who would then experience the just punishment of all humanity this punishment should last forever so what did jesus do got nailed on the cross for a couple of hours and stayed dead for three days which was more like hours or so oh yeah he also got whipped and some roman dudes took his stuff mortal scum got worse punishment in those days and stayed dead to boot doesn't that come up a little short this is supposed to compensate for the punishment demanded by god which is the burning of all sinners for ever and ever patrone thanks for the details this is all nice and good but it still lasts only a few hours am i not supposed to suffer all this and worse in hell forever is this enough to save me let alone everyone else don't expect him to save you two thousand years after his execution even when he was alive and in his prime years he wasn't able to save himself Justification (theology) Hell Immortality Sin Salvation Resurrection of Jesus Heaven Sola fide Original sin Mortification of the flesh Indulgence Eastern Orthodox Church Soul Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Crucifixion Torture Christian eschatology Judas Iscariot Theodicy Baptism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Capital punishment The Amber Spyglass Afterlife Divine grace Pain Mark Calaway Blood (computer game) Spanking Summa Theologiae Jehovah's Witnesses Characters of The Sandman Theory of conduct Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sin City Sacrifice Free will Abrahamic religion Purgatory Problem of Hell Kain (Legacy of Kain) Religion A Course In Miracles Christianity and anti-Semitism Abortion debate Supernatural John Lennon Human God Dispensationalism Paradise Lost Opus Dei Simone Weil Herbert W.
