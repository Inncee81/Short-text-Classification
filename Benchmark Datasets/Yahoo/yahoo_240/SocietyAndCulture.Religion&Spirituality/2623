who has a right to their opinion just curious i posted another question on here how my mother said that children would be better off with god than with a gay couple with this being said i asked her what she meant to have her clarify and she said in heaven my initial reaction was how do you get to heaven ummm you die so kids are better off dead then with parents that love them i am not arguing this point it was something she said and i don't think she thought it all the way though my mom isn't the type to promote killing kids and i understand what she was trying to say but just generally to that statement the idea someone would be having the right to think it is ok to kill a child a lot of the responses i had was she is entitled to her opinion really it's ok that someone thinks kids should die well what about the statement i think little year old girls are hot if someone said this would they still be entitled to their opinion where does the line get drawn i am not trying to incite a riot i really want to know because it makes no sense to me i just don't get it i was taught you keep certain things to yourself and even if it is your opinion somethings you don't say out loud personally my view on it is i think everybody has the right to think whatever they want but that should not give them the right to impose their views on anybody else in my opinion haha everyone is entitled to their opinions concern comes into play when opinions and beliefs turn into actions pedifiles can look at a child in lust and share his her opinion about it but the moment that person turns a thought into action is when a good ss whoopin takes place some peoples' opinions can be very harsh and self centered but they are only words right opinions are like ssholes everybody has one and they all stink Justification (theology) Theory of conduct Rick Santorum A Course In Miracles Epistemology Theodicy Summa Theologiae Teach the Controversy John Wycliffe Soul Intelligent design Confucius Laura Schlessinger Rich Mullins Predestination Evil Scientology beliefs and practices Socrates Mary, the mother of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origin belief Consensus decision-making Biblical inerrancy Philosophy of language Goodness and value theory Creationism Adam-God theory Yusuf al-Qaradawi Plame affair The Amber Spyglass Christian eschatology New Testament Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Free will Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Homophobia Sexual orientation Liberal Christianity The nature of God in Western theology John Howard Yoder Internet troll Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism David Hume Merit Political correctness Originalism Confucianism Polyamory Kyle Broflovski Atomism Reincarnation Gospel of Thomas Buddhism Heaven Sydney Riot of 1879 Humphrey Bogart Sola fide Christian views of Jesus Original sin Cultural relativism Roman Catholic Church Objectivist philosophy Scouting Church of Christ, Scientist Philosophical skepticism Falsifiability Salvation Purgatory Current teachings of Prem Rawat Paul of Tarsus Pharisees Baptism Ontological argument Karen Horney Philosophy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Euphemism Charmed Angel Philosophy of science Immanuel Kant Hell Determinism
