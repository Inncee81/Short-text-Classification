how important is tolerance compassion and acceptence of others in todays world they are all very important but they must each be understood in their proper context for example let's look at abortion i am personally against abortion but i have to accept that not everyone shares my views on what is life and what it's importance is that people are going to have abortions if i don't accept that as the way things are now i'm living in delusion i have a friend who had an abortion for reasons that i disagree with i will never agree with the reasons but i am also not her and therefore i work hard to have compassion for her situation but not all people have abortions for good reasons i can tolerate and even accept some situations where an abortion seems to be the best choice but i cannot tolerate for example the use of abortion as simply a form of birth control as such i work to make those situations less common this doesn't mean i condemn these people see above compassion please excuse the heavy example but i really wanted to point out that tolerance compassion and acceptences doesn't mean that you become a doormat to every other belief i didn't mean this to become a pro life or pro choice post Abortion debate Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abortion Evil Theory of conduct Homosexuality and Christianity Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Goodness and value theory Libertarianism Atheism Partial-birth abortion Originalism Nicomachean Ethics Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama Democracy Republic Religious pluralism Polyamory Roe v.
