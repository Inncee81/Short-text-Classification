what's the meaning of life there is nothing outside of you that defines a purpose for life no god who creates with some goal in mind humans are the only things who assign purpose or meaning because it's only humans who experience need and therefore set goals to fulfill this need however there is a spontaneous functioning to life that is defined by nothing and arises from the nature of experience itself which also arises spontaneously experience requires multiplicity which is the illusory dividing of wholeness into apparent parts this division brings with it a sense of lack if there is something that you are not you must be incomplete and so desire arises in it's infinite forms and we go about seeking it's fulfillment this seeking is the movement that is experience and regardless of the desire it is always a movement back to the wholeness which is our true nature and the circle is complete that's all that's happening here wadayathink the great play of maya all that lives works for protecting perpetuating and expanding consciousness when we dive deep into ourselves we find the source from where all meaning flows in the realm of non duality everything is complete its own proof meaning and purpose where all is one no supports are needed life is as it is we are always looking to make whatever is happening more different or better than it is we don t just allow whatever is to just be the way it is but if whatever is happening is the right experience that implies allowing it just the way it is freedom is available in every moment whenever you surrender your grasping and resistance pls share this through yahoo hope to c u there Yoga Sutras of Patanjali God Theodicy A Course In Miracles Meaning of life G__del's incompleteness theorem Friedrich Schleiermacher Objectivist philosophy Summa Theologiae Victor Cousin Free will Goodness and value theory Supernatural Sri Aurobindo Existence of God Infinity Rudolf Hermann Lotze Immortality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Aristotle Infantilism S__ren Kierkegaard Causality Simone Weil Predestination Soul Out-of-body experience Ontological argument Numerology Religion Sexual orientation Scientology beliefs and practices Halting problem Alcoholics Anonymous Propositional calculus Origin belief Cyberspace Art Philosophy of language Logic Kain (Legacy of Kain) Person Theology Philosophy of mathematics The nature of God in Western theology Extreme Programming Science Philipp Melanchthon Religious conversion Libertarian socialism Artificial consciousness David Hume Advaita Vedanta Atheism Asperger syndrome Pontryagin duality Brahman Ramanuja Entropy Jewish principles of faith Operational amplifier Al-Ghazali Adi Da Order theory Pratitya-samutpada Mortification of the flesh Laws of Form United Kingdom corporation tax Polyamory Adjoint functors Neo (The Matrix) Duties of the Heart Algorithm Urantia The Amber Spyglass Psychology of religion Peano axioms Evolutionary creationism Redundant array of independent disks Happiness Culture Opus Dei Charles Grandison Finney Time travel Democracy Brain-computer interface Occam's Razor Class (computer science) Property (ownership right) Scientific method
