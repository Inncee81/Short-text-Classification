i've noticed a lot of questions lately with the theme of death and what would you do if you only had so much time left this has been going on for days do you think someone is expecting to die these questions keep recurring is there something going on actually it's kind of spooking me well i think that death is something we should think about even though it's not a pleasant subject if we didn't think about death no one would make wills trusts living wills etc we like the idea of thinking and planning ahead and having control over things even after we die and i think the idea behind asking questions such as what would you do if you only had so much time left is to get you thinking about what you value most in life and what kinds of things you hope to do in your lifetime The Wizard of Id Altruism Predestination Theory of conduct Arthur Schopenhauer Current teachings of Prem Rawat Deconstruction John McDouall Stuart Coercion Free will Summa Theologiae Past teachings of Prem Rawat Social psychology Trust (Law) non-USA Dead Like Me Life insurance Simone Weil Milton H.
