do you consider evolution to be a religion personally i think that calling evolution a religion is an asinine attempt to try lower science to the level of fairy tales i hear the term evolutionist thrown around a lot and it makes me want to punch someone as there is no such thing as an evolutionist that's the kind of nonsense people spew when the only education they've had over evolution has come from an old guy with a bible who refers to it as evilution half of the time and devilution the other half of the time your thoughts please support your claim in some way no rambling about how i'm an evil atheist i will surely ignore you since scientific creationism has no evidence it can only act by attacking evolution since evolution is sound science rational attacks are impossible at the least deceptive level the practitioners turn to rhetoric they adopt the name science without using the scientific method while calling scientists evolutionists the key practice of calling evolution a religion is purely political they want to try to create a justification for attacking science education Atheism Creationism Religion Creation science Intelligent design movement Teach the Controversy Evolutionary creationism Intelligent design Creation-evolution controversy Creation and evolution in public education Phillip E.
