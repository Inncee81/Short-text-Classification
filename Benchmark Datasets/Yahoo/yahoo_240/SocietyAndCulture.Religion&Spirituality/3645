simple question some people will get the main point out of this and then some won't i can already see that coming so christians tell atheists that something can't come from nothing and yet say that god always existed atheists tell us that things can come into existance big bang and create time and matter and everything at the same coherent time and yet tell us that god could not be that reason so is there an actual difference in what both are saying christians have no evidence atheists have no evidence christians the universe is mature could be old atheists bible states that god made the universe complete and mature what is the point of spending our time fighting when no one has the answer so what is the point of fighting at the moment you might have an answer later but there is no answer now is there a very well thought out question i like these first off i must address a point you made about god always existing god created the universe we all live in and time as we understand it is a function of the universe which is to say that god created time this is how he has always been there he exists on a plane dimension whichever you prefer where time does not apply since our experience of time is entirely subjective we have no basis to comprehend the true nature of his existence this is a limitation on our part and in no way disproves the existence of a creator the other thing is that both sides have evidence aplenty we just can't agree on which parts to accept or on how the evidence applies or should be interpreted again we're only human none of this should preclude an ongoing discussion of the evidence as it comes in but i'll agree with you that all of the name calling and mud slinging is completely unnecessary even if it is kinda fun sometimes Religion Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Creationism Existence of God God Supernatural Origin belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles Agnosticism Evolutionary creationism Creation-evolution controversy Biblical inerrancy Free will Strong atheism Atomism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Creation science Infant baptism Determinism Ontological argument Philosophy of language Theodicy Afterlife Intelligent design Teach the Controversy Moral objectivism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philosophy Theology Presuppositional apologetics Resurrection of Jesus Pledge of Allegiance Halakha Jewish principles of faith Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish philosophy Faith and rationality Human Problem of evil Predestination History of creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion Trinity Old Earth creationism Theistic realism Fundamentalism Young Earth creationism Separation of church and state Jehovah's Witnesses Modern geocentrism Meaning of life Answers in Genesis The relationship between religion and science Deconstruction Abortion debate Socrates Phillip E.
