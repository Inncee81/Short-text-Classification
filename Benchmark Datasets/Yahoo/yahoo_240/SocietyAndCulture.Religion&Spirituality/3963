gospel according to john spoke of islam nexus helped us r a do you agree full gospel shirley please forgive spiderman he is devistated salam i assume you are speaking about paraclete the word for comforter advocate used in the injil john but the problem with that is that in all other parts of the injil paraclete always means the holy spirit although every greek manuscript says paraclete paracletos meaning one who comes along side some muslims argue that the word should be periklutos meaning praised one which in arabic is ahmad which muslims take to be muhammad there is a direct reference to ahmad in the quran surah as saff and so muslims find periklutos appealing because then a prophecy of muhammad can be deduced from the bible the problem however is that there is not a shred of evidence in support of this theory and the thousands of nt manuscripts predating islam none of them have periklutos and muslims are unable to produce a manuscript that does christians and all extant manuscripts have all confirmed that the word is paraclete as it stands even early testimonies of muslims testify that the bible's paraclete is the correct word for example ibn ishaq does not say that the word paraclete is periklutos in fact he confirmed that the word in greek is paraclete moreover he affirms that john wrote down the gospel that was revealed to jesus look at the quotes from the bible concerning the paraclete and i will pray the father and he will give you another comforter to be with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him you know him for he dwells with you and will be in you john but the comforter the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that i have said to you john but when the comforter comes whom i shall send you from the father even the spirit of truth who proceeds from the father he will bear witness to me john nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the comforter will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you john the context of the verses also do not support periklutos now here is a big problem if comforter refers to muhammad then we also have to accept that muhammad is the holy spirit in john contradicting muslim belief that the holy spirit is the angel gabriel that jesus sends muhammad in john and and that jesus sends muhammad in jesus' name that muhammad dwells with the disciples forever john not only is muhammad too late by years he can't dwell with them forever the argument that the truth law given by muhammad will be with them forever is spurious of course since they never receive it that the disciples of jesus know muhammad john all of which are unthinkable to a muslim the paraclete in christianity is a pneuma spirit or angel muhammd denied being either he said he was an ordinary man so could not be the paraclete jesus said when the parakletos comes whom i will send you from the father the spirit pneuma of the truth that proceeds from the father he will testify to me john john specifies that the paraclete will be with you forever the spirit of truth whom the world cannot accept because it neither sees him nor knows john him muhammed was not eternal nor a spirit was distinctly seen and known to the world as a mortal muhammad is but a messenger messengers the like of whom have passed away before him will it be that when he dieth or is slain ye will turn back on your heels he who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to god and god will reward the thankful quran the paraclete is to pneuma the spirit to hagios the pure one often translated as the holy spirit a pneuma can be an emissary or messenger angel but is always a being without a body at the baptism of jesus at the jordan river a pneuma pure spirit descended and remained on jesus throughout his minsitry jesus cast out demons by the pneuma he told nicodemus the pneuma moves where he wants to and you are hearing his voice but do not know where he comes from or where he is going before he died he told his followers that they knew the pneuma for he had been speaking through jesus for three years jesus said when he reached heaven he would petition the father to send another pneuma pure spirit to be in them throughout the age as the first emssiary came from god to help jesus the second emissary would be commissioned or sent by jesus to help his followers throughout the age since jesus was the truth the second pure spirit would be the to pneuma tes alethiea the emissary of jesus the pure spirit of the truth two paracletes are mentioned in the gospels they are diembodied beings sent by god to help they are not god but angels of god the second paraclete was sent to clarify the message of jesus the parables and dark sayings and difficult prophecies about his return the second pure spirit brought no new doctrines of salvation rituals or prophecies he did not come to give a roadmap of the future but to help the followers understand the words that jesus spoke Justification (theology) Historicity
