roman catholics is it a mortal sin to miss sunday mass for no serious reason if it is a mortal sin does one have to confess to a priest before receiving holy communion again what are the serious reasons by which you can miss sunday mass so that it is not a mortal sin if you died suddenly after neglecting mass for a flimsy reason would you die in mortal sin and thus go to hell remember the lord's day and keep it holy most certainly is in the bible so we are obliged to do this all the catholic church asks of us is one hour on sunday it's not a difficult obligation to meet mortal sins must be a serious matter the person must know it's a sin and the person must engage in the sin willingly so since refusing to worship the lord is a serious matter and you know it's a sin if you willfully miss mass on sunday or any other holy day of obligation it's a mortal sin yes you would need to confess to a priest before receiving holy communion again but you do not need to confess before attending mass again so say you miss mass on the first sunday of the month because you feel like sleeping in and then go shopping instead of attending the later mass in your area just 'cuz you don't want to bother with mass that late in the day you can't receive the eucharist until you go to confession but you can go to mass the following sunday and keep yourself from committing the same sin again even if you haven't been to confession yet serious reasons that allow for missing mass might include debilitating illness tending to a loved one who is dying getting into a car accident on the way to mass or some other form of accident being in an area where mass is not available no matter how far you can reasonably travel in a day giving birth to a child etc when possible receiving dispensation from a priest prior to missing mass is preferable once i was forced to work on a sunday and i thought the only mass available to me meant walking a mile through a questionable neighborhood in l a in the early morning when it was still dark so i got dispensation from my priest because it wouldn't have been safe however the schedule worked out such that i could walk safely to a parish when the sun was up so i was able to attend after all another time our kids were sick so i went to earlier mass while my husband stayed home and he was going to a later mass but just as he was getting ready to leave his dad called stranded on the interstate with a broken down vehicle by the time my husband got to him helped him tow the car to a shop for repair and drove him home there were no more sunday masses anywhere in the diocese so he called a priest and the priest gave him dispensation because my husband was honoring his father and serving somebody in need so that was an okay reason he still needed dispensation though the question about whether or not a person would go to hell for missing mass for a flimsy reason can only be answered by god god may see something in the person's heart that you and i cannot see so it would be wrong for any of us to speculate however we should all cultivate a love for going to mass and worshiping the lord even if the priest is boring the hymns are bad and the people are nosy judgmental stand offish or whatever we all have days when we just wish we didn't have to and that's okay too we're only human when my kids don't want to go to mass i tell them that god knows it's hard for them to make themselves go but that means he understands it's more of a sacrifice when they feel that way and he is all the more happy with them for making themselves go for his sake in the bible this is called the sacrifice of praise and it's a very good thing to practice Confession Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Catholicism
