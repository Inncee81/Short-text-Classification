how deep rooted is the evil of dowry in the muslim community and how muslim women lie about it and ignore it one mrs sweety had written to me stating that the evil of dowry exists in the hindu community and that in the muslim commuity the men give dowries and treat the women with respect i would like to invite her attention and all the members of this forum to the report in page of today's th august the hindu a muslim women by name hina fathima has been tortured by her husband by name firoz ahmed khan for the past years for dowry and the girl has been admtted to the hospitl with per cent burns and her eyes also bear cigrette burns educated muslim women also lie about the cruel treatment meted out to them by the muslim community this report is for the specific reference of mrs sweety who lied very sweetly from now on i shall be collecting evidences of the ill treatment of women by her community the taslima case in hydrabad yester day is another instance in point how long will this community lie about their culture and scripture the incident reported id of a muslim family whether they ae convrts or not is not he point majority of th emuslims her ear converts or bornof convertsonly and those who have forgotten their origins only what is inthe korn and what korn says is nt the point at issue that position woud apply to all religons what is done by the people a religons is th epaoint at issue and diversionary tactics do not help here to say that among hindus girls give dowry and among he muslims the men give dowry does not goto prove that dowry system is ot there among he muslims muslim societyis generallya reversalof other societies in all matters if he hindus shave of thier facial hairs the muslims grow their beard and facial hairs and if the hindus and others grow the hair on their heads the muslims shave them off if the women give dowries in the other communities the men give dowries in the muslim commuity at any rate the dowrysystem exists and in the present report that apperd in the hindu daily the man has beenharrassing the wife for dowry many sychg sthings should b going unreported also insingapore a father raped four of his five dauhters with the knowledg eof their mothrs it was ecuse of he actionof onlyone of his daughters he was booked his expalanation was that if he had no ddone that the girls would hav gone astray i would like to point out one sura in the koranwhich says ha if yu have slept with the wives of your father allah the merciful wouldpardon you do not commit it again if yu have slept with the daughters of yu r father allah the merciful woud pardon you donot commitit again this only shows the cuilture of he tribe to which the man who made quron belonged there is nothing to be proud of and there is n point in denying truths if you intent to corrct them hidig them and denying hem and say g that the orher commuities have somethig else is not helpful these accusaions coe in only whensome boasts of this religons in public and claims superiority over others all those who eat defecate which ever religons he belongs to this shoudb kept in mind if dowry exists in the hindu communnty the same exists amoing hemuslims too whichever communty they nmight hav belonged before theconvrsion there is n use sayg that kornprohibits so also the hidnu scriptures do nt sayhat dowry should b gien assome bodysaid that it is more a cultural aspect thjan a religious one but the point is that the cultiuralaspects of the tribes of arabia in marrying mutiple women and ggifting one of them to sleep with a friend whose is on a visit to one's family and commttinginchests and punishig the women who was forcibly raped and levinghe man unscathed and rewarding the fathr in law with the daughter in law as wife since he has raped her etc and are not in accordance with the civilization of this country and the muslims of this country woud dowell to chnage them and continue to remain as muslims with a rfined culture of this country and it won't be a nti religous for any one to continue toprctice his advanced culture wrongs can be corrected only by accepting the truth when at least it is pointed out with proof and not by denyi gthem or expalainig away and saying hat the persons committing them ar not muslims etc accordin to one's whim despite the production of a concrete proof Marriage Polygamy
