what does this bible verse peter mean to you everyone feel free to answer i don't care what your beliefs are so long as you can read and offer up a good opinion peter submit yourselves for the lord's sake to every human institution whether to a king as the one in authority or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right for such is the will of god that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men act as free men and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil but use it as bondslaves of god honor all people love the brotherhood fear god honor the king i take it to mean that even though a government may not be godly it is implimented in place by god and not submitting to it's laws therefore is like not submitting to god if we don't follow our country's laws we are not setting an example of a good christian to others around us we have freedom in christ maybe not to follow some of those laws such as not wearing a seatbelt because we know we are in the lord's protection but we can't use our freedom and faith in the lord in a way that dishonor god to others or make us lawbreakers the brotherhood is fellow christians the king is probably the king of the land Sola fide John Howard Yoder Ten Commandments Christian anarchism God Separation of church and state Sabbath Evil Soul Dispensationalism Theodicy Church of Christ, Scientist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles Jewish principles of faith Salvation Religious conversion Book of Isaiah Holy Spirit Resurrection of Jesus Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The Pilgrim's Progress Christian views of women Justification (theology) Presuppositional apologetics Original sin John Wesley Church of Christ Devil Merit Satan Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Sin Christian eschatology Summa Theologiae Status of religious freedom in Sudan Simone Weil Opus Dei Zoroastrianism Pharisees Religion Chosen people Antinomianism Biblical canon Fundamentalism Paul of Tarsus Free will Priesthood (Mormonism) Liberal Christianity God and gender John the Baptist Mortification of the flesh Theory of conduct Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rastafari movement Christian views of Jesus Bishop Shema Yisrael Articles of Religion (Methodist) Prevenient grace Pope Charles Grandison Finney Biblical inerrancy Royal Assent Trinity Noahide Laws Agap__ Moral objectivism School of Salamanca Book of Mormon Abington School District v.
