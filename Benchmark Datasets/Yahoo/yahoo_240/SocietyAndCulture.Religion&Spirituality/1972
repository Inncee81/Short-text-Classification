question for unbelievers in jesus sorry for question length say you were anti traditional marriage and you spent considerable effort trying to educate people on the evils and pointlessness of monogamy how it only restricts and removes any sort of sexual freedom then you meet a happily married couple of years who seem so in love and at peace with each other and the world that your only option based on the foundation you've already laid is to mock them and try your best to break up their relationship to save face but instead of them returning the insults or questioning their own relationship they show you many more couples just like themselves almost like a world unknown and unimagined by you until that time for many christians their relationship with jesus is the same consisting of such love and peace that life without him is incomprehensible i know christians can be annoying like a happy couple but why try to break down love when it is such an incredible thing to so many it's wonderful that you have that kind of faith because you believe in jesus does not mean you are right or that anyone else needs to believe the same as you what bothers me is how christians don't share this the thing you shared christians generally want the threat of hell to be what makes someone decide to be a christian i believe that is a form or terrorism scaring someone into believing what you think is right is terrorism your question is great because it does not threaten just explains what you believe i wish more christians were like you Marriage Polyamory Eastern Orthodox Church A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Avenue Q Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John Howard Yoder Opus Dei Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Trinity Paul of Tarsus Rich Mullins Evil Sola fide Religion Fundamentalism Church of Christ, Scientist Eucharist Coercion Dispensationalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theology Fiddler on the Roof The Smoking Room The nature of God in Western theology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Glen Jacobs Noah Baptist Monogamy Urantia Meaning of life Jewish views of religious pluralism Rapture Resurrection of Jesus Predestination Christian-Jewish reconciliation Emanuel Swedenborg Theory of conduct Heaven Altruism Infant baptism Book of Isaiah Christian view of marriage God Emperor of Dune Polygamy Christian views of Jesus Christian anarchism Religious Society of Friends Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sin City Presuppositional apologetics Sexual orientation Ex-gay Christianity God Church of Christ C.
