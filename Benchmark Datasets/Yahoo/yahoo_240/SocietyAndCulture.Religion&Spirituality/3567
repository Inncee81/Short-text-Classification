trinity proven false once and for all mark and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord this does show that god is one and has no partners and the trinity is a false doctrine take a look at this it talks about what is commanded to us by god and what is most important mark new american standard bible pay close attention to verse one of the scribes came and heard them arguing and recognizing that he had answered them well asked him what commandment is the foremost of all jesus answered the foremost is 'hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength ' the second is this 'you shall love your neighbor as yourself ' there is no other commandment greater than these the scribe said to him right teacher you have truly stated that he is one and there is no one else besides him and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love one's neighbor as himself is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices when jesus saw that he had answered intelligently he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god after that no one would venture to ask him any more questions most christians believe that jesus had to be sacrificed in order for god to forgive sinners but this is wrong you see god forgives who he wants to forgive and his forgiveness is not contingent upon any sacrifice even vs states that loving god and one's neighbor is more than all burned sacrifices it doesn't say it's almost more than most sacrifices or some sacrifices but more than all sacrifices in fact it says that loving god and one's neighbor as one's self is worth much more than all burned sacrifices so there is no need for a triune god there is no need for a blood sacrifice by jesus there is no need for any partners with god jesus wasn't sent to die he was sent to teach people how to love god and each other and to forgive and to come back to god period the popular christian belief is that god had to sacrifice himself in jesus but this is baloney god doesn't have to do anything and can and does forgive whenever and however he wants the trinity is false love god love your neighbor that's it worth more than any sacrifice much more God Ten Commandments Salvation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin A Course In Miracles Sola fide Christianity Pharisees Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abrahamic religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Baptism Christian views of Jesus Justification (theology) Resurrection of Jesus Roman Catholic Church Old Testament Charles Grandison Finney Jesus Soul Jewish principles of faith Book of Isaiah Meaning of life Religion Prophet Paul of Tarsus Summa Theologiae Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Angel Alan Campbell (pastor) Christian eschatology Cultural and historical background of Jesus Sabbath Church of Christ, Scientist Divine grace Abraham Virgin Mary in Islam Original sin John Wycliffe Great Apostasy Chosen people Creationism Council of Jerusalem Catechism Messiah Hell Book of Mormon Infant baptism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rastafari movement Judas Iscariot John Howard Yoder Dispensationalism Ethics in the Bible Mass (liturgy) Temple in Jerusalem Nontrinitarianism Purgatory Merit Jewish views of religious pluralism Christian apologetics Heresy Prayer Judaism Biblical inerrancy Slow Train Coming Existence of God Shema Yisrael Eucharist Church of Christ Gospel of Barnabas Martin Luther Articles of Religion (Methodist) Gospel of Thomas Theodicy Monotheism Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Revelation End times Book of Ezekiel Jews as a chosen people Mary, the mother of Jesus Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) John the Baptist Catholicism Eschatology Qiyamah Holy Spirit Love Mormonism and Christianity
