what's wrong with the christian creation myth all over the world religions and cultures have beliefs explaining the beginning of the universe and the beginnings of life on this planet so why are believers of the evolution creation myth singling out believers of the christian creation myth for special attention discombobulated the other question was my own same as this one you are unreal evolution is taught in science classes because it was derived from the observation of empirical evidence the genesis story is a narrative that was written down by men without any observed evidence of its validity people that teach evolution as a process that explains the changes of adaptation in a specie are not at all threatened by the biblical story of genesis its the other way around ignorant people throughout history have always tried to hamper the pursuit of truth that doesn't fit into their preconceived model of what is supposed to be if you think the above paragraph was a veiled attempt of mine to call you ignorant let me be perfectly clear while you may be very knowledgeable and informed in other areas of your life on this subject you are ignorant you are actually the definition of the word ignorant to say that people are intolerant when objecting to genesis being taught in science classes along side the theory of evolution is a hypocrisy years ago you would of kept evolution from being taught at all i have no problem if you want to teach genesis in a religious program or a philosophy class but don't try and bring it into our schools as science and try to retard the intellectual growth of our children to say that creationism is science is to say that god is a liar and has created false evidence for the sole purpose of fooling us i prefer to believe in a god that created a wonderful and mysterious universe and that god wants us to try and understand it for what it is not for what we think it should be Creation-evolution controversy Supernatural Intelligent design Origin belief Religion Creation science Evolutionary creationism God Young Earth creationism Intelligent design movement Mythology Flood geology History of creationism Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Human Creation according to Genesis Christian apologetics Teach the Controversy Evolutionism Existence of God Urantia Cosmology Trinity Church of Christ, Scientist Epistemology Genesis Answers in Genesis Phillip E.
