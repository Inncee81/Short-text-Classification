what event took took place in your life or pondering thoughts that ebbed your faith what tide returned your faith to strength your faith i was raised in a christian environment but i think that for everybody there comes a time to question what you've always been taught to own it for yourself it is difficult to pin point a definite event or time for this one just starts questioning to see if it is true what i discovered is that secular humanism tolerates everybody except those who disagree with them saying there is no wrong but then saying that those who say there is wrong are wrong breaks down the very foundation of their own belief system and secular humanists believe that humans can do anything they've set their minds to but where did the first thought or emotion come from not from matter nor was it something we could accomplish did it just happen but if it just happened and we did not cause it then there is something humans can't control also breaking down a foundation of that faith others live for themselves but self is so small and if my world is all wrapped up in myself i miss a lot that is going on around me others believe that they can reach paradise by being good and loving selflessly but to love selflessly to get to paradise means there is a hidden selfish goal defeating the purpose of selflessness the bible says that all sin i've not seen anybody achieve perfection babies cry to get needs met children have to be taught to be good although there were kind acts after hurricane rita there was also looting the shows american justice and notorious are enough to make one sick at just how depraved we can be we want to be in control of all events the god of our lives the second we hear that we should not do something we want to do it this is rebellion the bible says that people who sin everybody does not like to hear they are sinners this i also found to be true the bible said that we can not do anything to change the fact that we are sinners i've tried long enough to know that is true in essence i've found everything else to be a lie and the bible to be true i can't become perfect so i finally gave up and let god do it through me as the bible promises to those who believe that jesus died to pay the penalty for their sins and rose again to break the power of sin and death and i've seen more transformation in me since doing that than i ever had before confirming the bible's word to me once again Summa Theologiae Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Salvation Original sin Theodicy Sola fide Meaning of life Evil Predestination Justification (theology) A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Repentance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church Religion Roman Catholic Church Urantia Calvinism Merit Trinity Divine grace Church of Christ, Scientist Infant baptism Church of Christ Baptism Opus Dei Resurrection of Jesus John the Baptist Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish principles of faith Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious conversion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Holy Spirit Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions John Howard Yoder Fundamentalism Creationism Religious pluralism Book of Mormon Purgatory Love John Wesley Reinhold Niebuhr Indulgence Atheism Homosexuality and Christianity John Wycliffe Miracle Heaven Christian views of Jesus Christian eschatology Mortification of the flesh Sant Thakar Singh Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Satanism Total depravity Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Jesus Goodness and value theory Legalism (theology) Abrahamic religion Great Apostasy Sant Mat Prophet Jewish Messiah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Judaism Numerology S__ren Kierkegaard Paul of Tarsus Evangelicalism Book of Isaiah Bible and reincarnation Jewish eschatology Community of Christ Objectivist philosophy Eucharist The Amber Spyglass Altruism Philosophical skepticism Sacrifice Contrition Theory of conduct
