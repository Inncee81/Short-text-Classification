why do christians say or believe that jews killed the son of g d jesus rambam and many other prominent jewish scholars believe that the stories of jesus are based on yeshu ben pandeira also known as yeshu ha notzri jesus the branch a reference to isaiah a passage about the messiah yeshu is discussed in parts of the talmud that were censored by the catholic church censored because the church also believed they referred to jesus and because they are not flattering references the talmud claims that this yeshu was the son of a jewish woman named miriam mary who was betrothed to a carpenter their marriage was in the stage of kiddushin where she is legally his wife but not yet living with him or allowed to have sexual relations with him she was either raped or voluntarily slept with a greek or roman soldier known as pandeira that is jesus's real dad not g d as some christians claim and yeshu jesus was the product of that union because of the status of miriam's as incestuous yeshu is considered to be a mamzer which is translated as bastard it means the product of an adulterous or incestuous relationship some say that he was also a ben niddah conceived through intercourse with a woman in a state of menstrual impurity which is also said to leave a stain on the offspring so how can you blame us for killing the son of g d the talmud describes jesus as a heretic who dabbled in sorcery and lead the people astray into idolatry we can see now how the churches are full of idols of him that is why he was put to death by the sanhedrin for his crimes and in accordance with the procedure for heretics his dead body was hung in a tree until nightfall after his death were jesus and yeshu the same person many jewish sages in history believed so the main problem in identifying yeshu with jesus is timing the sanhedrin did not have the power to impose the death penalty at the time that christians say jesus died at the time when roman procurators like pilate were running the show so if jesus was yeshu then he must have died much earlier however because of mel gibson's recent movie i understand that there is reasonable curiosity about what judaism has to say about jesus that movie is a fake even the dead sea scroll proves that jesus did not die on the cross it is important to understand that jesus is simply not a part of judaism in your religious institutions you study your own religion you don't study every other religion in the world and explain why they're wrong we do the same we don't study why we don't believe in jesus because he's simply not a part of our religion if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die jesus is a false messiah http www evilbible com jesus false htm Religious conversion Sanhedrin Abrahamic religion Historical Jesus Heresy Mary, the mother of Jesus Ten Commandments Capital punishment Cultural and historical background of Jesus Prophet Jewish Messiah Jewish views of religious pluralism Biblical canon Sin Religious perspectives on Jesus Jewish view of marriage God and gender Christian views of Jesus Religion and sexuality Korban Birth control Christianity Halakha Maimonides Baptism Apocrypha New Testament view on Jesus' life Christianity and anti-Semitism History of Christianity Homosexuality and Christianity Anti-Semitism Jewish eschatology Bible Names and titles of Jesus Idolatry Jews in the Middle Ages Jewish principles of faith Roman Catholic Church Eastern Orthodox Church Messianic Judaism Barabbas Persecution of Christians Miracle Joseph of Arimathea Kabbalah Sabbath Mormonism and Judaism Jew The Passion of the Christ Moses Abraham Trinity Creationism Holy Spirit Christian-Jewish reconciliation Schisms among the Jews Chabad Lubavitch Dispensationalism Nahmanides Mishnah Mary Magdalene Apostle Gospel of John Dead Sea scrolls Homosexuality Book of Isaiah Christian denomination Incest Jerusalem Religion Shabbat God Satan Nazarene Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses New Testament apocrypha Reincarnation Religious pluralism Kohen
