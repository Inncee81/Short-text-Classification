sylvia brown i happened to flip the channel to montel williams when suddenly i heard sylvia say the believers will say oh god why are you doing this to me oh god this was on the episode when a singing fish warns family about neighbors house burning sounds kinda weird sylvia brown is a hoot she writes a new book every week personally i think her cold reading on montel is dispicable because so many ignorant people believe it is real she should just stick to eating twinkies on her couch while smoking pack after pack of virginia slims or maybe mistys i wonder why she won't take james randi up on his millon dollar paranormal challenge maybe because every fraud who has done so before has been exposed for what they are James Randi Sylvia Browne Pok__mon Live!
