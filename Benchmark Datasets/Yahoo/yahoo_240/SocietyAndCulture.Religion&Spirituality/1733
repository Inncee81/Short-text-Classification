what do u think could make sum who is iffy on the fact of whether or not the bible is true become a believer just wondering prayer i know it sounds corny and cliche but it's what worked for me if you have a bible then start reading it when you come across something that sounds fishy or doesn't make sense to you stop reading and say a quick little prayer to figure out what it all means maybe you will get a feeling like it is true or something it's totally personal and different for everyone or before you begin a reading session say a prayer to have your mind enlightened and to be able to understand what you read and to be able to know the truth of it just pray about it you can't base your decision off of facts or theories it's all about what you feel Prayer Church of Christ, Scientist God A Course In Miracles Religious Society of Friends Spiritism The nature of God in Western theology Salah Witchcraft David Hume Jewish principles of faith Prayer in Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Scientology beliefs and practices Eastern Orthodox Church Idolatry God and gender Mantra Theory of conduct Religion Age of Enlightenment Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ten Commandments Brahman Numerology Time Out of Mind Tetragrammaton Moses Epistemology Donald Davidson (philosopher) Charles Grandison Finney Sin Ludwig Wittgenstein Sola scriptura John Wesley Merit Charles Darwin's views on religion Prophet Biblical inerrancy Love Free will Hinduism Buddhism Book of Mormon Philosophical skepticism Sant Mat Ethics Liberal Christianity Yusuf al-Qaradawi Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Meaning of life Goodness and value theory Alan Campbell (pastor) The Da Vinci Code Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish services Gautama Buddha Apocrypha Supernatural Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Roman Catholic Church Zohar Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Jews as a chosen people Miracle John Cage Bible Creationism Catechism Vacuous truth Immanuel Kant Cultural relativism Alcoholics Anonymous Postmodernism Christian eschatology Saint Calvinism Vishnu sahasranama Urantia Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Deconstruction Atheism Kitsch Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Anglo-Saxon literature Lord's Prayer K' Bertrand Russell Abrahamic religion Fundamentalism Mary, the mother of Jesus Christianity Infant baptism Judaism Edgar Cayce Philo Soul
