is christianity or religion in general that evil what if you banned religion seriously people and nations were at war and committing atrocities before christianity just look at the pagan roman empire and greek civilizations whether or not they believed in a personal god they were still busy hacking away at each other yes they were pagans so they did have religions but what about our supposed ancestors i mean like cavemen and early humans before they had any kind of organized religion they most likely beat the butter out of other tribes of early humans so most likely they could care less about another tribe's religion they killed each other for other reasons so if you're a rational person whether atheist or christian why does everyone think the world will be more peaceful without religion would people just find other reasons to justify murder killing and war i think we would also lose the good effects of religion as well i mean consider regardless of what religion one is today they all generally teach it is wrong to kill wrong to lie wrong to steal what would happen when those religious influences were taken away would we start killing raping stealing doing as we please sure there may be less wars but there might be more individual crime Religion Evil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Abortion debate Sacrifice Sin Theodicy Theory of conduct Atheism Christianity Religion and abortion God Patriotism Morality Ten Commandments Historical persecution by Christians Religious conversion Problem of Hell Separation of church and state John Howard Yoder Supernatural Jewish views of religious pluralism Jewish philosophy Friedrich Schleiermacher Existence of God Christian anarchism Value system Prophet Argument from morality Apologetics Resurrection of Jesus Religious views of suicide Neopaganism Sabbath Predestination Heaven Icon Theology Exorcism Hell Religious Society of Friends Greeks Christian Identity Great Apostasy Religion and sexual orientation Creationism Trinity Apostasy Human nature Reincarnation Japanese war crimes History of Christianity Prayer Evangelicalism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eschatology Religion and sexuality Rastafari movement School of Salamanca Civil religion Capital punishment Coercion Cultural and historical background of Jesus Pre-Adamite Aristotle Fundamentalism Monotheism Magic (paranormal) Chosen people Moses Germanic paganism Evolutionary creationism Abrahamic religion Ethics Eastern Orthodox Church Pledge of Allegiance Unitarian Universalism Philo Gandhism Love Mythology Soul Dark Ages Christianity and anti-Semitism Moral objectivism
