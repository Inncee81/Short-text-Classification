what exactly are religious people being told during this time of warning give me your opinion my opinion more and more preachers are urging their people god wants you to get rich he wants you to be first class they are falling into the same money focused gospel that jesus drove out of the temple in his day i don't hear many preachers talking about the end times and the signs what i still hear is the name it and claim it solomon warns not to be poor so we don't steal and not be rich and forget about god i didn't see jesus living an extravagant life this to me is covertness and we shouldn't do this as god our father owns all it is as in the time of noah people went about eating getting married etc this is what i see today people are oblivious to what is going on only a few see it and i believe even less preachers are preaching it sin isn't preached on as compromise won't let toes be stepped on too many feel good messages well hell won't feel good Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Noah Church of Christ John the Baptist Alan Campbell (pastor) Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Rich Mullins Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Holy Spirit Jesus Christian views of Jesus Religious Society of Friends Prophets of Islam Sabbath John Wesley Huldrych Zwingli Ten Commandments George Fox Baptism Salvation Virgin Mary in Islam Opus Dei Repentance Soul Christian monasticism Gospel of Thomas Joseph Smith, Jr. Articles of Religion (Methodist) Christianity and anti-Semitism Resurrection of Jesus Plame affair Mormonism and Judaism Divine grace Liberal Christianity Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Dispensationalism Judas Iscariot Prophet Isa Primitive Methodism Christian eschatology Hell Judaism Abrahamic religion Charles Grandison Finney Rastafari movement Endowment (Mormonism) Clemens Maria Hofbauer Priesthood (Mormonism) William M.
