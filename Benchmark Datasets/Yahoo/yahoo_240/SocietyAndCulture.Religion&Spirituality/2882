fellow muslim siblings is allah pleased with me how often do you ask yourself that how often at the end of the day find yourself recalling the days events to see if you have done anything against the will of allah i was reading this hadith the prophet peace be upon him also said the mostly hated among men to allah is the one who is severe facing others with enmity sah h al bukh r and sah h muslim this hadith applies to everyone then i thought of the whole shiite and sunni struggles why all of this enmity dear brothers and sister i think if we focused on being just muslim and spreading love to one another including to those who are non muslims we would be attaining allah's mercy don't you agree you know it is really hard for me to believe that there is a huge conflict between the shia and the sunnis it seems like it has been blown up by the media in recent years but it does not reflect the correct situation i come from a family where my dad is shia and my mom is sunni i don't see them or any one else in my family going against each other i have went to school with people of both the sects yet i haven't seen any one bashing the other side having lived in neighborhoods with mixed sects i haven't seen any one throwing rocks at the other side so to me this picture of sectarian conflict is false i agree with you we should all be united and treat each other with respect and that respect be extended towards others as well not just the muslims doesn't the quran tell us that there is no compulsion in religion why can't we all just treat each others like humans we are humans first and then comes the religion part Shi'a Islam Sunni Islam Qiyamah Apostasy in Islam Criticism of Islam Historical persecution by Muslims Yusuf al-Qaradawi Aqidah Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Muhammad Hadith Women in Islam Religious pluralism Ali Imam God Alawite Abrahamic religion Women as imams Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Qur'an John the Baptist Five Pillars of Islam Succession to Muhammad Divisions of Islam Nation of Islam Apostasy Qur'an alone Jizya Religion Jerusalem Banu Qurayza Hijab Sufism Islam and anti-Semitism Prophets of Islam Imamah Religious conversion Wahhabism Intercession of saints Nikah Mut'ah Salah Aisha Sectarianism Sunnah Fundamentalism Islamic world Husayn ibn Ali Mahdi Sectarian violence in Iraq Homosexuality and Islam Religion and sexuality Idolatry Muqtada al-Sadr Adam and Eve Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization Prophet Talaq (Nikah) Battle of Bassorah Islam as a political movement Islamic view of marriage Arab Eid ul-Fitr Salman the Persian United Submitters International Tawh__d Muhammad al-Mahdi Saint Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Sahaba Allah Hajj Bilal ibn Ribah Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi History of Islam Virgin Mary in Islam Maria al-Qibtiyya Muraqaba Islamic calendar Persecution of Muslims Ja'far al-Sadiq Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Islam and Judaism Basra InterFaith Salvation Mohammad Ali Jinnah Evolutionary creationism
