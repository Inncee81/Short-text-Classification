do you take communion at your church if so how often please give details why your church does it that way i grew up in a christian church and have always been taught that you take communion every sunday b c the way we always looked at it jesus said whenever or more are gathered in his name do this meaning communion in rememberance of him b c of recent events in life i have started attending a baptist church and i really do like it the thing i can't get used to tho is they almost never do communion i have heard the pattern is whenever theirs sundays in a month they do it then but i'm not sure as a person who has always thought you always took communion at a church service i have had difficulties figureing out how they interpret it differently and want to kind of see where i really stand on it not just go with what ive always done so whats your take on how communion should be done and if you can give me scripture or anything to back it up so i can have some different view points on it i would really appreciate it thanks where exactly is it in the bible this kinda proves that i need to go read it for myself once again to see where i really stand i'm just not sure what part its in never questioned it before in acts it says on the first day of the week the disciples gathered together to break bread every week has a first day sunday this verse indicates that the lord s supper was one of the primary reasons the early christians met on sunday corinthians also uses this phrase on the first day of the week in the command to take up a collection on the first day of the week the nasb translates this as on the first day of every week it is recognized by those translators that this command was a pattern for every week this language is very similar to the command in the old testament to remember the the seventh day as the sabbath those under the law of moses realized that every week had a seventh day so they remembered the sabbath every saturday some say that if you partake of the lord s supper that often it becomes too commonplace and routine if an item of worship looses its meaning it is not because we practice it too often should we pray less often so it is not routine should we only worship once or twice a year so that it does not become too routine should we not sing as often if we love god we will want to remember christ often this is the purpose of the lord s supper a reminder of christ if we have the proper reverence for christ this will be something we look forward to every week and it will not loose its meaning yes where i go to church on the first day of the week we gather together to break bread and drink of the cup to worship honor and remember christ this follows the example given in acts Mass (liturgy) Baptist Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Holy Spirit Protestantism Baptism Agap__ Christian eschatology Christian views of Jesus Dispensationalism Biblical canon Plymouth Brethren Trinity Mary, the mother of Jesus Roman Catholic Church Christianity Jehovah's Witnesses Mormonism and Judaism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses New Testament Book of Mormon Saint Peter Community of Christ Great Apostasy Bible Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Resurrection of Jesus History of Christianity Transubstantiation Infant baptism Fasting The Last Supper Catechism Philipp Melanchthon Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Canonical hours Abrahamic religion Jesus Biblical inerrancy A Course In Miracles Gospel Articles of Religion (Methodist) Restorationism Didache Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aramaic of Jesus Mormonism and Christianity Homosexuality and Christianity God Old Testament Sola fide Liturgical year Psalms Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eucharistic discipline Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Martin Luther Church of Christ, Scientist Mission (Christian) Gospel of Mark Christian denomination History of the English Bible Idolatry Paul of Tarsus Evangelicalism Local churches Apostle Salvation Sunday Catholicism Prophet John Wycliffe John the Baptist Religious Society of Friends Bishop Alan Campbell (pastor) Pharisees Apostolic Succession Saint Christianity and anti-Semitism Fundamentalism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon True Jesus Church Iglesia ni Cristo Justin Martyr Apocrypha Sacrament (Mormonism) Rapture
