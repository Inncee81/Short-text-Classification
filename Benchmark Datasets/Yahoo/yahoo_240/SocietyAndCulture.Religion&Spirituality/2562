has anyone ever met a real deal satan worshiper i'm just curious i've heard the fundamentalists going on about how satan worshiper's are all around and i don't really think they are i'm not talking about some freind you have that's into death metal either i mean real deal cultists that are into sacrifices and stuff like that i have know quite a few satanists and left hand pathers in my time the types of people you are referring to have psychological issues and have nothing to do with real satanism generally speaking satanists do not worship satan he represents an ideology although there are some theistic satanists but as i said generally they do not also don't make the mistake of lumping practitioners of tribal and syncretist spiritualities that make use of sacrifices such as vodou santeria etc into your real deal cultists that are into sacrifices blood sacrifices were for the most part present in all religions at one time or another including judaism and christianity jesus being one big whopper of a human sacrifice in instances of real religious blood sacrifice the animal is killed in a very controlled and humane fashion much more so than most animals bred and butchered for grocery stores and are often treated like royalty for a long period before they are offered blood magick the use of one's own blood is practiced by many witches occultists magickians etc but it does not involve injuring or harming anything other than drawing some own blood from themselves and a small amount at that to reiterate some sick people buy into the hollywood and mainstream religious propaganda and use that as an excuse to act out their twisted fantasies but they are just that twisted fantasies if you ever do meet anyone who claims to do all that stuff run away they are either full of bullsh t or sick individuals who should be reported animal torture is an early indicator of homocidal psychopathic and sociopathic tendances stay the hell away from people who do it and report them Magic (paranormal) Witchcraft Satanism Sacrifice Satan Religion Satanic ritual abuse Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Demon Evil Historical persecution by Christians Cult Religious conversion Christianity Religious pluralism Hell Witch-hunt Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Voodoo Jehovah's Witnesses Roman Catholic Church Human sacrifice Church of Christ Resurrection of Jesus Great Apostasy Wicca LaVeyan Satanism New Age Urantia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eucharist Saint Magic and religion Germanic Neopaganism Sin Ten Commandments Paganism Blood Pharisees Prophet Dianic Wicca Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Cultural and historical background of Jesus Chick Publications Judaism Idolatry Exorcism Zoophilia Historicity of Jesus Angel Blood (computer game) Opposition to cults and new religious movements Scientology beliefs and practices Kashrut Gnosticism Criticisms of Christianity Theology Christian denomination A Course In Miracles Supernatural Mormonism and Christianity Iconoclasm Demonology The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Fundamentalism Esotericism Antichrist Pok__mon Jesus Utilitarianism Ancient Greek religion Blood libel against Jews Sabbath Theodicy Culture of Haiti Jewish principles of faith Black metal Capital punishment Buddhism Lukum__ Coercion Psychology of religion Harry Potter Mormonism Witch trial Deprogramming
