christians and global warming disclaimer am not against any religion in fact i've identified myself as christian all my life am but there are just some really contradicting things out there so am just really trying to understand do christians believe that the effects of global warming will happen i dont clam to know a whole lot about religion but i do know in the bible it says that god will never drown the earth again remember noah but to me what the scientist say about global warming makes clear sense what do christians say think about global warming do they not think it will happen or ok first of all global warming will not drown the earth yes i'm aware that some people for propoganda purposes have gone around spouting such things as the water level rising by feet but most scientists say that's rediculous my father himself an engineer and math whiz has himself calculated that it will never reach anywhere near feet you can do this yourself go and search for the surface area of the ocean and for the square cubic feet of ice on earth's poles using these two you can figure out how much the water level will rise if the ice melted all with a little math you will find the rise to be negligible compared to feet even if the water level rose by feet that could still not flood the whole earth granted we would be missing florida and several other areas but places like denver colorado are a mile up in the air so while we could say it would be a major flood it wouldn't be a cataclysm comparable to noah's flood which covered the whole earth so god's definitely not setting the world up for another deluge as for whether or not christians believe in global warming it seems to just be personal preference depends on your politics etc i personally have found that global warming is often a lot of hype like a modern day th day adventistism where everyone runs around screaming it's the end of the world just like how they said the population would become too big how oil would run out by etc those who profit from the environmental disaster panic will just keep pushing the dates back if the prescribed disaster doesn't arrive on time and until i see definitive evidence that this will have an awfully bigger effect than it has shown to possibly have by reasonable scientists then i will hold off demanding major economic changes etc although i do favor hydrogen cars it is always possible in trying to fix something small that you may by accident end up with a bigger problem Flood geology Global warming Noah's Ark Sea level rise Noah Effects of global warming Water Deluge (mythology) Ozone depletion Biblical inerrancy Creationism Climate change Permian-Triassic extinction event Ozone hole Young Earth creationism Global cooling Energy development Supernatural Tide Urban heat island Natural disaster Gravity Nuclear power Mitigation of global warming Sea level End of civilization Little Ice Age Carbon dioxide Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans End times Microeconomics Solar system Creation science Black Sea deluge theory Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change History of creationism Mars Global climate model The Day After Tomorrow Waterworld Tropical cyclone 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Evangelicalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Moon Religion Climate of the United Kingdom Ecology Water (molecule) Predestination Exploration of Mars Flood Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina The nature of God in Western theology Ecco the Dolphin Luminiferous aether Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Panama Canal Insurance Sexual orientation Theodicy Scientific opinion on climate change Inflation Petroleum The Skeptical Environmentalist Pollution Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Kyoto Protocol Glacier Meaning of life Cyclone God Greenhouse gas A Course In Miracles Chernobyl accident Future energy development Arctic Ocean Immortality Abrahamic religion Eschatology 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Hurricane Wilma Supply and demand Origin belief Air traffic control Hubbert peak theory Plate tectonics Enceladus (moon) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity
