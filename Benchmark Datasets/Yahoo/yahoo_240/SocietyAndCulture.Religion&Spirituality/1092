non christians when you ask a religious question and someone answers with scripture do you automatically close your mind to their answer it seems a circular argument to me the christian bible is not something i respect as the truth so how can quoting scripture to me from it help me to see your points am i dealing with zealots most of the time or lack of maturity or both i don't want to change anyones mind and i don't believe in arguing about someones faith it's a losing argument i'm referring to general religious questions did i say anything in my original question other than a religious question i didn't say anything about questioning their faith i really wish people would read the question sigh quite honestly i think you're dealing with people who firmly believe that what they think should be what you think which is wrong often i think that is either due to zealousy is that a word or a lack of maturity certainly i am a christian but i really don't think that quoting something i believe in and you don't will make you see my point it's dumb it's like saying aerosmith is the best band on earth and playing some of their music you've heard it already and don't think so you won't listen to what i have to say whereas if i made a rational argument you might besides i see quoting scripture to someone who doesn't believe in god as highly arrogant the bible is wordy and confusing and i think often people use it simply to try to make a non believer feel stupid why would you do that seriously it's not converting anyone and for the record i don't think the bible is the absolute truth it was written by man and man is not infallible Religion Biblical inerrancy New Testament Fundamentalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Presuppositional apologetics God Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Sabbath Existence of God Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Evolutionary creationism Philosophical skepticism Religious Society of Friends Bible Ten Commandments Trinity Theodicy Young Earth creationism Roman Catholic Church Apologetics Infant baptism Discordianism Theory of conduct Slow Train Coming Creationism Alan Campbell (pastor) Resurrection of Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist Christianity Biblical canon Liberal Christianity Nation of Islam Evil Christianity and anti-Semitism Book of Isaiah Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Theology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Wesley Meaning of life Modern geocentrism Philosophy of language Charles Darwin's views on religion Soul Book of Mormon Homosexuality and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Repentance Prayer Epistemology Moses Apocrypha Faith John Wycliffe Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Judaism Nontrinitarianism Teach the Controversy Prophet Justification (theology) Great Apostasy Mary, the mother of Jesus David Hume Tetragrammaton Afterlife Criticism of Mormonism Answers in Genesis Jewish principles of faith Jewish philosophy Bah__'__ divisions Creation science Merit Sola scriptura Halakha Baptist Christian-Jewish reconciliation Dispensationalism Bah__'__ Faith and Science C.
