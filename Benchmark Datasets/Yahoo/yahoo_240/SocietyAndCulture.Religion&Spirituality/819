is my friend in jewish hell an accuaintance of mine who was jewish by both his parents commited suicide is he now in hell according to judaism about him he never killed anyone except for himself but he wasn't necessarily a good person although he didn't like to hurt small animals or children or anything like that his negative traits were that he was very hateful jealous conniving etc so is he now in hell according to judaism if yes is he there for all eternity or what exactly p s concerning the noahide laws he was an atheist he was a thief he was sexually promiscuous he was very blasphemous there is no hell in judaism so no he is not in hell to correct a few mosconecptions i see from some of the jewish posters up until around years ago the general view was that suicde was akin to murder and carried the penalty of kares excission at the hands of the heavenly court meaning that even though such a person would enter the world to come at the end of the year of gehinnom essentially purifying the soul they would never be able to approach close to the essence of god and would thus remain only on the fringes however with the increased understanding of the neurological issues which can lead to depression and suicide as well as the psychological issues which lead to suicide harav moshe feinstein zts l published a teshuvah which is universally accepted that suicide is from mental illness or physical disease and the person is not guilty of murder thus suicide while not allowed is not seen as murder and does not have a punishment kares this is why suicides are no longer buried in a seperate section or with their graves at an angle but in the mormal fashion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sin Ten Commandments Halakha Noahide Laws Immortality Jewish eschatology 613 mitzvot Abrahamic religion Murder Judaism Jewish principles of faith Soul Divorce Religious views of suicide Abortion debate Capital punishment Hell Original sin Anti-Semitism Homosexuality and Judaism Guide for the Perplexed Eastern Orthodox Church Heaven Angel Maimonides Religion Jewish philosophy Kabbalah Free will Who is a Jew?
