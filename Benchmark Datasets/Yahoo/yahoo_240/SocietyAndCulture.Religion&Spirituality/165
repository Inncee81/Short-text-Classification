the band modest mouse are they atheist the song bukowski makes it seem like it i like them thx a link would be great lol thx much its not really them as much as it is their lead singer isaac brock and i wouldnt exactly call him atheist because in other songs he kind of states that he really doesnt know what to believe which would make him agnostic for example in doin the coakroach he starts off by saying i was in heaven i was in hell believe in niehter but fear them as well meaning although he doesnt think god is real if he is then he fears what will happen to him when he dies thats kind of my interpretation on it but overall i would call him more agnostic than atheist if you get into all of modest mouse's stuff youll know what i mean Agnosticism Atheism Supernatural Modest Mouse Religion Nontheism God Atomic Kitten Strong atheism Charles Bukowski Existence of God The nature of God in Western theology Rich Mullins Alcoholics Anonymous Freethought Evolutionary creationism Sin Christianity Freemasonry Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eraserhead Charles Darwin's views on religion Pascal's Wager Emanuel Swedenborg Gothic metal Sad Sappy Sucker Douglas Adams Isaac Brock (musician) Deity Apostasy The Cure Deism Isaac Brock Nine Inch Nails Epicureanism 10cc Judas Iscariot Bradley Nowell The Isley Brothers Transcendental argument for the existence of God A Course In Miracles Blue __yster Cult Year of the Spider Judaism Immortality KISS (band) Belinda Carlisle Timeline of heavy metal Young Earth creationism Persecution of atheists American Pie (song) Historical persecution by Christians Single certification Apatheism Samaritan Ignosticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Bertrand Russell Christian eschatology Religion in Canada Ten Commandments Argument from morality Theodicy Separation of church and state Weak agnosticism Friedrich Nietzsche Alice in Chains Alan Campbell (pastor) Hell The Pilgrim's Progress Bill Maher Messianic Judaism Third Great Awakening Angel Reincarnation Remix Booker T. & the M.G.'s Unitarian Universalism Meaning of life Simone Weil Satan Pok__mon Live!
