if i have love does that mean i will tolerate evil or reprove it i see many could be christians angry at those who tell them their living in sin then they say things like the bible says your supposed to love me are we supposed to tolerate evil before we can say that we have the love of christ in us bookish thank you for the spelling lesson and your lesson on love where did you go bookish if you truely love someone then you will reprove them however we must be careful of our approach to each situation and must seek for god's guidance the biblie staes in galatians that brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted the better we know our own hearts and ways the less shall we despise others and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions how light soever men's sins seem to them when committed yet they will be found a heavy burden when they come to reckon with god about them no man can pay a ransom for his brother and sin is a burden to the soul it is a spiritual burden and the less a man feels it to be such the more cause has he to suspect himself most men are dead in their sins and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin feeling the weight and burden of our sins we must seek to be eased thereof by the saviour and be warned against every sin ga here is what the bible says about correction proverbs for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth psalm when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity selah proverbs correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul jeremiah o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing job behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty god bless you Sola fide Original sin John the Baptist Virgin Mary in Islam Gospel of Barnabas Dispensationalism Aramaic of Jesus Repentance Hidden Words Merit Contrition The Pilgrim's Progress Soul Fallen angel Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God Sabbath Anointing Didache Jewish ethics Psychopannychism Reincarnation Alan Campbell (pastor) Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Christian views of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eastern Orthodox Church King James Version of the Bible Demon Tridentine Mass Divine grace Requiem Bhagavad Gita Matthew 4 Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Book of Job Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Idolatry Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Simone Weil The Dunciad Grimke Sisters Articles of Religion (Methodist) Immortality Eternal Father, Strong to Save Mary, the mother of Jesus Israel ben Eliezer Baptism Mortification of the flesh Jewish views of religious pluralism Satan Ezekiel A Course In Miracles Apocalyptic literature Theodicy Angel Priesthood (Mormonism) John Howard Yoder Thou George Fox Urantia Immanuel Summa Theologiae Christianity Evil Jerusalem Abgarus of Edessa Religion Prayer in Christianity Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Justification (theology) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Michael (archangel) Blacks and Mormonism Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand David and Jonathan Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prevenient grace Catechism Death (personification) John Wesley Duties of the Heart Church of Christ, Scientist Yehuda Halevi Kain (Legacy of Kain)
