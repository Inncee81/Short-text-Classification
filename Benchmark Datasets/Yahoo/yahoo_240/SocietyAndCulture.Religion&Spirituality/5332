is the fact that something created you a good reason to worship it don't get me wrong i don't for a second believe in god but i'm curious about the following hypothetical if god does exist and did create us and everything else is that sufficient reason to worship him suppose we were able to create a simulated universe inside a computer program that contained laws of physics constants life etc would the beings in that universe be obliged to worship us especially if we demanded it on what moral ground would they be obliged because your parents made you does not mean you have to worship them you should respect them but not always and you definitely do no worship them so is creation enough of a grounds for worship if in the future we started a less advanced civilization on another planet or in another universe do we then have the moral authority to demand its faith and worship or should humility win out good question i personally always wondered why everyone seemed so sure that a creator would love his creation that seems to be the general consensus among the theists and i never really saw a lot of evidence of that Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Theodicy Origin belief Problem of evil Atheism Ten Commandments Supernatural Existence of God Duties of the Heart Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intelligent design Trinity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theism Jewish principles of faith Abortion debate Trimurti Religion Merit Theistic realism Free will Immanuel Kant Urantia Determinism Simone Weil Sabbath Eastern Orthodox Church Falsifiability Time travel Meaning of life Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Jewish views of religious pluralism Categorical imperative Charles Grandison Finney Separation of church and state Ethics Satanism Two Treatises of Government Reincarnation Atomism Human nature Philosophy of religion Scientology beliefs and practices Moral objectivism Contract Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Evil Social justice Creationism Creation science Peter Singer Human Saint Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Judaism Extraterrestrial life Philosophy Teleological argument Idolatry Entropy Sacrifice Deity Divine grace Ontological argument Monotheism European Convention on Human Rights Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Roman Catholic Church Pledge of Allegiance Public domain Religious pluralism Cosmology Creation-evolution controversy Fermi paradox Problem of Hell Creator God Cosmological argument Zoroastrianism Confucianism Consciousness God and gender Multiverse Opus Dei Spiritism Property (ownership right) Genesis Thomas Carlyle Evolutionary creationism David Hume Friedrich Schleiermacher Copyright
