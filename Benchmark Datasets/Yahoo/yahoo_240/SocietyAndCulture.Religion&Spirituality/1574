question for christians when you die what age is your mind or soul in heaven cause plenty of babies die at birth are all souls a certain age in heaven or hell also do you have a body personally i have not yet been to heaven so i can't really answer but here is my guess what is your age i think it depends some people die young some people don't die until they are or so years old their brains are foggy they don't remember stuff anymore but you don't have all those problems up in heaven so even if you died at years old once you are free of your deteriorating body you might feel again babies that is a tricky one there are a lot of babies that have died before birth or shortly after since god has a plan i am sure the plan he has for those babies have more to do with influence on the parents of the babies than the babies themselves i think maybe god sends those babies back to earth to be born for someone else and for the parents that have lost the babies when they get up to heaven to finally meet the baby they lost so long ago they won't be sad about their babies having a second chance they will rejoice about it and know that they will be reunited soon enough since a lifetime is probably a blink of an eye in heaven Reincarnation Jon Secada Soul Immortality Heaven The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Sant Thakar Singh Rich Mullins Kyle Broflovski Simone Weil Time Out of Mind EastEnders Angel Sanctuary Bible and reincarnation Human Afterlife Apostles' Creed A Course In Miracles Cliff Richard God Mary, the mother of Jesus Problem of Hell Emanuel Swedenborg Dualism (philosophy of mind) Qiyamah Ten Commandments Free will Rapture Justification (theology) Eastern Orthodox Church Love Saint Religion Social rule Rei Ayanami Merit Game show Death Sharon Tate Book of Mormon Pitaten Resurrection of Jesus Ayya Vaikundar Hinduism The Death Gate Cycle Theory of conduct Ragnarok Timeline of alternative rock Phoebe Buffay's songs Adoption Zohar Theodicy Original sin Jewish eschatology Meaning of life Origin belief Joke Church of Christ, Scientist Best Friends Forever Hades Angel Catechism Knots Landing Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Jack (comic) Breastfeeding Fallen angel Romulus and Remus John the Baptist Yoko Ono Shen Gong Wu Memnoch the Devil Nation of Islam Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Oh My Goddess!
