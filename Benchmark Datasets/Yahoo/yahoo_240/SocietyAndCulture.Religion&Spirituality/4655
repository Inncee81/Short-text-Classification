how can evolutionist explain this it's a scientific fact that the moon moves th of an inch away from the earth every year if you go back just million years we would have tidal waves so big the would wipe out the land masses every day if you go back just million years the moon would be touching the earth so what would happen billion years that you claim where was the moon then how could the earth survive this don't say the moon started moving much later the moon is moving now and there is no evedence that it started later science is based on fact and the only facts we have on this is the movment that is happening right now footprints ken hamms writings you should read any of his books he's a scientist and you wouldn't believe how many facts contemporary science books hide from you not all scientist believe the theory of evolution sergent read a science book the moon is moving calling me a silly name how old are you claim that it is not moving say that its rate of movement is different argue about the age of the earth argue that your facts are wrong and sight other so called facts name calling and changing the subject are also possibilities good points that science books are biased heck all textbooks are and so are all books humans tend to be biased even when they try not to be it is part of being human why do not people learn to think critically and independently and question things instead of just believing everyone that comes along everyone who has a phd and acts like they know what they are talking about sorry i cannot be a bigger help i am not an evolutionist i prefer creationism it is a much better story even if it is inaccurate i would have just left a comment but then i would have to wait until you pick a best answer hopefully a serious evolutionist will give you a well thought out answer and cite their evidence Creation-evolution controversy Young Earth creationism Creationism Modern geocentrism Supernatural Intelligent design movement Intelligent design Religion Creation science Evolution Answers in Genesis Teach the Controversy Fermi paradox Moon Earth Flood geology Human Science History of creationism Theodicy William A.
