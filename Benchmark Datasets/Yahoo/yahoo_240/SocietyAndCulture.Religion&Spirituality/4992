what can i expect for 'voting in' a new pastor our church i've always been to non denominational churches or small little 'home churches' i now go to an assemblies of god church the pastor is leaving to become a board member of the ag group in mo we are going to be 'voting' in a new pastor what can i expect to happen thank you is this like an interview of sorts sorta kinda i am not familiar with the terminology used within your church but if you have deacons or elders or a church appointed committee they will be in charge of putting out a pastor call usually this is done through the association of your denomination when potential pastors respond they will be interviewed by your church representatives they will then bring the approved candidates to the church this almost always involves a sermon perhaps a luncheon and a chance for the members to talk with the pastor this same opportunity will be given to each candidate a church business meeting will be called and members will cast a vote for their preferred pastor one or two candidates may be called back for a second sermon it can be a stressful time for the church so you already know to be in prayer and takes notes on each pastor and the answers he gives to the congregation consider how he responds to you other members and the youth and children of the church this is vitally important to your church and as a member i urge you to participate at each opportunity Baptist Holy Orders Clergy Church of Christ Roman Catholic Church United Methodist Church Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Congregationalist church governance Uniting Church in Australia Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Worldwide Church of God Deacon Presbyterian church governance Bishop Church of the United Brethren in Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Methodism Minister of religion Calvary Chapel Church of Scotland Southern Baptist Convention Iglesia ni Cristo Jonathan Edwards (theologian) Second Vatican Council Seventh-day Adventist Church Presbyterian Church in Canada Plymouth Brethren Charles Taze Russell Speaker of the British House of Commons Pentecostalism Succession crisis (Mormonism) John Wesley Ordination of women Eucharist Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 John Calvin Jan Hus Community of Christ World Council of Churches Church of God of Prophecy Unitarian Universalism Presbyterianism Calvinism Two by Two Baptism Christian right Megachurch Yoido Full Gospel Church Great Apostasy Martin Luther Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Messianic Judaism Single Transferable Vote Charismatic Metropolitan Community Church Edgewater Presbyterian Church Pastoral Epistles Alan Campbell (pastor) Instant-runoff voting Catechism History of the Latter Day Saint movement David Yonggi Cho Temple (Mormonism) Fred Phelps Reformed Baptist Supreme Court of the United States Opus Dei Pope Papal conclave, 2005 William M.
