serious question for a change how is a person suppose to react when they find out a loved one has cancer before someone starts to worry or look for a punch line my sister had colon cancer fortunately it was easily handled with minor surgery and now shows to be completely clear i saw the original scope images and never even considered anything worse than that ok then when she told me all i could think was possible medical and surgical scenarios i know that what i told her including descriptions of the most common procedures calmed her by taking the fear of the unknown away however i felt no more emotional attachment than i did for the patients i worked on in surgery in the past now that i know that she's doing well it is really bothering me that i stayed so calm even when alone i feel like the normal response would be to get upset angry something any thoughts staying calm is what you have been trained to do and it served you well and probably her too are you feeling relief now that it's over that is the indicater that you care about her having the people around me freak out made me not want to tell them i had cancer my wonderful husband was a mess my friend who had nagged me to get the checkup even though i didn't feel sick was calm and sweet and funny through it all afterwards he told me he was terrified and felt guilty that i'd had the cancer even though he didn't put it there and actually saved my life by nagging me i'm now years out and do get my annual checkups i'm grateful to be alive Prostate cancer Transsexuality Pitaten Medicine Milton H.
