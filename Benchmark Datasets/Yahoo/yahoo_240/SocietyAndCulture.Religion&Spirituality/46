part of our anaysis leads us here can you share your thoughts on this correction salam i just find it hard to understand sometimes how they can hate us and now i see why we have rev albert enstine here and ankaboot as we see the dialog unfold please give your thoughts inshallah salam and thank you very much oh kind people of the earth rev if they reject your judgement know that it is allah's wish to scourge them for their sins sura ankaboot waanzalna ilayka alkitaba bialhaqqi musaddiqan lima bayna yadayhi mina alkitabi wamuhayminan aaalayhi faohkum baynahum bima anzala allahu wala tattabiaa ahwaahum aaamma jaaka mina alhaqqi likullin jaaaalna minkum shiraaatan waminhajan walaw shaa allahu lajaaaalakum ommatan wahidatan walakin liyabluwakum feema atakum faistabiqoo alkhayrati ila allahi marjiaaukum jameeaaan fayunabbi okum bima kuntum feehi takhtalifoona to you o mohammed we have revealed a scripture with the truth confirming all the preceding scriptures and appointed you its guardian so judge between them by that which allah has revealed and follow not their whims at the expense of the truth that has come to you for each one of you we have assigned a spiritual code and a righteous path if allah had willed he would have brought you all under one fold but it is a matter of divine providence that you should be tested by means of that which you have are awarded so race with each other in the performance of righteous deeds it is to allah that all must return in the end and he will explicate to you everything over which you used to differ waani ohkum baynahum bima anzala allahu wala tattabiaa ahwaahum waihtharhum an yaftinooka aaan baaadi ma anzala allahu ilayka fa in tawallaw faiaalam annama yureedu allahu an yuseebahum bibaaadi thunoobihim wa inna katheeran mina alnnasi lafasiqoona so judge between them only by that which allah has revealed to you and follow not their desires lest they trick you into erring in some part of that which allah has revealed to you and if they persist in turning their faces away it is a clear sign that allah is determined to punish them for their sins verily many among mankind are iniquitous in the above verses the spot light is on the qur'aan with a clear confirmation that it is a divine revelation containing guidance and light for mankind firmly admonishing the prophet to be its guardian to judge between people by that which allah has revealed in it to beware of those who might try to tempt him into overlooking a part of it for their own benefit and to bear in mind that those who turn away from allah's revelations do so to their own detriment verse expounds that although the rudiments of faith the criteria of right and wrong the collation of crime and punishment the susceptibility of the soul to capitulate and the ability of the self to emancipate it have remained the same since the times of adam the ground rules for bringing about a balance between good and evil through divine guidance have changed from generation to generation depending upon and dictated by the changes resulting from the passage of time for instance there is no denying the fact that during the early stages of man's habitation on earth the need for proliferation being the topmost priority the rules governing the process of procreation could not have been the same as they are now or they were during the times of abraham and noah this is why it is emphasized in this verse that allah has assigned for each of us a different spiritual code given us clear guidance on how to practice it and ensured that we are tested only on the strength of what has been awarded to us the spiritual code for the children of adam was different from the spiritual code for the children of israel and the spiritual code for the children of israel was different from the spiritual code for the children of ishmael context of revelation the following verse was revealed regarding a disagreement between two neighbouring factions of jews over the amount of ransom payable for murders committed as a result of their mutual feuds when the dispute was brought to the prophet for arbitration and he ruled that both sides were liable to pay the same amount according to the torah and according to the qur'aan those bent on demanding a higher ransom rejected his ruling next lol what a bore that first poster is that was no fun to prove wrong hahaha ya allah you gave us everything al hamdoullah rub alameen ameen hey rev i think maybe you forgot about words don't you hahaha astugfarallah azeem katheeran alal jahanam hayda
