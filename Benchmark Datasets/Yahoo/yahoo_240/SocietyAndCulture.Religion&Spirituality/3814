ressurection facts im a cynic and skeptic but even the most jaded of us has to consider somethings such as the roman guards are described as being bribed by jewish authorities to say the body was stolen what for bribery was a death penalty offense in the roman empire as was for guards sleeping on duty wouldn't they guards have been killed for saying they took a bribe the angels put the guards to sleep sleeping on guard duty also got you killed would the jewish authorities even have had the power to pay off roman guards the testimony of women wasn't worth crap in court suspicously convienient as it takes pressure off the men if the ressurection happened why are the gospels so conflicting could joseph of aramathea have bribed the guards since he was rich taken the body and not told anyone which could account for the belief of the apostles that never broke during roman torture and execution he was also a member of the jewish athurities himself wasn't he do we smell suspect here i want to hear arguments either way since breaking a roman seal was a death penalty offense were talking serious briberty which again brings us to the rich and influential joeseph wasn't he jesius godfather also could the women have agree to take the blame for the guys then had sex with the guards while the disciples moved the stone are there any accounts of an official roman investigation into the missing body as for the first two that's what makes the resurrection the most palatable of any other explanation with the third yes i believe they would have the romans and the jewish authorities just wanted to keep the peace with the fourth it is rather strange that the gospels would mention that it was women who found the empty tomb if they wanted to make it more convincing and it was all made up they would have used men wouldn't they where do the gospels conflict each other i've heard many so called examples heard them even when i wasn't a christian and when i read them myself i found that each of the gospels actually complement the others as for the sixth joseph of arimathea was not a believer why would he have stolen the body also keep in mind that he went and preached the gospel as well at least according to tradition and legend besides how could one man have moved the stone do you realize how much that thing would have weighed how much noise it would have made if someone had moved it how could he have moved the stone without waking the guards and why weren't the guards put to death edit as for the person who insists that the jesus myth was based off of mithra buddha krishna horus et cetera maybe they should go back and read some mythology put away zeitgeist put away the golden bough and put away sixteen dying and rising gods i've studied mythology since i was in elementary school and jesus is the only historical person to have the story that he has Joseph of Arimathea Jesus Gospel of Mark Gospel of John Historical Jesus Book of Mormon Gospel of Thomas Resurrection Gospel of Peter New Testament view on Jesus' life Paul of Tarsus Ten Commandments Baptism Historicity of Jesus Mary Magdalene New Testament Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Apostle Capital punishment Soul Sabbath Mary, the mother of Jesus Origin belief Cultural and historical background of Jesus Holy Spirit Acts of the Apostles History of Christianity Angel Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Saint Peter Chronology of Jesus Knots Landing John the Baptist Biblical canon Thomas (Apostle) Barabbas The Passion of the Christ Religion Joseph Smith, Jr. Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Catechism Pontius Pilate Sin City Trinity Forty-seven Ronin Genesis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theodicy Christianity and anti-Semitism Judas Iscariot Saint James the Just Secret Gospel of Mark Persecution of Christians Wang Mang A Course In Miracles Roman Catholic Church Life-death-rebirth deity Bible and reincarnation Gospel Yeshu Heresy Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Book of Daniel Christ Christian views of Jesus Religious conversion Biblical inerrancy Mormonism and Christianity Dispensationalism Pharisees Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eastern Orthodox Church Horus Noahide Laws History of the Latter Day Saint movement Religious pluralism Church of Christ Priesthood (Mormonism) History of the English Bible The Da Vinci Code Christianity Prophet Crucifixion Apologetics Christian eschatology Plame affair Opus Dei Book of Isaiah Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Roswell UFO incident
