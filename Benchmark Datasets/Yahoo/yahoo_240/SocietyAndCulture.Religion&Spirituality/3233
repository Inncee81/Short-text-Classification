witnessing about god to non christians i am a christian and i was talking to my friend at work about god and being a christian the other day as he was pretty interested in various denominations and my views on things he kept saying the bible jesus were invented to control people as a christian what do you say in answer to that i beleive that the bible is true and was compiled by many people and would be a huge fabrication to big to conceal if it were not true all i could say is that i have a personal relationship with god dont feel that it is a fabrication to control people is there a better answer to this a few people have said it to me now i dont really have an answer helpful answers only please thanks i am not a nightmare he asked and is actually a very good friend i merely answered his questions if you could answer mine rather than drawing assumptions about me then that would be great if christianity were intended to control people it did a really poor job for its followers in the early years i'm referring to the roman persecutions clearly christianity was not designed to control a group of mostly poor people who often had to go into hiding to avoid imprisonment torture and execution this is not the type of group of people that a power mad person desires to control a good example was paul who went from congregation to congregation but left others in charge others who often ran things contrary to the way he believed should be done paul presented himself as an authoritative teacher but eschewed leadership as can be seen with the apollos paul controversy he addressed in co there is no doubt that there are christian leaders throughout history who used christianity to further their own purposes power or wealth however this certainly does not seem to be the case for paul and his contemporaries conclusion although christianity has been used to further people's personal agenda it did not arise with that purpose in mind and certainly not all christian leaders use their religion for personal gain jim http www jimpettis com wheel Christianity Book of Mormon Religious Society of Friends Baptist Roman Catholic Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief New Testament Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Homosexuality and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Opus Dei Religion End times John Wycliffe Prophet Trinity Church of Christ, Scientist Messianic Judaism Christian Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eastern Orthodox Church Prayer Great Apostasy Christian denomination Ten Commandments Criticism of Mormonism Apologetics Historicity of Jesus Church of Christ Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses History of Christianity Bible and reincarnation Jesus Paul of Tarsus Restorationism Sabbath Authorship of the Pauline epistles Theodicy Fundamentalism Religious conversion Evangelicalism Minister of religion Existence of God Intelligent design movement Rastafari movement Biblical canon Blacks and Mormonism Biblical inerrancy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theology Binitarianism Judaism Book of Revelation History of the English Bible History of the Latter Day Saint movement Angel Sin Methodism Pentecostalism Socrates Baptism Meaning of life Persecution of Christians Supernatural Mormonism and Christianity Christian anarchism Nontrinitarianism John Howard Yoder Chosen people Charismatic Religious pluralism Bible Soul Jews as a chosen people Nation of Islam Intelligent design Teach the Controversy Plame affair Justification (theology) Christian views of women Acts of the Apostles Charles Darwin's views on religion Phillip E.
