confused about religion is jesus god the same person and when praying do you pray to god in the name of jesus or just bypass god go straight to jesus can you pray to god without mentioning jesus or pray to jesus without mentioning god how does it work there are always three entities the father god the son jesus and the holy spirit we were given the option of praying directly to god we sometimes pray to jesus because he is our lord and saviour but in no event should we attempt to bypass god since he is in charge he is the one who created the entire universe he sent his only begotten son to die on a cross to save our souls i think that most people use god and jesus christ interchangably but it doesnt matter since the bible said that jesus is sitting on the right hand of god i know i start of praying 'heavenly father ' and end 'in the name of jesus christ our lord and saviour' i dont think it matter which one you pray to as long as you are not praying to someone something else hoping that they it will make intercession on your behalf take care hugs Holy Spirit Salvation Sola fide Trinity Athanasian Creed Jesus Religious perspectives on Jesus God the Father Eastern Orthodox Church Christ Christian eschatology Mary, the mother of Jesus Baptism Adam-God theory Roman Catholic Church Book of Mormon Soul Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian views of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Angel Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Prayer in Christianity Resurrection of Jesus Binitarianism Saint Mormonism and Christianity God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Justification (theology) God and gender Sabbath Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Mass (liturgy) Names and titles of Jesus John Howard Yoder Catholicism Nontrinitarianism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abrahamic religion John the Baptist Mormonism Horus Urantia Predestination Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Church of Christ Catechism A Course In Miracles Saint James the Just Charles Grandison Finney Filioque clause Christianity Intercession of saints Summa Theologiae Incarnation Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gospel of Thomas The Pilgrim's Progress Eucharist Dispensationalism Gloria in Excelsis Blessed Virgin Mary Matthew 1 Sacrifice Articles of Religion (Methodist) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Merit Theology Church of Christ, Scientist Nicene Creed Tridentine Mass Virgin Mary in Islam Sin Opus Dei Abraham Mortification of the flesh Religion Antichrist Son of God Paul of Tarsus Infant baptism Holy water Jehovah's Witnesses Oneness Pentecostal Gospel of Barnabas Godhead (Mormonism) Heaven Pharisees William M.
