something freaky happened i don't know if this is in the right category but so i was watching tv in the basement just now and i thought i heard my cell phone vibrating but i looked everywhere for it but i didn't find it so i ignored it then two minutes later i went up to the rd floor to get a book and i found my phone and there was a missed call at the time that i was looking for my phone the thing is i turned my tv really loud and my phone was only on vibrate so how could i hear it when i was two floors away from my phone and i don't think my hearing is that great because i always have to ask my friends to repeat what they're saying 'cuz i can't hear them properly could have been a coincidence or it could be that something carried the sound maybe it was near a air vent or something Shaggy dog story The Basement Tapes Jon Secada Trapped in the Closet United Airlines Flight 93 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Time Out of Mind Microphone Prank flash The Shining (film) Hearing impairment Ear Sound Social rule 7 July 2005 London bombings James Hanratty Musical acoustics Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Oplan Bojinka The Emancipation of Mimi A Day in the Life Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Good Times A Hard Day's Night (song) Rose (Doctor Who) It's All Gone Pete Tong The Ashlee Simpson Show Procrastination September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Columbine High School massacre John F.
