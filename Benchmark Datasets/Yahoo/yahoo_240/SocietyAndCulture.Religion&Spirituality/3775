could hillary clinton become the whore of babylon as warned about in the book of revelation first let us look at how the ancient city of babylon originated babylon is the cite of the tower of babel as documented in the book of genesis and is later mentioned by nebuchadnezzar in his borsippainscription wherein he states that he built and finished at babylon e sag ila temple of heaven and earth the dwelling of the god of gods marduk and likewise the story tower please see http www jewishencyclopedia com view jsp artid letter b search tower of babel for more information second let us examine what happened during the tower of babel incident man still spoke one language during that time and committed themselves to building a tower to heaven to prove that man was greater than god when god saw this he waited for them to desist from their sin and when they did not he made it so that each man spoke a different language and could no longer understand each other to be able to complete their blasphemy now what has been happening here in the u s for the last century or so we have become a nation welcoming peoples of all races creeds colors and ethnicity a very christian thing to do and an admirable and commendable undertaking to be sure what though have the people we have welcomed done with their new found freedom why we have built skyscrapers reaching to the heavens just like the builders of the tower of babel this nation has become a melting pot that is allowing many nations who never spoke the same language since the tower of babel to assemble in one place learn the same language english and in so doing has unwittingly brought into being a people who are more and more glorifying themselves and turning their faces away from god rather than thanking him for the many blessings he has given us it used to be that the church or synagogue was by law the highest building in the town as a reminder that it is god that rules over all now it is the skyscrapers that dominate the skyline glorifying the works of man and not the glory of god we have become ancient babylon third let us examine hilary clintons husbands administration and a couple of bill clinton s policies that if implemented today would greatly endanger the safety of this country during the clinton administration president clinton as every democrat in the white house has done except president roosevelt during world war ii cut our military to the bone this is why we were unable to secure the borders in iraq during the early days of the gulf war due to an insufficient number of troops on the ground able to contain the insurgency before it even became the insurgency had we sufficient troop strength equipment weapons and supplies we would probably already be out of iraq and afghanistan i know i know many will argue that president bush should never have gone in until the military was sufficiently built up again and that is a very valid point but it does not negate president bill clintons responsibility in weakening our country there are also those who will argue that we should not be in iraq or even afghanistan at all and to those i answer that you have obviously forgotten how this country inadvertently helped to create the monsters that saddam hussein and osama bin laden became after iran took americans hostage during the iran hostage crisis who did we support during the iran iraq war iraq of course and as a direct result of the financial help military training and weapons supplied to iraq by the u s that helped saddam hussein gain the power to become the megalomaniac he was again during the russia afghanistan war who did we support afghanistan and the muhajadine of course what many people don t know is that osama bin laden was not only a leader of the old muhajadine but also an employee of the c i a once again as a direct result of the financial help military training and weapons supplied to afghanistan by the u s the taliban was formed came into power killed their own people trained the people who flew the planes into the world trade center on and became the monsters they are are we responsible for what people with free will choose to do with the time training and assistance we invest in them to help them become a stronger people no however it is our moral ethical and quite possibly our legal responsibility to clean up the mess we helped to create and take out the trash hence why we are currently at war with al qaeda and the taliban and not with iraq and afghanistan forgive me i digressed there for a moment president clintons other policy was to sell secrets and indeed a good bit of this countries financial well being to china what will happen to our economy should china call in those markers the stock market s volatile activity of the last few days will be as nothing compared to that now despite whatever claims hillary clinton may make during her campaign most politicians will say what the people want to hear when running for public office after all there is absolutely no reason to believe she will not impliment the same policies as her husband did if hillary clinton is elected to be president of the united states and cuts back our military she will be inviting every terrorist group to invade and destroy our country with how badly the entire gulf war has gone and with how many civilians the terrorists have killed without our troops being able to keep them in check we have offended the muslim world so much that terrorist groups are now gaining control of muslim countries like hammas did in lebanon if hillary clinton continues in her husbands shoes and continues to sell off controlling interest of our country to other nations the u s will become bankrupt read carefully revelations chapters and fourth let us examine the tattoo on the forehead of the whore of babylon it is the mark of the beast currently as i m sure everyone is aware micro chipping is available for your pets while i was serving in the military there was some discussion of micro chipping special operations troops including rangers special force and delta force soldiers also the world bank has been pressuring north and south america to convert to a one monetary currency called the amero as europe has converted to the euro once that occurs it is a very simple step to going to a cashless society with the national i d card being tied into your driving records voter history criminal records medical history prescriptions and bank accounts after that it only one more step to having that same information programmed into a microchip that is then implanted into your forehead or hand as mentioned in revelation my concern is that when hillary clinton becomes president then she will usher in this national health care plan she is touting which is the same socialized medicine that has failed in england europe and canada that has so many people waiting for life saving surgery coming to the u s before they die from waiting until their own socialized medicine can be bothered to get to them i am also concerned that she will also usher in the national i d card and proudly have the microchip implanted in her forehead please check with the notes in the harper collins study bible new revised standard version for their definition of the tattoo on the forehead in reference to revelation chapters and then i worry that in keeping with the pattern of other democratic presidents she will cut back our military which will weaken our country to the point of allowing other countries and terrorist groups to invade u s soil and bring about the destruction of the united states of america being a woman myself i have absolutely no qualms none whatsoever with a woman being president of the united states nor with the ability of a woman to lead this country what i am concerned about is this particular woman becoming president at this particular time incidentally wouldn t her administration end sometime late in the year so could senator hillary clinton become the whore of babylon god i pray the answer is no the whore of babylon is false religions babylon was the beginning of false religion that is where nimrod built the tower of babel nimrod made himself a god married his mother and they had a son together this was the beginning of the trinity teaching these false teachings were carried out of babel when god confused their languages and the people had to move on this false doctrines are still found in christendom today religions have sucked up to the governments scratching their backs as the governments scratched theirs religion has been guilty of killing the true prophets of god look at the spanish inquisitions and the puritan witch hunts as well as the many wars fought in the name of religion as revelation reveals the harlot has gotten drunk off the blood of the holy ones when she is killed the merchants cry over her death because they have made a lot of money off religion christmas easter halloween the cross people buy candles to put on the alter so the priests can pray for their dead loved ones ministers and priests beg for money from the congregations to support their lavish lifestyles the pope and other religious leaders get involved with politics telling the congregation who they should vote for and disregarding the command to stay separate from the world many churches have started accepting credit cards and debit cards from the members they ask members to donate a certain amount of money to the church trying to take advantage of the ancient practice of tithing which no longer is required god will do away with these false religions just as revelation says babylon the great will be exposed and all her disgusting deeds will come to the fore
