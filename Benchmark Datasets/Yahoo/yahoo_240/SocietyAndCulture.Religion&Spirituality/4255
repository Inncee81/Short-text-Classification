is there really a wrong way to pray i mean obviously we shouldn't be asking god to kill people and all that stuff that's not what i mean but is there really a certain way you think you're supposed to do it because i don't think there is and i never will believe that there is but i'd like to hear other people's opinions on that okay let me verify is there a certain way you have to talk to him i usually pray silently to myself or in my bedroom or alone but can't you just talk to him as you would a friend god is higher than me and i give him respect but i still talk as i would to a friend well if you only pray for the well being of yourself others and whatever else you want the point of praying is to give praise to god actually that's the whole point of life checkout islam Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rich Mullins Muslim ibn Aqeel The nature of God in Western theology Plame affair John the Baptist Religious Society of Friends Theodicy 2004 Democratic National Convention Ann Coulter Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Apostasy in Islam Islam and anti-Semitism John Howard Yoder Social rule Mass (liturgy) Friends Fahrenheit 9/11 Virgin Mary in Islam Laura Schlessinger Reaction to the assassination of John F.
