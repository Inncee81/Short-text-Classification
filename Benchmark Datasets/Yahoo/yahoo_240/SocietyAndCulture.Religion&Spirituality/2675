why are you all ignoring agnostics we have feelings too both believers and non believers often think that agnostics are sitting on the fence not knowing whether to believe or not indecisive dithering about well think again some of us agnostics are very passionate about our agnosticism we state very firmly that there is no way of knowing whether anything exists outside the physical universe and if something does then the nature of that something cannot be known the only truly logical answer to the question is there a god is there is no way of knowing i love being an agnostic for me being an agnostic is a wonderful exhilerating ride on the imagination anything could be out there and i love to explore what may be to an agnostic nothing is certain and anything but anything is possible it really sets the imagination free it also sets us free to explore the many different religions and to taste the experiences that can be had in each i have meditated with buddhists hindus and brahma kumaris groups sung in so called tongues with christians i have experienced what felt like the dissolving of self and of thought in the vastness of the universe in meditation i have experienced the power of prayer from the direction of many different spiritual paths i've pondered on the possibility that there is only the physical universe and that our known universe originated due to events in n dimensions where n i consider scientific methodology to be the best way of deducing what is most probably true in the limited domain of what we can measure but not what is certainly true i think that the theory of evolution is the most likely origin of life on this planet but i am open to other possibilities such as that we are broken off fragments of a universal consciousness this or the the idea that we all live in a virtual reality generated by a conscious super computer which exists in an ultimate reality beyond our comprehension are as possible to me as are the christian ideas or as is aetheism i love to ponder about these things i do so frequently for hours on end i love being an agnostic i would never want to be certain about the ultimate nature of reality being an agnostic is the most wonderful food for the imagination i have ever found because everything that i imagine about what may be may be real i call myself an agnostic explorer Religion God Atheism Supernatural Advaita Vedanta Ken Wilber The nature of God in Western theology Meaning of life Psychology of religion Buddhism Mantra Hinduism Human Soul Existence of God Reality Alcoholics Anonymous Immortality New Age Consciousness Prayer A Course In Miracles Determinism Francis Crick Simone Weil Gautama Buddha Reincarnation Hindu philosophy Mysticism S__ren Kierkegaard Meditation Sant Mat Scientific method Sri Aurobindo Charles Darwin's views on religion Anthroposophy Cyberspace Afterlife Friedrich Schleiermacher Gnosticism Immanuel Kant Creationism Urantia Philosophy Victor Cousin Scientology beliefs and practices Evolutionary creationism Yoga Theodicy Cosmology Brahman Science Philosophy of mathematics Fermi paradox Ontological argument Swami Vivekananda Christianity Theology A New Kind of Science Rudolf Steiner Carl Jung Bhakti Dharma Prayer in Christianity Evolutionism Neuro-linguistic programming Vipassana Unidentified flying object Deity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Deism Idolatry Mathematics Flood geology Vedanta Summa Theologiae Out-of-body experience Free will Existentialism Satanism Magic (paranormal) Sant Thakar Singh Predestination Ramanuja Bertrand Russell Moksha Infinity Eastern Orthodox Church
