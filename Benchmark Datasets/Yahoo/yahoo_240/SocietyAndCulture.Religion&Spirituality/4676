christians i really need your help on this meditation for church i can't think of anything right now i need to read a short meditation at church sunday and i do not know what to write the scripture is coming from gen and to sum it up it is talking about joseph was sold by his brothers and what his brothers meant for evil god turned it around and made something good from it will you pray allow the holy spirit to lead you and help me come up with some ideas please thank you this may help to expand on the foreshadowing of christ found in joseph it is comparatively easy to point out some of the traits of resemblance between jacob's beloved son and the dearly beloved son of god like jesus joseph was hated and cast out by his brethren and yet wrought out their salvation through the sufferings they had brought upon him like jesus joseph obtained his exaltation only after passing through the deepest and most undeserved humiliations and in the kingdom over which he ruled he invited his brethren to join those whom heretofore they had looked upon as strangers in order that they also might enjoy the blessings which he had stored up for them like the saviour of the world joseph had but words of forgiveness and blessing for all who recognizing their misery had recourse to his supreme power it was to joseph of old as to jesus that all had to appeal for relief offer homages of the deepest respect and yield ready obedience in all things finally to the patriarch joseph as to jesus it was given to inaugurate a new order of things for the greater power and glory of the monarch to whom he owed his exaltation may the meditation you write whether based on this or not be a blessing to those who hear it Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mary, the mother of Jesus Salvation Book of Mormon Christian eschatology Christianity Roman Catholic Church Summa Theologiae Priesthood (Mormonism) Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Amidah Trinity Eastern Orthodox Church Abrahamic religion Divine grace Catechism Ten Commandments John Howard Yoder Baptism John the Baptist Holy Spirit Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Abraham God Endowment (Mormonism) John Wycliffe Mass (liturgy) Angel Soul Sin Sabbath Salvation Army Catholicism Merit Church of Christ, Scientist Pope Christian views of Jesus Predestination Blessed Virgin Mary Eucharist Jesus Book of Isaiah Binitarianism Pope Benedict XVI Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mormonism and Christianity Mormonism Godhead (Mormonism) Athanasian Creed Papal Infallibility Christian anarchism Community of Christ Heaven Great Apostasy Coptic Christianity Joseph Smith, Jr. Messiah Charismatic Cultural and historical background of Jesus Adam-God theory Mormonism and Judaism Jehovah's Witnesses Martin Luther Charles Grandison Finney Paul of Tarsus Sacrifice Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Repentance Apocrypha Indulgence Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Pharisees Zohar Genesis Original sin John Wesley Anselm of Canterbury Aramaic of Jesus Theology Religion Celtic Christianity Apostolic Fathers Rule of St Benedict Philipp Melanchthon
