muslims what do you think of simple marriages would you be happy going to one or would you speak poorly about it read this post for more info and then reply what you think please http www sunniforum com forum showthread php t gitanafille i feel the same way lol nobody else answered this i guess the disagree lol butterfly that is often the case but changing a lot more and more you can check out that link too it talks about it i'm not a muslim but i like the idea of the simple marriage before deciding to get married to my muslim fiance in morocco i was planning a wedding and reception american style although not elaborate everything is so expensive that i was just getting depressed about having to trim so much i would like to have a walima but we can't afford much so we will be having a small intimate one i had even thought about renewing my vows in america so i could have a christian wedding but realized the ceremony i wrote did not mention either religion and was based on our love for each other and the completeness we feel in our union basically for both of us what is important is making our marriage legal not having an elaborate production one of the major differences between a walima and a reception in my opinion please correct me if i am wrong is that when enormous amounts of money are spent on a walima it is because of the number of people attending and it doesn't appear to me that anyone is trying to outdo someone else's walima whereas with receptions tons of money is spent in order to be the best i think all of this elaborate wedding stuff was started in great britain i know that in america weddings were also very simple Friends Theory of conduct Avenue Q EastEnders Marie Antoinette Eastern Orthodox Church Same-sex marriage Same-sex marriage in Canada Fiddler on the Roof Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Same-sex marriage in the United States The nature of God in Western theology Christianity PHP Microeconomics Little Britain Mail-order bride Miss Saigon Human sexual behavior Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Sexual orientation The Best Page in the Universe Social rule Haven (TNG episode) Francis Crick CPU cache Ten Commandments Culture of the United States Great Apostasy Women in Islam U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Polygamy Wedding Fundamentalism Islam Nikah Mut'ah Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Rich Mullins Religious Society of Friends Bernard Williams Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Neopets Sharia Roman Catholic Church Separation of church and state Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Good Times Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 God Wedding ring Internet forum Same-sex marriage in New York White wedding Ramakrishna Laura Schlessinger Domain Name System Piccolo Junior Saga Homosexuality Religious conversion Anne Boleyn The Wedding Present Freedom of speech Jewish view of marriage Hey Jude Knots Landing Sharon Tate Jizya Charles Darwin's views on religion Anne Rice Shinto The Apprentice 2 Le Malade imaginaire Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Charmed Negima Bertrand Russell Spain Patriotism Pitaten Alan Watts Extreme Programming Taoism Juliana of the Netherlands Alcoholics Anonymous Infant baptism Utilitarianism Reality Public domain Bosniaks God Emperor of Dune Eid ul-Fitr Discordianism Muhammad Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible S__ren Kierkegaard
