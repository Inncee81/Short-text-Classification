what is belief not what you believe but the the process as you see it in yourself and others without regard to any single object or subject for example is it possible to reach a decision of any kind without going through a belief process here is one working definition any other ideas belief is simply any idea or concept a person is willing to consider acting upon a postulate agree disagree terry your answer does not address the question to others note that i made no mention of faith although i know some cannot separate the two duck phup lots of good observations but where is a summary definition of the term one that can wrap our minds around the mess you see okay the word you are asking about is 'belief' but there is another word that needs to be considered first faith the phrase 'take the leap of faith' can be illustrated easily you are standing at the edge of the grand canyon and you must 'get to the other side' without 'climbing down and back up' and without any 'bridge' so how do you 'get across ' close your eyes and take one small step forward open your eyes and you are 'miraculously' on the other side of the grand canyon but when you 'turn around to look' at the canyon you see that there is no 'canyon' there all you can 'see' is a small line drawn in the sand okay i have that type of faith and there have been many times in my life when faced with the grand canyon i closed my eyes took one small step and turned to see that 'line in the sand ' i now 'believe' that is not a 'true miracle' but is the work of god i do believe in 'reality' but i believe that what we 'see as reality' is merely 'our view' and i also believe that the 'reality' from god's side may be a totally different view i 'believe' which is not an 'idea or concept i'm will to consider acting on' i believe because i continually get 'solid information' that there is 'more to this world' than just what i can 'see with my own eyes' i've taken that 'leap of faith' too many times not to 'believe' that god is 'watching over us' and 'helping us along the way' and for god's own reasons those of us who 'have this faith who continually take that leap of faith' are more 'able' to 'start to understand god and what is in the world to come as c s lewis stated in the chronicles of narnia further up and further in so my 'belief' in god is not based on 'concept' but on 'experience' and you may make your own 'choice' to 'believe' when i 'report my experience' to you or not to believe perhaps you are 'ahead' or perhaps you are 'behind' i don't 'know' that because i can't 'see' everything but one thing i do know i'll see you in heaven someday The nature of God in Western theology Reality A Course In Miracles God Fundamentalism Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Atheism Scientific method Scientology beliefs and practices Evil Existence of God Summa Theologiae Goodness and value theory Monotheism Determinism Predestination Religion Miracle Immanuel Kant Justification (theology) Creationism Intelligent design Ten Commandments Free will Objectivist philosophy Ontological argument Church of Christ Economics Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Socrates Trinity Moral objectivism Baptism The Chronicles of Narnia Liberal Christianity Religious Society of Friends Philosophy of religion Eucharist Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Simone Weil Mary, the mother of Jesus Salvation Discordianism Many-worlds interpretation Jewish principles of faith Faith and rationality Holy Spirit Special relativity Christian eschatology Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Philosophy of language Teleological argument Origin belief John Wycliffe Critique of Pure Reason Animism Separation of church and state in the United States Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Divine grace Urantia Causality Evolutionary creationism Demon Maimonides Human nature Time travel Saint Deconstruction Theology Creation science Truth Afterlife Catechism Heaven Sin Resurrection of Jesus S__ren Kierkegaard Apologetics Contract Philosophy of mathematics Dharma Great Apostasy Entropy Cult Modern geocentrism
