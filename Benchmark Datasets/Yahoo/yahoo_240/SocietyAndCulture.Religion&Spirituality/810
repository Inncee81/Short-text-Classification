hypothetical for most how would you deal with losing the feeling in both hands lets make it worse the loss of feeling will progress untill both arms are numb then your legs although you have loss of sensation you still have mobility and control your alternative is surgery that will cost you most of your mobility and probably increase pain which would be more important to you to feel what you touch or to be able to move freely ok too many people guessing wrong this is due to spinal damage sensory nerves are the first to be affected in this particular case motor nerves will eventually be destroyed too spinal stenosis hasn't progressed enough to cause paraplegia yet stenosis at present numbness permanent i can answer this from experience i have rheumatoid arthritis palindromic rheumatism and fibromyalgia what these diseases do is limit my mobility and cause me to live with chronic pain when i am having a palindromic attack the affected limb will swell to the point of the skin splitting the pain is incredible for about hours then it leaves as quickly as it comes my nerves are damaged at this point and until the swelling is reduced and things go back to normal the affected appendage is numb to make a long story short loss of sensation at this point is the most welcome thing i can think of i have actually been hospitalized due to pain emergencies and i promise you that relief from pain is sheer bliss the ra that i endure decreases my mobility to the point that on many days i must use a walker or a wheelchair the stiffness makes it difficult to brush my hair open jars etc i would happily give up all body sensations to no longer have to endure pain and to have returned to me my mobility one cannot know how precious one's health is until they lose it so never take it for granted edit is this something that you are experiencing if so i would recommend talking things over with your doctor and your family before making any sort of decision i would also consider what is most important in my life and whether i would have support both emotionally and physically i hope that things work out well for you and i will keep you in my thoughts Multiple sclerosis Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Pain Carpal tunnel syndrome Spinal cord injury Fibromyalgia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Spina bifida Rheumatoid arthritis Childbirth Syringomyelia Penis Fecal incontinence Local anesthesia Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetic neuropathy Equine conformation Paget's disease of bone Spinal stenosis Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Guillain-Barr__ syndrome Poliomyelitis Gout Alexander Technique Autoimmune diseases Epidural Post Polio syndrome Self-harm Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Acupuncture Paraplegia Repetitive strain injury Migraine Neuropathy Decompression sickness Muscle Out-of-body experience Diabetic retinopathy Radiation therapy Hearing impairment Chiropractic M__ni__re___s disease Spinal cord Weight training Panic attack Pneumonia Arthritis Atherosclerosis Angina Stopping power Cerebellum Hip fracture Clinical depression Intersex surgery Addiction Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Medicine Breastfeeding Grief Cerebral palsy Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transverse myelitis Chlorpromazine Motor neurone disease Stuttering Epilepsy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brachial plexus Psychosis Anxiety Divorce Orgasm Brain Dog Aortic dissection Microeconomics Diabetes mellitus Cephalic disorder Milton H.
