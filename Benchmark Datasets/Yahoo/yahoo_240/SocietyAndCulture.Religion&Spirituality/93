why do bible fundies think they are right and the catholic church is wrong the catholic church has oral traditions to back up their claims and also history the first bible fundies are just fall away catholics and that's the beginning of their existence in short their leaders are just rebels who stole the catholic church's bible tearing the books that don't appeal to them and call the remaining books to be only god's words which they are now using against the church anyway so what makes those bible fundies think they're in the right and everybody else are in the wrong is their incomplete version of the original bible enough to show that everybody is wrong except the bible fundies isn't that ridiculous and please don't quote the bible i'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can think for yourselfs and therefore give answer according to what you're thinking yep read history and you will understand all the bible fundamentalists are descendants of lapsed catholics whose ancestors were punished for being heretics they left europe and went to the americas or britain or scandinavia or germany or to escape the persecution that came about from trying to leave the one 'true' church just as there were wars between the orthodox and catholic churches when the catholic church became heretics in the eyes of the orthodox the bible thumpers feel they are right usually because they have singled out a specific part of the bible to believe in while claiming the whole bible is god's word and yet ignoring most of what is in it very simple to do when you are a heretic Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Catholicism Bible Eastern Orthodox Church Judaism Sabbath Biblical canon Jewish principles of faith Catholic Biblical inerrancy Homosexuality and Christianity Apocrypha Roman Catholic Church Religion Christian eschatology Religious pluralism Sin John Wycliffe New Testament Ten Commandments Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abrahamic religion Psalms Baptist Religious Society of Friends Book of Mormon Christian anarchism History of Christianity Mormonism and Christianity Origen A Course In Miracles Resurrection of Jesus Capital punishment Martin Luther King James Version of the Bible Anti-Protestantism Prophet Anabaptist Christian apologetics Second Vatican Council Great Apostasy History of the English Bible Christianity and anti-Semitism Holy Spirit Old Testament Paul of Tarsus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bible and reincarnation Liberal Christianity Church of Christ Protestant Reformation Infant baptism God and gender Original sin Documentary hypothesis Protestantism Christian denomination Opus Dei Idolatry Maimonides Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gospel of John Apostolic Fathers Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Acts of the Apostles Creationism Messianic Judaism Islam Creation according to Genesis Nontrinitarianism Filioque clause Bogomilism Evolutionary creationism God Historical persecution by Christians Merit Lollardy Criticisms of Christianity First Council of Nicaea Messiah Anti-Mormonism Abington School District v.
