why are there so many different baptism rituals different branches of christianity have different interpretations of what baptism means and how it must be performed roman catholics eastern orthodox and what are often called mainstream protestants such as presbyterians epsicopalians lutherans and methodists perform infant baptisms also known as paedobaptism during which water is poured over the head of a newborn child of christian parents historical records show that this has been done since very early in christian history but has been questioned by many christians throughout history as well denominations that are more detached from the catholic church traditions such as baptists pentecostals jehovah's witnesses and mormons do not support infant baptism believing that someone can only be baptized if they are of an age to make a conscious decision for themselves this is sometimes called credobaptism or believer's baptism these denominations typically perform full immersion baptisms while each denomination has it's own particular interpretation on what baptism actually accomplishes and how to perform the specifics of the ritual these are the two major views that cover most denominations lutherans for example keep infant baptism because they believe it is mandated by god baptists on the other hand believe baptism is meaningless without a conscious decision to accept christ Christian denomination Christian Christianity Restorationism Church of Christ Believers baptism Eucharist Messianic Judaism Mormonism and Christianity Protestantism Christian theological controversy Catholicism Trinity Religious conversion Apostles' Creed Holy Spirit Anabaptist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Catechism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptism for the dead Liturgical year Lutheranism Homosexuality and Christianity Justification (theology) History of Christianity Covenant Theology Great Apostasy Original sin Holy water Apostolic Succession Priesthood (Mormonism) Russian Orthodox Church Catholic sacraments Community of Christ Pentecostalism Summary of Christian eschatological differences Sacrament Divine grace Mennonite New Testament Jesus Salvation Sola fide United Methodist Church Presbyterianism Reformed Baptist True Jesus Church Infant communion Ordination of women Confirmation (sacrament) Seventh-day Adventist Church Dispensationalism Prophet John the Baptist Christian ecumenism Heresy Clergy Catholic Religious perspectives on Jesus Mormonism and Judaism Jehovah's Witnesses Calvinism Methodism Religious pluralism Feet washing Reformed churches Nicene Creed Religion and abortion Christian eschatology Christian-Jewish reconciliation Mainline Huldrych Zwingli Evangelicalism Minister of religion Bible and reincarnation Nontrinitarianism Separation of church and state Charismatic Harrowing of Hell Baptism of Jesus Heaven Ecumenical council
