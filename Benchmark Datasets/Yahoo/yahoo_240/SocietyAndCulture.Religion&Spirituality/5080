why would i as a woman seek to join a cult religion that won't allow me to become a spiritual leader if i desired to become a pastor or minister i could not do so in some sects of christianity i for sure could never be an imam in islam if i could not acheive the pinnacle of these respective faith if i so desired then why would i want to join if my say mean diddley squat why would i want to run and jump on the bandwagon for either of these beliefs it's the principle of the whole thing color me brown it's the principle if a woman is better spiritually qualified for leadership why should a lesser qualified man attain that position just because other men said so thousands of years ago retarded what you are asking is a valid question the most qualified person should be the spiritual leader and it shouldn't matter if they are male or female however in my opinion you are being unfair to christianity not being muslim i can't speak for them yes there are denominations that don't allow women into leadership among these are the roman catholic orthodox conservative lutherans and non denominational bible churches they interpret the words of paul to mean that a woman shouldn't have leadership over a man however many denominations of christianity have great respect for the leadership of women the united methodist church of which i am a pastor has allowed women in the ministry for many years right now i am serving under the very capable leadership of a female bishop of our church this is also true of the episcopal church and presbyterian churches i am not sure of others i do agree with you that the spiritual leader of a church should be a person who is called of god into the ministry and it shouldn't matter whether they are male or female pastor john Ordination of women Bishop Church of Christ Holy Orders Clergy Homosexuality and Christianity Eucharist Baptist Roman Catholic Church Minister of religion Evangelical Lutheran Church in America New Testament Lutheranism Christianity Infant baptism Calvinism Mormonism and Christianity Separation of church and state Christian denomination Catholicism Protestantism Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Heresy Baptism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious pluralism Opus Dei Theology Christian views of women Liberal Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pentecostalism Great Apostasy Fundamentalism Charismatic Judaism Evangelicalism History of Christianity God John Wycliffe Catholic Christian-Jewish reconciliation Ten Commandments Unitarianism Christianity and anti-Semitism Predestination Religion in the United Kingdom Islamic philosophy Russian Orthodox Church Creationism Exorcism Eastern Orthodox Church Hinduism Seventh-day Adventist Church Religious conversion Prophet Salvation Rabbi Christian Priest Dispensationalism Abrahamic religion Methodism Islam Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious perspectives on Jesus Church of Scotland Trinity Sabbath Biblical inerrancy Clerical celibacy Paul of Tarsus Evolutionary creationism Jehovah's Witnesses Atheism Idolatry Religion and abortion Religious Society of Friends Biblical canon Papal Infallibility Nation of Islam United States religious history Traditionalist Catholic Restorationism Religion in Israel Pope John Paul II Church of Christ, Scientist Christian countercult movement Apostolic Succession Messianic Judaism Cult United Church of Christ Nicene Creed Divine grace
