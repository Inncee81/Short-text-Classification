mormons was the kirkland temple as scared as the nauvoo temple kirkland had no sealing rooms no celestial room and no vail it was more like the salt lake tabernacle than the salt lake temple on the other had nauvoo was is very much like salt lake the difference to me was the time frame kirkland was built before joseph smith became a mason and nauvoo was put into service after he was made a master mason the rites are so similar that this looks like the lds rite had it's geniuses in the local masonic hall jim jimi and bofumo are making the only sense here i can assume from all this that mormonism was not reveled from god but instead evolved into the staggering mass of doctrine that it is today part old testament holding priesthood as some special authority from god part new testament pulling a verse here and there as a proof text and using the name of christ for illegitimacy part book of mormon but again enough just so they can call it a sacred book giving it and therefore smith authority but mostly d c and pofpg unless any part of those caused the church trouble as in section of the d c the kirkland temple is just one more evidence that joseph smith is a fraud and his message was not of god but from social evolution jim no it appears that the masons had a lot do to with what made something more sacred let's make up the rules as we go a long or what membership we acquire jim you really do ask some brain teasers lol Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Joseph Smith, Jr. Book of Mormon Priesthood (Mormonism) History of the Latter Day Saint movement Mormonism and Christianity Doctrine and Covenants Mormonism and Judaism Mormon Blacks and Mormonism Nauvoo, Illinois Mormonism Succession crisis (Mormonism) Plural marriage President of the Church (Mormonism) Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Emma Hale Smith Baptism Criticism of Mormonism Anti-Mormonism History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Joseph F.
