i believe in the bibles version of creation does that make me a creation nut if so all i can say is guilty and proud of it jedi only ranting going on is your answer bozo donna f i make a statement that i believe in the bibles version and i'm not to quote from the bible lol what is up with the personal attacks can't a person come on the ya religion forum and make a religious statement without being attacked personally lol guess not macmom the bible version of creation has been changed over and over again its my experiance that the evolution theory has been changed read my post of yesterday http answers yahoo com question index ylt ahvb h b h tksx fexsy ix qid aa b db kitty thanks for you nice response i don't denie that there is evolving within species but where is the proof that we went from microscopic to fish to anphibian to mammal to do we have a skeleton of the phase from fish to mammal from mammal to ape like to man no and we will never find one wheres the missing key matt thanks for the link and the great answer brother jedi that does not surprise me at all don't you just hate opposing views lol oh yeah and don't be so thin skinned you won't last long in this forum according to atheists anybody who dares form an opinion that isnt in line with their philosophy is offensive slightly retarded anti intellectual or nutty at best as witnessed by their repsonses you were accused of not reading enough not looking at the evidence rejecting the evidence at hand being too young which i know that isnt true and of coarse your inteligence called into question classic plays from the atheist playbook that are never going to go out of style it is their belief that they own science now therefore if you dont follow their philosophy you are actually going against science and if you do try to engage them on the level of scientific fact you just appear as a biased religious nut trying to hijack science and make it say what you want for your own purposes as if facts and evidence dont speak for themselves what they do ive noticed with their evidence is they start their scientific method assuming evolution and therefore come up with al these proofs of evolution that is why evolution has become so obvious to atheists is because their biased and corrupt method of naturalistic science doesnt know how to examine the facts any other way science as a matter of category doesnt speak out in philosophical religious or moral issues after all how can you scientifically prove things like murder is wrong god doesnt exist or that idealism and realism are wrong you cant all science does is explore and struggle to understand the material natural world but indeed atheists have hijacked it or think they have for their own philosophical purposes then they come and tell you we have irrefutable scientific proof you dumb god believer the only thing you are guilty of is believing god first thinking for yourself and having a view apart from atheistic philosophy im but what ive noticed is this new generation of kids is very resiliant when it comes to their religion and morality ive heard studies that say they are going to be more conservative socially and more religious as a whole than we are so atheists have to take a different approach in trying to tear down their faith and it begins by making the olive branch offer of believing in both evolution and god therefore they dont get to be teased by the atheists yet still hold onto that silly religion of theirs but after you cast a seed in someone youve already done much to turn them away from their faith well begun is certainly half done in this case atheistic philosophy is a very dangerous prideful godless thing and is going to decieve and damn many i think we as a community of believers need to seek to fight them more on this front for the sake of future generations i know what i believe and i know generally the facts but they dont and they are vulnerable History of creationism Philosophy Wedge strategy Jewish principles of faith Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meaning of life Biblical inerrancy Epistemology Theistic realism Young Earth creationism Ethics The relationship between religion and science William A.
