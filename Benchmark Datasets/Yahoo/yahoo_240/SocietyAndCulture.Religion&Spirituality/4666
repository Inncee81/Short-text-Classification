a lot of people are probably going to get mad at me for this but i believe in god i pray every day and i try to be a good person and i ask forgiveness when i do something wrong however my family doesn't go to church anymore i don't know the bible well and a lot of the stuff i have a hard time believing anyway i believe everything about jesus but i also believe in evolution i am not saying god didn't create those things but they do evolve i'm also not one of those people that thinks gay people go to hell i've seen a lot of christians go into the lgbt section and bash them so badly and it makes me mad i guess what i'm wondering is does anyone else see it the way i do the reason i am this is way is because i used to believe strongly when i was little then i was molested and i stopped believing because i didn't understand why god would let that happen i eventually forgave my grandpa molestor god and myself but my beliefs changed am i wrong for that do you think you have to believe the bible to be a christian how am i a troll i have never been accused of that i was being completely honest go ahead and look at the other questions i've asked if you need to i don't troll around here in fact i never come here because i thought no one would accept how i felt and you made me realize that there are people here who don't respect other people if they don't believe the same way you do thank you to everyone else who has answered and been genuine about it i really appreciate it believe everything about jesus but i also believe in evolution i am not saying god didn't create those things but they do evolve i'm also not one of those people that thinks gay people go to hell wow you sound just like my son he sees no problem with god creating the earth through evolution me i am not a fan of evolution but i guess god could have used that method but the bible doesn't seem to support that and you are so right about the horrible bashing done in the lgbt section it makes me cringe to go there and see so called christians acting in such a hateful way if you are following christ though don't you have to have some sort of guide for your life ie the bible you seem like a nice person i am sorry you have had such bad experiences but you don't seem bitter and i find that to be remarkable bless you dear one God Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church Salvation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Intelligent design Theory of conduct John Howard Yoder Sin Soul Supernatural Homosexuality and Christianity Creationism Free will The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Rich Mullins Justification (theology) Nontrinitarianism Sola fide Avenue Q Predestination Religious Society of Friends Nation of Islam Christianity Baptism Christian eschatology Trinity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Holy Spirit Genesis Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Immortality Mary, the mother of Jesus Slow Train Coming Abrahamic religion Religion Charles Grandison Finney Origin belief Roman Catholic Church Evil Idolatry Christian anarchism Creation-evolution controversy Alan Campbell (pastor) Infant baptism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Heaven Opus Dei William A.
