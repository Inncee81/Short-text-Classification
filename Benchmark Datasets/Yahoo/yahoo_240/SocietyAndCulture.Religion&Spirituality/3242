i have to admit i am still confused could someone explain to me the difference between a theory and a law i don't know how often i've seen in here someone trying to explain to us what a theory is in science by telling us that we can test a scientific theory by falling off the roof so how is citing the law of gravity giving us any information about what a scientific theory is and how does that have anything to do with the skeletons in the closet or more to the point the empty hangers where skeletons ought to be this is a good question sadly few people seem to understand the difference including everbody but ooz above me and duck and drac below me scientific laws describe physical phenomena often in terms of math and they have no exceptions scientific theories try to explain how these phenomena occur or what causes them simply put law what theory how a good example would be the gas laws and kinetic molecular theory the gas laws describe what happens to gasses when you change the volume the temperature the pressure or the amount of gas in a container the gas laws have no exceptions kinetic molecular theory explains these laws in terms of molecules and makes testable predictions based on the idea that a gas is made of molecules predictions not made by the laws themselves kinetic molecular theory may be wrong but it has predictive value and is a very successful theory if new evidence were to arise that discredited kinetic molecular theory scientists would either modify the theory to account for the new evidence or discard it altogether and come up with a new theory the new theory would still have to explain the gas laws and the new evidence and it would have to make testable predictions so that it could be verified Physics Theory Temperature Science Entropy Philosophy of science Falsifiability Intelligent design Gravity Water (molecule) Kinetic theory Creationism Phase (matter) Luminiferous aether Chemistry Flood geology Supernatural Modified Newtonian dynamics String theory General relativity Vacuum Thermodynamics Special relativity Multiverse Explosive material Cold fusion Pseudoscience Origin of life Evolution Mass Energy Law of value Emergence Theory of everything Molecule Amedeo Avogadro Homeopathy James Clerk Maxwell Creation science Albert Einstein Macroevolution Psychology Chemical reaction Meme Black hole History of physics Linus Pauling Equation of state Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Genetics Mathematics Experiment Heat Viscosity Physical science Scientific skepticism Dark energy Causality Irreducible complexity Solar variation Creationist cosmologies Validity of human races Non-standard cosmology Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge Global warming Physical law Particle physics Ozone depletion Biology Absolute zero Motor oil Hydrogen Abiogenesis Darwin on Trial Species Global cooling Superconductivity Evolutionism Theory of conduct Randomness The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Scientific revolution Physical cosmology Young Earth creationism
