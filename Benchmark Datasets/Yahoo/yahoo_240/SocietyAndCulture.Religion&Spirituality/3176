why do people ignore the crusades and blame muslims for being brutal which is something done by a minority throughout the prophecy of mohammed saw there have been at least wars but only about people were killed because the wars were always for self defense but today lots of lunatics are overshadowing true message of islam by doing suicide bombings and that stuff ok but why don't people see the soldiers in iraq killing thousands raping them why don't they see the crusades why don't they see the atom bomb why don't they see hitler even saddam who was a puppet of us and i can't count him as a muslim only allah knows there has never been a cruel like hitler in islam history including the lunatics muslims have never been into genocides slaughters massacres bin laden saddam and etc are the puppets of the jews us to make muslims look like terrorist why don't people try to see this i do not ignore the crusades or wwii hitler the atomic bomb the atrocies the us perpetrated against those of asain decent during wwii the killing of iraqi people i usually avoid watching the news and looking at pictures from newspapers because of the killing of my muslim and jewish brothers and sisters these things sadden me immensely i do see them and i do care the us has made mistakes catholics christians jews and muslims have made mistakes none of us is perfect i am against all wars i used to think i believed in just war or war for self defense then sept and then the so called war on terrrorism war in afghanistan and war in iraq happened i remember being so sad after sept and talking to my mom who said the us would likely go to war and i just could not understand how violence would help end violence i thought more people will hate the us and it will cause prejudice against my muslim brothers and sisters i can no longer think war is ever justifiable especially when some very wrong people lie to provide justification for war are usa soliders really raping iraqi women i do not recall hearing that but of course all news and even history textbooks are biased and products of the government and a propaganda of sorts but i guess it would make sense since throughout history soliders from various countries have done that probably in part because they are brain washed and demonize and seeing the enemy as less than human however i am not saying it is right if it is true the us people should know it and the usa soldiers should be punished and stop raping iraqi women i do not know the secrets of the us government or what goes on in people's heads and hearts however i so hope you are wrong that the usa and jewish officals manipulated bin laden and saddam to give the usa an excuse to intervene why would the us or jewish officals do this given the deaths of usa citizens and soliders regardless of whether or not it is true it is sickening to think the us and jewish officals would remember sometimes rulers do things their people are against so it might not be fair to say jews rather it is jewish leaders and how about the young jewsih and usa children who cannot get involved in politics yet they did not choose or support their leaders who are doing wrong horrific deads i do try to see the truth though sometimes i cannot hear any more truth about hatred violence and prejudice however i never want to hear lies i either cannot listen any more because of my saddness and heartache or i need to wait until later to hear more i pray for love honesty forgiveness and peace i want an end to hatred violence injusitce poverty hunger lying and prejudice some calling themselves muslims used genocides slaughters massacres they made it clear they did it in the name of islam and allah and even if they misunderstood true islam other nonmuslims see them calling themselves muslim and being violent and have to wonder if there are such teachings in islam granted they are acting contrary to true pure islamic teaching but so were the crusades so are the israeli jews persecution and subordination of palestinian muslims so is indian hindus killing of indian and pakistani muslims so is protestant and catholic irish killing each other this was written by a religious and spiritual person who is not muslim or jewish who is very very sorry that people changed christ's message and used it to justify the crusades is hurt over the prejudice and killings of muslims and jews and who thinks followers of all religions be they muslim hindu buddhist jewish christian etc deserve to be able to nonviolently practice their believes in peace they do not have the right to spread
