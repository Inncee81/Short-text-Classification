what are the major points of catholicism what is catholicism how does it differ from christianity and how did saints come to be recognized and prayed to why is that considered the right thing to do in the catholic religion i just want to clear up that i know it is a christian faith but that it differs in that people ask for saints to intercede instead of speaking directly to god and christ i believe that's why i'm asking the catholic faith is the original faith of the apostles as it was given to them by jesus christ years ago and faithfully handed down to us the catholic church has been eternally blessed by god the father constantly illuminated by the power of the holy spirit and it has always been nourished by the real and substantial body and blood of jesus christ a universal church and an eternal church those who belong to the church remain so forever and death is not a barrier catholics consider those who have gone before us to be alive perfected in god's grace and supernaturally engaged in christ's ongoing work of saving souls just as we here on earth should always be catholics offer true worship and perfect sacrifice to god for the forgiveness of sins in the very person of jesus christ who is the one time once for all eternal sacrifice of calvary the catholic church is a church full of priests some of those priests perform ministerial duties some teach some govern and all share in the royal priesthood of all believers and this especially includes all those who are now in heaven with god ans since every faithful catholic alive or dead is a member of god's own household a citizen of heaven and a co heir with jesus christ what would prevent us from treating each other like one big happy family jesus said it best mat and jesus answering said to them you err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god mat for in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married but shall be as the angels of god in heaven mat and concerning the resurrection of the dead have you not read that which was spoken by god saying to you mat i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living luk neither can they die any more for they are equal to the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection luk now that the dead rise again moses also shewed at the bush when he called the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob luk for he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all live to him if all the faithful are alive to god and all remain members of the church than what is there to keep us apart from them especially when you consider that all prayer is empowered and facilitated by the holy spirit Athanasian Creed Original sin Mortification of the flesh Infant baptism Paul of Tarsus Religious perspectives on Jesus Dispensationalism Community of Christ John Howard Yoder Sacrifice A Course In Miracles Great Apostasy Hell Heresy Jehovah's Witnesses Coptic Christianity Prophet Indulgence Abraham Justin Martyr Pharisees Origen Protestantism Opus Dei Binitarianism Tridentine Mass John Wesley Creed Martin Luther Confession Idolatry Theosis Alan Campbell (pastor) Pope Nontrinitarianism Calvinism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian views of Jesus Lutheranism History of the Latter Day Saint movement Judaism Blessed Virgin Mary Urantia Traditionalist Catholic Reincarnation Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Messiah Catholic
