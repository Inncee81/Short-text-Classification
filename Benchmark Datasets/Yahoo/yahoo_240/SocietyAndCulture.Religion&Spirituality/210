what is better a readymate temple of wood or a readymate temple of metal and please explain why hmmm by a readymade temple that you say i take it that you are talking about a portable temple for your home in such a case a portable temple of wood is best because wood happens to be a non conductor hence the energies that you would evoke in the deity in the temple shall remain and not get earthed in case of metal temple when we perform pooja and invoke the deity its energy transcends into the idol hence the idols are preferred to be of metals for homes this energy to remain in he idols the idols should be placed on a non conducting base wood being the best similarly when you are doing pooja or a jaap it is beneficial to sit on a woodden base thereby insulating urself from the earth and surrounding objects this helps in concentrating energies in oneself also when you discard the temple for a new one it is easier to dispose the woodden one thru burning rather than the metal one which in one way or the other shall go into recycling which i feel is not good as it housed an energy at some point of time practicality wise a wood temple is lighter in weight and can even be hung on a wall and requires lesser maintainence in terms of cleaning and maintaining and costs less than metal temples too also symbolically a wodden temple represents an easy porous ready to absorb and open mind to gather knowledge rather than metal which represents solid imprenetrable and hard mind kinda closed to any influence thanks Idolatry Spark plug Aluminium Energy development Hydrogen economy Hinduism Solar power Trimurti Vacuum Pebble bed reactor Heat Explosive material Fire fighting Vaastu Shastra Plastic Tantra Wood Circuit design Welding Semiconductor Waste management Magic (paranormal) Knife Transformer Solar cell Overhead lines God Ground and neutral Fire Aztec Glossary of climbing terms Violin Carbon MOSFET Coal Battery (electricity) Ra (board game) Nickel-cadmium battery Capacitor Electrical wiring Mantra Sento Wicca Casting Water (molecule) Protoss Space Shuttle program Tesla coil Ceramics Beryllium Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Bong Neuro-linguistic programming Meditation Diamond Vishnu Electrical resistance Depleted uranium Hindu deities Sant Mat Lithium Nuclear reprocessing Technology Buddhist art Electrical conduction Luminoth Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Seismic retrofit Drill bit Powder metallurgy Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Nuclear power Material properties of diamond Past teachings of Prem Rawat Akhenaten Mithraism Chair Door Money Superconductivity Fire extinguisher Engine cooling Jet engine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Nuclear weapon design Sewage treatment Chinese martial arts Japanese tea ceremony Planetary orbit Wind turbine Glass Gas tungsten arc welding Nuclear fuel cycle Ammunition Colonization of the Moon Confucianism Ekadasi
