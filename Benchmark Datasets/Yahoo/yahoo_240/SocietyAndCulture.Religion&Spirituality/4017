see the additional detals below why are the instincts of death of many muslims so powerful i've found very troubling some of the comments posted by muslim participants to many r s question for example one question at http answers yahoo com question index ylt ajvfdme kvuqt vn gt kbsy ix qid aarxdd show profile info kysf kraa it is true that this is a small unrepresentative sampling but they are disquieting nonetheless e g why are we so much in love with this world why do you regoice about this life when it gets shorter every hour the ummah is drwoning into love to their life and forgetting about the more importnat afterlife we muslims who live in the west a beset on all sides to revel in this life and forget the next it is a shame i do wish that those who are muslim but don't live islam would wear a sign around their neck so we could tell the difference another way to ask this question could be why is it difficult for muslims to at least appreciate their present life at least as much as an hypothetical afterlife i know muslims who are not only capable of enjoying this life but who are partying more heartily than any infidel i think the issue is hard to define but i have some ideas one muslims are indoctrinated from a very early age with their religion and the idea that all other religious beliefs are inferior two many islamic countires have an enormous pool of poor and poorly educated people this means that there is an immense pool of people indoctrinated see one who have no personal basis upon which to make judgments who have little or nothing to lose and the hope of something to gain in an afterlife we do not see wealthy islams wearing explosive vests and the imams mullahs and bin ladens of the world are very happy to have the self destructive work fall to those who are not too bright have nothing to lose or just don't get it three anytime a religion can sell its people on the idea that their faith is embattled the faith seems to actually gain strength christianity has always seemed to thrive in times of persecution the idea that heaven is close that god will reward you that your actions advance a greater objectiove and that this life is just a temporary state of affairs can be almost intoxicating to some people Afterlife Religion Islam Christianity Jewish principles of faith Atheism Judaism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sikhism Predestination Phaedo Heaven Fundamentalism Salvation Islam as a political movement Religious conversion Meaning of life God Qiyamah Islamic philosophy Reincarnation History of Islam Al-Ghazali Nation of Islam Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticism of Islam Suicide bombing Eschatology Hell Shi'a Islam Roman Catholic Church Apostasy in Islam Sunni Islam Sin Muhammad Dhimmi Abrahamic religion Alawite Jizya Separation of church and state Bosniaks Confucianism Religious pluralism Jihad Charles Darwin's views on religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pascal's Wager Mirza Ghulam Ahmad InterFaith Immortality Islamism Creationism Maimonides Prayer Sola fide Satanism The nature of God in Western theology Patriotism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Osama bin Laden Goodness and value theory Prophet Urantia Divisions of Islam Great Apostasy Chosen people Sharia Theology Ten Commandments Muslim ibn Aqeel Mary, the mother of Jesus Evil Islam and anti-Semitism Hadith Evolutionary creationism Confucius Mormonism and Christianity End times Apocalypse Theodicy Ramadan Historical persecution by Muslims Coercion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Polygamy Islam in Bangladesh Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Monotheism Jewish eschatology Saint
