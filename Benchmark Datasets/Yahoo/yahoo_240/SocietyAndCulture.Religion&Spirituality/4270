in my church we have a mixture of serious and joyful praise sometimes there are skits that make us laugh but make a point i like this variety but a few people are offended that we should laugh in god's house i don't get it why not have fun in our worship do you thinnk it is disrespectful to laugh in church no we are joyous people i guess maybe some of the people in your church are older and remember how church use to be i had to adjust to chorus singing i remember singing the whole verses of songs in the hymn books which are rarely used these days and are just collecting dust as long as its done with the proper respect and makes a spiritual point i don't see a problem with it Hymn Psalms Canonical hours Rich Mullins Minstrel show Qawwali Mass (liturgy) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
