how precious is the name of jesus to you as a christian the saints in the book of acts were persecuted because of the name of the lord calling on the name of the lord was one of the ways that saul of tarsus identified the believers what is it in this name that satan wants to utterly blot out this name that is above all names under the earth on the earth and in heaven this name that is the sweetest name on earth the name that we cry out when we are deepest pit and are rescued the name that the overcomers in the church in philadelphia revelation held fast to and did not deny today we are called christ ians those that are of and belong to christ what does his name truly mean to us would we ever deny his name would we take the name of another over his do we say i am baptist or wesleyian or catholic or penticostal or do we just say we are christ ians share with me what is this name jesus christ to you jesus christ to me means life god lord and savior i claim no religion religion to me is man by man's efforts trying to earn the approbation of god through good works i am a christian who is a follower of christ ridding myself of cosmic system thinking and replacing it with christ like thought through study and application of his word from the original languages on a daily basis becoming grace oriented as he is and trying to follow his principles as stated in the bible there are many who are truly christians but never study his word without study and application there is no growth going to church on sunday and ignoring bible teaching the rest of the week will not make one a mature believer so those who say the are christians may very well be they just may be baby believers every christian is at a different stage of spiritual growth and we have to be patient with each and every one as christ is with us growth happens over a lifetime and witnessing through our behavior being christ like is what we are commanded to do learn every day sinless perfection is impossible but keeping short accounts and keep getting up when we fall down is important here is a good site to get daily bible teaching for free for anyone reading this who may like that http www gbible org Christianity Church of Christ Salvation Church of Christ, Scientist Jesus A Course In Miracles Sin Divine grace Paul of Tarsus Mormonism and Christianity Apostle Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Heaven Holy Spirit Ten Commandments Resurrection of Jesus Original sin Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Abrahamic religion Sola fide Book of Mormon Trinity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses End times Justification (theology) John Howard Yoder God Mary, the mother of Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eastern Orthodox Church Dispensationalism Religious perspectives on Jesus Religious pluralism Mormonism Baptist Eucharist Soul Urantia Book of Revelation Great Apostasy Gospel of John Roman Catholic Church Calvinism Satan Apostolic Succession Religion Evangelicalism Christian views of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Merit Joseph Smith, Jr. Priesthood (Mormonism) Antichrist Satanism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origen Fundamentalism Mortification of the flesh Theology Christianity and anti-Semitism Blacks and Mormonism Apocrypha John Wesley Bible Community of Christ Binitarianism Opus Dei Restorationism History of the Latter Day Saint movement Harrowing of Hell God and gender Saint Peter Anabaptist Protestantism Liturgical year Mary Magdalene Hell Messianic Judaism Mormonism and Judaism Endowment (Mormonism) Articles of Religion (Methodist) John Wycliffe Seventh-day Adventist Church Christ Nontrinitarianism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Predestination
