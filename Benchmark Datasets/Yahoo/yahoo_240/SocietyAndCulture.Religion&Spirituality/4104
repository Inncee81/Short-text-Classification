believers and non believers alike give me some real answers i hate it that a bunch of atheists answer christian questions with retarded answers like nu uh and stuff like that come up with something intellectually stimulating and then we'll talk i also hate it that christians answer with things like praise the lord in the holy land that's stupid too what's the point of ya if not to have an actual debate involving intelligence and banter not just shutting out our minds and sticking out our tongues can we have an actual debate here people why do you believe what you believe give me something to make my mind work not bible verses or raspberries well as far as bible verses go if you ask me to debate my position on something i'm going to quote scripture on most things because that's where my position originates from in most cases i mean that's like saying to a lawyer to write a position or a brief with out quoting any case law honestly its the same scripture is our precedent that being said sometimes i get annoyed by this too because the person just quotes a scripture with no context or explanation of why they think that verse is relevant just looking to give the answer quickly with out giving any back up to it as far as the random things said to go against what the questioner has put forth or people who just go p as an answer those are just goin for getting points and thats just something that happens in this kind of forum we just have to ignore that cuz well it's just gonna happen the other thing is this type of forum makes it really easy to either misunderstand someones intentions because of the way they word something with out being able to hear inflection in their voice or seeing their facial expressions it's also really easy for people to act immaturely and not care because there really are no consequences again just the nature of this kind of forum i know its really aggravating but just use your little rating button if you rate someone with a thumbs down their answer disappears d don't need to see it anymore lol i get really aggravated with christians who act this way because they should know that we are accountable for ever idle word spoken or typed it's just so easy to be crude or inappropreate when no one can see you Biblical inerrancy Book of Isaiah Creationism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The nature of God in Western theology Atheism Theory of conduct Religion Sabbath Bible Ten Commandments Sola fide A Course In Miracles Resurrection of Jesus Slow Train Coming Soul Evolutionary creationism God Theodicy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Zohar Holy Spirit Supernatural Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Wycliffe Moses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sinfest Trinity Past teachings of Prem Rawat Presuppositional apologetics Plame affair English grammar Judaism Merit Intelligent design Origin belief Creation-evolution controversy Free will Jewish principles of faith Abington School District v.
