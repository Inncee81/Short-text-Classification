can someone convince me there is a god i'm just not sure how i feel about god if theres a god then how come thousands are being killed in genocide in africa and how come wars are raging and dont say god does averything for a reason or it will make everyone stronger because being dead cant make you stronger i just feel like god id a made up thing that makes ppl try to be nice to eachother i believe in peace and meditation but not god help i want to hear why you believe in him i guess i just dont have a lot of faith i understand how you feel you can't believe what organized religions insist that you believe so the question is now what yet you believe that there is something out there worthy of praise i don't think that anyone should convince another person about a belief in god continue to search your own heart and mind god for me resides in all of nature it isn't evil or good it hasn't written any books or anointed any leaders to persuade it is our earth home it is the people and the creatures that live here we are all part of this devastatingly beautiful and violent world there are no magical beings to believe in there are no implausible creation theories to prove the universe is here and i choose to live in it reverently i believe that the universe and all that dwell within it are here naturally science is a friend to my beliefs because it confirms the awesomeness of the natural world i use god to describe my beliefs because gods are considered powerful wondrous and mysterious doesn't that describe our cosmos the difference the universe is real Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Supernatural The nature of God in Western theology Religion Predestination God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charles Darwin's views on religion Creationism Human Soul Urantia Origin belief Atheism A Course In Miracles Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Socrates Trinity Holy Spirit Ten Commandments Animism Philosophical skepticism Jiddu Krishnamurti Biblical inerrancy Magic (paranormal) Existence of God Rich Mullins Duties of the Heart Cosmology Jewish principles of faith Evolutionary creationism Christian eschatology Immortality Fundamentalism Meaning of life Philosophy of religion Religious Society of Friends Idolatry Theology New Age Alaga__sia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Monotheism Genesis Intelligent design movement Book of Isaiah Christianity Protestantism Eastern philosophy Peace Mormonism and Christianity Summa Theologiae Intelligent design Original sin Problem of Hell Goodness and value theory Creation-evolution controversy Mythology Salvation Criticism of Mormonism Ontological argument Roman Catholic Church Human nature Islamic philosophy Reincarnation Philosophy Justification (theology) Priesthood (Mormonism) Falun Gong Phillip E.
