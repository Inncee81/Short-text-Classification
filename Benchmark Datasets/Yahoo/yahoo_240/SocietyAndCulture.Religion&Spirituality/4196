hand stigmata are all fakes because jesus was crucified through the wrist is this true would seem a little stupid someone showing stigmata on their hands when that has no biblical importance whatsoever don't you think recently i was told that when people tested hand crucifictions and found it to be impossible religious people changed their minds and said they crucified through the wrists have they themselves proven hand stigmata to be completely fake or stupidity on the part of god's affliction with this phenomenon towelieban barbie you're a moron alls they had to do to get away is let it rip through their skin and inchworm away if there wasn't anyone around it's funny how no one suggested these theories when i said it was impossible to crucify someone in that manner they simply said i was wrong and the romans crucified through the wrist and that was how jesus was crucified silly christians i heard this theory once that a spike through the hands would not support the weight of the body and thus the body would fall from the cross therefore they must have put the spike through the wrist however this logic ignores the possibility that the body was tied to the cross and the spikes were just there to cause pain hand wrist pain no matter how you slice it it probably would have been easier to nail it through the palm just by virtue of the strength required to crush the larger bones in the wrist and the palm offers a bigger target but i think you got it right when you said there was no biblical importance anyway as for the truth of the 'stigmata i've never seen it nor have i ever thought that it had any relevance for me so i can't say one way or the other whether they are fake or real it isn't biblical so believing it would require me to put my faith in man and i'm not going to make that kind of leap Crucifixion Resurrection of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Creationism Mortification of the flesh Free will Theodicy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Historicity of Jesus Meaning of life Sabbath Jesus Falsifiability Shroud of Turin Christian cross Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.
