i received a violation for my answer to a question regarding so called true muslims what do you think i simply stated that in middle eastern countries such as iraq and afghanistan true muslims will ask the parents to stap a bomb on to their year old child and send him out as a suicide bomber and the parents will do it in the name of allah and the true muslims asking them to do this will pay them a large amount of money hey i didn't make this up iraqi muslims told me these things could it be people don't want to hear stories of things that are actually happening could it be that they don't want to hear about true muslims taking men out of their homes in iraq and killing them in front of the neighborhood just to prove who was in charge i have been there as an american soldier i have seen the suicide bombers in iraq i was there helping the iraqi army get better trained to fight terrorist what are your thoughts btw the violation just made me laugh when i say ignorant things iraqi muslims told me these things i didn't make them up they are based on true events that take place in these muslim nations hi there i'm from iraq and i've been in the us for about years but i'm catholic and what did u say about muslims is true that is a part of thier religion they think that if they will do that god will reward them and that is wrong that is exactly what thier religion is most based on but if u have some faith u will recognize that killing people or taking your revenge is not what god asks us to do so just ignore what u have got may god bless u all Yusuf al-Qaradawi Suicide bombing Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Plame affair Nation of Islam Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Religion Al-Qaeda Donald Rumsfeld Saint Iraq War George Galloway Muslim ibn Aqeel Nick Berg Evolutionary creationism Occupation of Iraq timeline Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda in Iraq Jessica Lynch Ten Commandments Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq War on Terrorism Rais massacre Bowling for Columbine Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq Predestination Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Mary, the mother of Jesus Five Pillars of Islam Religious pluralism Prophet God Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Sin Cindy Sheehan Islam and anti-Semitism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John the Baptist Multinational force in Iraq Bilal ibn Ribah Iraqi legislative election, January 2005 Osama bin Laden Sectarian violence in Iraq Fundamentalism Hezbollah U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Plame affair timeline Atheism Iraq Kurdish people Islam Assyrian people Dhimmi Hillary Rodham Clinton Osama tapes Salvation 2004 Republican National Convention Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Female suicide bomber Improvised explosive device Jaish Ansar al-Sunna Sabra and Shatila massacre Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Islamic world Creationism Apostasy in Islam Lebanese Civil War Chosen people John Titor Guantanamo Bay Miracle Separation of church and state Oil-for-Food Programme Islam as a political movement Suicide Jizya Iraq disarmament crisis timeline 2001-2003 South Park Fred Phelps Charles Graner Theory of conduct Politics of Iraq U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Buddhism Status of religious freedom in Sudan Women in Islam Iraq disarmament crisis Christianity Justification (theology) Meaning of life
