why do christians still cite these historians as secular proof that jesus is lord josephus the part about jesus has been proven to be a forgery inserted by christians scribes hundreds of years after josephus wrote his original suetonius speaks of chrestus as though he is a person still living in rome in the 's tacitus mentions the death of christ but years after the event took place calls the christian religion a superstition pliny mentions that the christian cult was in existence in the early nd century no surprise here the fact is there were many christs or messiahs and no one makes mention of the fact that jesus was the son of god or rose from the dead or even mentions jesus by name harmony christians often say this the martyrs wouldn't have died for nothing so jesus must be the messiah that is terribly faulty logic and incorrect towelie obviously christianity exists and was a religion during the time of rome i am not disputing that l c are you saying that the contamination of josephus had to have occured after the tenth century do better research next time christianity made it's way to the top by a mountain of corpses and a river of blood it toppled the roman empire and controlled just about every country in the middle ages through the pope it had nothing to do with it's truth only it's convenience Jesus Pontius Pilate Acts of the Apostles Paul of Tarsus Biblical canon Messiah Saint James the Just Historical Jesus Book of Daniel Josephus on Jesus Book of Revelation Saint Peter Miracle History of Christianity Baptism Mary, the mother of Jesus Sabbath Gospel of Barnabas Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) New Testament view on Jesus' life Tacitus Cultural and historical background of Jesus Justin Martyr Chronology of Jesus Herod the Great Apocrypha Tribulation Eastern Orthodox Church Josephus Crucifixion Secret Gospel of Mark Anno Domini Gospel of Mark Catholicism Barabbas Trinity Religion Names and titles of Jesus Apologetics John the Baptist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Great Apostasy Bible and reincarnation Pope Holy Spirit Religious perspectives on Jesus Arianism Christian apologetics Christian denomination Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church Sign of contradiction Eschatology Abrahamic religion The Bible and history Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Christianity Biblical inerrancy Apostle Atheism Mary Magdalene Christianity and anti-Semitism Tertullian Prophet Angel Easter Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity New Testament Opus Dei Pope Joan Claudius God Authorship of the Pauline epistles Roman Empire Protestantism Heresy Gospel of John Apocalypse Book of Isaiah Roman Emperor Jesus-Myth Jewish Messiah Library of Alexandria Christmas Baptist Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Persecution of Christians Biblical Magi Shroud of Turin Filioque clause
