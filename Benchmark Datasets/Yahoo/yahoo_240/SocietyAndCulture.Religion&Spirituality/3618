should jizyah be enforced on non muslim minority in an islamic state a question arises whether a modern islamic state should collect jizyah from its non muslim citizens or not before we answer this question let us consider the views of dr hamidullah an eminent scholar of islam on this issue he says in the beginning of islam this tax did not exist in the muslim state either in madinah or elsewhere it was towards the year h that the qur an ordained it that it was a question of expediency and not a matter of dogmatic duty in islam is sufficiently shown by the following incidents it is reported by ibn sa d on the authority of zuhri that at the moment of the death of his son ibrahim the prophet muhammaed declared had he survived i would have exempted all the copts from the jizyah as a mark of esteem for ibrahim s mother who was a coptic girl or again cf suyuti husn al muhadarah ch khalij amir al mu minin when a non muslim egyptian laid before the muslim government the project of re digging the ancient canal from fustat cairo down to the red sea thus facilitating the maritime transport of the food stuffs of egypt to madinah the famous nahr amir al mu minin the caliph umar rewarded him by exempting him from jizyah during his whole life there are jurists who opine that one should also take into consideration the international repercussions affecting muslim interests in view of the fact that islam has penetrated the entire world and there are millions of muslims inhabiting countries which are under non muslim domination and the jizyah if levied on christians jews hindus and others in the islamic territory would inevitably produce a reaction on muslims among christians and other countries according to the qur an and also according to the practice of the prophet and right guided caliphs jizyah was collected from the non muslims when they had been defeated in the battlefield or when they had completely submitted to the muslim rule because of fear of imminent defeat no modern muslim state can claim of having conquered its non muslim minorities the non muslim minorities in a modern islamic state have somehow come to live with the muslims therefore imposition of jizyah on non muslim minorities is not obligatory under islamic law moreover the yield from jizyah would be too little in monetary terms but its repercussions on the muslim minorities living in non muslim lands may be considerable instead of jizyah it would be more advisable to levy wealth tax on the non muslim as well as muslim citizens of the islamic state however the muslim citizens should be exempted from wealth tax in respect of those assets on which zakat has been paid by them i am talking about jizyah which is the tax that is levied upon non muslims in islamic country which is to make it fair seems muslim contributes zakat for the islamic state while non muslim too should pay taxes which is jizyah which is something like zakat but the value is way smaller than zakat many non muslim have a misconception that jizyah is enforce as a punishment to non muslim for not ebing muslim which is definitely wrong so i am here to clear this misconception among both muslims and nn muslim cocnerning this important issue you are definitely right sameer a non muslim is exempted from paying jizyah if he joins the army jizyah is not collected from children women blind people priests and monks and all those people who don't have the ability to launch a warfare response to alonyoav zakat is paid by every muslim male or female old or minor sane or insane provided he possesses wealth at the level of nisab however jizyah is levied only on adult male healthy non muslims capable to participate in a war women old men minors sick persons of unsound mind poor beggars priests etc are exempted from the payment of jizyah those non muslims who join the military service of the islamic state are also exempted from the payment of jizyah tax while the muslims are not exempt from zakat even if they discharge the defence duties moreover the rates of jizyah are much lower as compared to zakat because the highest rate of jizyah is dinar or dirhams per person per annum while the amount of zakat can be substantial depending on the wealth of the tax payer for instance a zimmi with wealth of one million dinar would pay jizyah at dinar only while a muslim possessing that much amount shall pay zakat at thousand dinar nd response to alonyoav the caliphates that humiliated the dhimmis are the abbasids and the ummaiyads it is an undeniable fact tehse caliphates are really cruel towards non muslim but are they the role model for muslim rulers today so before you go on bashing muslims with your dhimmi watch or any otehr anti muslim propaganda know whose example does muslim followed the most we follow the four rightly guided caliphates as our role model not those abbasid and umaiyad who suppressed the jews like hell by teh way when you jews were persecuted in europe why the did you come and seek protection and asylum from the ottoman turks look at yourself from the mirror before you jude others by the way wikipedia is the most unscholarly source that i have ever read hahahaha go and learn about islam from a muslim scholars rather than learning from syeikh wikipedia jizyah doest not exist any more as non muslims join army as others Zia-ul-Haq's
