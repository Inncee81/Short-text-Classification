why do mormon missionaries always seem to be men in pairs and dressed in black i've yet to see a casually dressed female mormon missionary on her own or in threes for example why is that i understand the safety in numbers bit i guess it was the formal wear that they always seem to have on i would much rather be approached by someone more casually dressed i have spoken and invited mormon missionaries in my house before now but they haven't been able to convince me i am an agnostic bearing on the side of atheism thanks for all you answers some better than others i was looking for serious answers this time i am not exclusively serious all the time so bear that in mind if you answer any of my other questions because more men go on missions than girls they go when they are or older females go when they are or older they get sent all around the world one of my bros is in alabama and my other bro is going to brazil in november as to wearing church clothes its the rules except on p days which is their rest days they wear normal clothes on pdays and it is also the rules that each missionary gets a companion someone who helps teach give lessons and most companions are best friends you should get in touch with them they would be happy to find someone to teach they love to get groceries they are usually very friendly and are not alien killers they have a companion to help them teach and stuff not for their protection they can take care of themselves Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mormon missionary Missionary Book of Mormon Agnosticism Volleyball Succession crisis (Mormonism) Atheism Apostle Fundamentalism Temple garment (Mormonism) Christianity Rich Mullins Mormonism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Mormon Polygamy Pitaten Endowment (Mormonism) Trinity Swami Vivekananda Blacks and Mormonism Whose Line Is It Anyway?
