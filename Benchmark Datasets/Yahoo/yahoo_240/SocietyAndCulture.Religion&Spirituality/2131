what happens after it's all over there are those who believe in heaven and hell and that after you die you will go to either based on your behavior during your lifetime then there are those who believe in reincarnation or that death truly is the end what would your reaction be if what happens after you die turns out to be the exact opposite of what you believed while alive for christians what if there is no heaven or hell and you get reincarnated as a hippo for non believers what would your reaction be if you came face to face with god i'm just curious points will go to the most thoughtful answer unless your spelling sucks lol actually i think what would be most shocking to everyone would be if they found themselves in some sort of after life but they still weren't given all the answers to the meaning of life existence of god etc it seems like almost everyone that believes in an after life or the possibility of an after life assumes that they will find out the truth when they die however if we aren't handed all the answers in this life why should we really expect to have them all automatically answered in the next one the after life could easily be just as confusing and enigmatic as this one as for being re incarnated as a hippo as near as i can tell if re incarnation happens you don't remember your past life so all the christians would just be your typical unsurprised hippos for the non believers if they came face to face with god they would probably have a lot of questions that they would want answered such as why did you make up a religion for yourself that made no sense and if you wanted people to worship you how come you spent all of your time hiding from us so that we couldn't even tell if you existed or not if death is truly the end then obviously no one will be surprised to be surprised you probably need to exist Reincarnation Soul Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Immortality Afterlife God Religion Augustine of Hippo Book of Revelation Sin Scientology beliefs and practices Bible and reincarnation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Spiritism Eastern Orthodox Church Socrates Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Abrahamic religion Jesus Christian eschatology Ten Commandments Angel Sanctuary Heaven Incarnations of Immortality Hell Predestination Roman Catholic Church Free will Hinduism Death Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The nature of God in Western theology Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Philosophical skepticism Divine grace Summa Theologiae Kain (Legacy of Kain) Origin belief Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theory of conduct Witchcraft Atheism Original sin Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) God Emperor of Dune Urantia Justification (theology) Philosophy of religion Infant baptism Christianity Christianity and anti-Semitism Animism Creationism Criticism of Mormonism Simone Weil Evil Satan Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Fallen angel Apotheosis Flood geology Supernatural Meme Jiddu Krishnamurti Moses Purgatory Pascal's Wager New Age Karma Transcendental argument for the existence of God Religious views of suicide Saint Monotheism K' Nation of Islam The Amber Spyglass Religious pluralism Devil Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Angel Existence of God Mary, the mother of Jesus Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Icon Dualism (philosophy of mind) Phaedo Church of Christ Jehovah's Witnesses
