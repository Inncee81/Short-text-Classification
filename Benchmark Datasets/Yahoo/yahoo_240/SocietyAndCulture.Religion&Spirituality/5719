if you were once a christian what was it that made you change your mind i have always known that christianity did not accept one of my most basic beliefs reincarnation but i just figured that was because they had never really considered that it could be true if you don't look at something with an open mind than you will never really see it ultimately it was christians that repelled me specifically pentecostal fanatics since walking away i have learned so much the gnostic gospels and yeshua ben yoseph himself make much more sense to me if you look closely at the prophecies that the messiah jesus was supposed to full fill he did not full fill them all i have always believed in a higher being a loving being christians say that god is a god of love and well if this is true why does it seem that christians are very judge mental not to mention the fact that if god loves us so much why is there a hell it all just seems so hypocritical to me i love you but burn in hell don't drink but jesus drank wine do not judge oh but that is a daily occurence i think those thoughts sum up what many of us have experienced in life with the christian faith you see it is my belief that christianity has become more of a family tradition than a true conviction of faith it is believed because that is just what looks best in society at least here in the southern bible belt i am so happy to see people in this area finally start to question things as a great movement of figuring out your own convictions has taken flight here in my area and wow people just seem so much happier comfortable and well more themselves when they are able to come to their own convicitons without the powers of society dictating there faith Christianity A Course In Miracles Soul Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abrahamic religion Reincarnation Messianic Judaism Holy Spirit Fundamentalism Bible and reincarnation Eucharist Book of Mormon Religion God Biblical canon Historicity of Jesus Pentecostalism Biblical inerrancy Church of Christ, Scientist Prophet Christian views of Jesus Baptist Religious conversion Jewish Messiah Messiah Ten Commandments Church of Christ Mary, the mother of Jesus Great Apostasy Resurrection of Jesus Evangelicalism Sabbath Jewish principles of faith Baptism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Nation of Islam Restorationism Trinity John the Baptist Gospel of Thomas Priesthood (Mormonism) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eastern Orthodox Church Protestantism William M.
