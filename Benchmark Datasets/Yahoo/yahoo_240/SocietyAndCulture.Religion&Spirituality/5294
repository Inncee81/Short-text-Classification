free psychic i am going through a tough time in my life and am curious to see if a pyschic out there can help guide me or help me for free is there anybody out there that is if so what paths do you see me taking i dont usually do this but felt i needed to for you as you asked so nicely and wanted guidance and not someone to tell you what to do so just a little ok i see you looking out to another place overseas you want to escape from something at the moment and are pondering whether to literally run away from this but you are holding onto something that is keeping you from doing so this is possibly a relationship and i see two others in the past that have had you in a similar place please take some time out before you make any decisions on this though because things may not appear to be so bad in hindsight xx edit i said overseas that would most likely just be symbolic though and not a literal move W.I.T.C.H.
