we want to get married eventually but has religion come in the way my boyfriend and i met at a private church college a few years ago he is here because of his parents and i am here because i wanted church to be my life he loathes the church and many of its teachings although he grew up in it as i did i always loved the church although there were things that i didn't completely agree with that the church taught i was always happy about my spiritual life until i started to question it now i am confused about what i think vs what is influence by my boyfriend church leaders and the church school and whether i want to continue to be apart of this church thanks for all the great replies now that i read them i realize what the real issue is i have now come to realize what the church has been for me all my life it's been a safe place where i could know what to expect i wouldn't have to think for myself or stand up for myself which i am terrified of doing i want to explore other spiritual choices but i feel trapped where i am literally surround by members of this faith day in and day out and if i don't go to church i could get kicked out of school it's a good school i have a good job here and i'm almost done with school so i want to wait it out but i just don't know where to turn in the mean time this religion is all i know i seriously only have two friends that are not from church this is something you need to spend time and thnk about w o the influence of your boyfriend if he truly loves you he shouldn't care if you love church and have a strong faith whether or not u want to continue on the path you are on is up to you maybe you should sit down and think about what it is that first gave you that passion for church are those things still relevent are there more reasons good luck with everything and remember to pray in all things that you do god bless Opus Dei Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious Society of Friends Humphrey Bogart John Howard Yoder Church of Christ Christian eschatology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ, Scientist Social rule Rich Mullins Eastern Orthodox Church Shaggy dog story Predestination Past teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Martin Luther A Course In Miracles John Wesley Religious pluralism Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct EastEnders Religion Jon Secada Ten Commandments One Tree Hill (TV series) Separation of church and state Friends Boston Public Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ramakrishna Infant baptism Meaning of life Knots Landing John Wycliffe Philipp Melanchthon Salvation Fundamentalism Pitaten Jiddu Krishnamurti Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Anthroposophy Jan Hus Unitarian Universalism Piccolo Junior Saga Heaven Justification (theology) Dispensationalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The O.C.
