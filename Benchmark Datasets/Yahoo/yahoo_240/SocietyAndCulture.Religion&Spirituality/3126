the 'wanting' paradox there is a famous zen parable about a young man who went to one of the fiercer zen masters asking to be enlightened the master grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and held his head under water in the river until he was frantic for air when the master let the boy up he said when you want enlightenment as much as you wanted air just then come back and ask again ok very graphic but we are told that 'wanting' keeps us locked in the world of suffering stuck in the same old ego stuff so how can we resolve that paradox how is it possible to want it enough to do all the stuff you seem to have to do and yet be free enough of wanting to be 'shown the jewel' i sure want kensho how can that very wanting not forever exclude me ah sunman i've read all sorts of zen stories met monks and masters i've read the open secret' i really used to have a pretty good idea of what enlightenment was now i only know i want it at the moment cc wanting it enough to keep the broom moving and not wanting it so much as to lose myself in the wanting that actually is the koan right now 'my cup runneth over' hehehe wink the kindness of the sunman and yes i sure do know what you mean i would humbly submit that there is not a thing wrong with wanting enlightenment as long as the goal is sought to be of benefit to all sentient or limited beings who are blinded by ignorance and stumbling around at the edge of a huge cliff also this desire can be transmuted into the energy needed to sustain the desire after all bodhisattvas are like boxers who having this goal of defeating an opponent willingly step into the ring and get all bloodied and bruised time and again it takes a tremendous amount of courage to do this for others this altruistic wish magnified infinitely by wishing to do it for friends enemies and strangers alike even animals and beings in hells and heavens is the mind that aspires to enlightenment or bodhicitta you could attain liberation for yourself or nirvana through the practice of the three higher trainings of ethics concentration and wisdom with the latter taking as their object of observation emptiness but it would not be the unsurpassable true complete enlightenment of a buddha one would need bodhicitta to do that as only bodhicitta can eradicate the imprints of the afflictions or obstructions to omniscience furthermore just as the bird needs two wings to fly across the ocean the bodhisattva needs the two wings of method bodhicitta and wisdom the wisdom realizing emptiness to fly across the ocean of suffering to the other side buddhahood these two together are what keep you in the mahayana non abiding nirvana avoiding the extreme of peace nirvana and suffering samsara expressly for the sake of others if you plan on it taking multiple lives to accomplish this will increase your motivation and help you sustain your effort much much longer which will have the actual effect of increasing realization also it is fitting to dedicate every bit of study practice and constructive action like helping others to the great enlightenment which seals the activity and prevents it from decrease even a huge bucket will fill up one drop at a time best wishes Koan Tara (Buddhism) Hinayana Zen Nirvana Sutra Nirvana Hakuin Ekaku Buddha Faith in Buddhism Soul Meditation Bodhi Yin Shun Eastern philosophy Simone Weil Tantra Theodicy Nicomachean Ethics Merit Altruism Shunyata Theravada Nondualism Religious pluralism Advaita Vedanta Reincarnation Gautama Buddha Kukai Tathagatagarbha doctrine Goodness and value theory Idolatry Religion Sangharakshita Tibetan Buddhism Capitalism Pratitya-samutpada Karma Vipassana Hsing Yun Mantra Bhagavad Gita Perfection of Wisdom Buddhist philosophy Paradox Jodo Shinshu Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of Buddhism Wheel of life Miyamoto Musashi Ksitigarbha Summa Theologiae Anatta Theory of conduct Alignment (role-playing games) Force (Star Wars) Samsara Meaning of life John Wycliffe Alcoholics Anonymous Goldstein's book Bushido God Divine grace Satori Kadampa God in Buddhism Buddha-nature Sacrifice Tenshinhan Spiritism Transformers: Cybertron Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Stoicism Religious views of suicide Suma Ching Hai Time travel Trinity Friedrich Schleiermacher Zhao Yun Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Love Piccolo Junior Saga YuYu Hakusho Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Sigmund Freud John Howard Yoder Christian eschatology
