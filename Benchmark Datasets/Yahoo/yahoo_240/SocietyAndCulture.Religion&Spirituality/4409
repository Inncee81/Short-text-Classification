fallen angels recently whilst researching on the struggle between good and evil as put across by the bible i came across a source though i can't remember where now which stated that the original term for fallen angels was used to denote an angel who had come to earth i don't think it had any insinuation that the angel was evil until the cherub azazeal started reaping havoc by tainting others and divulging gods plans which is where azazeal was then condemned by raphael to spend eternity in darkness so does this mean that the actual term for fallen angel isn't how it was originally percieved well believer i follow neither god nor satan i am of pagan beliefs but i hold a general interest in all religions and like to know what i'm talking about as for the whole to do gods bidding satan was originally called samael in many things i have read i think he was the original angel of death so to attempt to dethrone or destroy god he was doing the exact job which god gave him just one take on it anyhow you could even insinuate that fallen angels could be referring to people Devil Satan Demon Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Angel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hell Azazel Satanism Paradise Lost Evil Idolatry Adam and Eve Angel Sanctuary Heaven Religion Trinity Predestination Resurrection of Jesus Neopaganism Original sin End times Magic (paranormal) Theology Reincarnation Gnosticism God Beelzebub Creationism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian Identity Belial The nature of God in Western theology Christian eschatology Divine grace The Fall of Man Book of Revelation Witchcraft Michael (archangel) Heresy Criticism of Mormonism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious Society of Friends Bible and reincarnation Historical persecution by Christians Karma Baptism Salvation Atheism Prophet Paganism Cherub Christian anarchism LaVeyan Satanism Human nature Hierarchy of angels Day-Age Creationism Christianity and anti-Semitism Lucifer Jesus Immortality Soul Witch-hunt Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Book of Job Demonology The Amber Spyglass Kabbalah Sin Urantia Priesthood (Mormonism) Chick Publications Religious pluralism Armageddon Fundamentalism Book of Mormon Existence of God Sabbath Ten Commandments Christian demonology Gabriel Philo Maimonides Anti-Mormonism Karma in Hinduism Abraham Emanuel Swedenborg Incarnations of Immortality Sola fide Socrates Pentagram Religious conversion
