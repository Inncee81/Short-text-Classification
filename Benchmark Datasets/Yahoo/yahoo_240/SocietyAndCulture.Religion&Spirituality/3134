an act of god so i went to cedar point today well now it's yesterday but whatever and the weather was supposed to be thunder storms off and on all day i had this planned a month in advance though so we went anyway as we were driving there a hour drive the weather was getting worse and worse so i started praying that it would clear up so we could enjoy ourselves we get there and the parking lot's flooded we go in and i'm still praying the entire way for better weather the sky becomes suddenly clear around noon and the rides start going then the weather becomes beautiful all day we go on all the rides we wanted to including the maverick awesome and then around we decide we're going to get henna tatoos and go shopping our feet are starting to get sore wet socks eugh and then the sky suddenly goes dark and it starts raining and lightning i know this wasn't a coincidence it was an act of god he was answering my prayers while we were waiting for the rain to clear up in the morning we went on the observation tower it stopped right when we were at the top broke down i prayed for it to come back down safely and also once again for the weather we stayed on it for about fifteen minutes and then it took us back down to be let off as soon as we stepped off the rain stopped and it cleared up when we were in line for the maverick the ride broke down we stuck it out in line we were there for about half an hour the line is normally an hour and fifteen minutes it started back up and we got on fast i prayed hard that it wouldn't break down while we were on it because it had been on the fritz all day we went on it with no problems and then we walked over to the mean streak which had no line as we were getting on the lady running the ride said that the maverick was down we had just gotten off everything here is true and it may seem like a coincidence but i don't think it is no this isn't a selfish post i'm saying that jesus blessed my day and i'm thanking him for it by telling everyone what he did for me today he is awesome ok another one the water company in our small town had been sold to another town last year the other town has people who are anxious to make a lot of money so they started charging our town x and more a water rate so high that our whole town couldn't afford to water our lawns wash our cars or even let the children play in the water last summer two people received water bills of over each many of the people in our town became angry hired an attorney and badmouthed the water company my husband and i and several other people prayed we asked god to give our town control of the water company so that our bills would not be so high well he answered our prayer by making out lawn watering this summer free he sent us rain nearly every day for the months of may june and july which is very unusual for texas because it hardly ever rains in the summer here i have also noticed on the water rates that they are much lower the water pressure is better and the quality of the water is much better this year god gave us a better answer than we had asked him for we thank him for this prayer to him works because he loves us Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Mercury Atlas 6 EastEnders Operation Market Garden Indianapolis 500 2004 World Series Time Out of Mind Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina New York Giants Episodes of Lost (Season 1) USS Tunny (SS-282) Cliff Richard Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Paul Is Dead John the Baptist Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Sant Thakar Singh 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Oasis (band) USS Trigger (SS-237) 2005 World Series The nature of God in Western theology Boom Town (Doctor Who) Weather lore The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Fiddler on the Roof USS Whale (SS-239) Climate of the United Kingdom Roswell UFO incident Fasting Diwali One Tree Hill (TV series) 2003 North America blackout Elis Prefecture Theodicy Climate of Salt Lake City Rain Man Heinkel He 112 National Weather Service Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks 24 (television) Escape from New York Jacob Mother Teresa 2004 Atlantic hurricane season The Family from One End Street Grandview, U.S.A.
