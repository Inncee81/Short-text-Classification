is anyone else sick of lies just wondering if anyone else out there is sick and tired of all the lies they've been told alll their lives nothing you read is 'true' nothing you watch on tv is true nothing's true not even bibles and other various holy books which were written by men imposing as 'god's messengers prophets apostles etc so i wonder if there's any hope for any of us to find our way out of the maze of deceit and if god exists then i can't see a just god throwing anyone in hell for being lied to yes but there's two different truths that you are referring to here there's sensationalistic truth which is geared towards getting a reaction out of you like media gosip or entertainment it's a machine that feeds people emotional side like caffeine in the morning people love controversy and the media capitalizes on it the second truth you're referring to here is the truth of existence why are we here is there a god is there an afterlife these are questions that people often have a great doubt in but preach to others to relinquish this doubt they aren't lying to you because they actually believe or want to believe what they're telling you is true from what i've seen people have the capacity to see truth within themselves and that religion only confuses us from seeing this truth there will come a time again when someone will see outside of the confusion and it's that person who can change the world Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urantia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Soul Book of Mormon Priesthood (Mormonism) Ten Commandments Second Vatican Council Mormonism and Christianity Simone Weil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Biblical canon Roman Catholic Church Resurrection of Jesus A Course In Miracles Prophet Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Salvation Opus Dei Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bible and reincarnation God Phaedo Sola fide Charles Darwin's views on religion New Testament John Wesley Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Christian eschatology Apostle The Amber Spyglass Theodicy John Howard Yoder Buddhism Merit Religious pluralism Trinity Mormonism Sant Thakar Singh Angel Bible Alan Campbell (pastor) Afterlife Sabbath Historicity of Jesus Maimonides Book of Isaiah Jehovah's Witnesses Gospel of Thomas Holy Spirit Divine grace Charles Grandison Finney Jewish principles of faith The Pilgrim's Progress Criticism of Mormonism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Judaism Love Religious conversion C.
