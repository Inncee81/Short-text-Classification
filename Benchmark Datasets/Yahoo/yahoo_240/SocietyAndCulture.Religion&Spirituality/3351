tanks bombs abortions and bombs over baghdad yes my last question was a lot tasteless the thing i found most disconcerting was when i asked people atheists if it was okay to have an abortion against the father of the baby's will people said it was okay to have an abortion even if the father wanted to keep it their reasons pointed to it being the woman's body and that the man should have known the woman's viewpoint before having had sex with her oh my what such horrible people i am pro choice and understand people make mistakes i also understand that people get raped and incest occurs these cases are especially justified to have abortions but if the father of my baby wanted to keep it i would take it into very serious consideration and probably carry it people do make mistakes but people can also change their minds if they were irresponsible making the baby some will take responsibility caring for it how could you abort in this circumstance isn't that heartless and if you did have the abortion against the father's wishes if he would make a good father then i believe that woman shouldn't be allowed to have kids ever again because there is no excuse for stupidity what do you think and i wasn't referring to the father in rape or incest cases they should have no say in such matters daddy has some billion other sperm cells he can wait but if the father of my baby wanted to keep it i would take it into very serious consideration and probably carry it i didn't say the mother wouldn't shouldn't consider it but in the end it remains her choice Abortion debate Abortion Abortion in the United States Theory of conduct EastEnders Incest Religion and abortion Theodicy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pro-choice Androgen insensitivity syndrome Rick Santorum Rape Social rule Birth control Shaggy dog story Kyle Broflovski Sexual intercourse Religion and sexuality Margaret Sanger Intact dilation and extraction Identity Crisis (comics) Lawrence v.
