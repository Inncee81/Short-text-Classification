in your opinion do you think everyone can love the emotion of your heart angels the devil humans whats your opinion can anyone or spirit love someone i've been told anyone can do so but i'm not so sure because for example the devil is evil and is said to have no mercy but when he was an angel wasn't he was capable of loving like as in to love god can that still be possible and i heard angels cannot love or from some that angels can such as in they love god but i mean the love like feelings as in uh romantic love so do you think anyone can love what are your opinions when i say love in this question situation i mean love as in the emotion from your heart for someone or the love like how you feel for someone not sex the bible says god is love i take this as meaning that when we experience love we experience little bit of god when one is totally separated from god there will be no such experience satan is in that state as sin and god can't mix then the second question how could those who reject god in this world experience love i believe we all experience god some more intimately than others while in this world in our final judgment though to those who reject god will have no sign of god in his life that for me is hell Hell Evil Paradise Lost God Salvation Sola fide Sin Religion Love Demon Satan Fallen angel A Course In Miracles Charles Grandison Finney Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) John the Baptist Soul Liberal Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual orientation Qiyamah Total depravity Adam and Eve Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Heaven Trinity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sinfest Last Judgment Book of Mormon Holy Spirit Ten Commandments Predestination Summa Theologiae Virgin Mary in Islam Antichrist Eastern Orthodox Church Reincarnation Michael (archangel) The Amber Spyglass Sexuality in Christian demonology Problem of Hell Israel ben Eliezer Satanism Incarnations of Immortality Slow Train Coming Jewish principles of faith Philipp Melanchthon Human sexual behavior Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theodicy Children of God Ascetical theology Christian eschatology Purgatory Perseverance of the saints Repentance Mortification of the flesh Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Merit Church of Christ, Scientist Supernatural Zohar Predestination (Calvinism) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Angel Sanctuary Belial Afterlife Mormonism Angels in Islam The nature of God in Western theology Mary, the mother of Jesus Theology Duties of the Heart Grimke Sisters Demonology Resurrection of Jesus Bhajan Christian anarchism Divine grace S__ren Kierkegaard Urantia Baptism Elvis Presley Zoophilia William M.
