catholic priests is it normal for a man priest or not to never have a wife this question has always puzzled me i have always wondered why the catholic church doesn't allow priests to marry i think it is the most natural thing in the world for a man to have a wife and family my pastor has a wife and two beautiful children non catholic of course this is not an insult to any catholics i have very good friends of many different religions serious answers only please i suppose that's a silly thing to say on here but i can only hope thanks for your info so it is only in the last couple of hundred years that this has been a rule i would agree that catholic priests should be able to marry and have children and to maybe raise some more priests and nuns you would think that they would want to have children to bring up in the catholic way intriguing thanks for all of your comments so far midge good answer i'm not criticising the priests at all and i do understand the vows that nuns and priests alike have taken there are sooo many catholics including myself that think priests should be allowed to marry but ya it's so they focus on god Clerical celibacy Roman Catholic Church Eastern Orthodox Church Marriage Priest Nun Opus Dei Catechism Holy Orders Justification (theology) Christian monasticism Minister of religion Ordination of women Martin Luther Clergy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Same-sex marriage The nature of God in Western theology Sharon Tate Traditionalist Catholic Paul of Tarsus Incarnations of Immortality Catholicism Anglicanism Little Britain Leviathan (book) Christian view of marriage John Wycliffe Sacrifice Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Exorcism Eucharist Salvation Monk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bishop Papal Infallibility Baptism Catholic sacraments Plenary Councils of Baltimore Rick Santorum Monasticism Sola fide Th__r__se de Lisieux Rich Mullins Criticisms of Christianity Trinity Culture of Lithuania Joke Leonard Feeney Chastity Evolutionary creationism Friedrich Schleiermacher Merit Christianity William the Silent Anti-Catholicism God Emperor of Dune Socrates Deacon Birth control Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity Atomism Religion and sexuality Counter-Reformation Infant baptism Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Nation of Islam Theory of conduct Mary, the mother of Jesus Charismatic Alan Campbell (pastor) John Knox Original sin Father Separation of church and state Gautama Buddha Religion Animism Protestantism 613 mitzvot Logic Augsburg Confession Pope Pius X Atheism Father Ted Genesis Frank Herbert Mennonite Fundamentalism Pope John Paul I John the Baptist Education The Two Babylons Second Vatican Council
