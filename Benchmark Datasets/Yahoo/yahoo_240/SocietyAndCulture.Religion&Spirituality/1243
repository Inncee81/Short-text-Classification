do green witch's believe in the christian god i am trying to understand a woman who claims to be a witch yet also claims that of course she believes in the christian god so i guess i'm asking based on her discussion with me do all green witches or witches of any type pick and choose what parts of christianity they believe she says that she follows no set of rules like any church has such as she doesn't do the fold kiss but does think she'll see god on judgment day and enter heaven summerland she adds the slash what is up with that i really don't understand how she can flip flop and then become so upset when i ask her to explain it any witches want to help thanks green witches usually believe in the forest god not the christian god that is a bit unusual but paganism is open hearted and open minded it really doesnt make sense to me either but who am i to judge and i think your friend is flip flopping because deep down in side she is afraid of being judged in the afterlife i certainly think its a bit hypocritical myself Salvation Witch-hunt Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Witchcraft Ten Commandments Hansel und Gretel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Homosexuality and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Rich Mullins Heaven Atheism Prophet Religion A Course In Miracles Witch trial Afterlife Qiyamah Neopaganism Eastern Orthodox Church Emanuel Swedenborg Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Theology Immortality Soul Theodicy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Christian eschatology Hades Christianity Angel The McGuire Sisters Reincarnation Trinity The nature of God in Western theology Roman Catholic Church God Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Sabbath Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Saint Hell Priesthood (Mormonism) Idolatry Year of the Spider Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Calvinism Wicca She Loves You Poker jargon Abrahamic religion Book of Revelation Names of God in Judaism Book of Isaiah Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Church of Christ, Scientist C.
