serious question for once do you think it's true that some people do indeed need a religion to live their lives in a morally acceptable way and if you do what do you think it is about those people that causes them to need it i've wondered about this lately and to be honest i'm not sure what i think about it thanks that's exactly what i'm wondering bula'ia aratyme why do some people believe they need it and if one believes that to be true about him herself then perhaps it is i suppose my question isn't very clear i wish you'd give me your thoughts on it because i've seen some great answers from you and i'm sure i'd appreciate your insight oops wondering about ramjet hmmmm i can think of cases were eastern religion makes people more moral because it urges them to be compassionate and seek inner peace but monotheism islam christianity judaism seems different to me if only i could remember the person who said it one of the enlightenment era thinkers said don't tell the servants there is no god they'll steal the silverware if you're a medieval serf religion might help you be happy with your station in life as inequitable as it is because it has the promise of equality in the afterlife similarly it's no coincidence that as soon as african slaves were imported into the united states their masters indoctrinated them with christianity for the same reason the promise that the first shall be last and the last shall be first whenever i look for times when christianity makes people be moral i find that it does make them nonviolent but often in situations where violence would have been justified the violence of the french revolution was justified because the french proletariat had no meaningful political power in the estates general although i don't think the tax collectors should have been burned alive but in equitable societies like present day france or present day sweden people are very non violent without religion in fact they are generally moral without religion even in the puritanical sense of the word there is more teen pregnancy in the united states than any other industrialized country so no i don't think so if people needed religion to be moral then japan sweden france etc wouldn't be so moral religion might help people be passive but in the grand scheme of things that isn't necessarily moral again with my example the french revolution violent as it was paved the way for equality and dignity for millions of people Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ten Commandments Pacifism Christianity Religious pluralism Nonviolence Supernatural Abortion debate Feminism Christian anarchism The nature of God in Western theology Abrahamic religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Predestination Republic Evil Liberalism Goodness and value theory Philosophy of religion Meaning of life Islamic philosophy Jewish principles of faith Philosophy Sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Roman Catholic Church Ethics Judaism Buddhism Moses Karl Marx Satanism Mahatma Gandhi Fundamentalism Hell Sexual abstinence Scientology beliefs and practices Divine grace Reincarnation Saint Human Creationism Coercion Afterlife Separation of church and state Soul Property (ownership right) Nihilism Christian apologetics Slavery Jewish eschatology Confucius Moral objectivism Religion and sexuality Anarchism Jew Social justice Feminist movement Theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Philipp Melanchthon Meme Jiddu Krishnamurti John Locke Nation of Islam Ethics in religion Capitalism Confucianism Phaedo Immanuel Kant Conservatism Simone Weil Rastafari movement Ontological argument Capital punishment Peter Singer Existence of God Polygamy School of Salamanca Friedrich Schleiermacher Religion and abortion Same-sex marriage Islam as a political movement
