why do muslim women keep insisting they have equal rights to men in the quran which is not true here are a few examples were men have more rights than women man has a degree over women sura witness of women equals that of man sura inheritance of women equals that of man men are stronger righteous women are obedient sura women are asked to stay quietly in houses etc men are the protectors and maintainers of women etc women are a tilt for men to cultivate etc men can marry more than one times but women cannot sura etc men can beat their women wives et men can divorce women the quran does not prescribe rules for women to divorce honestly who are the muslim women fooling you can fool only uneducated people who can't read the quran why don't muslim women in the west stop lying and claim that they are subservient to men and allah enough is enough doesn't quran forbid lying i think i conveyed my message wrongly i was arguing saying muslim women in the west keep saying quran gives men and women equal rights but it clearly does not and in countries where shariah exist women have no rights because the quran is the law so if muslim women in the west say quran gives equal rights to men and women then they are doing a disservice to women in islamic countries muslim women in the west are protected by the secular laws while women in islamic countries are not so muslim women in the west should stop lying they're told from a young age that they need protection from the big strong men and after a while they start to believe it even though it is of course false same reason christian women used to buy into the sexist system Sharia Islam Apostasy in Islam Qur'an Women in Islam Criticism of Islam Talaq (Nikah) Dhimmi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Muhammad Fundamentalism Marriage Mary, the mother of Jesus Virgin Mary in Islam Historical persecution by Muslims Chosen people Islam and anti-Semitism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Sunni Islam Polygamy Salah Islamic view of marriage Ten Commandments Religious conversion Hijab Liberal movements within Islam Abrahamic religion Prophet Islam in France Isa Hizb ut-Tahrir French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Same-sex marriage Abraham Israeli Arab Prophets of Islam Nikah Mut'ah Homosexuality and Islam God Original sin Alawite Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Mufti Yusuf al-Qaradawi Clergy Religious pluralism Religion and sexuality Hadith Intercession of saints Divorce United Submitters International Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Islamic fundamentalism Separation of church and state Ramadan Battle of Badr Kemal Atat__rk Magic (paranormal) Caliph Liberalism Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization Status of religious freedom in Sudan Sin Isra and Mi'raj Religion Aisha Homosexuality Arab-Israeli conflict Succession to Muhammad Basra Feminism Honor killing Capitalism Domestic violence Federal Marriage Amendment Accession of Turkey to the European Union Babylonian law Heresy Judaism Angels in Islam Islam in Egypt Predestination Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Satanism Confucianism Conservatism Sex segregation Muslim ibn Aqeel Holy Spirit
