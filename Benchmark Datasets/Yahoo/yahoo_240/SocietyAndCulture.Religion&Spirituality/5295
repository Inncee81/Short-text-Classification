what is witnessing and how does it work witnessing is the act of bearing witness in court a witness tells what they saw witnessing in a christian sense is to tell others what we have seen jesus do in our lives sharing the good news telling our story some groups like to go door to door and tell the story of jesus and try to convert people but for me i like to just live my life and talk about the things that i do just like everyone else does it i just happen to have jesus interacting with me on a regular basis and i share that with my friends coworkers whoever if i believe that he has supplied me with money for something i needed i state that when i tell somebody about it i bear witness to god's goodness in my life when i am around people i hope that my actions and attitudes reflect god's goodness and people will want to know him because of the good fruit they see in my life Religious Society of Friends Trinity Sola fide Holy Spirit Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses The Pilgrim's Progress Salvation Chosen people Jehovah's Witnesses Original sin Religious conversion Christianity C.
