if joel osteen charles stanley benny hinn bill keller joyce meyer were in the big brother house who wins it would be good to see how people like this would act in a house like the big brother house away from anyone else for so long true colors would show and i bet a lot more people would respect joel osteen and see benny hinn for what he is a false hope merchant i love and enjoy sermons and bible life studies offered by joel osteen charles stanley joyce meyer john hagee dr price dr tony evans adrian rogers now deceased beth moore dr jeremiah on a weekly basis but i know and they willingly profess confess that they none of them are perfect human beings most of their speeches and sermons include personal stories of relating their own incidences of shortcomings and how they admit them and strive to overcome them what many forget is that man may not see everything we think say or do but almighty god sees everything nothing is hidden from almighty god as a christian we strive to remember that strive to live our public and private lives so that almighty god will be pleased with us i think it would be more telling and more honestly representative of their christian walk when it showed how they dealt with every day situations and when they failed to behave as almighty god would wish if they were instantly contrite and repentant rather than seeking to cover up or dismiss or ignore their human failings Eastern Orthodox Church John Howard Yoder Perseverance of the saints Lakewood Church Joel Osteen Prophet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trinity Confession Benny Hinn Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sermon on the Mount Salvation Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) John the Baptist Baptism A Course In Miracles Divine grace Word of faith Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Sola fide Athanasian Creed Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Charles Darwin's views on religion Duties of the Heart Sabbath Tridentine Mass John Wesley Holy Spirit Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ex-gay Friedrich Schleiermacher Justification (theology) Total depravity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Roman Catholic Church Religion Dispensationalism Idolatry Megachurch Soul Charles Grandison Finney Book of Mormon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Angel Church of Christ Origin belief Emanuel Swedenborg Altruism Philipp Melanchthon Christianity Immortality Islam Mormonism and Christianity John Wycliffe Opus Dei Indulgence Girls Aloud Articles of Religion (Methodist) Baptist The Catcher in the Rye Evil Fasting V (TV series) Apocalyptic literature Judaism Alan Campbell (pastor) Merit Ten Commandments Theory of conduct Christian-Jewish reconciliation Names of God in Judaism Calvinism Great Apostasy Resurrection of Jesus Abraham Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Halakha Sydney Riot of 1879 613 mitzvot Christian perfection Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Socrates Mass (liturgy) Charles I of England Religious Society of Friends Fred Phelps Mortification of the flesh Gospel of Thomas
