is christianity the number one religion of manipulation does it take the cake for manipulation of the masses its based on a concept of believe or burn how is that for an argument without any proof so it presents people with a flawed either or concept between amazing infinite life and horrible infinite torture is this perhaps the saddest form of human manipulation in all of history i have seen several answers in which believers have said it is impossible to make someone believe lol well that may be so but it is damn sure possible to make them say that they believe all you've got to do is look at the history of christianity to see that oh wait a minute i'm sorry i forgot that is asking too much most christians haven't got a clue about the real history of their religion they just believe on faith and take as fact all the lies distortions and misconceptions that are fed to them without question the truth is that during the ascendancy of christianity they forced the population of a whole continent to say that they believed under pain of torture and death it was very much like the borg on star trek ng you will be assimilated resistance is futile after a few generations actual belief finally took hold because there were no alternatives christianity had utterly destroyed all 'tainted' knowledge that being all knowledge that did not conform to church dogma this of course is why humanity descended into the dark ages over a thousand years of deprivation and enforced ignorance courtesy of christianity now christianity is at it again threatening very quietly by tricking 'moderate' christians into achieving political objectives under cover of a religious agenda to drag us into a new dark ages look up 'dominionism' be afraid be very afraid they can't help it christians who go about 'spreading the word' are totally oblivious that their own gullibility and lack of discernment has resulted in their having been unwittingly sucked up into a huge conspiratorial criminal business enterprise the most successful multi level marketing mlm scam of all time they have no awareness at all that their 'prostletizing' is nothing more than a key component of the marketing plan which was instituted after the age of enlightenment kicked in and secular knowledge and ethics deprived christianity of the political power that had previously allowed them to simply torture and kill anybody who did not comply now they attempt to just pester people to death through sheer persistence and obnoxiousness selling eternal life is an unbeatable business with no customers ever asking for their money back after the goods are not delivered victor j stenger businesses may come and go but religion will last forever for in no other endeavor does the consumer blame himself for product failure harvard lamphoon doon paraphrase Existence of God Religion Atheism Intelligent design Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Hell Religious pluralism A Course In Miracles Creationism Resurrection of Jesus Meaning of life Goodness and value theory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul S__ren Kierkegaard Anti-Semitism Reincarnation Postmodernity God Christian eschatology Friedrich Schleiermacher Theodicy Divine grace Karl Marx Philosophy of mathematics Simone Weil Urantia Kain (Legacy of Kain) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gnosticism Apologetics Science Cult Opus Dei Social justice Abortion debate Afterlife Trinity Satanism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mind control Separation of church and state Supernatural Origin belief Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mythology Coercion Merit Conspiracy theory Intelligent design movement Deconstruction Victor Cousin Buddhism Human nature Presuppositional apologetics Pyramid scheme John Wycliffe Philipp Melanchthon Borg Jewish principles of faith Creation-evolution controversy Human Heretics of Dune Predestination Fundamentalism Dark Ages Roman Catholic Church Age of Enlightenment Conservatism Star Trek: Enterprise Jews in the Middle Ages Protestantism Advaita Vedanta Eastern Orthodox Church John Howard Yoder Eastern philosophy Anthroposophy Creation science Summa Theologiae Theology Capitalism Ten Commandments Justification (theology) Heaven Free will Evangelicalism Phaedo Heresy Sin City The nature of God in Western theology Bertrand Russell Epistemology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief
