how would you describe the difference between earthly temporal wisdom and divine eternal wisdom to start out earthly wisdom seems to be about observable consequenses trial and error etc and divine wisdom is much deeper also with eternal perspective empathy is talked about a lot these days in psycology as well earthly wisdom and or what is one of your favorite scriptures on wisdom and why i posted this question earlier today but only received answers i guess it was too early i also reworded the question please provide examples well temporal earthly wisdom is unreliable human wisdom changes with the times and depending where a particular society lives take for example a recent example the renowned child psychologist spock told new parents it was bad to discipline children it stifled their growth physically and emotionally etc he later had to recant that bit of wisdom when he came to the realization that lack of discipline had bred a bunch of out of control teens etc divine wisdom is eternal because the one who gives us that wisdom is eternal and because he knows humans better than we know ourselves despite what many say the wisdom of the bible is as valid today as it was when first written that is after all the way it was intended ps i missed the part about a good scripture describing wisdom another answer found a good one thanks james btw congrats on getting more hits on your question this go round Religion Soul Predestination Urantia Creationism Bible A Course In Miracles Merit Trinity God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philo Human Reincarnation Numerology Sin Roman Catholic Church Simone Weil Salvation Hinduism John Wycliffe Meaning of life Biblical inerrancy Friedrich Schleiermacher Sola fide Zohar Creation-evolution controversy Sri Aurobindo Philosophy Historicity of Jesus Divine grace Psychology Prayer Theodicy Four Quartets New Testament Biblical canon Jehovah's Witnesses Fallacy Immortality Resurrection of Jesus Theory of conduct Western philosophy Meister Eckhart Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Buddhism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hell Angel Meditation Socrates Church of Christ, Scientist Justification (theology) Pseudoscience Autism Demon Discordianism Consciousness Time travel Time Children of God Abrahamic religion God and gender Duties of the Heart The nature of God in Western theology Qur'an Christianity and anti-Semitism Sant Mat Ethics Kuzari Summa Theologiae Apocrypha Jewish principles of faith Martin Luther Gnosticism Christianity Second language acquisition History of Christianity Reinhold Niebuhr Spanking Empathy Love Fundamentalism John Howard Yoder Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Jesus Creation according to Genesis Child sexuality Perseverance of the saints Emanuel Swedenborg Philosophy of mathematics Church of Christ Esotericism Evil Tao Te Ching Word of Wisdom
