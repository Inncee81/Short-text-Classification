what are the noahide laws and how are they different from the mosaic law also what is the attraction that causes someone to become a noahide is it considered a religion or simply a way of life the noachide laws are very basic there are only seven of them they are to believe in god only no idol worship to respect and praise god not to commit murder not to commit adultery or similar sexual sins not to steal not to eat the limb from a living animal to establish courts of law these are the basic ideas that we as jews believe that all righteous people must follow they are different from the mosaic laws first because they existed before moses also there are mosaic law that the jewish people are bound to obey although not all laws apply to all individuals depending on the situation we believe that only the jews are bound by the mosaic laws and that god does not require that obedience from others some who consider themselves b'nai noach consider this to be a religion others take it more broadly as a lifestyle there are no rules and no right or wrong for that although certainly seeking out others with similar beliefs helps people in many ways Ten Commandments Halakha Paul of Tarsus Abrahamic religion Jewish views of religious pluralism Proselyte Jewish principles of faith Pharisees Religion Who is a Jew?
