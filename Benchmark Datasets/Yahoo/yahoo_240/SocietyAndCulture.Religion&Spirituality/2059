pentacostals has anyone ever had someone prophecy over a person and the prophecy is god is going to do a great work in you i have heard pastors say that to several people i knew and once we had a prophet come to our church at least he claimed to be a prophet and i noticed that all his prophecies were vague like that i'm not knocking the gift of prophecy i believe in the gifts of the holy spirit i think that god is going to do a great work in every believer i think that is such a very vague prophecy that no one could ever pinpoint or prove wrong i think the people who prophecy like that are just trying to prophecy broadly because they don't have a real prophecy from god if someone prophesies over you and you don't feel a stirring in your spirit then i would ignore it god will let you know it is for real or not i know a young girl that was told one time her new husband was on his way to get ready this girl while beautiful in god's eyes was a large plain girl and not very interesting no boy had probably ever looked at her twice she took this so to heart she went out and bought a bridal chest and filled it full of things for her wedding i watched her get more and more depressed over the next few months her love didn't come and the last i heard she is still single this did have an effect on her faith i just know it i thought it was a cruel thing to do but maybe the one doing it really believed they had that message for her we have to be careful with our spiritual gifts and don't misuse them and make sure before you do anything that it is really coming from god and not your own mind on the good side i know a young man who was told he was going to be a great preacher when he grew up he was he was my pastor when i got saved and the best pracher i have ever heard Pentecostalism Prophet Book of Mormon Priesthood (Mormonism) Book of Isaiah Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prophecy William M.
