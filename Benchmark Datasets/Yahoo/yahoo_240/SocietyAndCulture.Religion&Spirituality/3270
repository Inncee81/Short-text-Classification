do you think i d intelligent design should be taught in schools as a counter thought to evolution if educational institutions are going to evoke responses from students that are not one sided why is it such a bad idea to teach i d intelligent design as a counter position to evolution i am a public school teacher and also a former pastor i have a good theological education as well as a good secular education in educational policy and polity the problem with intelligent design curriculum is that it is very in your face towards the other view points the best way to look at the situation is that if you are enrolled in a public school they are normally going to do all they can through the curriculum to give credit to anyone except god the other side wants to just present the biblical account the two have no conscenus or common ground so intelligent design and the curriculums i have seen have no common ground with evolution most state curriculum's for science require a teaching of evolution but not to any extent so the thing to do is attack the darwinist right where he ticks in the basis for his argument the most famous darwinist who has ever lived is a dead man named dr jay gould he has said on many occasions and you can quote him that it takes just as much faith to believe either in an intelligent creator god or to believge in any scheme of evolutionary science with that key understoond and respected then the biblical teacher can stand and teach faith in a biblical creator and the darwinist in his missing link and man from monkeys it is my opion that the correct teaching of both all positions is the strongest argumment for day litteral creation as the bible states darwinism defies logic and reason all that to say this no the current curriculum is to narrow and not headed at the target of faith to communicate its point as a viable alternative to darwinism and evolution the real counter position is not id but biblical creation a couple of really good books on the subject and how to attack this problem darwin on trial by phillip e johnson and the face that hides the farce of evolution by hank hannagraf great question Phillip E.
