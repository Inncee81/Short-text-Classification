what came first the chiken or the egg there is a proven answer best answer foes to first one right who cares that i spelled chicken wrong im tired chickens evolved from non chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female dna or by mutations to the dna that produced the zygote these changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created that is two non chickens mated and the dna in their new zygote contained the mutation s that produced the first true chicken that one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken prior to that first true chicken zygote there were only non chickens the zygote cell is the only place where dna mutations could produce a new animal and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg so the egg must have come first Sexual reproduction Chimera (genetics) Meiosis Cancer Twin Mutation Sexual differentiation Morphogenesis Chicken Cloning Alternation of generations Ovum Senescence Egg (biology) Mitosis Animal Biological life cycle In vitro fertilisation Gamete The chicken or the egg Bird Cell (biology) Meme Embryogenesis DNA Species Evolution Carcinogenesis Lac operon Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Human Cell growth X chromosome Alien races from the Godzilla films Spermatozoon Ploidy Kiwi Y chromosome Macroevolution Human skin color Molecular evolution Cell division Pregnancy (mammals) Pregnancy Polymerase chain reaction Mitochondrial DNA Ovary Dinosaur Genetic code Chlorophyta Gene Egg (food) Prisoner's dilemma Telomerase T-Virus Drosophila melanogaster Transposon Genetically modified organism Mitochondrial genetics Cheetah History of evolutionary thought Spider Price equation Genetic engineering Antiretroviral drug Crohn's disease Human cloning Platypus Cellular differentiation Tay-Sachs disease Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000) Vitamin C Reverse genetics Chemotherapy Scientific method Genetic disorder Stomach cancer Color blindness Fetal development American lobster RNA Parkinson's disease Sadako Yamamura Mesothelioma Tumor Stem cell Virus Polycystic kidney disease Biology Menstrual cycle Mosquito P53 Spanish flu Red Junglefowl Apoptosis
