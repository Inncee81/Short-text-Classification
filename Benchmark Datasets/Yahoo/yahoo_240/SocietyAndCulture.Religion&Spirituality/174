atheists why do you deem the question does god exist to be meaningful there is one thing christians and atheists have in common that is they both deem the question does god exist to be meaningful something that is either true or false positivists on the other hand take a completely different approach i m an atheists btw but the positivist stance is compelling anway they contend the question does god exist is altogether meaningless after all is not a priori or posterori proposition something that can be known prior to or after sense experience example i tell you that i am imagining a blue mermaid with a yellow hat how do you know what i have going on inside my brain perhaps i am imagining a brazillan mommy walking on the beach maybe i am imagining nothing whatever is the case to you the statement that i am imagining such and such is altogether meaningless while the agnostic might say it is unknowable they still contend the statement is either true or false when in fact to you it is altogether meaningless do u agree with the positiv given a million possible worlds with a million differences each there's at least one god that's compatible with that type of world for that reason the question is meaningless since we cannot disprove all possible gods however against a clearly defined notion of god which your question did not stipulate this question is not meaningless at all since god is supposed to exist outside of human beings and his followers make claims that he is leaving evidence all over the world Atheism Agnosticism Existence of God Epistemology Religion Theodicy Strong atheism The nature of God in Western theology Afterlife Existentialism Falsifiability Ontological argument Transcendental argument for the existence of God Metaphysics Bertrand Russell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scientific method God Nontheism Deconstruction Postmodernism Free will Meaning of life G__del's incompleteness theorem Supernatural Goodness and value theory Theology Moral relativism David Hume Meaning Creationism Normal distribution Martin Heidegger Charles Darwin's views on religion Evolutionary creationism Christianity Science Pseudoscience S__ren Kierkegaard Determinism Willard Van Orman Quine Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Creation-evolution controversy Existence Soul Fundamentalism Analytic philosophy Ethics Friedrich Schleiermacher Biblical inerrancy Trinity Abortion debate A priori Altruism Objectivist philosophy Intelligent design movement Human nature The relationship between religion and science Critique of Pure Reason Psychology Simone Weil Logic A Course In Miracles History of creationism Empiricism Ignosticism Alcoholics Anonymous Theistic realism Modal logic Karl Popper Flood geology Moral objectivism Presuppositional apologetics Reality William A.
