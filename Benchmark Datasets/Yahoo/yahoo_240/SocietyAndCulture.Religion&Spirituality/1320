to dear christians and other non muslims would you accept my appreciation lately and almost always i have noticed that people often post questions trying to emphasize the gap between faiths asking such questions as do you hate this faith or that faith it's surprising to me that so many folks out there would rather spend their time magnifying hatred as hatred is always easier to justify but i have noticed many good christians and others as well defending their faith in good manner by showing love towards muslims and i wanted to thank you i would also like to ask what you think can be done in order to educate people on tolerance what do you do when you see people of your faith any faith discriminating others and to everyone else who reads this islam teaches me to love and respect everyone would you help me in making this place a bit more welcoming after all think about it we wont be around forever shouldn't we spend our time being the best towards others peace love moonlit if each muslim could be as attentive to the quran as you and as alert to its deeper messages then i would have said the shahada long ago myself i wish that more christians would also pay attention to the root messages of christ that when another person is mean it doesn't justify my being mean that i should love my neighbor as myself i have often said that the only way to understand a culture is through immersion when it becomes part of your life you learn and adapt because that's what your brain is designed to do but with so many people so removed from the middle east crisis islam etc they don't have a reason to learn so they don't i'll even admit to the same mentality until islam showed up on my doorstep i never had a reason to learn it i even held a sense of bitterness toward not just for the actions but for the society i lived in when i lived in jiddah as a child being forced to take the time to learn and adapt has opened my mind to the possibility that there are alternative ways to find god in my life and to live in emulation of the love he has for me so while i am confused as to the practice of faith my faith is as strong as it has ever been some days though i want to pull people who profess a faith aside and smack them with their scripture and ask if they've bothered to read it lately in islam according to the quran in christianity according to the bible there is no place for the violence hatred and bitterness that we have allowed to grow and thrive in this world Christianity Islam God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Nation of Islam Ten Commandments Jewish principles of faith Evil Religious Society of Friends Religious conversion Predestination Fundamentalism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Sin Qur'an Infant baptism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Separation of church and state Mary, the mother of Jesus Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John Howard Yoder InterFaith Anti-Defamation League Theodicy Jewish views of religious pluralism Criticism of Islam Salvation Community of Christ Justification (theology) Homosexuality and Christianity Filioque clause Evolutionary creationism Theology Prophet Church of Christ Theory of conduct Idolatry Eastern Orthodox Church Summa Theologiae Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Atheism Criticisms of Christianity Evangelicalism Conservatism Satanism Persecution of Christians Baptism Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Muhammad Virgin Mary in Islam Saint Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Roman Catholic Church Christianity and anti-Semitism Religion and sexual orientation Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sola fide Original sin Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pacifism A Course In Miracles Jehovah's Witnesses Christian anarchism Polygamy Mahatma Gandhi Christian eschatology Baptist Islamic philosophy Protestantism Second Vatican Council Chosen people Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Trinity Abrahamic religion Pope Benedict XVI Rudolf Steiner Arab-Israeli conflict Women in Islam John Wycliffe Ramadan God and gender Emanuel Swedenborg Merit Holy Spirit Cult Abraham Charles Grandison Finney Historical persecution by Muslims Prayer Apologetics
