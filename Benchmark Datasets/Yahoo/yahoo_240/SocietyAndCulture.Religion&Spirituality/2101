which of the apocrypha are interesting and worth reading the apocrypha are books in the christian tradition but not necessarily accepted and not part of the bible but there seems to be tonnes of apocrypha so can someone recommend which of them is interesting that is interesting more from a philosophical and historical rather than religious perspective and editions in english of good translations or other stuff also welcome okay you are correct when you say there are 'tons' of books that are 'called' apocrypha' but there are actually only eight books that are considered to be 'apocrypha' to the bible and they are all 'good reading' many from the female point of view which may be why they were 'omitted' from the 'regular bible since that was decided by all males the 'best translation' is the new jerusalem bible it's a 'translation' that is done in 'modern english' from the 'original aramaic and greek' editions of the bible i have 'totally different' translations of the bible in english and while i am a catholic i still think that the king james translation protestant bible when i was growing up is the 'best' because it's the most 'poetic' but when i am 'reading the bible' i get all translations out and read them all 'verse by verse' so that i can 'understand' what is being said more 'fully' but i have noticed that time and again it's the translation of the bible called the new jerusalem bible that seems to be the 'most complete' and makes the 'most sense' both linguistically and theologically Bible New Testament History of the English Bible Apocrypha Biblical inerrancy Bible translations King James Version of the Bible Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Revised Standard Version Mary, the mother of Jesus Gospel Tanakh God and gender Jesus Tetragrammaton Book of Daniel History of Christianity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Deuterocanonical books Old Testament Judaism Historicity of Jesus New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Translation Psalms Septuagint Mishnah Apocalyptic literature Theology Nazarene Documentary hypothesis New Testament apocrypha Christian denomination Sabbath Christian eschatology Textual criticism Names of God in Judaism Biblical studies Qur'an Homosexuality and Christianity Literature Creationism New Revised Standard Version Fundamentalism Sin Arab New Jerusalem Bible Dating the Bible King-James-Only Movement Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Talmud Jewish principles of faith The Bible and history Angel Biblical inspiration Dispensationalism Puritan Satan Holy Spirit Acts of the Apostles Douai Bible Dead Sea scrolls Judas Iscariot God Gospel of Mark Genesis Protestantism Bruce Metzger Ten Commandments Peshitta Mission (Christian) Great Apostasy Religious Society of Friends Liberal Christianity Geneva Bible Nontrinitarianism Gospel of Luke William Tyndale Ebionites Alan Campbell (pastor) Apostolic Fathers Hell Jehovah New American Standard Bible Holman Christian Standard Bible Timeline of Christianity
