are muslims terrorists or are terrorists extremists hiding behind religion from years of studying islam from when i was until now i know that it's brainwashed people who do the killing while following a mullah with his own agenda not the quran what does this say to you does islaam promote violence and terrorism no islaam is a religion of peace and submission and stresses the sanctity of human life a verse in the quran says chapter verse that anyone who saves one life it is as if he has saved the whole of mankind and anyone who has killed another person except in lieu of murder or mischief on earth it is as if he has killed the whole mankind islaam condemns all violence which happened in the crusades in spain in the nd world war or by acts of people like the rev jim jones david koresh dr baruch goldstein or the atrocities committed in bosnia by the christian serbs anyone who resorts to violence is not practicing his religion at that time however sometimes violence is a human response of oppressed people as in palestine there is a lot of terrorism and violence in areas where there is no muslim presence for example in ireland south africa latin america and sri lanka sometimes violence is due to a struggle between those who have and those who do not have or between those who are oppressed with those who are oppressors unfortunately the palestinians who are struggling against oppression are called terrorists but not the armed israeli settlers when they do the same as it turned out in the oklahoma city bombing sometime muslims are prematurely blamed even if the terrorism is committed by non muslims god does permit defensive wars against organized oppression sometimes some misguided muslims turn to violence as happens with all religions and countries of the world to call all muslims terrorists is completely false islaam is a religion of peace harmony and submission to the laws of god almighty terrorism and islam do not go hand in hand terrorism is the systematic use of terror esp as a means of coercion webster's new collegiate dictionary well i can see several other groups and or religions that fit the category of terrorists using that definition for example my church the catholic church used terror tactics for centuries as a means of obtaining and retaining power i believe that there are violent passages in the koran i have read a few but the same types of violent passages can be found in the bible in fact the bible may have more the fact is mohammed was a warrior so you will see passages that are couched in the culture of war in his teachings and or prophesies but the israelites were also a war like people and that is relfected in the bible i agree that extremists or fanatics use and pervert religion for their own means because in the end the three main monotheistic religions all have messages of violence within their books but each can be a means to peace beauty and love for one's fellow man it depends on the culture and the people interpreting the text and the teachings i have never yet met a muslim who wasn't kind and concerned about striving to become the best ethical person he or she could be i have found most to be very generous and willing to help his or her neighbor i've never met an islamic terrorist but i have met horrible people with allegiances to other groups or religions so you tell me Islam as a political movement Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Moses Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Nation of Islam Suicide bombing Mahatma Gandhi Religious conversion God Terrorism Hamas Arab-Israeli conflict Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fundamentalism Abraham Abrahamic religion Jerusalem Prophet Ethnic cleansing Criticism of Islam Christian anarchism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Cult Idolatry Jew Original sin Jewish views of religious pluralism Salvation Apostasy Qur'an Al-Qaeda Gandhism Religious perspectives on Jesus Anti-Defamation League Evolutionary creationism Temple Mount Pharisees Anti-Semitism Devil Separation of church and state Al-Aqsa Intifada End times Homosexuality and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses War on Terrorism Dhimmi Religion and sexuality Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Mormon Marriage Israeli West Bank barrier Religion and abortion Religious views of suicide Racism Criticisms of Christianity Muhammad Israel Satanism Child suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict God and gender Palestinian territories Crusade Baptism Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Zionism Apostasy in Islam Book of Isaiah Bible Jesus Apocalypse Christianity and anti-Semitism Palestinian political violence Persecution of Christians Chosen people Dispensationalism Sabbath Isa Sabra and Shatila massacre Peace Sharia Arab Monotheism
