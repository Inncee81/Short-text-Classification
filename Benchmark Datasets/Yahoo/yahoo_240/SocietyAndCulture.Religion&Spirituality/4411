to all christian and muslim please answer my question honestly why you choose christianity or islam to be your religion you have addressed the christians and muslims in the same question well talking about islam why i choose islam is because i found it logical to do so today islam is the fastest growing religion in the west this is because it has the solution to the problems of the west and the whole of human kind it not only tells you what it good but shows you the way to implement what is right for example it does not only tell you that robbing is wrong but shows you a way how to get rid of it every single person who has a savings of above grms of gold he has to give charity on it according to the report of who if rich people of this world give of their wealth in charity poverty will be irradicated from this planet what if the islamic law of charity is implemented after that if someone robs his her hands should be chopped off anyone will say chopping off hands islam is a barbaric religion i will ask them if the charity law of giving of every rich person's wealth is implemented in the first place there will be no reason why anyone will commit robbery and no reason for chopping of hands the punishment will only serve as a discouragment to the thief if such a law is implement in the worst afflicted places of crime will the cases of robbery increase decrease or remain the same there are many misconceptions regarding islam in the minds of the non muslims and muslims alike thanks to the media but i challenge that anyone points out any teaching of islam that is against humanity as a whole islam is a practical way of life it is not only a religion common misconceptions on islam http www irf net book zip islam does not call for blind faith it reasons and argues and gives proofs why it is the true religion the holy quran says have they not pondered upon it the quran if it was from anyone other than god it would contain numerous flaws many people have tried to find mistakes in the quran and ended up realising the truth there are more than verses on science in the quran and not even have been proven wrong by modern established science it confirms gospel of jesus and taurat to be from god both jesus and moses where messengers of god who were given books they gave the same message worship non but one god and associate no partners with him but these books weren't preserved by god because they were only meant for their nation as jesus has said in the bible i have not send but to the lost sheep of israel matthew the quran was the last book from god and muhammed pbuh his last messenger he is prophesised by jesus in the bible the quran is preserved to date and will be preserved till the end of times by god himself even the worst critics of islam throughout decades have accepted that quran is the only book unchanged till today and it will be god willingly Virgin Mary in Islam Islam Ten Commandments Qur'an Criticism of Islam Religion Nation of Islam Religious conversion Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Moses Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Soul Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Apostasy in Islam Christianity Muhammad Holy Spirit Fundamentalism Abraham Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus Book of Mormon Original sin Religious pluralism Resurrection of Jesus Angel Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin Creationism Meaning of life Chosen people Sharia Gospel of Thomas Religious perspectives on Jesus Book of Isaiah Supernatural Roman Catholic Church Abrahamic religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Trinity A Course In Miracles Exorcism Theodicy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses New Testament Atheism Islamic philosophy Polygamy Separation of church and state Shi'a Islam Maimonides Salvation Marriage Eastern Orthodox Church Prophets of Islam Repentance Miracle Divine grace Book of Revelation Gospel of Barnabas Evil Nontrinitarianism Sola fide Baptism United Submitters International Justification (theology) Heaven Dispensationalism Islam and anti-Semitism Biblical inerrancy Names and titles of Jesus Monotheism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Bible Religious views of suicide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Yusuf al-Qaradawi Opus Dei Reincarnation Christian apologetics Saint Jewish principles of faith Jewish views of religious pluralism The nature of God in Western theology
