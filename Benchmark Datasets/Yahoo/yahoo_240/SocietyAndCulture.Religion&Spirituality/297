why so many questions about catholicism and mormonism it seems that people have now become obsessed with the stupid theory that mormonism is based off of catholicism first off mormonism was started by a man joseph smith jr and neither the orthodox church nor the roman catholic church has claimed mormonism so i don't see why it is so important someone elaborate and dont be a rude pompass as's about it please guys i am a former catholic and while i distance myself from the rcc i still appreciate what it has done for me and i would greatly appreciate you not bashing it i know it has some bad rep but please dont bash it nor do i want you to bash mormonism just answer the question tur b for some reason i can look at the question that we were so heated over why is that and i have only spoken the truth about the church no matter what i will always and forever love and respect it no matter what my views are it was a part of my life and so it will remain i didnt ask your gay little comments i just asked why people compare catholicism to mormonism nothing more nothing less im only going to say this once the next person that says how dare a catholic call themselves a christian will be bitten by a serpent and that is the serpent of satan because that is probably where you are going to go hell i asked you not to be rude and to respect both catholicism and mormonism if you want to bash either one start your own damn thread the questions are just to prove the churches wrong in my opinion there is only one church that is true and it can be either the catholics or the mormons catholics because they claim to have had the authority since the time of peter and the mormons because they claim to have had the authority restored back to earth i haven't heard of any other church to claim that they have the authority of god like the catholics and mormons do Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mormonism and Christianity Priesthood (Mormonism) Book of Mormon Great Apostasy Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ Mormon Baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Original sin Homosexuality and Christianity Adam-God theory Eastern Orthodox Church Restoration (Mormonism) Revelation Apocrypha Biblical canon God Bishop New Testament Restorationism Fundamentalism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Anti-Mormonism Heaven Mary, the mother of Jesus History of the Latter Day Saint movement Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Succession crisis (Mormonism) Polygamy Curse and mark of Cain Abrahamic religion Catholicism Infant baptism Justification (theology) Theory of conduct Nontrinitarianism Ten Commandments Sin Papal Infallibility Apostolic Succession Opus Dei Bible and reincarnation Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Separation of church and state Religion Trinity Satan Hell Charles Grandison Finney Church of Christ (Mormonism) Community of Christ Free will Religious pluralism Latter Day Saint movement Endowment (Mormonism) Sabbath Second Vatican Council Baptist Meaning of life Excommunication Catholic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holy Spirit Liberal Christianity Blacks and Mormonism Traditionalist Catholic Lamanite Gallicanism Apostles' Creed Martin Harris Satanism Evolutionary creationism Danite Salvation Binitarianism Mormonism and Judaism Noah Pope Discordianism Protestantism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Angel Blood atonement
