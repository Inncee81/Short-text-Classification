has islam passed or failed the ultimate test of any religion is in the nature of followers it produces the level of development in its society improvements in the quality of life etc as the saying goes as a religion so its people based on this yardstick how would you rate islam benrotn why people do not convert out of islam http en wikipedia org wiki apostasy in islam how's that for double standards yachadoo religions are not only about stating facts more then that they instruct you how to lead your life dylan why do you take it in the negative the question is pretty neutral people have the right to defend islam also lawrence islam certainly passed the test then it's the present we are talking about criminals swindlers and child rapers happen in every society communism collapsed due to a variety of causes but the absence of religion was not one of them incidentally china is also a non religious communist country it is going from strength to strength lawrence i agree with you regarding change that is the only constant in life all countries races cultures and why not religions have to adapl else they will be brushed away or at most remain minor players the reson why the soviet union collasped was almost fully because it was unable to keep pace with the us in terms of arms buildup the expenditure on arms led to the collapse of the soviet economy regarding the concept of heaven or hell whcich made the soviet soldier unwilling to fight it might be better that this concept is not there at least the suicide bombers who incidentally plauge the muslim countries more would not be there china is governed by the chinese communist party incidentally muslims all over world become ex muslims you see them here on ya alot too islam is not a better religion than any other if any test of religion is valid it has to be the character of its adherents as you indicate jesus the christ of christianity and a prophet of islam says that a good tree can not bear bad fruit if you apply his words to the church mosque you'd have to say that they are not a fruit of a good god sorry but that's just an honest assessment who can deny that western religions christianity and islam included has been the most divisive influence in the history of mankind p s the nature and spirit of your question makes me wonder if this is typical of muslims of course i can't tell from just one question the point is that you're not representing islam very well i know for a fact that muslim schools in palestine and elsewhere indoctrinate their children with hatred for jews i know for a fact that muslim communities in pakistan and afghanistan and elsewhere hide known terrorists in their midsts and that they do so very successfully every question i've ever seen from a muslim here is always so full of propaganda that i can't help but believe that you're all being indoctrinated with false ideas if not just plain hatred islam spreads fastest in the poorest parts of the world it seems to appeal to the desperate and uneducated a potent combination of traits for those hoping to exploit the human condition to brainwash ignorant minds Fundamentalism Prophet Religious conversion Islam as a political movement God Religious pluralism Separation of church and state Original sin Criticism of Islam Islam Abrahamic religion Cult Apostasy Soviet Union Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nation of Islam Atheism Persecution of Christians Creationism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Islamism Zoroastrianism Nationalism Idolatry Satanism Suicide bombing History of Islam Supernatural Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Hell Baptism Religion in China Ten Commandments Opposition to cults and new religious movements Bosniaks Islamic philosophy Propaganda Evil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sin Islamist terrorism Coercion Heaven Muhammad Predestination Jew Apocalypse Scientology beliefs and practices Conservatism End times Militant Islam Islam and anti-Semitism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Apostasy in Islam Christian eschatology Religion in the Soviet Union Salvation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Western world New anti-Semitism Religious perspectives on Jesus Patriotism Anti-Defamation League Antichrist Neofascism and religion Islamic world Democracy Communism Buddhism Trinity Terrorism Saint Same-sex marriage Monotheism Mormonism and Christianity Republic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brainwashing Meme The Power of Nightmares Confucianism A Course In Miracles Mahatma Gandhi Heresy Education Christianity and anti-Semitism Theology Status of religious freedom in Sudan Status of religious freedom in Iran Great Apostasy Islam in France Hinduism Yusuf al-Qaradawi
