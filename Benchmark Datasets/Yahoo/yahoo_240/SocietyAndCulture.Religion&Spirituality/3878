i should believe that god blinked everything into existence because so to recap the responses from my previous questions god gets to kill us if he wants to because he created us and he's really the only one who creates because somehow he can blink things into existence working from absolutely nothing and i should believe this because why because your holy book says so ooooooh that sounds reliable because your faith assures you it's reliable well why is your faith any more or less valid than anyone elses because you feel it and your feelings are infallible hmmm see all these answers inevitably lead up to god is mysteriously powerful but at that point you've jumped the shark your mythology is no more believable than any other so why should i believe it p s because god exists and he did what the bible says will lead us right back to those same questions and i should believe that because of your book your faith your feelings buzz i'm sorry please try again if the christian god was a human they would all want him in prison or at the very least a mental ward but since he works in mysterious ways yes i'll pick you up tomorrow morning and we will both go to the first church of the holy jumpin' epileptic jesus together okay Religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief New Testament Resurrection of Jesus Sola fide Christianity Roman Catholic Church Infant baptism Bible Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Biblical inerrancy Summa Theologiae Fundamentalism Papal Infallibility God and gender Creationism A Course In Miracles Mormonism Religious Society of Friends Soul Urantia Eucharist Great Apostasy Eastern Orthodox Church Liberal Christianity The nature of God in Western theology Priesthood (Mormonism) Catechism Perseverance of the saints Theodicy Historicity of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Criticism of Mormonism Angel Baptism Supernatural Jewish principles of faith Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origin belief Free will Pope Evolutionary creationism Creator God Slow Train Coming Ten Commandments Holiness movement Determinism Church of Christ, Scientist Abrahamic religion Religious pluralism Merit Biblical canon Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Catholicism Community of Christ Nation of Islam Charles Grandison Finney Temple (Mormonism) Church of Christ Holy Spirit Transcendental argument for the existence of God Book of Mormon Nontrinitarianism Devil Alan Campbell (pastor) Simone Weil Baptist Binitarianism Infallibility of the Church Atheism Theology Blink-182 John Howard Yoder Nahmanides Paul of Tarsus Divine grace Presuppositional apologetics Ordination of women Reinhold Niebuhr Islam Afterlife Christian Godhead (Mormonism) Christian apologetics Protestantism
