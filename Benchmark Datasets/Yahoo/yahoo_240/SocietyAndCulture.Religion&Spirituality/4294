confused please help i do not understand if there is one god why are there several other gods that other cultures believe in why is there several religions out there i dont get it no one will ever know what will satisfy god at one time all men had knowledge of the one true god but because of sin and rebellion men have drifted far from god and invented many false gods and religions according to their own imaginations we know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no god but one for even if there are so called gods whether in heaven or on earth as indeed there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is but one god the father from whom all things came and for whom we live and there is but one lord jesus christ through whom all things came and through whom we live but not everyone knows this i corinthians the god who made the world and everything in it is the lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands and he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else from one man he made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live god did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us 'for in him we live and move and have our being ' as some of your own poets have said 'we are his offspring ' therefore since we are god's offspring we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone an image made by man's design and skill in the past god overlooked such ignorance but now he commands all people everywhere to repent for he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed he has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead acts Salvation Ten Commandments Soul God Baptism Christianity Sola fide Sabbath Trinity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Idolatry Fallen angel Articles of Religion (Methodist) Book of Mormon Sin Summa Theologiae Hell Holy Spirit Satan Justification (theology) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Priesthood (Mormonism) Prophet Paul of Tarsus Angel Resurrection of Jesus Original sin Church of Christ Mormonism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Binitarianism Creationism Eastern Orthodox Church Athanasian Creed John the Baptist Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Jesus Devil Isa Heaven Theodicy Repentance John Howard Yoder Dispensationalism Idolatry in Christianity Adam-God theory Origin belief Free will Biblical inerrancy Mormonism and Christianity Jewish Messiah Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pharisees End times Urantia Religious perspectives on Jesus Gospel of Thomas Justin Martyr Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Roman Catholic Church Miracle Tower of Babel Predestination 613 mitzvot Charles Grandison Finney Messiah History of Christianity Eschatology Abrahamic religion Cultural and historical background of Jesus God and gender Apology of Aristides Merit Divine grace Demon Purgatory Qiyamah Christian views of Jesus History of the Latter Day Saint movement John Wycliffe Christian apologetics Aramaic of Jesus Afterlife Friedrich Schleiermacher Book of Isaiah Didache Calvinism Religious pluralism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Satanism Duties of the Heart Blood atonement Horus Catechism
