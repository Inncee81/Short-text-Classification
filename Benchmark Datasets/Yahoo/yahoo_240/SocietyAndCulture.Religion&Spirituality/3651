this is pretty sad a church in arlington texas cancels a memorial service for a gay vet hours before i am very disturbed by this because churches are suppose to represent god not place judgement on people as much as the this isn't my choice of a way to live i still am very sickened by this the man is dead he deserves to be honored this is a megachurch a nondenominational all i can say is i am very disappointed what do your thoughts please as usual be respectful thank you very much in advance http news aol com story ar a church cancels memorial for gay vet ncid nws i need to add more details the man that died was gay he was alive and he will be judged by god we are to love our neighbors as our selves this also is in the bible our job is not to judge anyone and the person that said they would show a slide show of him kissing the church doesn't have to allow that part but honor him at least as a person he deserves that much and hours later this church knew they were counting on them for this service i am not placing judgement on anyone but it floors me to know that any church that truly knows god and claims to love and do what god says this is an out right pathetic situation what no one understands is that this wasn't a christian church nondemitational church totally different than anything a catholic or christian church would do all i can and will say to finish my thoughts is no true catholic or christian would deny god's creation because of what they were did or are i know i wouldn't and trully can't not my job to do so http www catholicchurchnh org index cfm content id http www catholicchurchnh org index cfm content id point of these links is catholics wouldn't do this to people not all religions feel the same as this church does http www catholicchurchnh org index cfm content id point of these links is catholics wouldn't do this to people not all religions feel the same as this church does sdc i am a christian and should all the facts be known and this is the case as you mention i think that this illustrates whats wrong with modern religion church is for the spiritually sick and that includes both christians and non believers alike don't place all your stock in one church's bad decision to bury this gay vet if you really knew god you would realize that misjudgement does occur at times in churches simply because humans forget that they too are sinners god loves all people and jesus died for gays too Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ten Commandments Christianity Theodicy Salvation Sabbath Sin Soul Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hell Biblical canon Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology The nature of God in Western theology Predestination Eastern Orthodox Church Religion God Religion and sexual orientation Church of Christ, Scientist Saint Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Homosexuality and Christianity Opus Dei Eucharist Trinity Original sin Biblical inerrancy Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Miracle Liberal Christianity Theory of conduct Calvinism Prophet Mormonism and Christianity Free will Sola fide Bible Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious Society of Friends Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Fundamentalism Angel Evil Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gospel of Thomas Reincarnation Seventh-day Adventist Church Simone Weil Baptist Meaning of life Exorcism Church of Christ Supernatural Infant baptism Religious pluralism Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Criticisms of Christianity Immortality Religious conversion Jewish views of religious pluralism Merit Time Out of Mind John Howard Yoder Russian Orthodox Church Creationism Baptism Bible and reincarnation Divine grace Marriage Kurt Cobain Idolatry Abrahamic religion Jesus Purgatory Spiritism Christian anarchism Holy Spirit End times Christian apologetics InterFaith Scientology beliefs and practices Atheism Creation-evolution controversy Satanism Martin Luther Friends Michel Henry
