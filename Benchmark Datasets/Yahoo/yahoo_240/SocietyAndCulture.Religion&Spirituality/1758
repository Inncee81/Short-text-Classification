what do you know about how islam spread and what do you think do you know enough history to really get the idea or do you know what you've been told what do you think was islaam spread by the sword according to the quraan there is no compulsion in religion thus no one can be forced to become a muslim while it is true in many places where muslim armies went to liberate people or the land they did carry the sword as that was the weapon used at that time however islaam did not spread by the sword in many places where there are muslims now in the far east like indonesia in china and many parts of africa there are no records of any muslim armies having gone there to say that islaam was spread by the sword would be to say that christianity was spread by guns f 's and atomic bombs etc which is not true christianity was spread by the missionary work of christians ten percent of all arabs are christians the sword of islaam could not covert all the non muslim minorities in muslim countries in india where muslims ruled for years they are still a minority in the usa islaam is the fastest growing religion and has million followers and no sword is around islam was spread by the prophet muhammad saw after receiving the first revelation at first he spread islam only to his close kin fearing that he might be ignored by his people and attacked by the quraish leaders who at that time still worship idols he gained a lot of people who were interested by this new faith among them were his own wife khadijah binti khuwailid ra his best friend abu bakr as siddiq ra his cousin ali bin abu talib ra and many more all were moved by his honesty and the simplicity of the faith even after he preached openly after three years people who were onced actively opposing him now turned to islam for example umar bin al khattab ra was very against islam atr that time however he was a man who loved poetry and after hearing the recitation of the qur'an he embraced islam praise be to allah even after the conquest of makkah the prophet saw forgave his mortal enemies even those who tried to kill him and they in return accepted islam after the prophet saw 's death the rightly guided caliphs abu bakr umar uthman and ali ra anhum continued to spread islam with peaceful ways for instance when umar ra conquered jerusalem he made a truce with the jews of jerusalem and let them stay there this was considered to be very advanced followoing the treatment of previous empires to their subjects so yes i myself do not see one single sword if islam was indeed spread by the sword not one single jew or christian could live during the times of the caliphate not one african christian could live if the moors indeed spread islam by the sword not one hindu could live if indeed islam was spread by the sword so where is the sword i see the truth spreaded by one single man muhammad rasulullah saw who was illeterate faced with death threates from tribal leaders lived with humbleness through him islam has been expanded throughout the world reaching the four corners the truth prevails with the will of allah alhamdulillah i thank allah for making me a born muslim for leading me to the light out of the darkness may allah guide us all Timeline of 7th century Islamic history Nahj al Balagha Khalid ibn al-Walid Coptic Christianity John the Baptist Nation of Islam Jerusalem Prophets of Islam Quraish Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Historical persecution by Muslims Abdullah ibn Abbas Prophet Religious pluralism Religion Women in Islam Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr Sahaba's ancestors Kharijites Chosen people Almoravides Kufa Umar II Muawiyah I Hajj History of early Arab Egypt Islamic conquest of Iran Religious conversion Muslim music Abrahamic religion Rise of Islam in Algeria Fundamentalism Isa Islamist terrorism Criticism of Islam Wahhabism Islamism Jew Alawite Suleiman the Magnificent Islam and Judaism Hadith Abdul Qadir Jilani Judaism Shura Polygamy Umayyad Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Salman the Persian Amr ibn al-A'as Abraham Muhammad's marriages Islamic world Islamic philosophy Abbasid Idolatry History of the Middle East Sufism Berber Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Maria al-Qibtiyya
