isn't it funny that if we never talked about religious beliefs we may all get along rather well do you think we let beliefs ruin possible acquaintances and friendships or even civil speech we have all even me been guilty of not so nice speech i apologize for my not so great stuff but still the question remains i am a christian and proud of it and will talk about it but i am also reminded that arguing is not really a good thing but i also agree with draconum i can argue with most any of you and probably chill with you a few minutes later my point is that people get so nasty and i ahve been guilty i think that if we are going to alk of these differences then we should keep a civil tongue in our mouths me included and queen b thank god we didn't shop on ya for each other we had good old nsca for that thanx for the ba best are you saying we should ignore the most important things in life simply to avoid disagreement this is a way to control others by making them feel guilty about being different or holding different views to try to get others to keep quiet is in a way passive aggression you can apply that to every area of life don't talk politics we might disagree don't talk love and romance we might disagree don't talk about anything of importance just stick to surface level chatter that has no benefit to the deeper things every human has religious beliefs to pretend they don't exist is deceptive at best dangerous at the worst it ignores the reality that some whether we like it or not would like to kill us as part of their religious beliefs it matters not if we talk at all about it hide it bury it whatever it is reality to hide our beliefs out of fear of not being popular is not very brave how are we to know who agrees with us how are we to know who doesn't how are we to initiate conversation that could save someone's life that could help them make decisions that will keep them from being destroyed how are we to discuss the reality of god if we never talk about him being timid to avoid conflict is never the best option Theory of conduct God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The nature of God in Western theology Religion Theodicy Religious pluralism Socrates Philosophical skepticism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Emperor of Dune Reality Goodness and value theory Atheism Intelligent design Objectivist philosophy Cult Evil A Course In Miracles Conscience Determinism Abortion debate Pascal's Wager Supernatural Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Patriotism Value system Creationism Free will Humphrey Bogart S__ren Kierkegaard Predestination The Death Gate Cycle Trinity Epistemology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Democracy Anti-Mormonism Biblical inerrancy Transactional analysis Heaven Homosexuality and Christianity Deconstruction Samurai Deeper Kyo EastEnders Sexual orientation Religious Society of Friends Culture of Lithuania Human sexual behavior The Amber Spyglass Opposition to cults and new religious movements Justification (theology) Jewish views of religious pluralism Phillip E.
