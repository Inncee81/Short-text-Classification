why did j krishnamurti disband the order or the star and then towards the end of his life say that nobody was transformed this question is for those who have read about him in the words of krishnamurti himself i maintain that truth is a pathless land and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever by any religion by any sect that is my point of view and i adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally truth being limitless unconditioned unapproachable by any path whatsoever cannot be organised nor should any organisation be formed to lead or coerce people along any particular path if you first understand that then you will see how impossible it is to organise a belief a belief is purely an individual matter and you cannot and must not organise it if you do it becomes dead crystallised it becomes a creed a sect a religion to be imposed on others this is what everyone throughout the world is attempting to do truth is narrowed down and made a plaything for those who are weak for those who are only momentarily discontented truth cannot be brought down rather the individual must make the effort to ascend to it you cannot bring the mountain top to the valley and you are all depending for your spirituality on someone else for your happiness on someone else for your enlightenment on someone else when i say look within yourselves for the enlightenment for the glory for the purification and for the incorruptibility of the self not one of you is willing to do it there may be a few but very very few so why have an organisation Jiddu Krishnamurti Religious pluralism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Atheism Hinduism Scientology beliefs and practices Anthroposophy Coercion Judaism Religious perspectives on Jesus New Age Pharisees Meaning of life Eastern philosophy Roman Catholic Church Rudolf Steiner Religious conversion Advaita Vedanta Fundamentalism God Spiritism Age of Enlightenment Ten Commandments Mormonism Theology Calvinism Discordianism Abrahamic religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Jewish principles of faith Philosophical skepticism Religious Society of Friends Soul Spirituality Buddhism Sociology of religion Nondualism Guru Sant Mat Christianity Evangelicalism Christian eschatology Predestination Creationism Science Human Ethics in religion Liberal Christianity Taoism Trinity A Course In Miracles Gautama Buddha Satanism Urantia Shinto Epistemology Existence of God InterFaith Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Merit Mormonism and Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Jainism Idolatry Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islam History of Christianity Sunni Islam George Fox Gnosticism Supernatural Friedrich Schleiermacher Divine grace Dharma Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path Afterlife Anti-Mormonism Karl Marx Cult Opus Dei Animism Enlightenment (concept) Catholicism Salvation Victor Cousin New Testament Ken Wilber Resurrection of Jesus Kalki Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct
