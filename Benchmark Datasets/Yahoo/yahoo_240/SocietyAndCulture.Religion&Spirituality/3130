christians is god still all good even though he is jealous vengeful and full of anger the lord is a jealous and avenging god the lord takes vengeance against his foes he is furious with his enemies nahum who can withstand his indignation who can endure his burning anger his wrath is poured out like fire even rocks are shattered before him nahum sammy this is actually exactly what i was looking for i had a feeling that most christians would say that god is good even though he is jealous vengeful and full of anger although i have a feeling that you wouldn't particularly want to hang around another person who acts that way it is also probably unlikely that you would think that person was a very good person either why is there a double standard where god is concerned isn't god supposed to be the role model here tera rainbows are lovely things but if god is really sorry for what he did couldn't he just bring all those people back to life especially all those innocent children and babies who suffered an agonizing death by drowning the idea of a god of rage jealousy and vengeance is not compatible with the idea of a god of infinite love besides a being with petty desires call them emotions if you will but you can trace them back to desire such as these cannot be perfect as perfection is to be free of desire Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Theodicy John Howard Yoder Jealousy God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Revenge Predestination Evil Immortality The Marriage of Figaro Justification (theology) The Amber Spyglass Hulk (comics) The Count of Monte Cristo Christian eschatology Merit Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Sexuality in Christian demonology Saruman Philipp Melanchthon Summa Theologiae Capital punishment Karma Free will Original sin Charmed Sacrifice Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Simone Weil Ranma __ characters Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reincarnation A Course In Miracles Infantilism Numerology Ten Commandments Religion Books of the Swords Alcoholics Anonymous Rich Mullins Anger management Sola fide Blood (computer game) The nature of God in Western theology Love God the Father Soul Ontological argument The Death Gate Cycle Phoebe Halliwell Shen Gong Wu Angel Cliff Richard Hell Alignment (role-playing games) Virtue Spiritism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Polyamory Mortification of the flesh Thor (Marvel Comics) Duties of the Heart Slow Train Coming Book of Isaiah George Harrison Jan Smuts Salvation Sin City Trinity Supernatural Days of our Lives Aphrodite Goodness and value theory Prisoner (TV series) Lightsaber combat Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Holocaust theology Samson Iago Athrun Zala The Oresteia Hellenic philosophy and Christianity Divine grace Ecco the Dolphin The Pilgrim's Progress Bhakti Psychology of religion Spectre (comics) The Dunciad Sesshomaru Book of Mormon God and gender Rastafari movement
