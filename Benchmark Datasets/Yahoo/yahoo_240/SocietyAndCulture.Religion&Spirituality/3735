a question for christians i have been meaning to figure this out for a very long time now okay so many christians say that people are not born as homosexuals its by their own choice when they grow up but then some christians say that people were actually born as homosexuals from the begining of their lives so which one do you believe to be true i just dont understand because here is my point of view the bible says how god is soo against homosexuality and that it should be a man and a women married and not two men or two women so why would god willingly create any homosexual if he is against the idea that is why i think people become homosexuals by their own choice but hey that is just my opinion what do u think i really wanna know psychology has shown that when the mother takes on the father's role in the family the children become confused and the boys may imitate the feminine role if either parent is rejecting or harsh the children may reject their parent's sexual role there is also the possibility of hormonal imbalances especially as many today are not eating healthy diets meats with hormones added or getting enough exercise some are exposed to homosexuality at an early age and feel they must be that way for it to have happened to them there are many things called sin wrongdoing that people feel is part of them such as lying gossip and slander etc whatever our own personal sin s we must address them and turn away from them god is patient with us if someone needs hormone therapy get it if someone needs counselling or therapy get it if someone needs deliverance get it god is not going to change heaven's standards for each person's whims if we want heaven we must change Transsexuality Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Reparative therapy Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gender role Ex-gay God and gender Homosexuality Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Prostate cancer Mary, the mother of Jesus Transgender Evil Roman Catholic Church Religion and sexuality Biology and sexual orientation Theodicy Marriage Predestination Religion Homophobia Homosexuality and transgender Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dissociative identity disorder Catechism Summa Theologiae Laura Schlessinger Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 613 mitzvot New Testament God Sola fide History of intersex surgery Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Unification Church Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ten Commandments Same-sex marriage Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Simone Weil Eastern Orthodox Church Sin Divine grace Judaism Trinity Christianity History of Christianity and homosexuality Sharia Liberal Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Free will Paul of Tarsus Salvation God the Father John Howard Yoder Calvinism Narcissism Sigmund Freud Homosexuality and Judaism Love Sodom and Gomorrah Choice and sexual orientation Soul Charles Grandison Finney Urantia Creationism Minister of religion Falsifiability Sexual differentiation Homosexuality in China Angel Woman Gender identity Children of God Priesthood (Mormonism) Stomach cancer Meaning of life Domestic violence Obesity Cancer Cliff Richard Infant baptism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pedophilia Polyamory Adam and Eve Cross-dressing Sexuality in Christian demonology
