found god and found jesus i want explicit detail from anyone who claims to have found either or both my personal experiences i only believe in the god but cannot say the jesus yet because i have yet to see a find sleep paralysis is my only experience and it's possibly it was only a hullicination still i felt the same energy you feel when you feel a person is sneaking up behind up behind you you can feel their warm their breath their existance i felt that still i have my debate i say that one morning half awake half asleep it was sleep paralysis and possibly a sign or possibly what many people are claiming as their experience therefore i'm asking this question what has your experience s been like have you have one many or none i'm guessing many people have had none and only dreams i did happen to have this strange experience one morning i woke and then paralysised in mid step and couldn't move for literally i'm guessing minutes what do u say during my paralysis i saw solid black shadows solid black human figure shadows all around me walking looking moving talking when it went away they faded away and i was able to move i went to work after that very shaken the whole day the whole year i still cannot forget it was as serious as ever and i felt my days were over i thought i was dead for those minutes the shadows they were spirits dark shadows i couldn't see their feet either just fades of light and shadow thanks everyone i hold a belief that this is a normal hallucination of sleep paralysis it's really scary though even the strongest warrior feels a slight shake seeing this and then not waking up after wards you only start moving after seeing what you thought was only in the damn movies but in real life it's really a shocking moment i would see a doctor for sleep paralysis don't mistake a condition as a sign from god Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Narcolepsy Sleep paralysis Philosophical skepticism Animism Milton H.
