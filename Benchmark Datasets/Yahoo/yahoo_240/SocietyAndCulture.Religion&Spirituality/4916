how do i not fall into evil can i cast a spell i am a witch if you have read my other questions you would know been one for one year i don't want to fall into the darkness please don't say if you don't want to fall into it join god or you already have if you are a witch those are just so not true blessed be everyone there is a good and a bad side of witchcraft i am on the good but i could someday be on the bad side but i don't want that so how do i not become on the side of evil i want to stay a witch just not fall into the other side hello again you seem to be a bit confused and this does happen to a lot of people just starting out the fact is there simply isn' t necessarily a good and bad side magic k is not simply black or white on the contrary if we're using the color mentality the vast majority of spellwork magic k is gray what matters is your intent and how you focus that for instance if you're angry at a particular person group of people you may want to take a break or meditate on calm and forgiveness before you begin your work i usually just meditate on it but i have a friend who actually calms himself down and slowly softly chants part of the rede and yes he's wiccan but you don't have to be wiccan to appreciate karma he goes back and forth between sometimes chanting bide these wiccan laws ye must with perfect love and perfect trust live ye must and let to live fairly take and fairly give and merry meet and merry part bright the cheeks and warm the heart mind the threefold law ye should three times bad and three times good and usually after concentrating on that and his belief in it he's alright to start his work ritual or otherwise however i must say i'm a bit surprised not necessarily in a bad way mind you because most witches don't believe in absolute good or absolute evil well that's interesting it's good to see you're finding your own path hope this helped blessed be o namaste Wicca Wiccan Rede Magic (paranormal) Witchcraft Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Theodicy Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Karma Phoebe Halliwell Summa Theologiae Charmed Witches (Discworld) A Course In Miracles Dianic Wicca Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Witch trial Mantra Social rule Scarlet Witch Yoga Ontological argument Karma in Hinduism Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Witch-hunt Merit Slayers Buddhism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Falun Gong Sola fide Carlos Castaneda The Fairly OddParents Jon Secada Family (Buffy episode) Immortality Sin Neopaganism God Satanism Religion Reincarnation The Amber Spyglass Sant Mat One Piece minor characters Pysanka Macbeth Swami Vivekananda Jedi Meditation Bhajan Ten Commandments Pitaten Stregheria Discordianism Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Roman Catholic Church Socrates Historical persecution by Christians Curse Tantra Supernatural Magical thinking Black cat John Wesley Negima Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Vegeta Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Philosophical skepticism Cunning folk Vishnu sahasranama Past teachings of Prem Rawat Diwali Lady Frieda Harris Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Warlock Vipassana Determinism Paige Matthews Atheism Thelema Saruman Necromancy Dragon Booster Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Queen of Wands Edgar Cayce Magic circle (Wicca)
