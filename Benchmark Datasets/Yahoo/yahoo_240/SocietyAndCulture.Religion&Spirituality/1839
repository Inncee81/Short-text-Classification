the religion of evolution can you let me know of any positive mutations it seems evolutionists always love to point out the resistance of bacteria against certain antibiotics but this isn't a positive mutation the bacteria loses the ability to produce the substance that triggers the poison of the antibiotic at first this may look positive but it's still a loss of information mutations only corrupt the current information evolutionists love to use natural selection to somehow prove molecules to man evolution happened natural selection only selects what it already there it cannot add anything new evolutionists always love to say that they have transitional fossils that prove evolution but there are only a handful of debatable fossils in truth if evolution were true we should see millions and millions of transitional fossils we should see fish mammal fish mammal etc whale cow whale cow etc this is never seen evolutionists also sometimes find one or two fossils and imagine what the rest looks like in addition they often use drawings instead of showing the bones why is that we also see supposed 'millions of years old' fossilized animals that look exactly like those of today no change over 'millions of years the only reason evolutionists find evidence of evolution in their mind is because they start off with basic presuppositions probably that god does not exist or he didn t create everything all at once sure creationists have presuppositions as well but the evidence lines up much better with the creation model sudden appearance of complex animals animals producing after their kind millions of fossils buried in the flood etc evolutionists like to use the language of speculation and incorporate it into natural selection in order to make the theory seem more believable the millions of years is the only way they can make it seem plausible romans describes evolutionists exactly how they are today because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen i think it s wise to trust god more than fallible men please take this test if you feel convicted by god http www livingwaters com good the example i remember most came from my biology textbook was about finches in the galapagos they showed that one particular species had a short beak and many years later showed that same species with much longer beaks what happened was a few had been born with the longer beaks and were more adept at getting the larvae in the trees this would result in them being much healthier and thus the females would be more likely to mate with them then babies would be born with the same characteristic the longer beak and viola evolution many christians accept this form of evolution as it does not have to oppose the bible you can still believe god made man and all the creatures on earth and that after long amounts of time certain animals had to adapt to their environment i personally believe that humans evolved
