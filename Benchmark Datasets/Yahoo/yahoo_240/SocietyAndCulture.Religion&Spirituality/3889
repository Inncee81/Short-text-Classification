think you can handle this kind of logic i dare any atheist to take the time to read this and this isn t even going into detail scientists have said plenty of times that the universe works in perfect harmony and that it seems like it's a complete fluke that we're here that the chances everything that has occurred is in i got no source but that's the idea so it seems evolution given the fact it's been really efficient and in constant transition is almost too perfect to be true that it explains everything so perhaps and this has been suggested that god is what made it happen but furthermore he is actually everything that has existed and it's taken him this long to get to this point he was all those original organisms that had to evolve and adapt he was all those animals that had to change and survive to eventually create humans and now he is all of us combined but we still have our individual souls god as the father of our souls in which we either choose to embrace turn away from god this is the issue of freewill and explanation of sin sins are the pleasures and we need pleasure otherwise we would have no confidence in god and be miserable our whole lives giving us no motivation to get his approval he provided for us but they are only intended to be used under control which is why he wants us to wait for marriage to have sex because if you can control you re most primal and intense drive then every other sin is easy to overcome also sex is the most important sin to avoid because anyone can and does do it not everyone is a murderer thief liar a lot of people are though or over indulges with food alcohol smoking etc sex is something everyone has in common and once you start it s hard to stop in which case you lose all control of yourself and any other sin my explanation for the bible is simple people at those times hardly knew anything about the world or universe let alone evolution or science so he had to simplify by telling his people that follow my rules and you will be safe the thing is he didn t even really mention a heaven hell in the ot because he had to kill all those isrealites and if he told them about hell they would have not agreed to any of the rules what he was trying to accomplish with them was to create the circumstances for jesus arrival and he needed jesus to cure the world of sin so that everyone no matter how much of a sinner can still get accepted into heaven if they accept god into their lives like the rules became less strict i ll explain later why this had to be done also adam and eve whether they existed or not basically explain how it was inevitable that from creating humans it s only natural that they d choose free will over being emotionless drones that in itself is unavoidable but it s also safe to say that while god was creating himself he discovered that it s impossible to start perfect perfect is something that must be accomplished from an imperfect state but you also have to consider the fact that god is the god of all people so any religion that exists or existed is influenced by god each of them generally describe how to be good and you will be rewarded so all people throughout all time have been exposed to god s mercy it s all that he can do since we are all a creation of god then we all have eternal souls and are i kid you not all gods because within eternity anyone can become perfect and know everything regarding heaven and hell since we have eternal souls it is only possible to become one with god if we show him that we care and are willing to commit ourselves to him because if we do we are granted heaven in which case we gain perfection through eternity anyone can become perfect if they are given an eternity to reach it which is why sinners and those who do not accept god are not granted heaven because they won t even make the effort to try and they get exactly what they wanted nothing to do with god and since souls are eternal they live in their own hell of despair and loneliness every soul is alone after death only through god are we joined with everyone else he saves peace is only possible if everyone agrees and feels the same way and that can only be accomplished through the common belief in god that everyone agrees on and feels the same about which is love god s next step well he must create himself on earth and the only way to do that is to be born into it however god would probably not even know or be aware that he is god it s something he would have to discover he would not have any kind of a miraculous birth to determine that otherwise that would throw off the world and he d just get taken and probably killed also living in a sinful world he would also be a sinner so that s why jesus needed to cure us of sin so that he is free to do what he has to do and living in the world means he must sin in order to get approval or respected by anyone and he d need that to fulfill certain criteria which involves becoming known to the whole world i mean everyone anyways he must come to this world because he is the only one that can judge us at which point that will be the end of this world because the only solution to end all the problems we re facing is to kill all those who do not accept him because if they continuing living here the worlds problems will persist and it will get worse and worse as time continues so that s the only way it can end the good thing however is that when god does come the whole world will know it so the whole world will have a chance to accept him and since it s his world well the choice is clear the end of all things will be televised tabula is that the best you can contribute i thought atheists were supposed to be intelligent and free thinkers and logical good job at not impressing anyone you people absolutly suck the second someone brings something that completly negates everything you beleive you write it off as dribble this just means you cant handle it you tell me it's there is no logic and yet you didn t even read it where's the logic in that ok first let me state that i am not an atheist but a believer in god's creation of the universe now down to brass tacks you gotta learn the difference between evolution theory and creation science to put it very simply evolution theory does not and cannot explain how life began only what happened to it after it began also please learn the difference in the use of the word theory as it pertains to science and theory as us laypeople use it big difference if you learn these simple things you'll save yourself and the rest of us educated
