when are the religious door knockers going to wake up i mean why cant they see that they are like those telemarketers they are exactly the same they are trying to sell a product and when you tell them your not interested they still hound you who agree's with me door knockers will never wake up if they are religious or otherwise mostly they are made of metal on rare occasions of wood that has been cut and now contains no living cells door knockers are only there to let you know that someone's at the door i got rid of mine and replaced it with an electronic door bell sometimes i didn't hear the door knocker when someone knocked now if you are saying only we could do something about all the religious people who mistakenly think you give a darn about their religion and insist on trying to speak to you all the time there is a solution in my area we've gotten a no solicitation order set up and have signs on the street lights warning these creeps that if they come to the door we will have them arrested it works a treat not only do they not come to the door we are also not bothered by salesmen of any sort so get if you have problems with religious salesmen do the same after they spend a few nights behind bars for breaking the law you will be supprised how little they bother you Sin City Clothing The Dalek Invasion of Earth Professional wrestling match types The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Elvis Presley Colony in Space Direct marketing The Doors George Costanza The Champions Billboard Hot 100 Theory of conduct Spam (electronic) Avenue Q Insomnia Frame problem Sales Ocean's Twelve Rais massacre History of the British constitution Rent (musical) Joke Satanism Second Battle of the Atlantic Blood Simple Telemarketing Door B-47 Stratojet Shaggy dog story Conker's Bad Fur Day The Chemical Brothers Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rosa Parks Upholstery The Empty Child Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Son Gohan Royal Assent Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Emancipation of Mimi Charles Peace Garfield The Death Gate Cycle Kill Bill Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wayne Corporation Ozzy Osbourne Sento Burr Redding The Dark is Rising Sequence The Keeper of Traken The Marriage of Figaro The Shining (film) Bicycle lighting George W.
