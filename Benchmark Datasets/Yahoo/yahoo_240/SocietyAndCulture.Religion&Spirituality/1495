why don't those who claim to be something actually follow it if you're going to claim to be a religion you should follow it and not put your culture above it there are a number of factors that make many muslim men abusive abusers are often part of a cycle picking up the habit after watching their own fathers abuse their mothers in north america or in muslim countries and their own children learn this abusive behavior and abuse their wives this is an important point because the longer the muslim community tolerates abuse the longer it will be passed on from father to son from generation to generation for cultural reasons some muslim men accept the idea that it's normal for a man to hit his wife and that she is no more than a piece of his property some muslim husbands abuse their wives as a result of frustration resulting from economic hardship political oppression experienced outside the u s problems with the children or an inferiority complex some abuse their wives because they want them to be more modern and less islamic by removing their hijab islamic dress while others are abusive because they want the opposite some muslims with superficial ties to islam don't know that abuse is unacceptable due to their weak faith poor islamic knowledge and lack of interaction with the muslim community tragically some muslim men actually use islam to justify their abusive behavior focusing on rituals considering themselves to be islamically knowledgeable and disregarding the spirit of islam they wrongly use the qur'anic verse that says men are the protectors and maintainers of women to go on power trips demand total obedience and order their wives around they disregard the islamic requirement for the head of the household to consult with other members of the family when making decisions then if their wives dare to speak up or question their orders these men misinterpret a qur'anic verse that talks about how to treat a disobedient wife and use it as a license for abuse what more can we do to stop this assalam alaikom sister you know sisters could create informal support groups in their local community for other sisters who feel they are in abusive situations with the ultimate goal of counseling the couple giving good advice maybe bringing an imam or concerned brothers into the picture to council the husband divorce of course is not the answer as the man or in some few cases the woman will just remarry and continue the cycle it is up to us as an ummah to help our brothers and sisters change for the betterment of themselves and ultimately the entire ummah the better people we are the better muslims we can become insha'allah Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hijab Marriage Islam as a political movement Islam Divorce Qur'an Domestic violence History of Islam Religion Yusuf al-Qaradawi Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Polygamy Muhammad Liberal movements within Islam Succession to Muhammad Mary, the mother of Jesus Nation of Islam Isa Sunni Islam Dhimmi Religion and sexuality Hadith Infantilism Nikah Mut'ah Ten Commandments Islamist terrorism Ali French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Prophets of Islam Christianity Fundamentalism Caliph Apostasy in Islam Muslim ibn Aqeel Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi John the Baptist Historical persecution by Muslims Aisha Qiyamah Women as imams Homosexuality and Islam Chosen people Noah Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Jizya Islam and anti-Semitism Al-Ghazali Origin belief Shura Alawite Family Theory of conduct Predestination Muhammad's marriages Creationism Exorcism Democracy Transsexuality Sex segregation Islam in Indonesia Sufism Islam and clothing Religious conversion Scientology beliefs and practices Apostasy Talaq (Nikah) Homosexuality Qur'an alone Divisions of Islam Salah Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Islam in Turkey Islamic world Fathers' rights Islam in Egypt Laura Schlessinger Religious pluralism Theodicy Judaism Atheism Sexual orientation Feminism Eastern Orthodox Church Salvation Separation of church and state Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Conservatism Magic (paranormal) Status of religious freedom in Sudan Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
