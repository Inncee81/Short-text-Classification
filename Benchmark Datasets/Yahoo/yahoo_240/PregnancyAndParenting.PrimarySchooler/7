my daughter aged seems to be constipated and it's sunday evening here no chemists or doctors open no i mean none this is a small town so what can i give her at home that might help i don't have prunes in the house or i'd give her those any ideas for something in the average food cupboard that might do the trick thanks yes i am in australia i didn't know there was a nurse line i've just come from uk where they have the same thing thanks my daugter who is three suffers from severe constipation and the dr told me to buy her a laxative called para choc or lactcholose available from the chemist drug store i am in australia so the names of the drugs might vary a bit you just need to aks your pharmacist for the correct name i was told to give this to her for month and then wait amonth and try again however since it is sunday there i dont know if there would be a drug store open try giving her a warm bath and something for the pain of having a sore tummy but nothing with codeine in as this wil make her consitapation worse if you some kind of wheat cereal we use weetbix but anything with whole grains cheerios or fresh fruit such as apples and pears or fruit juice orange is the best however this will not work straight away it might take upto hours i know from experience if she is in really bad pain i would take her the local doctor and see if he or she can give and enema this is similiar to a sepository and will help to clear some of the blockage good luck Fecal incontinence Breakfast Breastfeeding Cereal Fruit Hamster Apple Fasting Migraine Cheerios Laxative Jewish cuisine Beer Clinical depression Diarrhea Alcoholic beverage Theory of conduct LSD Anorexia nervosa Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Analgesic Crohn's disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Adjustable gastric band Bread Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
