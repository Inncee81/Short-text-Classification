riding to school my yr old wants to ride to school but we have been told she has to wait till she is in grade but in most schools they have to do a bike educatation test before they ride their bikes to school who agrees with this i know i do but my child cant wait till grade as i want her to wait till then not grade please help depends on the area you are in we live in a quiet area so mine rode to school from an early age usually accompanied by my hubby or me till grade i think but i remember watching a programme on this subject and apparently we should not let children below the age of ride on there own something to do with the way there vision changes they can not see to the side the same way an adult does if you could accompany them that would be good as i think all kids should have the chance to ride it is good for them Education Grade (education) High school Education in Hong Kong Prostate cancer E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
