i'm a new piano's learner how i can play piano easier and be a become a good and fast learner plese give me some tips i really love to learn piano make sure you have some basic things down every day so that they quickly become habit sit high enough at the bench that your upper arms are level and that you can stay relaxed at all times don't droop your wrists as this leads to carpal tunnel syndrome when you practise enough warm up with chromatic major and minor scales and when you get to be more advanced play triads and inversions as well the triads you should know for each key are major minor diminished and augmented later you can do seventh chords and diminished chords you can look online to find out how to form each of these chords train your ear by trying to play songs you can sing from memory on the piano first determine what key the song is in by finding which note the song seems to resolve on this note is known as the tonic from there you can simply guess the melody notes by singing each interval aloud or in your head and locating it on the keyboard this ear training helps tremendously when your mind goes blank during a performance even if you forget where to place your hand you can still remember what you're supposed to play next a good way to start learning is to play some of the works written specifically for beginers many famous composers have written something like 'children's pieces' or an 'album for the young' try schumann's 'album fur die jugend' start learning each piece by making sure you understand the rhythms before you start to play start by learning the easier pieces such as humming song and mignon and only move up to harder pieces after mastering those some of the chopin preludes numbers would also be good to start with Tonality Chord (music) Sonata (music) Musical mode Interval (music) Harmonica Classical music era Chord symbol Minor scale Inversion (music) Seventh chord Fr__d__ric Chopin Romantic music Modulation (music) Figured bass Key (music) Accordion Diatonic functionality Just intonation Songwriter A Hard Day's Night (song) Fugue Blues Jazz Major scale Sonata form Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven) Twelve-tone technique Gy__rgy Ligeti Music Chromatic scale Baroque music Violin Ear training Robert Schumann Dog training Herbie Hancock Goldberg Variations Double bass Modal jazz Consonance and dissonance Concerto Timpani Counterpoint Tone cluster Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Serialism Diving Video game music Witold Lutos__awski Clarinet Olivier Messiaen Chord progression Camille Saint-Sa__ns Musical notation Queen (band) Ferruccio Busoni Gustav Mahler Time Out of Mind Johann Sebastian Bach Symphony Sergei Rachmaninoff A Day in the Life History of sonata form Piano Bebop Pentatonic scale Harp She Loves You Repetitive strain injury The Doors Charles Ives Symmetry Meantone temperament I Want to Hold Your Hand Tristan chord The Beatles March (music) Aerial (dance move) Electronic organ Joseph Haydn Carnatic music Franz Schubert Native American music Well-Tempered Clavier Please Please Me Tablature Claude Debussy Musical analysis Vladimir Horowitz
