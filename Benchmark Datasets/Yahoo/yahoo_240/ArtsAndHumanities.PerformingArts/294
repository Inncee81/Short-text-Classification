in final destination how does the kid who gets blown up by the grill get on deaths list he is on death list but he is not in the pile up and f hwould not have survivors had not survived then he would not be helping out kat and the car would have hit him okay the long answer is chaos theory basically put all random events tie into each other short answer he was destined to die by getting hit by a car he was saved and as a consequence all actions that were interrelated to his got skewed chaos theory so death had to reshuffle things pick a time and place to take this kid out and thankfully he did it in a very entertaining way another way to look at is that every event interrelated to his dying would have theoretically been altered or postponed if you want to delve into physics and another little giggler of a hypothetical theory of many worlds which like chaos theory states that for every action take every possible outcome of those actions will be played out through an infinite number of realities so boy doesn't die reality as it was supposed to play out doesn't so our reality skews along a different time line see back to the future ii to get things back to were they were supposed to be with him dying and the infinite number of lives that each event touched from his death to god knows what death just rewrote the script kid got killed our reality adjusts and the world moves on wrap you mind around that one time will ya Determinism Theory of conduct Causality Incarnations of Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Immortality Free will Time travel Theory Blackjack Randomness Intelligent design Meaning of life Friedrich Schleiermacher Donald Davidson (philosopher) Supergirl Special relativity EPR paradox G__del's incompleteness theorem Bubble Bobble Many worlds and possible worlds in literature and art Shawn Michaels Reality Normal distribution Law of value Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Occam's Razor Fischer Random Chess Dynamical system Karl Popper Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Origin belief Physics Scientific method Time Philosophy of space and time Episodes of Lost (Season 1) End of civilization Infinity The Invisibles Legacy of Kain Father's Day (Doctor Who) Speed of light Game theory Warcraft III Religion Infinite monkey theorem Faster-than-light Professional wrestling Probability theory Information warfare Consciousness German grammar Extensive form game The Dark Tower (series) Human nature Philosophy of language Hardware random number generator Soul Many-worlds interpretation Magic (paranormal) Reincarnation Grant Morrison Metaphysics Sin City Simone Weil Grandfather paradox Black hole Immanuel Kant Assassination David Hume The Amber Spyglass The Chronicles of Amber Survivor (novel) Scientology beliefs and practices Social psychology Game programmer Mafia (game) Supernatural Glen Jacobs Philosophy of science Naruto jutsu The Butterfly Effect Vegeta Socrates Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
