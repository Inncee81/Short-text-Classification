what to look for in a piano concerto i am starting to learn my first concerto is there a special characteristic that is associated with concertos any tips and suggestion thanks a concerto is a piece written for solo or soli more than one instrument s with orchestral accompaniment most recordings you get of a concerto will have an orchestra as the accompaniment since most of us don't have a full orchestra at our disposal then the accompaniment part has been adapted for piano when you perform this piece at a recital or competition there will be two pianos one for you the soloist and one one for the accompanist concertos typically consist of three movements the first movement is usually more technical and quite flashy the second mvmt is typically slower and lyrical and the third mvmt is usually quite upbeat like a dance or jig with a big finish find a few recordings of the piece by different artists everyone interprets pieces differently make sure you get all three movements if you plan on learning all of them itunes is a great source and its cheap familiarize yourself with how it sounds do everything your teacher says the way your teacher says even it seems superfluous go slow with the technical sections and don't try to rush up to the performance tempo before you're ready make the metronome your new best friend the pickier and more precise you can be while learning a new piece the more headache you'll save later on i also find it very helpful to do some research on the composer of the piece and find out why he she wrote it and what was going on in the world or in his her life when it was written this helps me gain insight into how the piece should be interpreted good luck on this major endeavor and important milestone in your musical career Sonata form Philip Glass Tempo Sonata (music) Johann Sebastian Bach Musical works of Mozart Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven) Brandenburg concertos Piano concerto Sergei Rachmaninoff Symphony Double bass Henry Cowell John Cage Cello Joseph Haydn Classical music era Maurice Ravel Nikolai Karlovich Medtner Viola Anton Bruckner Olivier Messiaen Music genre Bassoon Felix Mendelssohn Orchestra Program music Igor Stravinsky Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) Blues Vladimir Horowitz Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Glenn Gould Baroque music Edward Elgar Fugue Song Klezmer Violin Concerto (Beethoven) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Heitor Villa-Lobos Choir Charles Ives Bass clarinet Grammy Award Harpsichord Luciano Berio Clarinet Concerto (Mozart) The Creation Big band Edvard Grieg Yo-Yo Ma Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart) Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji Conducting Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart) Violin Ralph Vaughan Williams George Gershwin Arnold Schoenberg Piano Ern__ Dohn__nyi Concert band Salsa music Music of Brittany Leonard Bernstein Orchestration Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) Sinfonia Elliott Carter Elodie Lauten Steve Reich Violin Concerto (Berg) Romantic music Jean Sibelius Turkish music (style) Benjamin Britten Violin concerto Martha Argerich Goldberg Variations Grammy Awards of 1960 Camille Saint-Sa__ns Native American music
