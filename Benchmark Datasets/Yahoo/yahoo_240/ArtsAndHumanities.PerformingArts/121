i'm a lefty should i play left handed guitar i've jsut started having guitar lessons last week and right now i have a rght handed guitar i'm left handed and i've been wondering if i should play left handed guitar i think the first time how he told me how to hold i had it switched arund but he corrected me so which should i play plus if i'm going to play left handed will it be more expensive i'm a lefty too but i play right handed guitars and basses i would go with what's more comfortable to you but you should consider that at the outset it's easier for folks to teach you in the in the standard right handed position there are more right handed guitars to select from a lot of times left handed guitars may cost a bit more if they are available in the model that you're looking at chord charts and tablature are going to be reversed and there is usually a right handed guitar to use if there are jam sessions that you attend and want to sit in on if you didn't bring your guitar with that being said there are a more than a few famous lefties that play left handed guitars and basses good luck btw it's not any harder to learn the right handed way of playing Harmonica Blood on the Tracks Guitar Highway 61 Revisited Tablature Electric guitar Blonde on Blonde Brian Jones (musician) Violin Time Out of Mind Double bass I Want to Hold Your Hand The Yardbirds Buddy Guy Queen (band) Oasis (band) Bringing It All Back Home Red Hot Chili Peppers Rock (music) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Slide guitar Dog training Country music Donovan Lonnie Donegan Twelve string guitar The Velvet Underground A Hard Day's Night (song) Blur Musical notation The Shadows Music genre Joy Division (band) The La's John Frusciante Mouse (computing) The Stone Roses Slow Train Coming Rush (band) Bob Dylan (album) Beyond Shadows DrumMania Mot__rhead Mandolin The Beatles Hey Jude Fender Telecaster Therion (band) Another Side of Bob Dylan The Waterboys The Cure She Loves You Eric Clapton Warren Haynes Alice Cooper New Morning The Church Van Halen Bon Jovi Bolt Thrower (band) Left-handed Trey Anastasio Jazz The Wedding Present James Hetfield Def Leppard 1957 World Series The Kinks Sex Pistols Frankie Goes to Hollywood King Crimson Harp Pearl Jam Black Sabbath Music of Ireland Aerial (dance move) The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Planet Waves Swingout Eddie Van Halen Love and Theft Iron Maiden Rod Stewart Led Zeppelin Chord (music) Carter USM 2000 Australian Grand Prix Quarashi The Ventures Fleetwood Mac The Who Elton John Guns N' Roses Nirvana (band) GuitarFreaks The Masters Apprentices Bohemian Rhapsody Layla
