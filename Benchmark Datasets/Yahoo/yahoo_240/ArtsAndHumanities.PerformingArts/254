another newbie violin question is it absolutely necessary to get a violin teacher go to violin classes when starting for the first time i realise it will make a huge difference but is it doable alone keep in mind i have no aspiration to play in an orchestra or become famous i would just like to have a competent ability skill in playing be able to play basics is this possible i'm a violin teacher so i can't believe i'm saying this but no you don't need a teacher my dad taught himself the violin it will be much more difficult by yourself and you are pretty much guaranteed to pick up bad habits but if you have no professional aspirations i don't see why you can't do it yourself it's just like skiing you can teach yourself but you'll get better faster with a teacher Violin Martial art Alexander Technique Team Fortress Classic Teacher Sonata (music) Cello Suzuki method Clarinet Joke Snowboarding Tai Chi Chuan Niccol__ Paganini Education in Japan Education in the United States Education Itzhak Perlman The Fairly OddParents Education in Portugal Philosophical skepticism Social rule Orchestra Double bass Aikido Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Olivier Messiaen Fast bowling Mauro Giuliani Timpani Secondary education in France Milton H.
