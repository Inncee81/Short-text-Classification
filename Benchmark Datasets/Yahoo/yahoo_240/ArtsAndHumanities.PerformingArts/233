teach yourself violin help ok i have a violin but i have no idea how to play and i cant really afford lessons i keep looking online and all i can find is how to tune a violin or the names of the different parts of the violin i cant find anything that actually shows you how to play are there any websites out there where you can learn songs on the violin i know the have lots of guitar tabs and stuff for diff songs but i cant find any for violins i'm guessing because violins dont have frets i would like to learn at least one song that i could practice over and over again until i can get lessons any ideas also to any violinist that might be reading this got any advice besides the obvious get lessons lol i posted a few links to questions i have answered in the past that are similar to this one they should have everything you need and if not let me know and i'll be glad to send out some more p s kudos to jkf alone for the encouraging post it is always nice to see someone who isn't trying to discourage put down or intimidate a potential player it's an honor to be on the boards with you Violin Bass guitar Guitar Tablature Suzuki method Double bass Self Portrait Charles Ives Viola Avenue Q Sampling (music) Mandolin Cello Plame affair B3ta Goju Ryu Blood on the Tracks Newbie Electric guitar Bon Jovi Banjo Internet troll Timpani Legend of Zelda series songs Django Reinhardt Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Theory of conduct Singlish Authentic performance Ukulele Wheel of Fortune Meaning of life Pet Sounds Music lesson Tool (band) Little Britain Jumpstart 3rd Grade Tic-Tac-Dough Tapping Slide guitar Extreme Programming Olivier Messiaen $ale of the Century Viol Jeopardy!
