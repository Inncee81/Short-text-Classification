stereo speakers question i'm trying to get the best speakers for my stereo receiver here are my receiver details power output stereo mode ohms thd hz khz x w total harmonic distortion ohms w khz for safe amplifier operation use the speakers with impedance of over ohms when you use only speaker a or b terminals and use the speakers with impedance of over ohms when you use both speaker a and b terminals what should i be looking for in a speaker it is a sherwood receiver model rx for this receiver you want to look for a speaker system that has a nominal impedance of ohms or higher since there are very few speaker systems that are ohms you only need to get speakers if you do get speakers only run of them at a time unless you are able to somehow find ohm speakers since your receiver is not really full range as far as the frequency response is concerned hz khz or wider is considered full range any speaker system that will play down to hz to hz in the bass frequencies will be more than sufficient to make the most out of your receiver to give you an idea many bookshelf speakers will be able to cover the frequency response of the receiver just fine on the other hand most large floorstanding speakers will not sound any deeper in the bass than a minimonitor speaker system because your speakers will only go as low as your receiver so it will not be cost effective to get a large speaker system not knowing what music you listen to at what level you listen and the size of your room i can give you a few choices that will match well with each criteria if you want a speaker that will play loud actually at db v m are the most efficient stand mount monitors on the market that i've seen and or you have a large room i e ' x ' or larger the bic acoustech ht bookshelf speakers will do quite well i own a pair if you want a speaker that is smooth sounding with clarity that is easy to listen to for most types of music the silverline audio minuet minimonitors are very small but will cover your receiver's frequency range and is one of the most easy speakers to drive because of its extremely stable impedance this is a high end speaker system meaning it is capable of the highest quality of sound for its size using premium quality components the price will be relatively higher than your typical consumer electronics speakers i've auditioned these impressive little gems if you want a floorstanding speaker system so you won't have to put the speakers on stands or on something else that sounds very good with most music and not cost an arm and a leg is the athena as f i hope this at the very least puts you on the right road to finding musical and channel home theater bliss Electronic amplifier Microphone Impedance matching Transformer Operational amplifier Electrophysiology Subwoofer Bass guitar High fidelity Circuit design Decibel Antenna (radio) MP3 Oscilloscope Audio system measurements Transistor Gramophone record Sound Blaster Resistor Laserdisc Digital-to-analog converter Bose Corporation Super Audio CD Low-pass filter Stereoscopy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Music radio Digital audio broadcasting Audio crossover Kenwood Electronics Impedance Mixing console Compact disc Stereophonic sound Magnetic cartridge Voltage source Amstrad CPC Input impedance Analog-to-digital converter Advanced Audio Coding Solar cell Capacitor Federal Standard 1037C Bicycle lighting Headphones Wind turbine Phase-locked loop Sega CD Sound recording Radio controlled airplane Frequency synthesiser Phonograph KEF Double bass Atari ST Harmonica Inflation Amateur radio Movie projector High-definition television RISC Computer Surround sound Electronic organ Car audio Speech recognition RC circuit Laser Acorn Electron Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster 8 mm video format HD Radio Radio Coaxial cable Jack plug IBM PC compatible Modem Vorbis Vacuum tube Output impedance Switched-mode power supply Corporate governance Flute Digital photography CPU design Home cinema Gas metal arc welding
