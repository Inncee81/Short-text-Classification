does anyone know about wiring up speakers replacing speakers in speaker cabinets etc i have an old set of marantz home speakers and the inch woofer blew out so i put in a alesis pa speaker and when i play the speaker now it lights up on the inside and i can see it through the air release port is it possible this is not the proper wiring and the wires are heating up and im going to ruin this speaker yeah it sounds like you will end up damaging something transducers in this case your woofers cannot be mixed and matched each type has it's own impedance wattage rating and each has it's own spl so if these weren't causing damage it is unlikely that they are the same sensitivety as the originals they probably need to be crossed over to the high frequencies at somewhere else in the audioband too if you can't find someone to fix 'em try to find the original ratings ideal volume wattage rating and spl frequency slope on line and find new woofers that come close there are several marantz owners on the web that can help Loudspeaker Subwoofer Audio crossover Circuit design Transformer Antenna (radio) Impedance matching Vacuum tube Sound pressure level Transmission line Transistor Electronic organ Electronic amplifier Car audio Tweeter Fuse (electrical) Audiophile Bass guitar Jet engine Resistor Operational amplifier Low-pass filter Oscilloscope Incandescent light bulb Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hard disk Tire Welding Electrostatic loudspeaker Decibel Fire fighting Delay line memory Acoustics Sound Tesla coil Electric motor Spark plug Atari 8-bit family DualDisc Overhead lines Color Diving regulator Gas metal arc welding Piezoelectricity Impedance Speed of sound Lightning Hearing impairment Capacitor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets M16 (rifle) Hearing aid Magnet Resonance Potentiometer Drill bit Professional wrestling match types Thermostat Carburetor Relay Diode Coaxial cable Internal ballistics Blasting cap Frequency Torpedo Burglar alarm Game Boy Electrical wiring Synthesizer Solar power KEF Compact disc Two-stroke cycle Overhead powerline X10 (industry standard) Fan (implement) High fidelity Barbed wire Phoneme Dance Dance Revolution Overclocking Mattress Original Amiga chipset Tank Headphones Web crawler TGV Modem Klipsch Sensor Electrical generator Circuit breaker Severe weather terminology (United States) Naval mine Sound recording Flux Temperature Furnace
