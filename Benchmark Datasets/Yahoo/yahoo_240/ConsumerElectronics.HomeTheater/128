who knows about the bose speakers how is the sound are they good for electronic musics and what amp is good for them and how is the high frequency sound of is it from back or front of the speakers and can a high frequency sound be ok when it coms from back of the speakers and how is the high frequency sound of is it from back or front of the speakers can a high frequency sound be ok when it coms from the back of the speakers hi the bose direct reflecting loudspeaker was released in by dr amar bose who founded the bose corp in he studied at the massachusetts institute of technology where he became an electrical engineer he also studied in the field of psychoacoustics his loudspeaker design was the result of extensive research into how we interpret the sound we hear at a live event he maintained that at a live event we hear more reflected sound than direct sound this is the principal incorporated into the the speaker enclosure is in the shape of a triangle at the rear of the enclosure are eight inch full range drivers four on each angle of the triangle and one inch full range speaker on the front baffle the original was advertised as having unlimited power handling capacity i have only heard it once in at the first hi fi consumer show in australia it was being demonstrated in one of the rooms of the hotel where the show was being held it was driven by a bose watt per channel amplifier which had a special equalizer to extend the frequency range in the bass and treble region the sound stage was enormous and sound was all around the room as the result of the speakers in the rear of the enclosure facing the front wall of the room it was a type of sound you either loved or hated enormous sound stage at the expense of pin point accuracy as the years progressed the speaker had many alterations to improve its sound and dispersion pattern and it has survived to day in the latest version the series v so the bottom line is to listen first to see if you like the sound additional information each of the little speakers is a full range speaker hard to believe isn't it each speaker radiates the bass midrange and treble so the treble is bouncing off the walls with the rear drivers and radiating towards you with the single front speaker you hear treble as a delayed and forward dispersion but it will not sound as sharp and clear as a single forward facing tweeter in a normal speaker in other words it is diffused that is why you must listen to them to see if you can live with them i hope that helps Bass guitar Subwoofer Audiophile Microphone Instrument amplifier KEF High fidelity Surround sound Antenna (radio) Headphones Transformer Car audio Stereophonic sound Leslie speaker Radar Headlight Acoustics Hearing impairment Speed of light Audio crossover Equine conformation MP3 Gramophone record Klipsch Electrostatic loudspeaker Tank Radio Solar cell Universal Serial Bus Electronic amplifier TGV Magnet Piezoelectricity Transmitter Transistor Low-pass filter Timpani Car handling Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Psychoacoustics Professional wrestling throws Piano Light-emitting diode Kenwood Electronics DVD Laser Hard disk M16 (rifle) Impedance matching Motorcycle Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound effect Electric guitar Television Compact disc Electric motor View camera Electromagnetic radiation Mazda RX-7 Computer Oscilloscope Wind turbine Advanced Technology Attachment Phonograph Solar power Rail terminology Helicopter Electromagnetic spectrum John F.
