what is this transformer doing on the back of my speaker i found an old tube radio from the swap shed the dump and it has a speaker with a transformer on the back of it what is the purpose of this transfomer i havent tired out the unit yet im gunna re wire everything first its all a mess but the tubes look to be intact and the attendant at the landfill said he knoes the person that had it its fine just very old and needs new wiring its an old westinghouse in a custom box i guess they didnt knoe the value of free operational tube amps the transformer matches the impedance of the final amplifier stage of the tube amp which is typically k ohms or more to the low impedance of the speaker typically ohms solid state circuits generally don't need a matching transformer like this Transformer Operational amplifier Impedance matching Circuit design Electrophysiology Electronic amplifier Transistor Loudspeaker Bass guitar Impedance Oscilloscope Nominal impedance Resistor Capacitor Instrument amplifier Antenna (radio) Marshall Amplification Electric guitar Coaxial cable Vacuum tube Decibel Valve sound Relay Ohm's law Transmitter Computer Current source Alternating current Audiophile Output impedance Transmission line Current (electricity) Kenwood Electronics Guitar Electrical resistance Voltage source Electronics Fossil fuel power plant Tesla coil Integrated circuit Superconductivity RC circuit Series and parallel circuits Electricity Delay line memory Thermal power station Electric power transmission Electrometer Input impedance RLC circuit Solar power Analysis of resistive circuits Damping factor Amplifier Travelling wave tube amplifier Effects unit Ampere Landfill Electrical engineering Ohm Semiconductor device Magnet Password X10 (industry standard) Transconductance Voltage drop Electrical network Phase-locked loop Tire Dog agility Crystal oscillator Inductor Printed circuit board Mass spectrometry Bombe Residual-current device John Myung Three-phase electric power Diode Electricity meter Maxwell's equations Glass Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Cray-1 Central processing unit War of Currents Electric motor Low-pass filter Circuit breaker Nikola Tesla Cable television Logic gate Quizbowl Welding power supply AT&T George Westinghouse Electrostatic loudspeaker DIY audio Valve amplifier
