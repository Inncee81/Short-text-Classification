dvd image looks blocky solutions whenever i watch a dvd gradients appears as bands of color instead of beeing smooth giving the images a 'blocky' feel this is especially apparent during night scenes where black zones are very pixellated normal tv programs don't have this problem i'm not familiar with all that technology i see that my dvd player and tv have all sorts of input and output jacks currently i use a cable with yellow plugs to link dvd and tv my tv is a conventional crt toshiba model af c my dvd player is a panasonic dvd f any hints on how i could improve this thanks banding is a symptom of low color resolution i would expect to see it on an lcd since it only supports bit per color but on a crt it is really unusual composite video yellow plug is not exactly the best way to watch a dvd but you should definitely not see any banding on a crt tv i suspect that the video dac of your dvd player is not fully functional or the composite input to your tv may have a problem try another dvd player with your tv to see if it is a tv or dvd player issue or try your player with another tv Television DVD Laserdisc Liquid crystal display Atari 8-bit family Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Game Boy High-definition television SCART Nintendo GameCube IPod Xbox MPEG-2 Nintendo DS Stereoscopy Game Boy Advance Nintendo Entertainment System Digital Visual Interface Atari ST Original Amiga chipset IMac PlayStation Portable Laptop RGB color model Cathode ray tube Xbox 360 Computer display Raster graphics Digital photography Apple II family Color Graphics Adapter 2D computer graphics Windows Vista Analog-to-digital converter Nintendo Revolution ATI Technologies Sega Dreamcast Amstrad CPC Commodore 64 Sinclair ZX81 Video codec Color Creative Zen DualDisc Enterprise content management Dither TFT LCD H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Audiophile RCA connector Panasonic Sound Blaster Computer graphics Nintendo 64 Digital projector Rendering (computer graphics) PowerBook Oscilloscope S-Video TurboGrafx 16 TrueType Computer animation EMac X Window System History of computer and video games Apple IIGS Camcorder Mouse (computing) Handheld game console 1080p Copy protection USB flash drive Video Aliasing Plasma display Digital-to-analog converter MOS Technology VIC-II Holography JPEG 2000 IBM PC compatible Digital cinema S-VHS MP3 Gamma correction Palm OS Sega Saturn Tungsten Handheld YUV
