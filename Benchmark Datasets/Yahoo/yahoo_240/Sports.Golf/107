am i good enough to play highschool golf hey i just started playing golf about months ago and my varsity highschool tryouts are next week i just wanted to know if the kids on highschool golf teams are really that good i think im decent and i know some people on the golf team that can't be that great no offense to the golfing community but golf is the shit of sports in my highschool we're big into football and lacrosse i don't think many people will tryout it really depends on how good the school is at golf i played on our varsity team for years in high school just graduated we won state championships and state championship runner up titles our top golfers only on varsity each tournament could break so two on junior varsity could break we consistently had scores in the s every tournament and our school holds one of the lowest rounds in the history of high school golf in kansas in the last years including this year we have had people play golf at d schools what i'm pointing out is an extreme we were one of the top golf programs in the state for years and if you couldn't shoot in the s you had no chance of being on varsity however many schools in the area had people that wouldn't break all year for holes it just depends on the school and how serious people are about golf Golf Tiger Woods The Open Championship Jack Nicklaus Texas Longhorn Athletics U.S. Open (golf) Georgia Institute of Technology PGA Tour PGA Championship Vijay Singh Education in Romania Gary Player Official World Golf Rankings Lacrosse Norway national football team Match play Michelle Wie Sudden death Boston College Athletics Sports timeline Stanford University Primera Divisi__n Argentina Cincinnati Bengals Playoff World Series Syracuse University Orange Annika S__renstam Southeastern Conference Atlantic Coast Conference Junior varsity Ryder Cup Bowl Championship Series Washington State University PGA European Tour The Big Break Leon White Florida State University Water polo Ultimate (sport) Snooker Sports in Puerto Rico Clements High School Michael Campbell Paintball United States Golf Association Sport in Ireland American football Pittsburgh Steelers July 2005 in sports Luther Head Baseball Chris Benoit Cleveland Browns University of Houston Rugby union Poker jargon University of Denver Hazeltine National Golf Club Northwestern University New Mexico Lobo Basketball Double the Fist May 2005 in sports Tulane University Virginia Commonwealth University Michigan Wolverines Women's majors Nick Faldo Lincoln-Douglas Debate Hunter College High School All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship National Football League The Contender (television series) Sandy Koufax University of Arizona Basketball Big East Conference High school HSBC World Match Play Championship Bundesliga (football) New York Knicks Columbia University University of California, Los Angeles Pennsylvania State University FC Rostov Troms__ I.L.
