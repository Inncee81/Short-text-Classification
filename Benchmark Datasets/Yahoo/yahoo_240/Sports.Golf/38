on a golf telecast with the camera behind the player the ball always appears to go to the right why two answers if the camera is truly directly behind the golfer then s he is drawing the ball for a right hander towards the target a draw is like playing a baby hook on purpose contrarily if the ball appeared to go left at impact when the camera is directly behind a right handed golfer then the golfer is hitting a cut baby slice if the camera is actually a little off center meaning to the viewer's right for the right handed golfer but still behind the golfer then it's the illusion of two dimensional television keep in the mind that while the ball appears to be going to the right in reality it is travelling away and up from its original position but on tv it appears to be going to the right and up even if the camera was off center and a right handed golfer was hitting a cut the ball would still appear to be going to the right now if the camera zoomed out so you could see the entire ball flight which would be very difficult considering the size of the ball the angle from the ball to its right when it rises wouldn't be as significant this is simply because you are further away from the ball of course none of this says anything about a shank Golf Golf glossary Snooker Golf club (equipment) Billiards Table tennis Baseball Volleyball Fast bowling Caddy View camera Tennis Glossary of American football Ryder Cup Disc golf Mouse (computing) IMAX Water polo Seishun Academy Middle School Four square Greg Norman Softball Field hockey Deep Impact (space mission) Digital photography Tiger Woods Cricket The Big Break Leg before wicket Eight ball Major League Baseball television contracts Golf ball Vin Scully Digital camera Michelle Wie Ben Hogan Sudden death Stereoscopy Photography Bullet Vijay Singh Apollo 8 Magic (illusion) Polo Grounds Hot Shots Golf (series) Katamari Damacy Collision detection Photographic lens Sprite (computer graphics) Resident Evil 4 Golf handicap Anchor Oscilloscope Bad Wolf Combine (Half-Life 2) Wrigley Field Lawrence Whistler Tag Internal ballistics Jack Nicklaus National Football League Pinball Quake III Arena MTV2 GunBound Panoramic photography Laws of cricket Professional golf tours 3D projection Opportunity rover Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Drill bit Nick Faldo Autostereogram Rugby union positions Left-handed American football strategy Anamorphic widescreen Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Starfleet ranks and insignia Reality Sun Coriolis effect Comparison of Canadian and American football Leica Arnold Palmer Helicopter Manifold MLB on FOX Candlepin bowling Bass guitar Bobby Jones (golfer) Surveillance The Open Championship PGA Tour
