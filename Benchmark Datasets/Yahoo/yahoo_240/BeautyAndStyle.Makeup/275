what can i use to clean the make up brush i use for foundation you can choose to purchase makeup bruch removers but i find that baby shampoo as already previously mentioned works very well it is gentle enough to use on the bristles of your brush with no harsh chemical fillers but is strong enough to remove the bacterial residue from your brush and also remember the way you clean your brush is just as important as what you clean it with here are some key steps using lukewarm water run your foundation brush under the tap with the bristles pointing in a slanted downward fashion do not let the bristles point up under the water as this will damage them and cause the glue at the base to loosen after the bristles are wet squirt a small dollop of baby shampoo into the palm of your hand and dip your brush into the shampoo and gently stroke it through several times act as if you were dipping the brush into foundation using the same gentle motion that you would use to apply it to your face do not swirl the brush as this will change the shape of your bristles and instead stroke it through next rinse it off under the lukewarm tap water and lay it dry on a clean piece of paper towel do not ever let it dry upright as this will cause the bristles to become loose clean your brush every weeks Brush Manicure Brazing Shampoo Dry cleaning Hand washing Car washing techniques Upholstery Sento Menstrual cup Pottery Soldering Dairy Coir Agar plate Drawing Gilding Japanese tea ceremony Bong Mattress Drowning Knife Fecal incontinence Tattoo Halitosis Japanese toilet Casting Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Hemp Towel Acne Aerial (dance move) Massage Tooth Sewage treatment 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Paint Vacuum cleaner Screw Hangul Weaving Diving Electric motor Dishwasher Fire extinguisher Collecting fossils Shroud of Turin Psoriasis Toothbrush Bladderwort Washroom Soap Sauna Canoe Paper Glossary of partner dance terms Breaststroke Plastic Toilet paper Hat Urinary incontinence Seismic retrofit Hamster Violin Welding Fluoride therapy Conducting Equine conformation Beach Bonsai Glaze Dreadlocks Wok Chopsticks Glossary of climbing terms Drill bit Tobacco Whitewater Leaf Wound Printmaking Breastfeeding Tap dance Otitis externa Carnivorous plant Comanche Water Sterilization (microbiology) Tempera Triclosan Sea-Monkey Tanning Diseases of the honeybee Hyperthermia Sulfuric acid Car wash Empire Burlesque Gas metal arc welding
