is it true foundation is good for your skin in the winter i heard that foundation was good for your skin in the winter because i no it clogs your pores up but i need a straight answer whether its good or bad for you skin please help this is strictly my opinion but i would say bad most of them don't allow your skin to breath and obviously yes it clogs your pores i use to use the chanel foundation and at almost for one compact i was sure it wouldn't give me breakouts like the more cheaper stuff but i was wrong once i stopped using all foundaton my skin started to clear up in a matter of weeks it's been over a year since i stopped using it and the difference is remarkable my skin is clear enough now that i have no need of foundation anyway so best advice is even though it may be hard at first to walk around without it you'll be happier in the long run and also don't over wash your face f cking with it all time i e cleansers astringents toners facials etc is just way too much you ever notice that alot of men don't have skin problems like women it's because they're not screwing with their face all the time i use a cheap ivory soap bar and scrub my face every to days the days in between are just water this keeps in the natural emullients and oils and prevents drying out if your skin is naturally oily however i'd recommend scrubbing once a day or max every other day trust me this really works my skin is clearer Cleanser Acne Tattoo Theory of conduct Soap Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Hard water 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Shaving Dialysis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ethics Violin Plame affair Sento Eczema Soap opera Current teachings of Prem Rawat Skin Wood Sydney Riot of 1879 Mosquito Leather Manicure Philosophical skepticism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Yarrow Shaggy dog story Babe Ruth Weather lore Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Diving Drill bit The Ashlee Simpson Show Diving suit Oily fish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dandruff Mummy Textile manufacturing Bong Physical attractiveness Merit Menstrual cup Human Hamster Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Urinary incontinence Cancer Equine conformation Dry cleaning Use of poison gas in World War I 1957 World Series Plastic First aid The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urea Jute Dragon Booster Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Radio Yerevan Time Out of Mind Astringent Rosacea Non-native pronunciations of English Electrophysiology Ex-gay Goodness and value theory Aerial (dance move) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cruising (maritime) Car washing techniques Carburetor The Inside Operation Market Garden Utilitarianism Theodicy Discordianism Avenue Q Winter War Thermal power station Hey Jude Solar power Boom Town (Doctor Who) Economics Decompression sickness Japanese toilet Mud People The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Porosity David Hume Appeal Dairy
