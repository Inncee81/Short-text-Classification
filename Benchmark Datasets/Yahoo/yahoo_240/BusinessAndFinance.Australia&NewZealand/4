quick question on australian tax return hey i put my tax return in on friday right online i saw that it takes like standard weeks but a few people i know got it in like days they didnt have any claims or anything so i was thinking did they get their return quicker because of less processing all they put in was group certificates and claimed no deductions since i only put group certificates in and claimed nothing else whatsoever no benefits no savings no inheritance nothing i am expecting hoping to get my return tomorrow a week from when i put it in can anyone verify this at all thanks i dont know if i dont owe but i did it online and they gave me an estimate the processing of a tax return lodged electronically is generally quite quick however things can always get in the way to hold things up just like any other workplace can get held up on things such as the mail system it system etc that's why they say allow weeks be patient and wait until weeks is up then give the ato a call if you haven't received anything while a lot of people can get their refund within a week unexpected things can always get in the way Credit card Social Security (United States) United States Postal Service Taxation in the United States Publicly funded medicine SAT Unemployment benefit Insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tax credit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Australian industrial relations legislation, 2005 Extreme Programming Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Enterprise content management Flat tax Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Life insurance Public-key cryptography Census FairTax Politics of Canada Health insurance Social rule Microeconomics Wal-Mart 2000 Australian Grand Prix ISO 9000 Current teachings of Prem Rawat Electronic voting Past teachings of Prem Rawat Internet fraud Appeal Theory of conduct Warren Buffett Surveillance Jennifer Lopez Ponzi scheme Supply-side economics Food Stamp Program Octopus card Philosophy of science London Congestion Charge Gross domestic product Depreciation Income trust Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Goodness and value theory XML Treasury security National Insurance Debugging Religious Society of Friends Capitalism Progressive tax Capital gains tax Blood on the Tracks Tax bracket Minimum wage Time Out of Mind Boom Crash Opera Software engineering Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dividend imputation Otakon Mathematics Sydney Riot of 1879 Organic food The Chemical Brothers Python programming language Leadership Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soap opera Liberalism Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Creationism Alan Campbell (pastor) Keynesian economics Outsourcing 2005 Kashmir earthquake Security (finance) Mail EFTPOS Gold as an investment Bond Sigmund Freud Logic Expert system John McDouall Stuart February 15, 2003 global anti-war protest Social Security debate (United States) Phishing Patent Barbara Boxer Trade union Single certification Nuclear power
