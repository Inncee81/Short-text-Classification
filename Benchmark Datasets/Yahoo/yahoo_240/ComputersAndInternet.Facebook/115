facebook highschool network i am switching high schools so i left my high school network and now when i try to get into my new one it says i need to be in high school to join a high school network i even added people in that network to my friends list but it still says this after about months of trying how can i get into the network or how can i contact an admin theres nothing on the help page to contact one changing high schools we can move you from one network to another just go to the networks tab of the account page and identify the school to which you've been moved just so you know we only allow you to move one time every six months if you are moving around faster than that you should probably have a little talk with your parents also please note that if you move to a school that you do not attend and are reported for doing so you will be permanently banned from the site what it says on the help page if that doesn't help look through it and see what else http hs facebook com help php page Facebook (website) PHP GameFAQs Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie MSN Messenger Windows XP Uniform Resource Locator LiveJournal Gmail Web crawler Windows 2000 Education in Romania Multimedia Messaging System Internet Group Management Protocol IP Multimedia Subsystem Mozilla Firefox Whois Uniform Resource Identifier Mozilla Application Suite Wheel of Fortune No Child Left Behind Act The Best Page in the Universe Wget World Wide Web Instant messaging French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Stopping e-mail abuse Perl High school Web application MAC address Cornelia Rau Cellular network Common Unix Printing System CPAN The Internet Movie Database EMule Independent Media Center Web browser Domain Name System Denial-of-service attack Jabber Phishing Opera (web browser) America Online SAT Virtual hosting Wikipedia Blog MySQL Apache HTTP Server Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cross site scripting Google Talk Secondary education Spyware Internet AOL Instant Messenger Transmission Control Protocol E-mail ITunes Skype YaBB Quicksort Representational State Transfer Short message service Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix BitTorrent Universal Plug and Play Palm OS London Congestion Charge Tab Belinda Stronach Internet Relay Chat Proxy server Friends Neopets RuneScape cheats Great Teacher Onizuka Friendster GSM services Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Orkut The Star Wars Holiday Special Multiprotocol Label Switching Malcolm in the Middle PHP-Nuke Corporal punishment Flight controls Associative array TV Tome ITU-T Local area network Plame affair Miranda IM Link-state routing protocol Etisalat
