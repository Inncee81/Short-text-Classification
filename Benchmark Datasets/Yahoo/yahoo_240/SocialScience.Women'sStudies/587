why don't ment like pubic hair on girls but seem to love it on themselves i really want to know my boyfriend wants me to stay shaved and smooth but he rarely trims himself why are men like this don't they know how bad it hurts to cut yourself down there how bad nair burns and how tortuous it is when it grows back because it itches like hell and we can't scratch at it i don't find it disgusting to have pubic hair as long as it's trimed and under control but if steve boyfriend ever sees it the mood tends to die almost instantly could someone please educate me as to why men hate hair on women but have man pube fros of their own ok i will take this time to point out my boyfriend isn't a complete jerk just because he has a personal prefrence he was just an example of what i was talking about with my question i'm not planning on leaving him i'm pregnant with his kid i gave him my virginity and ever since he found out about the pregnancy he won't even let me carry my own dishes to the sink anymore because he doesn't want me to get hurt last night he mentioned that he didn't like it and he didn't want to have sex but i do suspect that it's because he's afraid to do anything while i'm pregnant the subject has come up before and it has stopped us from having sex a time or two but my boyfriend isn't the big issue here it's just me wondering why men never seem to like pubic hair i've been to an art musem where there was a painting of a naked women which is apparently art and she had pubic hair there was a crowd of men wondering when the razor was invented or if she'd ever heard of one i think its just a matter of personal preference cause all of my past bfs have preferred for me to actually have hair with my first bf i shaved cause thats what i thought guys liked and he was like hon i prefer natural luckily i havent had super hairy men either Kodocha Pubic hair EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Friends Knots Landing Sex and the City Hair The Amber Spyglass Ranma __ characters The Inside Sin City Phoebe Buffay's songs Haircut Futurama (TV series - season 5) Marilyn Monroe George Costanza Social rule Recurring South Park characters Beard Radio Yerevan Survivor (novel) Shaving Androgen insensitivity syndrome Neighbours Piccolo Junior Saga Pok__mon Live!
