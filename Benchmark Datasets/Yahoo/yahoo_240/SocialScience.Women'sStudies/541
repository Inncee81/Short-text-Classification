why are feminists so quick to dismiss the faults and wrongs of women i posted a question that stated women commit more domestic violence than men right away all the women were like give me a source thats not true more men are in jail you have to take into consideration the fact that most men do not report acts of violence done to them by women as much as vica versa if a man slaps a women he might get arrested a women would have to seriously injure a man before he would call the police or report it you also have to take into consideration the fact that violent acts by women are not take as 'seriously' and women often get lighter or no jail sentence for the same crime a man commits why can't women admit that they are just as big a part of the problems in this world as men are women are not as abusive as men sorry that statement is pure sh t women are more emotionally and psychologically abusive men don't complain as much so it seems like men are more abusive i agree no one should hit anybody man or woman a woman that hits a man is just as wrong as a man that hits a woman Domestic violence Rape Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Spousal abuse Sin City Plame affair Serial killer Fathers' rights Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Ex-gay Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 EastEnders Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) O.
