do you agree with the views of the author r v connell in his book masculinities connell argued that there is no such thing as a single concept of masculinity but rather that many different masculinities exist each associated with different positions of power i think it depends on where you are examining the idea from if we are talking a multiple culture scale then yes of course that makes sense if you are looking at just one culture and trying to examine ideas of masculinity within it then at least in my culture it seems as though there is one over arching ideal for masculinity but multiple ways of expressing it and embodying it for example being a ceo with a power suit and tie is seen as masculine but so in heavy labor such as construction however both have their roots in a powerful image that we associate with masculinity only one is physical power and the other is financial i would take the concept of multiple masculinities in this case and say something more like multi faceted masculinity also if we want to take this farther than just concepts and expectations of gender then again we run into the obvious answer of yes yes of course there are different identities that still coincide with being male i feel as though the expectations that come along with being male are just as dangerous to men and the possibility of different masculinities and individualism as the gender expectations for women Gender role Gender Gender-neutral language Sexual orientation Feminism Masculism God and gender Philosophy of language Bulgarian language Gender identity Man Transsexuality Goddess Heteronormativity Physical attractiveness Social constructionism Grammatical gender God Culture Biology and sexual orientation Human nature Reparative therapy History of intersex surgery Power (sociology) Capitalism Neopaganism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Liberalism Esperanto vocabulary Friedrich Schleiermacher Gaze Confucianism Property (ownership right) Transgender Masculinity Hierarchy Brahman Species Sexual differentiation Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Asperger syndrome Socrates Effeminacy German grammar Asian fetish Economic inequality Carl Jung Adjoint functors Fight Club Spanish nouns Cross-dressing Postmodernism Hebrew grammar Homomasculinity Maurice Merleau-Ponty John Money Reality English grammar Homophobia Social psychology Anthropology Theory of conduct Patriarchy Christian views of women Intellectual property Narcissism Catalan grammar Susan McClary Philosophy Rape Leadership Free will Polyamory Anarchism and capitalism Immanuel Kant Meaning of life Gender identity disorder Hypnosis State Ethics Chinese language Scientific method Homosexuality Political correctness Yoga Queer theory Labor theory of value Democracy Sex-positive feminism God the Father Arabic grammar Penis envy Baldness Civil rights Philosophy of space and time Autism
