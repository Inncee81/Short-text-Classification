why are companies increasing their discrimination against women in pay and promotion i often hear on this forum that no gender pay discrimination exists in the us a couple of federal judges differ with your opinion a federal judge has ruled that female drug sales workers for novartis pharmaceuticals may proceed with a class action gender discrimination lawsuit against the company the women claim the company discriminated against them in pay promotions and personnel evaluations sometimes because they were pregnant or had recently given birth pregnancy discrimination is prohibited by a federal law enacted in complaints to the government about such discrimination are increasing to last year up from in according to the federal equal employment opportunity commission here's the new york times article judge allows class action bias suit against novartis http www nytimes com business cnd suit html ex en d b ei partner rssnyt emc rss three of the novartis plaintiffs as well as others who submitted affidavits said that women who became pregnant suffered a variety of poor treatment including arbitrary discipline denial of promotions and termination of employment many attest to specific comments by managers indicating a hostility to pregnancy judge lynch wrote in his opinion one woman testified that her manager said he preferred not to hire young females stating first comes love then come marriage then comes flex time and a baby carriage another manager allegedly encouraged a young woman to get an abortion yet another woman alleges that employees were urged during a training session to avoid pregnancy the declarant five months pregnant at the time drew the eye of the trainer who said oops too late judge lynch wrote in his opinion if you'd bothered to read the article it mentioned another recent law suit being filed against walmart involving million women for gender wage discrimination david w sanford the lawyer for the women said he believed the case was the second largest gender discrimination case certified as a class next to a case against wal mart the wal mart case which alleges discrimination in pay and job classification and is pending in federal court in northern california involves an estimated million women who have worked for wal mart since so the logic of quite a few of you is since women get pregnant women should be refused employment since they are a woman and could become pregnant maybe you'd prefer women got their tubes tied before filling out a job application would that be sufficient so a woman could not be denied employment because of her gender or denied raises or promotions is she still allowed to marry or have a step child would that interfere so if a man is a widower should he be fired since he will now be a drain on the company like a woman would be if you assume women are always the primary caretaker or would he have to marry so if a woman hires a nanny why does she have to worry about hiring promotions or pay raises if she's not taking time off then what is the excuse for how she is being paid and promoted managers are hostile toward pregnancy b c it takes a trained employee away from her fr king job this is not a gender issue yes this is a gender issue since women are the ones who get pregnant and if fathers did their share of the infant care child care nanny care sick child days child special events then time away from work wouldn't be a woman issue it would be a parent issue a common human issue so i agree this is a human issue but since some men say their jobs are more important than their wives jobs or say they make more money than their wives jobs or say that it is the mother's other job to be the primary child caretaker instead of being a shared parental responsibility instead of being a human issue parental duties have been made by society corporations business families and churches into a woman's issue if men would take equal responsibility for the childcare of their children and stood up for their parental rights then employers would listen it is difficult to prove employment and salary wage discrimination since most people are threatened with being fired if they discuss their salary with anyone plus nearly every company hides their pay rates and pay scales if sexual discrimination cases are increasing it must be pretty blatant to have been found the evidence has to be overwhelming before most judges will allow a case to move forward in addition since the reagon era enforcement of pay equity has not been a top priority the pay equity law has been in place since since women are the only ones that can have children you can think of the matter like you do that these women are being given a special privilege by law which men are not given and is not in the best interests of business well we could change that tube tie all the women make sure men are sterile have test tube babies then neither gender has to have kids and we can get rid of laws that only apply to one gender we must be cautious as this case hasn't ended yet as the article says a federal judge has ruled that female drug sales workers for novartis pharmaceuticals may proceed with a class action gender discrimination lawsuit against the company this only means that the court shall hear the workers' case and not that it has ruled in favor of the workers secondly it is absolutely possible that this company has discriminated against these women based upon their pregnancy status however in the fourth paragraph of the article it is stated a statistical analysis the plaintiffs submitted to judge lynch concluded that women were paid about less a month than men in similar jobs a figure that they say does not include pay disparities due to promotions if i were the judge i would want to know what they mean by similar jobs i e why didn't they study the same jobs it would also be interesting to see how many pregnant women or women that have recently given birth have been promoted and compare those numbers with women who were pregnant or recently gave birth who did not recieve a promotion it would also be interesting to note whether or not that less a month is statistically significant if not then the workers have less of a case though they still can have one it would also be interesting to see the other reasons why these women feel that they were discriminated against in the article it states the women claim the company discriminated against them in pay promotions and personnel evaluations sometimes because they were pregnant or had recently given birth lastly the things said to these women if found to be true in court are unprofessional and should be punished thirdly just because complaints to the government have risen doesn't mean that all those complaints are valid ones i would want to know how many of those complaints were later found to be invalid stats are only as good as what you compare them to in the final analysis just because somebody brings a claim of discrimination against a company doesn't automatically make the company guilty the gender of the accuser also doesn't make the claim true the facts of the case ought to be the only thing the judge uses to determine the truth this judge seems to feel that the women have enough evidence to proceed if so then it is her his court to do with as he she pleases within the confines of the law i think that the public at large would be better served if the workers' evidence as well as the companies evidence were both made public as soon as possible as a final comment gender pay gap studies as far as i can tell are not the sort of studies that can show causation these studies do show that women make less than men however they are correlational this means that nobody can draw a causal conclusion from them and hope for their hypothesis to be logical in essence it doesn't matter what one federal judge or a million federal judges think the number of people believing in something won't make that something true it is whether or not that idea concept conforms to the reality of the world
