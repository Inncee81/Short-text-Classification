why do women so poorly at driving competitions one would assume that women who tend to be lighter would have huge success as racers yet there are very few women who race and even less who win and please avoid the everyone is beeing sexist card we have classy gypsy cat lets see how good your german italian is put up or shut up the ratio of women to men is a factor but with regards to what tera said there is no reason why women should ever be welcomed into mens' racing they don't belong there just as men are not welcomed into the wnba or wpga nor do they belong there either it seems to me that when one compares women and men that compete it really comes to a win win for women and a lose lose for men what do women stand to lose nothing what do women stand to gain a lot as made evident by female racer danika patrick being showered with winner status for being the third loser and she hasn't won anything yet she is treated like a major racing celebrity and she hasn't won anything since the early 's when her scrawny lightweight body helped her win in cart racing where weight is a huge factor what do the men stand to gain by women being there less than nothing if men beat women so what they beat a girl if women beat men they and their manhood reputation career sense of accomplishment are just fodder in female pursuit of tromping around in the mans' arena a sport created established promoted and sacrificed to by men they have nothing to gain and everything to lose when women are there for men it is just lose lose with regards to women women could change that you know in some way men could actually win something if they beat women in a race maybe the race commission could give men more points for every lap they have on the girl at least give them some incentive for not letting the girl pass them there is a way to make this fair since women have nothing to lose women could offer something so men would actually have a reason to race women one thing i have learned in this is that there are women out there who actually have respect integrity honor and humility with regards to their role in society and to men that is why we don't know who they are if they really exist they let men be men and enjoy their accompishments and then there are arrogant spoiled females the nervy girls with the attitude who have nothing to lose big deal why don't they let spoiled children race as well women competing with against men is a win win for women and a lose lose for men women have everything to gain and nothing to lose men have everything to lose and nothing to gain if women want to race let them start their own racing league like men start all of their own of everything else it is even easier for women now because men have already established the infrastructure that wasn't present when they started from scratch the truth of the matter is no one would watch a womens' racing network any more than they watch wnba or wpga people want to see the best this is why they watch men facts are facts name calling won't change them question if men treat competing women the same way they treat competing men would it be singled out as sexism or should men fumble over themselves to help out the little lady maybe let her win etc etc etc Indianapolis 500 Boxing Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) New York Giants Tour de France 24 Hours of Le Mans Women's National Basketball Association Sexism Transsexuality Chariot racing The Apprentice 2 Professional wrestling match types The Amazing Race Friends Playoff format National Football League Auto racing Female bodybuilding Poker jargon Iditarod Single Transferable Vote Economic inequality IBM PC compatible Anorexia nervosa Alex Ferguson World Series Penske Racing Valentino Rossi Physical attractiveness Opus Dei Domestic violence U.S. Electoral College Capitalism Ben Johnson (athlete) The Ashes Norway national football team Mario Kart 64 Badminton Feminism Human Gender-neutral language Jacky Ickx Woman Gambling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ice hockey Urinary incontinence Ayrton Senna New England Patriots Rugby union Triathlon St. Louis Rams Bicycle Professional wrestling slang The Boat Race Audi Diving Kurt Angle Sport NASCAR Gender role Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
