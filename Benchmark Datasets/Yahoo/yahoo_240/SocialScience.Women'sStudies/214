are women giving up as i look at the world today it depresses me things aren't the way they were years ago its getting worse an example would be take a look at a music video from the 's or 's and compare them to todays music videos do you see a problem with this it really makes me sad to see year old girls working at strip clubs and sleeping with all these guys how can they let men disrespect them like this i feel as though men are overpowering women more and more and it's just getting worse some women just don't even care anymore they've given up so they just go back to the stereotypical views of society instead of sticking with their own morals how has society become this way i totally agree with you i think women have taken a huge hit with the porn industry in the internet but look at it like this the guys now are total p ssies all they are good for is sex they used to be protective toward women and children now all they think about is their m mber and they think its cool instead they are just pathetic and in relationships some of them are really high maintenance it seems to me that guys are always playing off of womens emotions we feel something they work from that kind of a lazy vampirish way to go through life if we will strip for money they will pay they dont see it as bad for women they see it as somethign we do they dont see the girl who goes home after to two kids and has nowhere else to go or someone who was a runaaway they dont see peoples real feelings they just see what they can use from women Jennifer Lopez Avenue Q Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Male prostitute Transsexuality One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Homestar Runner Homophobia Gender role Abortion debate Sin City Pornographic actor Pitaten The Wack Pack Sinfest The Ashlee Simpson Show Human sexual behavior The Fairly OddParents Sexual orientation Recurring South Park characters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Laura Schlessinger Theodicy George Costanza EastEnders Teen Girl Squad Fathers' rights Pornography Quarashi American Psycho St. Elmo's Fire (film) Human The Merchant of Venice Unemployment About a Boy Goodness and value theory Divorce Atomic Kitten Shaggy dog story Prostitution The Critic Married... with Children Striptease Moral Politics Women in Islam Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Infantilism Buddy Guy Totally Spies!
