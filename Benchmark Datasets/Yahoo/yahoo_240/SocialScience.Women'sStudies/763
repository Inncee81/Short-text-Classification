hypothetical question if this category was called gender and men's studies which would be the subjects of discussion many times the question of why there is not a men's studies has been asked in this section my opinion is that all past academia studies have been men's studies therefore it was necessary to create the women's studies to give women their rightful place in history as well as concentrating in discrimination and many other social issues but what if a new academia section of men's studies were created in social science which would be the subjects of study and why ok everybody don't get carried away now yes traditional curriculum used to focus solely on the accomplishments of men a point made by dale spender it would be possible to graduate from advanced mathematics classes without knowing that women ever participated let alone excelled in this area spender however this has changed a lot thanks to feminism current textbooks contain information on the historical contributions of both genders also according to karen lehrman a women's rights activist who disagrees with gender academia most of the women's studies courses are designed not merely to study women but also to improve the lives of women both the individual students the vast majority of whom are female and women in general lehrman while i disagree with her about the validity of gender studies she makes an interesting point in that she explains that the study of women is not exclusive to studying their history it is also an indication that a female friendly environment is positive towards a female student s self esteem and their sense of identity these programs help women to better understand who they are as people not just their histories yet traditional curriculum doesn t focus on the identity of the student in the way that women s studies programs do from this perspective you could say that men are being excluded from programs that could help them better understand themselves and their place in society by studying their own identity because in the majority of academic institutions men are not being provided with an equivalent to the study of women a study of males or masculinity basically as anyone who has taken any women's studies course knows it is an environment where curriculum focuses not so much only the historical accomplishments of women but rather what that also means for the individual student today identity as women is focused on and often counsel from female mentors is available through these programs all wonderfully beneficial in essence i think its a mistake to simply argue that the only reason ws exists is to balance traditional curriculum when we know that it is beneficial for many more reasons and why shouldn't men be able to reap the rewards of these benefits by having their own realm of academia Feminism Sexual orientation Gender Economics Postmodernism Gender-neutral language Philosophy of language Affirmative action Feminist movement Psychology Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Civil rights Gender identity Science Deconstruction A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Anthropology Social psychology Sociology GED Economic inequality Education in Japan Masculism Academia Biology and sexual orientation Master's degree Education in Portugal Secondary education in Japan Same-sex marriage History of intersex surgery Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Futures Studies Software engineering Alternative medicine Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor Transsexuality Human Intelligent design movement Transgender Professor Reparative therapy Homophobia Intelligent design Creation-evolution controversy History Lawyer Political correctness Altruism Sex Franz Boas IB Diploma Programme Cognitive science Goodness and value theory Race and intelligence Abortion debate Second language acquisition Mathematics Graduate school Theology Logic Cross-dressing Tripartite System Discrimination Teach the Controversy Lawrence Summers Massachusetts Institute of Technology Liberalism John Lott Sociocultural evolution Noam Chomsky Extreme Programming Ethics Capitalism Property (ownership right) Center for Science and Culture Animal rights Hampshire College Domestic violence Education in Taiwan Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anti-intellectualism SAT Indigenous peoples
