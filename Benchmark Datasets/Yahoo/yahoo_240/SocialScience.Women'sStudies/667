am i a stalker i like this girl at this gym i work at she teaches group exercise classes oneday i sent her flowers anonymously with my email attached over the next few weeks i traded emails with her telling her i liked her until i finally got up the nerve to tell her who i was she sent an email thanking me for the flowers but saying she was in a relationship i then sent her seven emails over the course of four months with no response i could see this made her nervous so i attempted to tell her in person i would stop i had to take two of her classes classes i normally take before i could get a moment alone with her she was terrified but after class i apologized saying i'd stop sending emails and she said that it was ok the next week i got written up and the write up read bob is getting written up because he has been sending mary emails and she has told him to stop though she hadn't and he attended two of her classes and sent her a voicemails sic i own up to unsavory behavior but the wording of this was unsettling to me am i just some bitter stalker in addition to sending her a voice mail saying i'd stop the emails which i didn't think would go through i attempted to call her on her business cell but backed out feeling that it crossed the line i have fantasies of just running up to her and kissing her dead on the lips and i purposely walked by her house once when i had a package that i needed to pick up from the post office in her neighborhood am i a stalker do i need help randomx i don't know why i had to tell her i'd stop i just wanted to apologize in person and make sure things were ok between us and i didn't want her to have to worry everyday about whether or not i'd send an email i wanted her to know for sure waswisgirl you say you're discounting how upset your victim is and justifying your behavior by telling yourself and us that you wanted to contact her 'just to say you're sorry' waswis first of all i haven't contacted her in year or so secondly could you please provide my actual reason for wanting to contact her in person i could have done it by email but her friend had already indicated no more emails if i did it by cell that would have crossed a line and i got written up for sending a voice mail so my only option seemed like in person the only thing hr commended me on during the write up was the apology and let it be noted that when i finally did contact her all i did was say i'm sorry and that i'd stop sending the emails so if i had other motives please tell me and i need more info to know what you mean by discounting how upset my victim was oh and waswisgirl you seem to be discounting how upset i was you weren't the one who looked her in the eye and saw how terrified she was i was there and that hurt me that i put her through that and that's why i resolved once and for all to leave her alone it was for her feelings and her feelings alone i didn't have to sign that write up i've refused to sign them before but it did it just to show that yes i care about her comfort so please before you talk about me discounting other people's feelings don't discount mine i give a damn about how she feels it was just open to interpretation while i was sending the emails but clearcut once i looked into her eyes and saw the terror i hated it why ask the question if you just wanted to hear what a nice little boy you are and how misunderstood and wholesome you are you're the one who got written up none of your excuses cut it you're a stalker ah waswisgirl the broken record you're a stalker anways i agree that with the lose definition given a stalker i would be one but the reason why i asked this question was merely to get other people's perspectives and to just talk about it i haven't talked to anyone about this at all for two reasons a i didn't want to tell my story only for people to prop me up and demonize this girl who didn't know what to do in an unfamiliar situation b i didn't want hear someone just bash me telling me what i did wrong things i already know but unfortunately those are more or less the two types of answers i will get your answer just seems so vitrolic and assumes too much about me to be taken seriously you seem to have issues youself turn in down a notch you are crossing the line why did you have to tell her that you'd stop the emails you should have just stopped you also shouldn't have sent so many as two at most would have told you that she wasn't interested in replying the whole secret admirer thing is creepy too you definitely need to get over her and learn about boundaries lack of boundaries is kinda a big stalker warning thing too she's completely right to be creeped out and i would be too because that behavior that lack of boundaries is telling you might not be violent or a rapist but women have to be careful about that sort of thing and if you lack personal boundaries you may very well lack physical ones she can't tell where your personal line is and from her perspective it's already too far into creepy territory i'm a big believer in people talking to therapists in general and i'm kinda hard put to tell you what else to do at least talking to a professional might help you with your lack of confidence and to figure out where boundaries are supposed to be Milton H.
