who has the more sexy torso male or female both just so happened to be fit it's really hard to compare the two i don t know how u can since it s like comparing apples to oranges i mean women have nice boobs but i a man in decent shape will have pecs bot midsections if in decent shape would look good but even if a man doesn t have a build thus not a chest he could still have nice toned arms that a good amount of guys naturally seem to have whereas i see the beauty in the whole female form but the arms are not really a sexual part to me and i think that 's true for most men but the boos obviously are and the midsection also and the hips and the small of her back and that curve but a man's toned arms seems to be one of the sexy of sexual parts for women to see and that is becauase man having the muscles and muscle tone and i mean bot forms have different features that are sexy i wold think and some which both of the same parts can both be sexy i think it all depends on how one looks at it but i don't u can really compare i mean afterall if one is fancying the man's muscles and tone compared to the female form that the person is mor admiring non sexually then i would think that should imply the sexier form to that person and usually that goes with the sexual orientation and the same goes for fancying the female form and admiring non sexually the male form oh i just read the fit part well then the male form if fit wold have a flat hard stomach or abs and pecs and sculpted shoulders and cut arms and proabablyh muscular back and the female form would have nice slender arms shoulders nice flat stomach nice firm but soft breasts so yin and yang pretty much soft curves vs chiseled features obvioulsly to me it would be the female form since i am a man but i can actually look at things objectively so in the objective stance none is better than the other Equine conformation Sexual attraction Weight training Physical attractiveness Aerial (dance move) Tai Chi Chuan Sexual differentiation Wood carving Puberty Professional wrestling throws Tightlacing Massage Human position Professional wrestling holds Wing Chun Terminal ballistics Gender role Abdomen Piledriver (professional wrestling) Sexual dimorphism Humphrey Bogart Swimming Sexual orientation Drill bit Undergarment Orgasm Human height Sex toy Breaststroke Drawing Human anatomy Time Out of Mind Microeconomics Elbow bondage Naruto jutsu Archery Madonna (entertainer) Rococo Autopsy Professional wrestling attacks Dog Secondary sex characteristic Hangul Knife Aikido Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Buttocks Sex Nudity Theory of conduct Mr. Olympia Gender Team Fortress Classic Diving Androgen insensitivity syndrome Condom Transgender Gay slang Sexual revolution The Ashlee Simpson Show Woodworking Biology and sexual orientation Economic inequality Human sexual response cycle Breech birth Hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Usher (entertainer) Humerus Swingout Reservoir Dogs Dualism (philosophy of mind) Supply and demand Body image The Smoking Room Volleyball Professional wrestling aerial techniques Scoliosis Social rule Shoulder Suplex Dragon Booster Transsexuality Glossary of ballet terms Discordianism Hentai Xiaolin Showdown Internal oblique Urinary incontinence Doom enemies Sex organ Anal sex Sundial Harem anime Male prostitute
