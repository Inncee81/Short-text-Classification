has my ex girlfriend damaged me for life my ex girlfriend was psychologically and emotionally abusive i was in love with her and leaving her was the hardest thing i ever did but i was at a point where if i didn't leave i would fall apart plus when we broke up she acted like it was nothing no emotions or anything she has even called me since to ask for favors now that i'm over her and the pain is gone i have a hard time seeing women in the same light i know its stupid to generalize and i know she is just one person but i can't trust women like i used to my ex seemed so charming and innocent when i met her and she turned out to be a self centered cunning bratty evil manipulator she never cared about me i feel bad that i can't see women as beautiful innocent godesses anymore and i don't feel i ever will again women don't seem to care about men beyond what we can do for them sorry for all the women i may offend but thats how feel right now i feel like women are just a big let down in the end this is a people thing not a woman thing all people suck everyone lies and no one can be trusted so what did you learn next time don't fall in love don't get into co dependent relationships most women will step on your nuts if you let them most guys learn this by middle high school woman are brutal with men's emotions that's why we act the way we act is this your first time welcome to the club good new is here's where the fun starts now that you've experienced this you can date several women being emotionally attach and not get sucked into the charming innocence either that or you'll stubornly continue to fall into this trap until you have a psychotic episode or you find a women who's been abused by so many man she'll be happy to find you One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Kodocha Boston Public Pitaten Social rule Sin City The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy W.I.T.C.H.
