i got a violation because because of a response to one of sung's questions my response was minor compared to some of the other one's what's up with that he got me so irritated when i was reading his questions last night sorry it's funny how the violations come on the comments you don't expect it on really you should not answer them trolls check their profiles and see if they go around asking obnoxious questions all the time or if they are set to private usually clues that they are trolls i take a chance every now and then on a new account but work out a filtering system that works for you the thing is that they feed off of causing a stir and getting people pissed off if everyone ignores them then they go somewhere else it is hard to ignore them if lots of other people are replying but keep in mind that there are people here to feed the trolls as well and it is just as disruptive as the trolls themselves Internet troll Netiquette Social rule I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Have I Got News For You Joke Theory of conduct Dilbert America Online Intelligent design GameFAQs message boards Plame affair Newbie RuneScape Random Events Something Awful Forums National Kidney Foundation Singapore Little Britain The Hobbit B3ta Microeconomics Sexual orientation Discworld SCO-Linux controversies Milton H.
