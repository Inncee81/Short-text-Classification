why do so many women want a commitment from men i just spent the weekend with my girlfriend and it was fantastic but now she wants a deeper commitment she wants me to dump my other two girlfriends and date her exclusively of course this will not happen so their goes another good thing ruined because women always need commitment why can't we all just have a good time ladies i'll commit but asking me to make you number one is just asking too much brad is number one personal opinion the demand for exclusivity comes largely from hypo ego low self esteem women who demand to take hostages in a relationship are afraid of losing out to a better looking smarter or otherwise more desirable woman not to be ignored is the stds that can be transmitted to others involved in poly amorous situations as well add to that some women demand men to be exclusively available to support her and her choices especially when her choice is to become pregnant and give birth then divorce or file for child support when she can legally obtain it without having to put anything back into the relationship lastly when one can demand a committed relationship there are more finances available to them than if there were others vying for equal or similar attention it is similar for men as far as hypo ego is concerned as well as stds beyond that the most likely reason men want exclusivity to a woman is to better insure that any children she produces for him to support are more likely to be his Polyamory Human sexual behavior Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EastEnders Polygamy Oral sex Domestic violence Divorce Microeconomics Knots Landing George Costanza Simone Weil Transsexuality Sexual orientation Sexually-transmitted infection Friends Condom One Tree Hill (TV series) Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Same-sex marriage in Canada Paternalism Poker jargon Theodicy Abortion debate Marriage About a Boy Abortion Philip J.
