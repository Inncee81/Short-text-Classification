do you believe these findings are correct in marilyn french's seminal works analyzing patriarchy and its effects on the world at large including women men and children she defines patriarchy as a system that values power over life control over pleasure and dominance over happiness how can we alter these beliefs to work towards a more equitable society for marginalized groups i think that if we deconstruct the notions that surround control dominance and power we may be on our way i feel that it ties in quite closely with what is expected of men based upon their gender there is a great deal of work on the gender expectations of women but i don't see a great deal on gender expectation of men most of the work i have seen is cursory at best i think that if we could somehow shift that paradigm that men have to act a certain way in the way that we have shifted the paradigm that women must only be wives and mothers than we will be able to move towards a more positive and inclusive society by the way does anyone else find it terribly amusing that the first two supremely negative answers did nothing but strengthen the argument being made in the initial question i lol'd Feminism Patriarchy Social psychology Gender role Sexual orientation Power (sociology) Anarcho-primitivism Postmodernism Economic inequality Ethics Heteronormativity Feminist movement Coercion Matriarchy Goodness and value theory Transsexuality Divorce Radical feminism Same-sex marriage Deconstruction Gender-neutral language Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Abortion debate Social justice God Morphology (linguistics) Microeconomics Goddess Human sexual behavior Paradigm Liberalism Marriage Anarchism Affirmative action Paradigm shift Sociology Jacob Neusner Economics Structuralism Transgender Utilitarianism Incest Bertrand Russell Infantilism Domestic violence Human Homophobia Afrocentrism Effeminacy Homosexuality and transgender Object-oriented programming Fathers' rights Estoppel Sexism Objectivist philosophy Same-sex marriage in Canada State Birth control Twelve leverage points Social research History of intersex surgery Supernatural Gender identity Intelligent design Simone Weil Lesbian Human rights Reparative therapy Motivation Philosophy of space and time Second language acquisition LGBT Libertarian socialism Gentrification Anarchist economics Gay Political economy Democratic Party (United States) Drug abuse Civil rights Property (ownership right) Critical theory Sadism and masochism Susan McClary English grammar Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Immanuel Kant Expert system Sex War Japanese values Science G__del's incompleteness theorem Homosexuality and Christianity Mary Wollstonecraft Democracy Ruth Bader Ginsburg Paternalism
