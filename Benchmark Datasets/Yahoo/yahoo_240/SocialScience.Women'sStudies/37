why do some people on here like to spread hate make their gender look bad to the other i was just wondering why they feel that their time is best spent by spreading hate ignorance trying to hurt people to be honest i just roll my eyes at them but isn't there something more constructive they could be doing because all they really acheive is to make themselves that which they represent look really bad are they purposely trying to help the side that they say they oppose when did i mock white men in a question i asked i mocked some guy whining about how men are oppressed i find it odd that that could even be considered since men hold of the positions of power wow it's funny how defense a certain group is getting as i didn't even say a gender or how hate is being spread i think some people have a guilty conscience lol no jackal not that time of the month i'm actually pregnant so do you wanna make a crack at that i know how you like to harass pregnant women i've seen you over in the pregnancy section many a time hey i'm not even upset about it not nearly as upset as some of the people i'm referring to and i do have a life btw i just happen to be stuck at work right now between projects so i thought i'd ask a real question not some stupid gender bashing rant like so many on here do oh and btw i wasn't jsut talking about the misogynists i actually had a few misandrists in mind too but hey all i get is insulted by the misogynists will someone actually answer the question no delicious you weren't who i had in mind for us women i was thinking well for example a certain person who calls herself after a flower that used to always ask why do of men as for bein in denial the only women i see that fall under those stereotypes are on tv none of the women i know are anything like the stereotypes well it is the trolls i'm asking about i just don't get their mentality or lack thereof kendrick you honestly think that the majority of man wh res not men the ones who sleep around with different women every day would sign up to take responsibility for a kid from one of their one night stands honestly that's not 'hate' that's the truth and if women who sleep around could do the same thing i'm sure they would shadow soldier if you read that i said nothing about white or any other color and it was in response to a long winded misogynistic over generalized ridiculous question that painted men as totallly helpless innocent victims of society shadow soldier don't get your boxers in a bunch w i t t w e isn't white it was meant as baby talk for little and i said men are in control no mention of white can you read and by that i meant they hold of the positions of power president vp etc ok kendrick i'm wrong all those people who have one night stands are all ready to jump up volunteer to take responsibility for a kid that resulted none of the women would have abortions and none of the men would do anything but make sure they can be found is that better sheesh happy bullet that's a valid opinion and i'm glad you contributed in such a civilized manner thanks people who spread hate and ugliness about their gender are often very angry and disappointed with their lives and think that what their life is like is what it is like for everyone else of their gender so they resort to using their life experiences as facts and or use gender stereotypes to make themselves feel better by putting others down it's petty childish and immature at best and sick and disturbed at worst and you're right you didn't state either gender yet look at how many people assumed you were talking about them or their gender lol it only takes a few defensive hostile people to create a nasty environment it's easy to blame and hate others it takes time responsibility and work to try to be fair Theory of conduct Internet troll Social rule Friends EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Knots Landing Hip hop rivalries Avenue Q Media and ethnicity The Inside Futurama (TV series -
