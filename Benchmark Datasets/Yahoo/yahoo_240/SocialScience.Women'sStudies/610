do women need men more than men need women ok for the sake of argument lets take reproduction out of the picture and say that humans reproduce asexually without the need for intercourse so women produce more women and men produce more men but women and men don't need to really associate which gender would be more successful at life you have to consider that women need men for protection access to resources jobs etc since men basically build the modern world you also have to take into consideration the fact that men stick together and women treat each other like dog crap what does this say for the argument that men and women are equal i guess the real question here is what would men seek women out for when reproduction is not an issue people keep in mind the actual question this question should be answered based on the situation i described above why are we talking about marriage and successful women i'm not asking about the current situation i m asking if the situation was different and women were not needed for reproduction please read before responding yep women definitely need men more than vice versa many women however have too much foolish pride to admit it how often do you hear a man say he wants a woman to sweep him off his feet it all goes back to the damsel in distress syndrome which is still alive today of women wanting a man to rescue her and bring her to paradise the vast majority of modern commodities women use were invented designed and built by men now how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the truth Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Birth control Same-sex marriage The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reproduction Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity Animal rights Abortion debate Human Species Divorce Sexual intercourse Theodicy Relations of production Civil rights Human sexuality Feminism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Sex Socrates Resurrection of Jesus U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Homosexuality and Judaism Transsexuality Law of value Homophobia Simone Weil Shaggy dog story Autism rights movement Psychology Polygamy Transgender The Amber Spyglass Philosophy of language Killian documents Property (ownership right) Autism Democratic Party (United States) Phaedo Labor theory of value Fictional character Objective-C Novel Game show Commodity markets Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Death Gate Cycle Humphrey Bogart Roe v.
