fathers of daughters what type of man would you want your daughter to marry what traits and attitudes would you want him to have would you hope they'd have a traditional marriage or a more contemporary one why would you want to see her stay home with her kids or would you want to see her in a career share your hopes and dreams for your daughters i'm actually surprised by the lack of responses tera i thought there were enough men here that they would step up and share thier views i try to set an example for them of the kind of person should they decide to marry that i would like to see as sons in law strong loving wise and principled i'm far from perfect but every day that i wake up those are my goals someone who loves them far more than himself who is highly principled that is he actually consistently lives what he says he believes we will never have to worry about what he will do in a given situation because he is a man of principle and always tries to do what is right a man who is strong loyal loving spiritual who always puts his wife and children's' needs and wants before his own who is willing to make whatever personal sacrifice necessary to care for and protect his family and able to handle crises and life's difficulties with wisdom compassion and calmness a man who had the common sense to prior to having children equip himself with the earning potential to provide for his family without assistance should my daughter chose to be a stay at home mom so she will have the choice to raise the babies herself at home though the maternal grandparents intend to make themselves available whenever needed hopefully the second choice with daycare hopefully being a last resort i am equipping my daughters for life as independent individuals who do not need to be taken care of by a husband or her parents i do not barrage them with the concept that they must get married they understand that it is their choice from their earliest recollections and every day of their lives they have experienced the love of a man they are being taught to recognize when someone genuinely loves them and as long as i am around they will never want for love and affection so they are being taught to recognize when a man genuinely loves them more than he does himself treats them with tender compassion and puts her needs ahead of his own i am a firm believer that a girl's father has a great influence over the kind of person she choses to marry and i consider that fact every day so should they chose to marry i believe that they will have high standards and be equipped to chose wisely my daughters are both being taught to be tri lingual and early in life we have begun discussing what kind of work they want to do they will be able to be self sufficient they will not need to marry should they chose not to thus should they decide to marry and bear children they can chose to stay home with them or not they have seen that their father can provide for the family without assistance so they can target a man who has equipped himself with the necessary earning power to finance the family Infantilism Eastern Orthodox Church Family Polyamory A Course In Miracles Divorce Predestination Goodness and value theory Socrates EastEnders Rule of St Benedict One Tree Hill (TV series) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Summa Theologiae Abortion in the United States Abortion debate Alcoholics Anonymous Fathers' rights Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Theodicy Arjuna Same-sex marriage Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Justification (theology) Marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coercion Religious Society of Friends Confucianism Original sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious pluralism Jon Secada Philipp Melanchthon Laura Schlessinger Melanie Wilkes Separation of church and state Salvation Jewish principles of faith Religion Free will Who is a Jew?
