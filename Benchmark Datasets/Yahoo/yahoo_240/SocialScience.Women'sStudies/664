women required to shave parts of the body to be hired men have to shave their faces in order to join corporate or military america yet women are not required to shave parts of their bodies is this fair it depends on the type of work here is my take on the military everything should be equal women should have to shave their head when they enter boot camp women should also have the same requirements as the men in regard to physical fitness requirements my brother who was in the military wanted to be a paratrooper and to do that you have to run with a full pack a certain distance in a given amount of time he did not meet his requirement but a woman who ran the distance in less time than my brother met her requirement that is wrong this is not high school gym class this is the military these people are supposed to protect us standards for women should not be lowered because it's not fair joining the military is not about being fair if a woman can pass the same requirements as the men then by all means let them do whatever if women want equality then things really need to be equal including shaving their head in the military it's not a beauty contest and in food sevice i've been in food service for years and not once has a manager said anything to any of the women to cut their hair put it up or something if you find a hair in your food chances are it doesn't belong to a man but yet the men are told to shave i've also seen women with long nails with polish on them and they aren't told to cut their nails or to not have polish if you prepare food in a restaurant and you do these things it is in violation of the health department but yet nothing is said to any of the woman corporate america hair cutting no but the style yes you are a work representing your employer example like no spikes purple hair hair that looks mangled and dirty other jobs can't think of anything where it would be necessary Hair Beard Depilation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Haircut Baldness Social rule Golf Professional wrestling match types Global Gillette Recruit training Shaving RuneScape quests Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Amber Spyglass Shoe Virginia Military Institute Glossary of American football Simone Weil Drug test Explosive material Humphrey Bogart Norwegian Campaign Softball Oral sex Guinea pig Food and Drug Administration Friends Vlad III Dracula Affirmative action Sexual attraction Theory of conduct Kurt Angle Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hijab Poker jargon American football Bodybuilding Physical attractiveness 613 mitzvot Sin City Beavis and Butt-head Salute Capitalism Great Teacher Onizuka Volleyball Mixed martial arts Divorce The Apprentice 2 Customs and etiquette of Japan FairTax Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Microsoft Edith Nourse Rogers Baseball Boy Scouts of America Kimono Evan Mecham Human rights in the United States Strap-on dildo Floppy disk Pok__mon Abilities Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Pilgrim's Progress Comanche Grade (education) Scouting Dalton McGuinty Windows XP United States Postal Service Windows 2000 Breath of Fire III Black hole Bubble Bobble Doomsday argument Nail (anatomy) Happy Tree Friends Artemis Entreri Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Life insurance Rigging Gay rights Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Triathlon Jewish bereavement Piccolo Junior Saga EastEnders Paul Is Dead Archery Skinhead
