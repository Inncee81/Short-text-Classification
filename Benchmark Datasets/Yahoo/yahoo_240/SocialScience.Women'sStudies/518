anti feminist warren farrell is an avid anti feminist and masculinist is this what these movements are all about frankly i am shocked your opinion http www gate net liz fathers farrell yep i'd say warren farrell is an anti feminist and masculinist and he made a lot of money off of his shoddy research and opinions just like a lot of other masculinists and anti feminists do but some feminists have done shoddy research and used their opinions as the basis for their ideas so it's a common problem farrell was a member of now and got on a board but having worked with and for now since it's a volunteer organization anyone can join and just about anyone can be elected into many positions i was and it wasn't rocket science i was on a board too men get a lot of attention too in feminist organizations just like they do in any group that is made up of women so i'm not surprised he got lots of attention i also got tired of now and broke away i don't know why that doesn't get the press that farrell gets lol i disagreed with some of their leadership decisions and some of their positions on issues but i decided to later support the work they do that i agree with here's a review of one of his later books women can't hear what men don't say destroying myths creating love by warren farrell ph d warren farrell was in a fabulous position to help men address and change masculinity when he wrote his new book women can't hear what men don't say destroying myths creating love he could have used this book to help men to rewrite the masculine role in a manner that is much healthier and much more rewarding than the manner in which it exists today however that is not what he has done contrary to the book's subtitle it has neither destroyed myths nor created love it has not charted new territory that could ease communication between the sexes rather it has perpetuated existing myths and created excuses interestingly he refers to victim feminism and competitive feminism as two forms of feminism that he feared not disagreed with or disliked feared he had inadvertently shown how threatened he feels by the cultural changes feminism has affected and continues to affect in his bio as well as his other publications farrell frequently includes the statement that he is the only man ever to have been elected three times to the board of the national organization for women the quote gives the impression that he sat on the national board of n o w he didn't he sat on the board of the small new york city chapter of n o w well over twenty years ago which is a far cry from sitting on the national board in washington d c rarely if ever does he mention his current and very active memberships on the boards of men's and fathers' rights groups he is on the advisory board of fathers rights and equality exchange he is also on the board of directors of the national congress for fathers and children and the children's rights council these groups do not focus on child welfare or on improving relations between the sexes they concentrate on lowering or eliminating child support they claim that the vast majority of allegations of domestic violence and child abuse made by women are malicious lies designed to give the women an upper hand in court they seek forms of child custody that benefit only men such as mandatory joint custody in all custody cases regardless of research which has shown that joint custody has proven to be detrimental to children's welfare one incident farrell has placed under the lace curtain category vividly illustrates that he does not properly investigate claims mailed to him an america online subscriber had written to him claiming that feminists run aol and that aol actively discriminates against men by disallowing any men's issues discussion online it appears that farrell had taken this e mail at face value and merely passed on the news without looking into its accuracy he had stated that the men's issues discussions included active dialogue and men expressing themselves did he actually read those discussions the men's center where these discussions had taken place was never particularly busy most of the folders sat empty for days or even weeks at a time these discussions consisted primarily of a tiny number of men's rights supporters who engaged in ad hominum attacks against feminism and homosexuality especially when feminists were debating them the atmosphere was of course very contentious all around the subscriber who had contacted him displays palpable hostility in his writings he used epithets such as feminazi psychodyke estrogenic jihad homo anal males and homo anal sex as the perversion it so obviously is referring to feminists and homosexuals i know this because i had debated with men's rights advocates in those folders for several years does farrell support arrogant hostile misogynistic and homophobic rantings coming from those who claim to speak for the rights of men in addition the shutdown of some men's discussion folders had nothing to do with either feminism or men's rights aol had completely reorganized several years ago contrary to what farrell had written subscribers were notified of the imminent shut down of the old forums including the men's center the communities forum where these discussions had originally existed was eliminated to make room for the larger more extensive forums that are so popular on aol today there are plenty of folders all over aol where men may discuss men's health divorce and custody and the masculine role men's health is one forum where men may discussion their issues this forum was not mentioned in the book it's ironic that farrell blasts men's issues being discussed in talkwomen's feminist views area because he insists that women hear what men have to say maybe he wants women to hear what men say as long as he approves of the forum in which they hear it a major reason farrell may have been shunned by the feminist movement is not mentioned in this book the feminist publication 'off our backs' reported on this issue in once this issue is clarified it will become very clear why he has neglected to discuss it in the december issue of penthouse farrell was quoted in philip nobile's article incest the last taboo previously suppressed material from the original kinsey interviews tells us that incest is prevalent and often positive in this article farrell made many statements in obvious support of incest the article included the statement w hen i get my most glowing positive cases out of says farrell the incest is part of the family's open sensual style of life wherein sex is an outgrowth of warmth and affection it is more likely that the father has good sex with his wife and his wife is likely to know and approve and in one or two cases to join in in addition farrell was quoted in this manner m illions of people who are now refraining from touching holding and genitally caressing their children when that is really part of a caring loving expression are repressing the sexuality of a lot of children and themselves t housands of people in therapy for incest are being told in essence that their lives have been ruined by incest in fact their lives have not generally been affected as much by the incest as by the overall atmosphere and he claims to be clueless as to why feminists no longer wish to contact him this is the most tragic thing about women can't hear what men don't say farrell was in a position to help men make real lasting positive changes in their lives and he punted the ball he favored blaming feminists for the ills experienced by men rather than give men the reins to make the necessary changes themselves he is well known plenty of people who have never picked up one of his books have heard of the name warren farrell even if he were to attempt to assist men in making real lasting changes the men and women who look up to him may not accept such a turnabout from him the men's and fathers' rights movements have a very heavy presence on the internet site after site blame the feminist movement for many of the problems that men may experience it's so much easier to point a finger at feminism than it is to do the time consuming exhausting and thankless work necessary to restructure a gender role from the inside out Laura Schlessinger Fight Club Ethics Scientology beliefs
