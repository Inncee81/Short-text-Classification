has anyone changed the gender of their avatar gotten different reactions for the same ideas i did it once it was interesting i got a different type of insult degrading comments less about my assumed appearance more about my sexuality but overall i got insulted a bit less by the males they seemed to give me a bit more understanding about the same for the females but some did misinterpret things i said in a negative way rainbow perhaps i was just sharing my observations as objectively as i could jackal happy bullet i'm not certain your specific examples are entirely in the same category because people knew that it was still you guys well not sure if everone did but it was obvious to myself many others but thanks for your input anyhow i'm sure they still have some validity kendrick that's true someone bashing their own gender is not going to be taken very seriously i didn't actually have that in mind in my case i didn't bash anyone just pointed out the same types of things i usually do about both genders yes interesting you ask i am a woman i did not have an avatar at first so it defaulted to what appeared to be a mans pic also my nickname looks like keith but it isn't they are initials of names put together kelth people have mistaken me for a man and even asked me if i was one before recently i changed my avatar and some people still think it is a man pic because of the short hair sexist anyway when i asked men why they don't wear makeup and they thought i was a man they responded that i needed to go the gay section but when i asked them the same and clearly stated that i was a woman they all seemed to give me honest answers even more women are down right mean when it comes a women questioning them why they wear make up yet the ones that thought i was a man simply seemed confused Gender-neutral language Gender role Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Social rule Infantilism Homosexuality and transgender Gay Transgender LGBT Philosophy of language Gender identity Biology and sexual orientation Homophobia Joke Plame affair Transsexuality Cultural relativism Ontological argument Socrates Same-sex marriage God Emperor of Dune Debugging Sex Scientology beliefs and practices One Tree Hill (TV series) Bisexuality God and gender Sexism Political correctness Gender Feminism Human sexual behavior Have I Got News For You Human Coercion Family name Sexual differentiation BASIC programming language Civil rights Goodness and value theory Internet troll Effeminacy Postmodernism Domestic violence Ethics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Falsifiability The nature of God in Western theology History of intersex surgery Slashdot trolling phenomena Meme Milton H.
