why do you think some women are anti feminist i'm thinking of women like phyllis schalafly ann coulter and other conservative women who seem to want to undermine the advances of women or is it just a matter of them having the queen bee syndrome fyi the queen bee syndome is defined a case of a woman who may have gotten ahead by pulling herself up by the bootstraps and now doesn't see the need to help other women in fact the queen bee may go out of their way to hold other women back whom she feel may be competition in in a workplace or social situation isn't it funny that these women are telling other women to go back to the kitchen meanwhile they're making millions of dollars by writing books preparing speeches and working so they certainly don't practice what they preach part of me thinks they're just doing it for the another part of me thinks that they truly believe what they are saying but the fact that they don't apply it to themselves shows how what they're saying is apparently good in theory but not so good when it needs to be applied to real women Ann Coulter Sex-positive feminism The Amber Spyglass Ethics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Microeconomics Fathers' rights Friends Abortion debate Supply and demand Civil rights Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story The Subtle Knife Sexual revolution Gender role Masculism Biblical inerrancy Deconstruction Asperger syndrome The Death Gate Cycle Bee Gees Epistemology The Smoking Room Paula Jones Workplace democracy Anne Rice Political correctness Philosophical skepticism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an American Civil Liberties Union Phyllis Schlafly Undergrads Feminism Creation according to Genesis Knots Landing Economic inequality The Catcher in the Rye New Testament Queen bee Baron Munchhausen Transsexuality Extreme Programming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Free will Keynesian economics Productive and unproductive labour Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Priesthood (Mormonism) Inflation Barack Obama German student movement Truth Sleeping Beauty Blonde on Blonde Autism Germaine Greer Moral Politics Labor theory of value Bernard Williams Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Academy Award for Costume Design Japanese values The Shining (film) Chess strategy and tactics Transactional analysis Philosophical Investigations Democracy Kosher foods Feminists for Life Transformation problem Economics Multiculturalism Heir Apparent Honeybee Intelligent design Margaret Thatcher Avenue Q David Hume Russian joke Law of value Postmodernism Science Strategic management Surreal number Reality The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Pat Buchanan Gender-neutral language Stuttering Barbra Streisand Dinesh D'Souza Dilbert Socrates
