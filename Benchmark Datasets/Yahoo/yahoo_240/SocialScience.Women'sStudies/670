homophobia do you agree with these statements it is generally argued that homophobia is a mechanism for regulating the behaviour of all men rather than just self identified homosexuals and it has been proposed that homophobia is an essential characteristic of patriarchal society dils ann cooper albright ann ed moving history dancing cultures dance history reader pg it attracts my attention that the most homophobic people seem afraid of their own possible homosexuality as if by attacking homosexuals would confirm their personal sexual orientation the funny thing is that these same homophobic people tend to denigrate women as well isn't this contradictory bushman i ask this question because it pertains gender and women's studies why i have to explain this bushman again i don't understand why a simple question disturbs you so much i am not insulting anyone just thinking about homophobia because i was reading a section of this book about it breath in and breath out calm down gosh i don't know even why i have to defend my right to ask a question where i am curious about the position of other contributors dazvidania jeff of my friends are homosexual there are homophobic people i know it i have seen it in real life and here in yahoo answers wow some reactions are really wow jeff sorry i was reading too fast i apologize sorry again wow what an ugly following this answer attracted nothing like having the bible beaters come out of the woodwork and share their love for those different from themselves as well as the people who just love to hate lesbians and gay men because they can it's so pc to hate lesbians and gay men too because obviously god is on their side too not every time a man or woman wants to do something that a man is not suppose to do or does what a woman is not suppose to do they are labeled a homosexual since gay hatred is so socially acceptable based on religious intolerance and gay hating legislation labeling someone gay is the time tested tool to use to keep both men and women in their place meaning in their sexist traditional gender stereotypical roles look how often feminists are labeled gay and lesbian by anti feminists on this web site like every day multiple times a day and look how many men and women rush to say i'm not gay but or i'm not a feminist but anytime a man tries to talk about feminism in a positive light the first thing an anti feminist says is you must be gay the first thing young feminists male and female say to an anti feminist is the same thing you must be gay one of the worst insults you can make in this society is to accuse someone of being gay so it is an essential tool of social control especially by those that have the authority of their church and law behind them to enforce it and there really is a good reason to fear being labeled gay or lesbian in this society there is no right to employment in the majority of us states if you are perceived to be gay or if you are actually gay or lesbian so if someone labels you as gay even if you aren't you can legally be fired with the reason they're gay in the majority of us states you can also be kicked out of the military and don't have a right to your home furnishings or personal items if you don't have a will and your partner dies even if you do have a will you can still lose everything you shared with your partner you will most likely lose custody of your children if someone accuses you of being gay as well there are truly severe repercussions for being labeled gay in us society i don't know if homophobia was an essential characteristic of patriarchal societies in the past but it sure has been an effective strategy for enforcing social control for the last few hundred years in us society just a whisper of homosexuality or lesbianism has been the end of many people's careers marriages and their leadership roles in their community it still works too i agree that you are a gay hater if you're against gay marriage too i personally hate marriage but i recognize all the privileges that married people get over unmarried people by denying those rights to committed couples because of their sexual orientation is discriminatory gay couples aren't asking to be married in every church in the nation so the religious crud doesn't hold water but marriage does provide thousands of privileges and rights for those that are eligible to marry that other committed couples can not have and many of these rights have to do with taxes wills custody and property so gays and lesbians are being denied many rights every citizen has if they are heterosexual that's discrimination and when states make explicit laws stating that people of the same sex can not marry that's discrimination laws prohibiting whites and non whites from marrying were in place until just a few years ago it took the supreme court to override those state laws since the states refused to get rid of them since racism was so socially acceptable why does this matter to me i'm bisexual i was with a woman for years and people did not know unless i told them since i look stereotypically feminine i refuse to pass for straight just because it would be easier i almost lost my job when i put my female partner as my partner on my work life insurance the hr director was stunned that i stated it she had never had anyone admit to her that they were gay she proceeded to tell a great deal of the staff and quite a few were very upset and made sure i knew it when did this happen years ago hatred and fear of gays and lesbians is a social disease but one that is totally
