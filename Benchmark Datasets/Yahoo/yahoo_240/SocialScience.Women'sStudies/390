some people on here said that criticizing female sex supremacists means to be against feminism and equality they even went as far with comparing people who criticize female sex supremacists to people who opposed the blacks rights movement do you think this comparison is accurate why why not if we stick to the comparison who are the female sex supremacists the ones who want equal laws and rights or the ones who oppose equal laws and rights and want special laws and rights mollypop i never said men should have special rights you can think and prove you are better than a person x its called fair competition incidently female sex supremacists try to justify special rights and perks with an inferiority of women by saying they need special help and attention although you also have those who just say women are special and therefore deserve x the women who want to oppress men instead of just having equality between the sexes are a large and vocal group and i will speak out against them because i am for human rights and that means everyone's rights not just the female sex's rights but everyone irregardless of color race creed national origin socioeconomic group religion and gender and i am a woman and i like men and want them to be powerful people as i want women to be that way too but power is not bullying Homophobia Black supremacy Civil rights Supremacism Speciesism White supremacy Woman Same-sex marriage Gender role Gay rights Feminist movement Sexism White separatism Religion and sexual orientation Transgender Gender identity Masculism Gender-neutral language Gender Black nationalism Racism Equal Rights Amendment Homosexuality White (people) Transfeminism Equal Protection Clause Intelligence quotient Sex-positive feminism Christian views of women Gay Abortion debate Sexual orientation Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Women in Islam Animal rights Same-sex marriage in the United States History of feminism Age of consent Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Female genital cutting Fair use Homosexuality and Christianity Racial segregation Suffrage Asian fetish European Convention on Human Rights Marriage Religious Society of Friends Human sexual behavior Transsexuality History of South Africa in the apartheid era Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Andrea Dworkin Sex Liberalism Group sex Sociology Reparative therapy Heteronormativity Same-sex marriage in Canada Matilda Joslyn Gage Bell hooks Penis envy Religion and sexuality God and gender Constitution of Japan Nazism Homosexuality and transgender Judicial activism Southern Poverty Law Center African American American individualist anarchism Order of succession Radical feminism Political correctness Miscegenation Anti-racism Civil Rights Act of 1991 Pedophilia Racialism Human rights Rape Cross-dressing History of women in the United States Queer Unlawful combatant The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Hate group North American Man/Boy Love Association Passing Constitution of India American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Conscription Anti-Defamation League
