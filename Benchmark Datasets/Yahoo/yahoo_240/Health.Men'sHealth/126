why do women always think that they have to get off first i personally think as long as my man is happy then i am happy of course it is nice to orgasm too not that i don't care about a woman's pleasure but you are the perfect woman will in that aspect anyway i find women can be rather selfish when it comes to sex some of them fake orgasms which is dishonest i think most men would rather be ineffective than deceived we can't get better if we think we're gods in bed they let us do all the hard work and complain if they didn't get off i'd like to see you get on top do all the thrusting and focus on getting me off as well as yourself and then there's oral and hand jobs i have yet to meet a woman that enjoys doing that all the girls i've been with act as if it's a chore just because it doesn't give them pleasure Oral sex Strap-on dildo Anal sex Sexual intercourse Orgasm Child sexuality Masters and Johnson Jam (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Human sexual behavior Serial killer Bondage (BDSM) Mail-order bride Sexual orientation Masturbation History of sex Theory of conduct Social rule Religion and sexuality EastEnders Sex toy Zoophilia Nicomachean Ethics Avenue Q BDSM Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Woman on top sex position Sexual dysfunction American Psycho Gender role Sin City Autograph Meaning of life Birth control The Beatles discography Happiness Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Tom Leykis Anorgasmia When Harry Met Sally...
