i really want to get circumcised but don't know how it will affect me in the long run one thing i've noticed in my experience talking with people is that it affects everybody differently there are some people who were circumcised as adults and very happy others more that i know of who were circumcised and lost sensitivity and feeling after all they do remove nerve endings in a sensitive part there's no way to tell which will apply to you but in general i would say not to do it unless something is wrong with your penis how it is already and really wrong and you think it can be fixed by circumcision after all it's non reversible it's a big thing and most circumcised people never experienced the other side of the coin so they don't know what it's like you could have terrible long term affects like a drying up of the glans and less feeling and worse sex but some people have reported that it gets better however these are the things that should not impact your decision cleanliness if you can wash under your foreskin every day then it's fine what people say girls like most of the girls in the world are having sex with uncircumcised men as of men are uncut so really they shouldn't complain personally as a female i prefer uncircumcised and that's how almost every young man is where i live things like infections google it there is no conclusive evidence that it helps with infections and you should practice safe sex anyway Circumcision Foreskin Medical analysis of circumcision Foreskin restoration Penis Glans penis History of male circumcision Phimosis Masturbation Brit milah Female genital cutting Ridged band AIDS Human sexual behavior Oral sex Balanitis Penile cancer Sex organ Condom Transsexuality Smegma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gay slang Prostate cancer Man Circumcision advocacy Gliding action Clitoris Intersex surgery Pedophilia John Money Balanitis xerotica obliterans Circumcision in the Bible Penis removal Puberty Sexual orientation Infant baptism Child sexuality AIDS in Africa Chronic fatigue syndrome Genital integrity Child sexual abuse Hypospadias Prince Albert piercing Jewish Christians AIDS pandemic Genital modification and mutilation Chancroid Utilitarianism Breastfeeding Infantilism Vulva Body modification Gender role Gay Theodicy Abortion debate Human sexuality Age of consent Hearing impairment Human penis size Sex toy Urinary incontinence Sexual fetishism Gender identity Cervical cancer Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Subud Ex-gay David Reimer Pubic hair American Psycho Sex assignment Fecal incontinence Economic inequality History of intersex surgery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kyle Broflovski Sento Domestic violence The nature of God in Western theology 613 mitzvot Jam (TV series) Autism Infibulation Hepatitis C Motion picture rating system Multiple sclerosis Sharia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Appeal Polyamory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Transactional analysis
