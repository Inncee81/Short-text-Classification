ok all men serious question about sex is it really all physical attraction for the male sex i was thinking about it today and i realized that we women bash the men when honestly i as a woman also tend to judge a boy with how he looks you are very right both sexes judge each other attractiveness girls are just less obvious then boys about it it takes a long time and maturity before a guy realizes he is being looked at and judged just as he judges women and to be more subtle when he is attracted to a girl i was raised by my sisters as well as my mom and i know girls are harsh and judgmental with each other and the opposite sex they just express themselves differently it is not all about physical attraction a great personality and confidence in yourself goes a long way and men pick up on that every man loves attention and made to feel like he is the king it really does not matter what you look like if you can do that Gender role Sexual orientation Physical attractiveness Human sexual behavior Gay slang Child sexuality Sex History of intersex surgery Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Transgender Dead Like Me Joke Kylie Minogue Androgen insensitivity syndrome Bisexuality Girl Social rule Sexual attraction John Money Childlove movement Puberty Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender identity Homosexuality and Christianity Gender Homosexuality and transgender Sex and the City Friends Sex and intelligence Mojave people Zoophilia Bish__jo game Human Cross-dressing Gender-neutral language Anal sex Polyamory Sexual selection Abortion debate Robert A.
