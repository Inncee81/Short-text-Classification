what's the biggest fish you can land with lb line i'm just getting started fishing and i'm curious how you decide what size line to use i know it doesn't have to equal the weight of the fish but i've never heard any rules of thumb on what strength line to use usually your reel will tell you it can accept sizes up to say lb for a number to work with the heavier the line the more difficult it is to handle easily it won't cast as well it will tangle more easily and it will not be as sensitive to the bite keep in mind though it depends on what your fishing for i usually stay around lb test line but when i am fishing for big strippers or big catfish i change to a heavier line you my need to have a bigger reel for this also a heavier rod especially if you are ocean fishing it can be a little expensive to have all the equipment for all the possible fishing experiances you may encounter back to the question it is possible to catch a pound fish on pound test line you have to set your drag and play them out till they are tired enough to reel in only problem is if they run and you don't have enough line on the reel to slow them down before they hit the end i have many rods and reels for different types of fishing but for fun i love to catch a bass or any nice fish on an ultra light with pound test it's exciting and fun Fishing rod Slot machine Movie projector Avenue Q Drag racing Angling Explosive material Big-game fishing Kitesurfing Drill bit 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fishing Lawn mower Fast bowling Badminton Striped bass Social rule Anchor Tag CPU cache M60 machine gun Car handling Poker jargon Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Indianapolis 500 B-47 Stratojet Weight training Knife Equine conformation Fishing reel M16 (rifle) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie RuneScape Random Events English cricket team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Nuclear reactor Timpani Coming of Age (TNG episode) Radio controlled airplane Reel Big Fish Diving Welding It's Walky!
