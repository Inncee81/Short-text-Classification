why is the queen's husband not titled the king of england you would think that once you marry the heir to the throan you automaticly become their counter title i've answered this question so many times the queen was heir to her father king george vi and philip was not an hereditary heir to the throne just a son in law since the queen is regent no one can bear a title higher than hers which is queen regent the title king implies the regent and this won't do because the regent is queen philip of royal birth danish german greek royal houses must use the title for consort of a ruling queen which is prince consort consort is what a person who marries an heir can get in england england's rule is hereditary thusly the wife of the prince of wales will never reign but wear the title of queen or princess as they claim consort the same rule apples to a male who marries an heir to the throne he can never reign automatically but becomes a consort it would take an act of parliament for philip to become king Heir Apparent British monarchy Louise of Hesse Regency Acts Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Christian IX of Denmark British Royal Family George VI of the United Kingdom Victoria of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Charles, Prince of Wales George I of Great Britain Edward III of England Prince Kingdom of England Edward VII of the United Kingdom George V of the United Kingdom Succession to the British Throne Dutch monarchy Princess of Wales Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Elizabeth I of England Imperial Household of Japan Thai royal and noble titles Mary I of England Henry VIII of England Kings of Jerusalem Monarch Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem Emperor Philip II of Spain Edward IV of England House of Bourbon Hatshepsut Mary I of Scotland George III of the United Kingdom Frederick VII of Denmark Line of succession to the British Throne Order of succession Joseon Dynasty Emperor of Japan House of Orange-Nassau King consort United Kingdom order of precedence Habsburg William III of England Richard III of England James I of England Victoria, Princess Royal and Empress Frederick Mary II of England George II of Great Britain Prince of Wales Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall Mary of Teck Charles II of England John of England Alexandra of Denmark Regent Wars of the Roses Henry VI of England Peerage Danish Royal Family Duke Kingdom of Hawaii Princess Charlotte, Princess Royal Richard I of England Marie Sophie of Hesse British princess Maud of the United Kingdom Juliana of the Netherlands Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl__cksburg Caroline of Ansbach Catherine of Aragon Princess consort Emperor Ai of Han Duke of Braganza Fujiwara clan James II of England Jadwiga of Poland Chinese nobility Henry VII of England Margrethe II of Denmark Christian I of Denmark Morganatic marriage Wladislaus IV of Poland Maria II of Portugal Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Style of the British Sovereign Lord Chancellor
