really bad and annoying tv problems recently i just got my dads old tv it worked fine then he got a glistening new hdtv and i got his old inch general electric standard i tv i have a problem with the picture any time i play a game or watch a movie through the av cables any bright colors containing red drag over to the right say i'm playing the elder scrolls iv oblivion on my ps what happens is when its maybe sundown and the sky is red all the red on the screen stays in the same place but also alot of red is being dragged to the right of the screen it gets really annoying any suggestions also every so often what happens is there'll be a little purpleish blue color in the middle right or left of the screen and it gets dreadfully annoying when the tv was in my dads room it never did this all we did was carry it around a corner and up the stairs it never went near any magnets and there arent any magnetic items in my room theres a dvr box to the right of it but nothing else i know of could hurt i had another tv both are roundscreen that had the same exact problems it was also sitting in the same spot as the old tv what sort of thing could cause the tv to do that the tv's are on the second floor its a year old farm house and the only thing in the attic above it are one of the turbine things the metal spinny thingys but i doubt that would have any effect on top of the tv are just a bunch of disks but anyways the tv never did this to my dad only as soon as it got into my room it started messing up whats going on every roundscreen tv i've had in the past has done this to me and only in this room any help or a reason why its doing this would be great btw to the person who said i is needed its not its only if you have an hdmi cable av is for i and p etc but anyways the same problem occurs when im playing on any game console be it my snes n nes gamecube wii ps genesis sega dreamcast or my ps and ps even it also does the same thing with my dvd player vcr and my old dvr box that connects through av inputs rather than a cable line the red bleeding out of it's intended visual area is a sign that the picture tube has aged and is dying it's sometimes possible to rejuvenate the crt and get a few more months out of it but the crt is basically gone at this point if you have a boat and need a new anchor it may be useful in that capacity back down the color and contrast levels to limit this phenomena Television Computer role-playing game Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Dreamcast Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Entertainment System Oscilloscope Nintendo GameCube Sega DVD Nintendo Mouse (computing) SCART High-definition television Xbox Bubble Bobble PlayStation Portable Atari 8-bit family Video game console Laserdisc Cathode ray tube Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital video recorder PlayStation 3 TiVo Super Mario Bros. 3 Cable television Sega Saturn Lighting Final Fantasy Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 Mario Pac-Man Wind turbine Super Mario Bros.
