in a furnished basement would you go with lcd or plasma hd tv i want a p contast ratio large screen for my basement mostly for hd dvd's and xbox seeing how it is in a large room with no sunlight what is a better option i agree go lcd also you mentioned a contrast ratio here is a bit of information to explain how that is nothing more than a marketing tactic first of all it's necessary to understand the difference between the two types of contrast ratio measurements the one used by pretty much every manufacturer out there is full on white full off black while this can give some amazingly high numbers people don't watch all white or all black screens comparing the brightest whites in one scene to the blackest blacks in another scene is not representative of the picture quality available at the exact instance you're watching each scene the contrast ratio that matters most for the most common viewing scenarios is ansi contrast ratio with ansi contrast ratio the black and white levels are measured at the same time on the same screen using a square black and white checkerboard image what this means is that it is representative of the contrast ratio achievable at any one point in time this is what is really important the reason ansi contrast ratios are not published is because of marketing ansi contrast ratios are much lower than on off contrast ratios an ansi contrast ratio of would be an impressive result and would be outstanding but much too low of a number if casually compared to an on off contrast ratio of Liquid crystal display Plasma display Television Digital photography Stereoscopy Decibel Light-emitting diode Loudspeaker Video Projection screen NTSC Contrast ratio Pixel Plasma (physics) Oscilloscope Solar cell Laserdisc High-definition television Labour economics Big Bang Common Lisp Gamut MP3 Anamorphic widescreen Color Laptop Entropy Sun Movie projector Nuclear fusion Nuclear magnetic resonance Prostate cancer Analog-to-digital converter White (people) Microeconomics Photography Wallpaper group Gross domestic product Solar power GoldenEye 007 Digital-to-analog converter Supply and demand Cinematography Watch Drawing Labor theory of value Basement EIA-708 PE ratio Widescreen PlayStation 2 Organic light-emitting diode E85 Transformer Welding Planetary nebula Binoculars Inflation IMac Sega Cathode ray tube Aspect ratio (image) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Quark-gluon plasma Gameking Signal-to-noise ratio Mutual fund Level of measurement Hipparchus (astronomer) Human skin color Pan and scan Tide BASIC programming language Economic inequality Balassa-Samuelson effect Anchor Species Spacecraft propulsion Chess problem Supply-side economics Audiophile Central processing unit History of computer and video games Digital television Neutrino Archimedes Global climate model Motion picture rating system PlayStation 3 Law of value Eyepiece Electrophysiology DVD
