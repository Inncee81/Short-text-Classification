how do you hook up a direct tv satellite dish we have an extra dish that we want to hook up at our camp and want to try to do it ourselves i did it myself and it wasn't as complicated as i expected the dish comes with a cable to connect it to the satellite receiver which in turn connects to the tv there is an installation kit that comes with several different kinds of hardware to hang it on a brick wall anchor it to concrete put it on the roof etc there is also a little compass in the kit and you look up the azimuth compass heading and the elevation angle above the horizon in the instructions based on your zip code you set the dish to this position then the receiver has a mode where it measures the strength of the signal and you move the dish a little big up and down and from side to side looking to get the strongest signal there is even an audible signal on the tv so you can just listen through an open window while you're up on the ladder adjusting the dish i got it right on in about five minutes i expected it to be a lot harder because the satellite is so tiny and so far away but it turned out to be very easy then you call directv and they do some stuff at their end to turn the signal on Satellite dish Communications satellite Polarization Satellite television Anchor Oscilloscope Modem Sundial Antenna (radio) Glossary of firefighting equipment Global Positioning System Skateboarding trick Solar power Navigation Radar Pirate decryption Poker jargon VHF omnidirectional range DirecTV TiVo Wind turbine Equine conformation IPod Direct broadcast satellite Booting Teletext Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Glossary of American football Elevator Xbox Optical fiber Glossary of nautical terms Stairway Arecibo Observatory Set-top box Ethernet Space elevator Glossary of climbing terms Digital circuit Game Boy Advance High-definition television Huygens probe Cable television Sextant Drill bit Addressing mode Sailing Digital video recorder Rail terminology RS-232 Mouse (computing) Swingout Digital television Bluetooth Aerial (dance move) Radio controlled airplane Cheating in Counter-Strike Chess terminology Home Box Office Professional wrestling match types Charles Wheatstone Enigma machine Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Loudspeaker TV-FM DX Professional wrestling holds Control character Copy protection Resident Evil (video game) MP3 Rigging Kernel (computer science) Atari ST Electrophysiology Satellite radio Quake III Arena Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Suplex Cruising (maritime) GunZ The Duel Strap-on dildo Carburetor Morse Code Avalanche Digital audio broadcasting Voice over IP Passenger car Broadband Internet access Public Broadcasting Service PIC microcontroller Celestial navigation STS-61 Floppy disk Seismometer
