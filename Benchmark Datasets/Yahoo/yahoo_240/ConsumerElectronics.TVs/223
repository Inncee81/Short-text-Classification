lcd or plasma what's the difference between lcd and plasma lcd tvs versus plasma tvs comparison plasma televisions lcd televisions advantage screen size screen sizes range from inches to inches larger plasmas like a inch unit from panasonic are in production but are still prohibitively expensive for consumer use sizes range from inches to inches as with plasma there are larger lcd tvs made like a inch display recently released by lg but they are not readily available or affordable at the consumer level plasma tvs are the current size champions particularly when comparing tvs that consumers can easily purchase lcds are catching up in size with their developing technology however and may surpass plasmas in the near future this may be due to difficulties in producing glass large enough for larger plasmas viewing angle up to up to lcd tvs have the advantage here but by a small margin your viewing experience is not going to be ideal at or degree angles lcd tvs used to have a problem in this area primarily because lcds were originally used as single person computer monitors screen refresh rates plasma displays refresh and handle rapid movements in video about as well as crt televisions lcd tvs were originally designed for data display and not video therefore refresh rates had to be improved lcd tvs with refresh rates below ms or lower ms show very few noticeable artifacts lcd tvs are now available with refresh rates as low as ms slight edge to plasma technology burn in or stuck pixels plasma tvs can suffer from burn in produced by static images after extended periods stationary images burn in and produce an after image ghost which remains permanently on the screen with technologies such as 'pixel orbitor ' new plasma tvs have addressed burn in and significantly reduced the issues of older models lcd tvs do not suffer from burn in but can have a retained pixel charge which may also produce ghosting stuck pixels are also possible with an lcd display with the latest plasma technology this is less of an issue than ever before pixel orbitor for example is one method of reducing burn in used by plasma manufacturers it requires no additional programing from the end user as some older burn in prevention techniques did if you plan to use a plasma for gaming some games with permanent 'dashboards' may still cause some burn in check user manuals for available solutions by model product life span plasma tvs have a reported half life of to hours half life is the time it takes the lamp to fade to half its original brightness lcd tvs also have replaceable backlights but the expense of replacing one when the time comes may be greater than simply replacing the entire tv both plasma and lcd technology should more than adequately satisfy most consumers the average crt tv the kind most of us have at home has a half life of around hours if the average american household watches an average of four to six hours of television a day even a hour lamp would give you over years of use by then you'll be enjoying your new 'holodeck ' weight plasma displays are fairly heavy and may need additional supports to be mounted onto a wall lcd tvs weigh less than comparably sized plasma tvs lcd tvs are considerably lighter more portable and cheaper to ship durability plasmas are very fragile making them tricky to ship and install unlike the commercials where plasmas are mounted on the ceiling plasmas are best installed by a professional and should be installed on a wall that can bear a good deal of weight much more durable than plasmas end users can easily mount an lcd tv themselves if desired lcd tvs are far less fragile than plasmas shipping due to their fragile nature plasma tvs need to be shipped by specialty carriers overnight or fast delivery options are not recommended special shipping methods and their heavier weight add to higher shipping costs shipping lcd tvs is not difficult and is not as expensive as shipping plasma displays lcd tvs are lighter and far less fragile than plasma displays making shipping easier and less expensive installation plasmas are heavier use more power and run hotter than lcd tvs and therefore require more planning when mounting them plasmas are generally best installed by professionals end users can easily install lcd tvs themselves or can use them just as they use a traditional tv using a stand lcd tvs are much easier to install than plasma tvs brightness contrast plasma tvs report higher brightness and contrast levels than lcds under ideal conditions no ambient light this is a true advantage of plasma technology because lcd tvs are backlit and therefore light must be blocked to create blacks plasmas have individual pixels that either on or off creating deeper blacks and better contrast lcd tvs can often look better in 'real world' situations plasmas are made with a special glass surface that can reflect light which dulls the brightness and contrast of the image lcd tvs reflect very little light allowing them to maintain levels in well lit rooms both lcd and plasma tvs will meet the brightness expectations of most consumers however in 'real world' situations with ambient light lcd tvs will generally look a little brighter thickness as thin as inches deep as thin as inches deep lcds tvs are just a bit thinner performance at high altitude high altitudes can affect the performance of plasma displays because the gas held inside each pixel is stressed and has to work harder to perform some manufacturers make plasmas that are specifically designed for high altitudes but they may be priced higher than standard models lcd tvs are not affected by high altitudes lcd tvs Hypoglycemia Mattress Xbox 360
