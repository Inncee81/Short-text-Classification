can anyone help me fix an acoustic solutions lcd tv model lcd nk hd please help me i purchased a lcd tv it was ok for a couple of days and then all of a sudden i seem get very bad picture roll for which i have to keep switching the tv on and off repeatedly to resolve however the worst problem i have is very bad colour bleed the only way i can describe it is that it's like watching a live action cartoon if that makes any sense at all the background seems to go blue and the objects are red and green as you can imagine this is very frustrating sometimes i can resolve the problem by switching the tv off and on but other times i'm stuck with it please please somebody help me i would be eternally grateful cheers acoustic solutions tvs are made by a company called vestel contrary to what another answerer has said there is nothing inherently wrong with the components but i have noticed that the soldering is rather poor with many dry joints also they seem to have rather poor quality control so occasionally you may get the odd duff capacitor or whatever that slips through when it should have got replaced before shipment the fact that you can fix the problem by effectively putting a power spike through the circuit by switching off is quite symptomatic of a failed electrolytic capacitor the spike will cause the electrolyte to temporarily reform and then things will work for a while until it starts breaking down again if so find the duff capacitor and replace it and all will be well i have two sets one is perfect the other has a minor problem on the power amp which i can't be bothered to fix as i play the sound from it through my stereo however i would concur that unless like me you have access to the circuit diagrams and service manuals then the sensible first step would be to go back to the store but if that fails then take it to an electrical repair shop and get them to remake all the dry joints on the main board and check replace any suspect electrolytics be warned though that isn't a quick job to do so if you don't get it repaired under warrantee you expect to pay a fair bit for the repair mind you as the tv was pretty cheap even if you do end out forking out it would still be quite reasonable Circuit design Oscilloscope Capacitor plague Poker jargon Capacitor Audiophile Computer Television Bicycle lighting Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Action potential Color 2000 Australian Grand Prix Electronic amplifier Rail terminology Ethernet Impedance Electrophysiology Digital circuit Operational amplifier Service life CPU cache Microphone Central processing unit Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cold fusion Gramophone record Microeconomics CPU design Theodicy Digital photography Hash table Windows XP IMac Cable television Loudspeaker Eye Procrastination Electric motor Cathode ray tube Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Telephone exchange Heinkel He 112 PlayStation Portable Diode Goodness and value theory Super Nintendo Entertainment System Fluorescent lamp Printed circuit board Apollo Guidance Computer Transistor Tesla coil Objective-C Sound Blaster Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Violin Friends Watch Pixel Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Information Technology Infrastructure Library Democracy Quicksort SCART Switched-mode power supply Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Transformer Gauge theory X10 (industry standard) Cray-1 GunZ The Duel Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Enterprise content management Trademark Nintendo Entertainment System Surveillance Dynamic random access memory Debugging PCB layout guidelines Analog-to-digital converter Thermal power station Bob and George History of computing hardware Plasma display Light-emitting diode The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Seismic retrofit
