my television i asked this question before and the answer i received was that my television was possessed although i found that quite funny it didn't help much we have a couple tvs so i know it's not the cable i know how to switch preferences for language auto program and that sort of thing one tv on certain channels that we watch all the time goes to spanish now and not giving us the option to change to english plus a few channels have lost their audio i'm sooooooooo confused otherwise it's fine but any suggestions as there really isn't such a thing as tv repair anymore just tv replace you know what i mean any other suggestions am beginning to believe my television is possessed called cable company they tried to guide me to the saps but we have an rca and it's not easy i even looked for a hidden compartment on the tv for a button it's a mystery i tell ya all other channels are perfectly fine just a few either no volume or in spanish i have to find my paperwork unless there is an rca expert out there hmmmm maybe i'll ask for one here your sap secondary audio program is turned on i know this since in your other message you state that it only plays spanish on some channels that would be the channels that actually have a spanish sap on the other channels where no sap exists the audio is in english on the other channels where an sap signal exists but that channel carries no sap audio the audio seems muted because there is nothing there to hear if you gave us the model number of the rca tv it might be possible to find a manual online i liked the answer that said look for a reset or defaults setting it might be possible to unplug the tv for a day or more and achieve this also but that depends on how they saved the settings and that means you cannot use the tv in the meantime look for an audio button or sap button on the remote you probably already did go into the setup menu and look for audio selections and see if there is an sap setting or a mono versus stereo setting in there set it to stereo if it is a stereo tv that is usually main audio since sap is mono Television IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART Xbox Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD Remote control Oscilloscope Digital television Cable television Mouse (computing) Jack plug Modem Ethernet Teletext Musical Instrument Digital Interface NTSC PlayStation Portable Embedded system AmigaOS Compact disc RCA connector AES/EBU Wheel of Fortune Digital audio broadcasting MP3 System/36 FM broadcasting Stereophonic sound Quadraphonic Synthesizer Atari 8-bit family Knight Rider Windows 2000 Telephone exchange Amstrad CPC American Broadcasting Company Floppy disk Laserdisc Walkman System/34 Steganography Multitrack recording ITU-T Microphone Compact audio cassette Whose Line Is It Anyway?
