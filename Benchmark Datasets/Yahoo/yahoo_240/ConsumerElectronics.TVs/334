can you fix a burnt out plasma help i think i may have killed my friend's tv aparently when i turned off the system i turned off the surround sound cable box but not the tv thought i did but aparently it was on for like hrs w out a signal now he says it had no picture is there a way to fix it it is repairable unless it was hit by a lightning strike or strong power surge but your friend should make sure you did not just select an input that is inactive instead of turning it off also agree with answer below mine it might need to be unplugged for a minute or two and then plugged back in to reset some kind of automatic protection that was triggered by leaving it on and hdtv sets with digital tuners can experience tuner lockup and also need to be unplugged to fix by the way did your friend turn the cable box back on sorry i have to ask because some people really do not know how to operate their own audio video equipment once the installer leaves High-definition television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Television TiVo Digital television Cable television Xbox IPod Oscilloscope ITU-T Modem DVD High fidelity TV tuner card Universal Serial Bus Set-top box Telephone exchange Digital video recorder Welding Loudspeaker Digital cable Radio Dolby Laboratories Federal Standard 1037C PlayStation Portable Audiophile Impedance matching Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Diablo II: Lord of Destruction ATSC Freeview Fuse (electrical) Spark gap Lightning Atari 8-bit family Embedded system GSM services Frequency modulation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets ITunes Pirate decryption Phreaking Naval mine Composite video Bluetooth Power line communication Digital Visual Interface Nirvana (band) Videocassette recorder Synthesizer Satellite television Nintendo GameCube Apollo Guidance Computer Windows Vista Johnny 5 Kenwood Electronics Automatic transmission Windows XP Compact audio cassette Compact disc Lightning rod Protoss Windows 2000 FM broadcasting Solar power Jack plug Widescreen NTSC Photography Camcorder Wi-Fi TurboGrafx 16 D-subminiature Ground (electricity) Copy protection Telephone RCA connector X10 (industry standard) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Musical Instrument Digital Interface Arc welding Digital audio broadcasting S-Video Electronic amplifier Electric guitar Dimmer MPEG-2 Secure Digital card XLR connector DVB Telegraphy Video Digital Subscriber Line Circuit design Mixing console
