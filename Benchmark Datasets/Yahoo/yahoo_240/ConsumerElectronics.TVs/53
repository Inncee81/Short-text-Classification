son burnt out my tv by pressing the power button on and off how can i fix it tested a fuse i found and it was ok dont see any other fuses what can i do to fix it there really is not much that can happen by repeatedly turning the set off and on maybe the sets computer is locked up try unplugging the set for a few minutes then plug it back in and retry it if the set has been damaged it likely would be the horizontal output transistor or power supply regulator the surges could have damaged them it is highly unlikely but not impossible Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Transistor Vacuum tube Worms weapons and tools CMOS Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Embedded system Electronic amplifier Power strip Linear regulator Manual transmission PlayStation Portable Debugging Jack plug Electric motor Circuit design Residual-current device Fluorescent lamp Voltage regulator Nintendo Entertainment System Operational amplifier Pump It Up Gramophone record Xbox 360 STS-61 Fuel injection Diesel engine Son Gohan Spark plug Electrical wiring (UK) Ecco the Dolphin Radiation hardening Cheating in Counter-Strike GunZ The Duel IPod Welding Diving regulator Liquid crystal display Suicide methods Digital circuit Toyota Prius Turing machine Read-only memory Universal Serial Bus Spark gap Mouse (computing) Spacecraft propulsion Collision detection IBM 1620 Central processing unit Diving cylinder Intellivision Items in the Metroid series Heinkel He 100 Uninterruptible power supply D-subminiature Oscilloscope Switched-mode power supply Microprocessor Cathode ray tube Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Computer Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Turbocharger Domain theory Reading spark plugs for racing Audio power Armored Core Scuba set Capacitor plague Cerebellum Personal computer Electricity meter John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Canon T90 CPU design Diode Space Shuttle program Super Metroid AmigaOS Nuclear fusion Internal ballistics Electricity Battery electric vehicle Tier One Transformer USB flash drive Nintendo DS Chernobyl accident Compiler optimization Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Enigma machine Incandescent light bulb Opera (web browser) Microprogram Relay
