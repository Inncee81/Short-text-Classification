fixing a tv my friend is giving away a big screen tv but there is a problem with it i was wondering if it would be cheap to fix or if it would probably be really expensive they say the screen doesnt come on but you can hear it clicking on like a regular tv would do before the screen pops up anybody have any idea what could be wrong or if it would be expensive why would you even think about buying a tv that doesn't work especially when you don't know anything about television repair Digital photography Windows XP Public Eye Marilyn Monroe RuneScape cheats Gramophone record Theory of conduct Click consonant Social rule Cable television Opera (web browser) AmigaOS Cyberspace The 64,000 Dollar Question Prank flash Power pop Extreme Programming Mutual fund Real Love (song) Channel 4 The Karate Kid, Part III Ja Rule Cheap Trick Broadband Internet access BBC television drama Henry Fonda Gross domestic product Escape from New York Oscilloscope The Ashlee Simpson Show Fixed income Minesweeper (computer game) Shaggy dog story Steven Wright Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Widescreen Lost in Space Public domain System/34 MapleStory Jon Secada Cancer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Smoking Room Jam (TV series) Symbiosis (TNG episode) Meta-reference Avenue Q RuneScape quests Galactic Civilizations Screenshot Coming of Age (TNG episode) GunZ The Duel Gladys Knight & the Pips Arbitrage The Riordans WGA screenwriting credit system Columbia Pictures Bicycle brake systems Wonderful Radio London Chet Atkins Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mouse (computing) Supply and demand Tic-Tac-Dough The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Eurovision Song Contest LiveJournal Grandview, U.S.A.
