problems with my tv while playing ps i just bought a insignia lcd hdtv from best buy i understand this is one of those you get what you pay for tv's but still i dont think that legitimizes my problem i bought an hdmi cable for the picture quality is absolutely amazing the only problem i have is the sound the only game i've played on it and the only one i own is elder scrolls oblivion as i said the picture comes in great but the sound is almost like the speakers are blown it sounds like an explosion everytime someone hits me in the game then i tried it with the standard component cables and the sound was fine can someone help me with this any sort of help will be appreciated thanks ahead of time the only thing i can think of causing this is the sound settings you have for the ps if you choose a wrong setting then the signal might be too strong for the speakers when you set up the component sound look at what is available and write them down only choose those for the hdmi i strongly recommend getting the hdmi to work so that you can upscale old ps and ps games and standard dvd Television DVD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IBM PC compatible High-Definition Multimedia Interface Home cinema Laserdisc Oscilloscope Digital television Loudspeaker Dolby Laboratories Digital Visual Interface Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Nintendo Entertainment System Cable television NTSC Widescreen 1080p Theory of conduct Audiophile Warez Sound Blaster Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 3 Tris Speaker Sega Dreamcast Video High fidelity Sound recording Xbox Atari ST Shit Mouse (computing) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family Xbox 360 Poker jargon Movie projector The Elder Scrolls Digital cable Home Box Office Infantilism PlayStation Portable The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Digital rights management Game Boy Magnet Game theory Hiberno-English ATSC DMX (lighting) British Sky Broadcasting MP3 Hebrew language Liquid crystal display ROM image Dance Dance Revolution Synthesizer Anamorphic widescreen Speech recognition Gramophone record Violin Babe Ruth Decibel Singlish Hey Jude Super Nintendo Entertainment System Digital audio broadcasting Liquid crystal display television DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Computer role-playing game DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Handheld game console African American Vernacular English Ethernet Universal Serial Bus Color Blu-ray Disc Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) The Amazing Race William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Optical fiber Computer and video games Digital photography Wheel of Fortune Sega Saturn DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Therion (band) Hangul Gross domestic product Bass guitar Spider-Man (games) VHS MPEG-2 Extreme Programming PowerBook
