what's the uk debit card situation nowadays when i was at uni years ago switch was the real debit card and solo was a kind of debit card lite but what's the vibe these days i ask because some web shops accept payment with solo but not switch switch doesn't exist anymore it is maesto http en wikipedia org wiki maestro debit card basically changed over with the introduction of chip and pin i believe solo still exists but as you say is a lite version essentially for young people or people with terrible credit histories as it can't be used everywhere and has low limits on it web shops will accept masestro which is the new switch before they will accept solo nb if you have an old card which says switch on it that should work by selecting maestro similarly if you have a maestro card on an old website that should work by selecting switch Debit card EFTPOS Credit card Smart card Internet fraud Money Kazaa Bank Oyster card Surveillance Uniform Resource Locator Chip and PIN Cross site scripting Computer MetroCard Slot machine Wiki Domain Name System Aldi RFID Electronic commerce Monty Hall problem VISA (credit card) Bank fraud Culture Online shop Octopus card Legal tender Ulster Bank Two-factor authentication Electronic money Cheating in poker Credit card fraud Scalable Vector Graphics Secure Digital card Automatic teller machine Wikipedia PowerPC Interac HTTP cookie Jumpstart 3rd Grade Loyalty program Mozilla Firefox Best Buy London Underground EMV Sound Blaster E-ZPass IPod Neopets Beijing Atari 8-bit family World Wide Web Insurance Sega Dreamcast MAME Wheel of Fortune Poker jargon Scrip ITU-T Euro Cheque United Kingdom corporation tax Macromedia Flash Identity document USB flash drive Embedded system Billboard Hot 100 Digital photography Web server Integrated circuit Modem Central processing unit EasyGroup Filling station Atari 2600 Musical Instrument Digital Interface ATI Technologies Apple II family Telephone card Python programming language Visual Basic MSN Messenger Automated Clearing House Nintendo Entertainment System Mouse (computing) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Yu-Gi-Oh!
