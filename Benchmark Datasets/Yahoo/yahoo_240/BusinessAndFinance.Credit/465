what to do i have two credit cards with id fraud help i have two credit cards mint and capital one both have been used with out my knowledge or agreement i only found this out when statements arrived neither credit card company will freeze the interest on the cards i have informed police who are unable to assist me because since april it must be the card company who report's it to the police not sure where to turn next as it seems i am liable for this money any advice thanks xx this is uk card issue thanks for help so far guys i had a similar problem with a visa debit card from lloyds tsb as soon as i saw the statement they had taken euros cash from a bank in milan i called the fraud department and they sorted it out very efficiently and immediately with just two phone calls they called me back to verify my identity they needed to know of course that i hadn't been in italy and that i still had the card it had been cloned but they were quite happy to verify this verbally on the phone which surprised me identity theft and card cloning is unfortunately very common and the safest thing is to make sure that the card never leaves your sight this is one reason why chip and pin is safer than swipe and sign i also had a problem with a credit card transaction online where i never received the goods again this was dealt with swiftly and efficiently by a call to the card company the first call should be to the card company and you should find a number for their fraud department either on the card on the agreement or online hopefully the fraudulent transactions should show some anomaly not goods you normally purchase not purchased from a place where you were or something like that nevertheless card fraud is something that they deal with regularly and they should be able to freeze the card and cancel and refund the amounts and the charges quickly and routinely both companies are reputable ones i believe and i am surprised that you have had problems i suggest that you call them again with all the facts that you can lay your hands on especially any circumstances that you can remember where the cards might have been cloned or left your person without your knowledge EFTPOS Credit card fraud Octopus card Chip and PIN Surveillance Bank fraud Internet fraud Automatic teller machine Electronic money Identity theft Contract British national identity card Plame affair RFID Smart card Schabir Shaik Trial Money Insurance Identity document Microeconomics Enron Corporation Bank Euro Advance fee fraud Password United Kingdom corporation tax Loyalty program 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Spyware Fraud Mail fraud Mergers and acquisitions Privacy Poker jargon Gold standard Interac Legal tender Passport Corporation Electronic commerce Phishing IBM PC compatible Electronic voting Two-factor authentication United States dollar Slot machine Life insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tax Betting (poker) Wachovia Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Anonymity Skype Consensus decision-making Corporate governance Intellectual property Vodafone Spam (electronic) Have I Got News For You Aldi Jean Charles de Menezes Mortgage Public-key cryptography Phone fraud Florida Central Voter File Marshall Plan Timeline of the Enron scandal Data retention AMD David Beckham Citigroup Ocean's Twelve Canadian dollar Punch card MetroCard SCO-Linux controversies SmartRider Baccarat Monetary policy Grand Theft Auto III Commodore 64 Tom DeLay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EMV Minimum wage National identification number Draw poker Emergency telephone number Stock Annuity Personal finance Islamic banking Mutual fund Cheque
