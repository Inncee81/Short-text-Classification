a question about my credit card if i scheduled an online payment to post onto my account for tomorrow and requested this post date tonight will my credit card balance drop tomorrow in accordance with what i payed even though it doesn't show any deduction on my checking account balance from where i payed it from it should work that way i made online payments to two credit cards on they were posted to the credit card accounts and the payments cleared my checking account on but i have been making online payments to these accounts for years it sounds as if this will be the first time you will have tried it so perhaps the credit card company will have different procedures for when they will post a payment from a new customer edit my credit cards are with the outfit you mentioned in the other later question Credit card Internet fraud Credit score Cheque Bank Credit card fraud Octopus card Bank fraud EFTPOS Surveillance Financial audit Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Student loan National Insurance Debit card 401(k) Annuity E-ZPass Betting (poker) Electronic money Electronic commerce Identity theft Article One of the United States Constitution Food Stamp Program Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Personal finance MetroCard Bond Enterprise content management Extreme Programming Payroll United States Postal Service Advance fee fraud Oyster card Poker jargon Playing card Taxation in the United States Accounts payable Mail Phishing Mail fraud Life insurance Health insurance Game programming Schabir Shaik Trial Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Credit history Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Depreciation Minitel Finance Financial services Scrip Refinancing Primerica Financial Services Mutual fund Wachovia Mensal__o scandal E-mail spam Government debt Copyleft Windows XP SmarTrip Chip and PIN Corporate governance Mortgage Steam (content delivery) Insurance Certificate of deposit Gross domestic product Baccarat Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bretton Woods system Automated Clearing House Telephone card Micropayment Currency Gold standard The Amazing Race Consensus decision-making Money Compensation of employees Data retention E-gold America Online Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Xerox American Express Fiat money Electricity meter Apprenticeship Blackjack Payphone Interest Traveler's cheque United States Constitution Animal Crossing
