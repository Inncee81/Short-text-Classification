if you are married how much does your spouse's credit effect yours if nothing is in both names my husband and i just got married in march he has a past history of really bad credit he's not a good money manager he's not good at remembering when things are due and tends to be late on things out of pure forgetfulness i on the other hand have excellent credit i have never been late on anything always pay more than minimum and really handle credit in the way it should be handled i also handle accounts payable receievable for a living so i am accustomed to handleing money how much does it effect my credit if he's late on one of his payments if my name is not on it we don't have both our names on anything not even bank accounts haven't gotten around to a joint one yet does it effect mine at all or since we got married do we have a joint credit score now or what i'm looking to take over our finances since i'm not satisfied with the way he's handleing them its causing major tension i would like to know one way or the other in this arguement thanks btw i married him b c i love him with all of my heart he's not a total bum works hard and provides very well for me he's just not good at tracking this type thing everyone has strengths and weaknesses and you can't pick the parts of a person you love you have to love all of them its kinda difficult right now on us but we will get it figured out in a way thats benficial to both of us also we already own home or i should say he does it's in his name he's done a lot of work on his credit already and qualifying for a home proves that but its still not his fave thing in the world to handle and so thats why i would rather just take care of it all his credit will not directly affect you in any way we all have one credit score and it is attached to our ssn so your info does not merge with his it does affect you in other ways indirectly because he has bad credit and you good does he expect you to provide him with credit cards if he defaults on those cards it would affect you negativly not saying he does or would just considerations to make when it comes time to buy a house or a car if his name is on it with a bad credit score he would probably need you to cosign this in and of itself would not bring down your credit score but the more items you have in your name the more your debt to income ratio is affected and that inturn would affect your credit worthieness so you need to watch that kind of thing the biggie will be when you are ready to buy a house if his credit is poor it could affect your interest rate especially if you need him on the mortgage to buy the house ie because of dti so it is good you are having your accounts separate but it is also important you two put a little time and effort into fixing his poor credit and maintaining your good credit so you will be on equal footing also you say he is really bad at money managment so it might be important to keep separate finances you could have checkings the checking for your paychecks to be direct deposited into the checking for your bills to be paid from and groceries and the checking for your spending money give him access to only the spending money account it is important he doesn't feel you are imasculating him but that you are trying to help him and keep your finances in order as well good luck Credit card Bank Mortgage FairTax Annuity Debt Credit score Student loan Bond Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Gross domestic product Citigroup Internet fraud Poker jargon Life insurance Money Mutual fund Social Security (United States) Personal finance Islamic banking Cheque Capitalism Derivative (finance) Economy of Russia Gold standard Money supply Fiat money Economy of the United States Divorce Interest Bretton Woods system Fractional-reserve banking Inflation Identity theft Mergers and acquisitions Compensation of employees United Kingdom corporation tax Schabir Shaik Trial Theory of conduct Finance Taxation in the United States Security (finance) Capital accumulation Insurance Publicly funded medicine Equine conformation Hyperinflation Tax Concurrent estate Inventory Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Betting (poker) Electronic commerce Pitaten Great Depression Social rule Surveillance Corporate finance Donald Trump Health insurance The Amazing Race Economic inequality Blackjack U.S. public debt Financial audit Predatory lending Value added tax Craps Economy of Pakistan Unemployment Commodity markets Financial markets Flat tax Contract Leasing Euro Arthur Laffer Supply and demand Financial services Supply-side economics History of the United States (1918-1945) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Tesco Primerica Financial Services Billboard Hot 100 Savings and loan association
