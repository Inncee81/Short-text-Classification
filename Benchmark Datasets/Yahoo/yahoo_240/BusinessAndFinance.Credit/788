how badly is your credit affected if you forget to pay your credit card i'm usually on time paying but i plain forgot to pay my credit card bill this month and was about a little over a week late paying it back this is the first time i've ever been late on a payment for my credit card and i'm a bit worried that later on if i go to apply for a house or car this could affect my status seeing how this is reported to credit score companies is being late once on your payments that bad as long as you pay it before you are days late nothing even gets reported to your credit report so if you paid it only a week late you will be fine however you may have accidentally kicked into a higher interest rate and had a late fee assessed because you were late but this only effects that credit card and is not noted on your credit report Credit card Bond Student loan London Congestion Charge Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Credit history Insurance Deflation (economics) Interest Debt consolidation Mortgage Life insurance Personal finance Minimum wage Government debt Bank Debt Money Health insurance New York Giants Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit default swap Auto insurance Credit card fraud Primerica Financial Services Octopus card FairTax Municipal bond Cable television Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 EFTPOS Wachovia Public transport Telephone card Economy of Russia Unemployment Treasury security Predatory lending Futures contract National Insurance Dividend Micropayment Data retention Advance fee fraud Islamic banking Credit rating agency Gold standard Refinancing Richard Perle National Football League British national identity card Estoppel Phishing Mail Debit card Government National Mortgage Association James T.
