what if i pay off the bad debt to build on another question i asked what would happen to my credit score if i paid in full my bad debts would that restart the years i currently have a credit score and need to increase it in less than two years i do have negative items which will be at the end of their seven year mark in three months you should check the collecting sol for your state to see were you stand since it has been almost years there could be a chance you are past the legal collecting sol and if so you would not be legally liable to pay to answer your question no an account cannot legally be re aged to report for a longer period than it normally would run it would not matter if you paid or not it cannot be re aged if you pay a negative account without requesting deletion your scores will drop since the account would be updated to reflect the recent payment status updating is not re aging even though they are negatives you will probably see a decrease in your scores when they drop off of your reports you would be losing history even though it is negative history your scores should rebound within months or so or probably even go higher as long as you keep the positive accounts in good standing if it were me and the accounts were due to drop off in months i'd send a dispute to the cra's claiming the accounts as obsolete and request removal i would not suggest doing that if a person is still within the collecting sol for their state and could not afford to pay the accounts off the first thing you should do is check your states collecting sol if you are still within sol send the collectors a debt validation letter do not sign your signature to any letter you send to a collector only print your initials or type your name everything you send to a collector should be sent certified mail return receipt when you get the signed cert green card back send your disputes to the cra's when the collector properly validates the debt send them a letter requesting to pay a portion of the amount as payment in full and that they will agree to remove what they had placed on your reports be absolutely sure you have it writing from them that they consider your payment as payment in full if you are past the collecting sol you do have a legal right to send the collector a sol letter which informs them that the debt is no longer legally collectible you might click on my profile and click on the last link i have listed you will be able to find the collecting sol for your state sample letter templates for validation sol etc never use a site that requires any payment for information especially when there are a few very good sites where you can get the same info and probably more for free United States Postal Service FairTax Article One of the United States Constitution Bond Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Annuity Life insurance Internet fraud Taxation in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social Security (United States) Postage stamp Plame affair Advance fee fraud Deflation (economics) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit E-mail spam SAT Drug test Mail fraud Appeal Identity theft Tax protester Mortgage Unemployment Estoppel 2003 California recall Bank fraud Tax Euro Surveillance Debt Gmail Neopets Domain Name System Public-key cryptography Gold standard SCO-Linux controversies Credit repair Divorce Cross site scripting Pretty Good Privacy Child support Opportunity rover Socrates RuneScape Digital signature Make money fast Downing Street memo Money George W.
