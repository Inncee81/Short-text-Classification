payday loans okay i really need about because i had my grocery money but lost it and i have a child to feed so it seems the only choice i have is a payday loan so are there any out there that are legit i found one that said if i borrowed i would only have to pay back does that sound right it was from www mypaydayloan com i have heard a lot of bad things about these places but i really need the money so where could i go to get one for the record to everyone who asked no i don't gamble i lost my wallet payday loans are legit and great if it is a fast loan and you pay it back on your very next paycheck the interest rates on these loan are beyond high extremely high the thing with these it that most folks don't pay it off on their next paycheck but ask for extensions which they have to pay for plus the original interest so at the end on a loan you are paying double or sometimes triple what you borrowed if you can pay it back immediately then if you need it i understand feeding your kids i have two but if you know you won't be able to pay it back on your next check i say borrower a few bucks from a friend or family member and pay them the interest of just be careful with them Payday loan Predatory lending Usury Student loan Hyperinflation Insurance Mortgage Professional wrestling slang 1919 World Series Deflation (economics) Credit card Tuition Lender of last resort Money creation Gambling Poker jargon Advance fee fraud Microcredit Money supply Short selling Interest rate Government debt Money Savings and loan association Economy of the United States Charles Ponzi Bank fraud Bank Satchel Paige Islamic banking Finance Schabir Shaik Trial Interest Inflation Education in the United States Islamic economics Microeconomics Annuity Social Security (United States) Tertiary education fees in Australia Credit union Savings and Loan crisis Pitaten Yield curve Bond Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Mississippi John Hurt 2004 Democratic National Convention Reaganomics Financial markets Stock Babylonian law Universal Studios Debt consolidation Prolog Craps Repurchase agreement Mortgage-backed security Blackjack Fiat money FairTax Security (finance) Central bank Deficit spending Violin Subsidy Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Bulk vending West Bromwich Albion F.C.
