credit counseling if you are going through credit counseling services can the credit card company still sue you what is weird is i called the credit card company and went with one of the companies that they recommended to me and today i get a call saying that they do not have to work with the credit counseling service and still have the option to sue us why would they do that when you are paying them as of now we are not even late on this credit card they raised our rate to because my debt to income ratio changed i bought a house and it almost tripled the payment on the credit card i cut up the credit card months ago we were never late to them just for some reason after we owned our house almost a year the credit card company decided they needed to look at our credit report saw that our debt to income ratio had changed and felt they needed to raise the interest rate they said it is because of a universal default clause that is in their fine print when we signed up for the cards almost years ago i called and asked if they work with this credit counseling service and they assured me that they did and there would be no problems you can consult with a debt consolidation agency but all are not good try to get some who are bbb online registered organisations and are member of us chamber of commerce and then apply online and get their help they will help you to fix your credit and also relief you from the debt to know more you can visit http www debtconsolidationmanagement blogspot com and http www creditcardbiz blogspot com Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Annuity Credit score Bond Phishing Student loan Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Mortgage Credit history Electronic commerce Interest Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money Schabir Shaik Trial Citigroup FairTax Security (finance) High-yield debt Debt consolidation Plame affair Personal finance Economy of the United States Life insurance Gold standard GSM services Deflation (economics) U.S. public debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Finance Bank Bretton Woods system British national identity card Downing Street memo 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Credit default swap Euro Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Primerica Financial Services Temasek Holdings Public transport Mortgage-backed security Paul Martin Futures contract America Online Karl Rove Islamic banking Mergers and acquisitions Hyperinflation Internet fraud Derivative (finance) Data retention Estoppel 401(k) Social Security (United States) United States Postal Service Corporate finance Microeconomics Standard & Poor's Divorce Unemployment benefit Barrister Debt levels and flows Intellectual property Surveillance Social Security debate (United States) Oakland Athletics Credit card fraud Inflation Bank fraud Fractional-reserve banking Donald Trump Taxation in the United States Dividend Economy of Russia Public domain Financial services Apple Computer Dot-com Unemployment Credit repair Arbitrage Economy of Pakistan Neopets Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Topps Spyware Tom DeLay Municipal bond Micropayment Cost of capital Capital accumulation
