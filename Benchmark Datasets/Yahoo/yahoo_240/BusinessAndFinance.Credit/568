chexsystems and collection agency a bank i had years ago failed to close my account they had a balance of zero for three days then charged me the monthly service charge then put in because the fee overdrew my account even though i didn't have that feature on my account needless to say after in fees and six months after i closed the account they finally closed it i have disputed this many times and gave up they reported me to chexsystems so i have not been able to have a checking account for the past three years and now they have sent the amount due to a collection agency which added to the bill thanks alot what can i do about not being able to have a checking account does my name say on chexsystems for seven years like their collection will stay on my credit report i want to buy a home in two years i just found out it went to collections today if disputing with the bank and the collection agency fails contact the bank's regulator you'll need the name of the bank which will tell what kind of charter it has then you can contact someone like the attorney general's office or the federal reserve bank they have website links and you can find out who to contact from them write a letter and hopefully you kept statements and or other documentation hard lesson to learn but keep statements for this kind of reason and never just pitch them without looking at them fighting this will take a little time but your other choice is to just pay it if you're buying a home you'll be probably be required to pay it if it's not resolved by then you're probably in the clear with opening a checking account after years but your privileges may be limited Mortgage Credit card Plame affair Money supply Bank Advance fee fraud Financial audit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Octopus card Poker jargon Corporation United States Postal Service Internet fraud FairTax Surveillance Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Debit card Child support Article One of the United States Constitution Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Bond Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Mensal__o scandal Student loan Primerica Financial Services Deflation (economics) Credit repair National Kidney Foundation Singapore United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Short selling Betting (poker) Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Probation officer GNU General Public License Economy of Russia Contract Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Taxation in the United States The Amazing Race Bretton Woods system Killian documents Fiat money Cable television Cheque Credit union Copyleft Money Life insurance Identity theft Mergers and acquisitions Health insurance Euro Appeal Eliot Spitzer Personal finance Karl Rove Joseph C.
