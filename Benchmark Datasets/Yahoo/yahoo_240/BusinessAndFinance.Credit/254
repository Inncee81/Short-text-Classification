can a credit card company or debt company take u to court i am struggling with sum debt at the mo i was fine paying it all off before i was sighned off work with depression and whilst some creditors have been ok a couple are sending me letters saying they will take me to court can they i have offered them a fixed monthly fee til im back at work and its silly that the debts are less then and they are threatning me when i have one creditir who i owe a few thousand too who are more then happy to wait the stress of this is just making my depression worse and i dont want to feel suicidal again like i did when i was at my worst please help oh another thing i get a month once is split between my creditors i have too live on a week i dont understand where they think i can get the money from yes unfortunately they can take you to court however this is not a criminal court and you don't even have to turn up if you don't want to basically you end up with a ccj and the judge orders you to pay it ruins your credit rating you can put in a defence though with your incoming and outgoing money and the judge will only order you to pay what you can afford can be as small as a week so sometimes although it ruins your credit it can be a blessing as you are ordered to pay less than what the credit card company would want you to pay it is better to try and make an arrangement with the company yourself though and save your credit rating its not really worth companies taking you to court for small amounts of money but they threaten it to try and get you to pay i m sure that you can come to a private repayment arrangement at a monthly fee you can afford if you set this up though its vital that you stick to it go to the cab and they should be able to help you to organise your finances and sort out arrangements with your lenders Debt Mortgage Credit card Bond Bank Student loan Interest Corporation Government debt Money Annuity Great Depression Insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Bretton Woods system Divorce Monetary policy Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Advance fee fraud Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Estoppel Enron Corporation Short selling Debt levels and flows Bankruptcy Social Security (United States) Developing countries' debt Internet fraud Security (finance) Keynesian economics Personal finance Babylonian law Poker jargon Hyperinflation U.S. public debt Capital accumulation Gross domestic product Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Donald Trump Unemployment GSM services Debt bondage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore EastEnders Gold standard History of the United States (1918-1945) Credit score Finance Arbitrage United States Postal Service Credit repair Bank fraud Government National Mortgage Association Islamic banking Unemployment benefit Derivative (finance) Stock History of post-Soviet Russia Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Debt consolidation Microeconomics Citigroup Life insurance FairTax Economy of the United States Financial services Primerica Financial Services Legal tender Microcredit Gold as an investment Surveillance Usury Tom DeLay 3dfx Charles Ponzi Medical malpractice Currency Blackjack United Kingdom corporation tax Child support Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Tennessee State Constitution Capitalism Confidence trick Economy of Argentina 401(k) Annual percentage rate Financial markets SCO-Linux controversies James Hanratty Avenue Q
