can someone help me with most common objections in telesales i want to know questions and answers of the most common sales objections you can come across for example i hav to speak to my partner first how do handle that i'm going to use the universal widgets example when discussing business if unfamiliar widgets are a fictitious product that you are trying to sell to begin the most important thing to remember in telephone sales is that it is a numbers game even if you never knew how to overcome an objection and you simply just asked people if they would like to buy midgets some people would still say yes on the flip side no matter how good you are at selling widgets some people will always say no so just make lots of calls and you'll make lots of widget sales i have to speak to my partner first a the client is not convinced that what you are offering is worth the buy needs more information but would prefer to just politely end the call with a sorry excuse b mr client this is a pretty big decision so i understand you need to discuss this with your spouse just out of curiosity what do you think they'll like or dislike about my widgets then you can have a discussion with them about what their spouse likes or dislikes it keeps them on the phone and gives you more opportunity to sell i'm happy with the widgets that i have right now a you haven't stimulated your customer enough to want to listen or pay attention b fantastic i'm glad that you are a loyal client of widget central before i get off the phone with you what would be the one thing you could change about your current widget you'll either get a nice response that will allow you to continue your conversation or you'll get nothing continue with open ended questions that begin with why or what until one of them opens them up to talk to you the worst that will happen is they hang up and you move on i'm not interested right now but i'd like to get your number in case i'm interested later a they aren't interested at all but you're a nice guy and they'd like you to think they care b i appreciate the consideration what's the main reason you'd be motivated to buy in the future vs today you could go on for hours here but main things to do in sales on the telephone are simple make the calls and ask for the sale take rejections before moving on ask open ended questions to gather information ask for the sales it generally takes phone calls to get sales in most industries Microeconomics Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Social rule Plame affair Supply and demand Internet fraud Time Out of Mind Telephone exchange Humphrey Bogart Consensus decision-making Capital accumulation Password Value added tax Customer relationship management Ashton-Tate John Kerr Ethics Contract Annuity Shaggy dog story Monetary policy Xlib English grammar Java programming language Intellectual property Goodness and value theory Little Britain MMORPG Stardock Current teachings of Prem Rawat X Window System Konfabulator Wal-Mart Voice over IP Infantilism Whois $ale of the Century UK telephone numbering plan Asperger syndrome Surplus value New Coke Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rich Mullins Phone sex Same-sex marriage in Canada Polyamory Law of value Wheel of Fortune Sexual orientation Philosophy of business Philosophical skepticism Call centre Big Brother (USA TV series) Milton H.
