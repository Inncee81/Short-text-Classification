minimum credit limit so i've read that some credit cards have a minimum credit limit that they issue when you are approved generally i think it is the cards for bad credit that specify these minimum limits would anyone happen to know what the minimum credit limit given by chase is hmm i guess i need to rephrase has anyone been approved for a chase card recently how much is the credit limit they gave you how would you rate your credit standing based on your credit score obviously i know that everyone doesn't have the same credit line what i'm asking is if chase has a minimum credit line that they grant to people who open accounts the way that the sub prime cards say that their opening credit line is at least and since i expect that this figure is probably unknown in the case of chase cards i will settle for some sort of idea as to what kind of opening credit line they grant which is why aside from asking if anyone has opened an account recently i am also asking for the credit profile of the person to see if there are similarities in our situation while i know i can't draw any definite conclusions from this data i'm satisfied with having some idea any idea thanks i have a chase card and my limit is how does that help you but i think i understand your question so i'll take a stab at it bad credit credit cards tend to have lower limits usually starting at around some are orchard bank mastercard centenial mastercard first premier and tribute to name just a few they tend to start with a limit they charge you up fromt fees and activation fees and when you get the card you usually have an available balance of around half what you started with if you are lucky they will charge you in the neighborhood of year in fees and the rate is to the moon now chase i don't believe markets to that demographic i'm not trying to sound like a snob btw but i could be wrong i'm guessing that a chase card would start at around for the lower limit again i don't have any independant knowledge of this but i have looked at a ton of credit reports and don't recall seeing a lower limit on a chase card Credit card Student loan Minimum wage Debit card Poker jargon Bank fraud Octopus card Theory of conduct MasterCard Password United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Supreme Court of the United States GED Citigroup Game show Whose Line Is It Anyway?
