is it possible to find out if someone has been repossessed by their mortgage lender just trying to find out if they are telling the truth about money owed they are claiming repossession so can't pay as they can't pay the mortgage first let me say that mortgage companies do not repossess houses they foreclose on them foreclosure records are public and can be obtained at the court house which many counties let you access via your computer if they don't let you access from your computer you will have to go down to the court house and search public records under their name and address if they aren't paying their mortgage and have been foreclosed upon it won't be long before their are evicted by the lender or whomever purchased the property at the foreclosure sale they are not telling you the truth and you better go ahead and sue them for the money in magistrate court or state superior court once you get a judgment you can garnish their employer and begin to get your money back get started as their next step is probably bankruptcy and once that is started you won't ever get your money back Mortgage Great Depression Predatory lending Allodial title Concurrent estate Bond Insurance Taxation in the United States Lehigh and New England Railroad E-mail spam Real estate broker Debt Real estate Privatization Financial markets Donald Trump Contract Bankruptcy in the United States Student loan Corporation United States district court Article One of the United States Constitution Debt consolidation ACORN Appeal Finance Monopoly (game) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Federal National Mortgage Association Bank Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Construction Bankruptcy Divorce Usury Child support Steve Jobs Sheriff Deflation (economics) Life insurance Interest Temasek Holdings Fixtures Schabir Shaik Trial 401(k) FairTax Annual percentage rate Government debt Magistrate Public domain Short selling Lawyer Credit card Collyer brothers Personal finance Security (finance) Wardenclyffe Tower Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Joseph Smith, Jr. Irish Property Bubble Microsoft Islamic banking Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Judiciary of Hong Kong Intellectual property Enron Corporation Citigroup Dave Ramsey Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Conveyancing Jean Schmidt Trust (Law) USA Islamic economics Common criticisms of Microsoft Wang Laboratories Economy of the United States Charles Ponzi Toronto-Dominion Bank Asbestos Domain Name System Estoppel Copyright Wal-Mart U.S. public debt British residential property market Coingate Grover Cleveland The Source (magazine) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Small claims court Patent Ross County, Ohio Government of Maryland Courts of England and Wales
