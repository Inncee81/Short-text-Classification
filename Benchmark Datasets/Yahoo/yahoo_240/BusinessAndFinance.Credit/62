can i still claim back my bank charges even though a test case is going before the crwon court i have already served legasl notice abbey national for about weeks ago then last week a group of national banks have joined together and asked permission to test a case in the high court which could take years meanwhile trading standards have announced that banks do not have to support anyone claiming fees before the test case can i still proceed using the unfair terms in the cosumer contract regulations act on my own through the county court no one seems to know also can i still proceed against credit card companies it is a goos thing that you have already srved your notice as even if you have to wait a year you still will be able to clain for everything you have asked for even if due to the delay you go over the year mark i think that even the county courts are starting to put these on hold too until the outcome of the test case but if it is already going through then you never know you should get a response from either the courts or the bank either way remember this is may be a delay but at the moment it is not a rejection so providing the test case goes your way then you will still get what you are trying to claim also see http www moneysavingexpert com SCO-Linux controversies Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Article One of the United States Constitution Public domain Insurance Bank Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 SCO v.
