so does anyone else understand this i'm going to be starting college in the fall my parents and i aren't in a good place right now because of some decisions that i made that they don't agree with i need a little bit more money for school but i've maxed out on most of the funds that are available to me i've tried to apply for a loan through many different places but has denied me because of my lack of credit history i can't find anyone that is willing to co sign either now i'm a good girl i don't smoke i don't drink i don't do drugs point being that i don't waste my money i'm responsible and i know how to budget the only reason that i haven't gotten a credit card is because i've always been taught that no credit is better than having bad credit how are you supposed to get anywhere in life when no one will throw you a bone all i need is about so that i can attend college buy a reliable vehicle and insurance i don't have a car to get to work so how am i supposed to keep a job help i mean i'm a smart girl top ten of my class i need to go to college but i just don't see how if i can't get my classes paid for or if i don't have reliable transportation to and from work and school well bull rooster aardvark how do you suggest that i get to school i live half an hour away that's my sacrifice not living on campus so i can save money not exactly a place where they have busses running either people my problem is getting to campus so thanks to everyone who suggested that i get a job on campus is an exorbinant amount of money to lend and is typically only loaned on secured collateral such as auto loans or mortgages your best bet is to obtain a student loan you are correct in stating that you will need a co signer however this will likely be referred to as a guarantor in some cases you may not need one and that is for smaller amounts just enough to get you through school not enough to buy a car also you need to complete your fafsa form this will allow the government to make a determination on your financial need based on your lack of income and on the income of your parents you'd be surprised you may qualify for grants which is free money that doesn't need to be repaid additionally you may be made aware of some scholarships you could potentially qualify for i was fortunate enough to receive a grant throughout college and never had to take any loans or pay out of pocket for my education i never expected that but then filling out the fafsa allowed the government to find those oppotunities for me if you're still interested in building your credit history you should begin by obtaining a low limit credit card my first card was through capital one who caters to college students also i would recommend american express blue these are all unsecured cards which means you will not have to pay a fee to open them or pay fees to maintain them as those with bad credit not no credit will have to do once you've established some time on this card and maybe another if you choose to open more than one you may want to look into obtaining a loan that would qualify as an installment account these are all debts that are contractual and not revolving meaning you are obligated to pay a certain note each month things like this are car loans lines of credit mortgages and personal loans having installment credit is one of the major things lenders consider when decisioning whether or not to grant you a loan some good first time buying companies to consider with your first auto loan are triad financial roadloans drive financial and americredit all cater to subprime clients and first time buyers i hope this information helps you Education in the United States Debt Bank Life insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Capitalism Money
