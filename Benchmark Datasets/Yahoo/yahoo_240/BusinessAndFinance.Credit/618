does lowering your credit limit lower your credit score i already have several credit cards i want to lower the limit on one which i have used for several years from to maybe or also i want to cancel a credit card limit which i have never used will doing either of these things lower my credit score i am planning on doing this because i want to get a different credit card for home improvements lower interest and i want to make sure that i wont be denied because i have to much credit for how much i make obviously if my credit score goes down that wont bode well for this endeavor either thanks in advance and please only answer if you know what you are talking about i only have about on the credit card i also have a credit card but i can't cancel that one even though i haven't used it because it is a dental credit card my total available limit right now is around i certainly wont use it all but we are fixing up our kitchen and want to get a specific credit card with no interest for a year i don't make much money but i wont be the only one paying this off i just have the highest credit score i believe its lowering your credit limit and or closing a card will have a negative impact on your scores the thinner your credit file the more it will hurt since it sounds like you only have cards that would be considered a very thin file plus when a credit limit is lowered the other creditors will notice there could be a strong possibilty that the other creditors will follow suit and lower the credit limits on those cards also i know many people who have credit limits that exceed their annual income by or times and some have more in general they are not penalized by having that much credit since they take care of their accounts you didn't mention if the card you are thinking about is a store card or a major card if you are planning on getting a store card from home depot or lowes go in person to apply i'm not sure about lowes and unlike many creditors i know hd does have a say in the approvals when someone applys in store if hd is aware that you will be spending money in their store that may sway them to make sure you are approved Credit card Estoppel Student loan Credit score Sears Holdings Corporation Insurance Taxation in the United States Hearts (game) Corporation Tom DeLay Wal-Mart 401(k) Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Surveillance Flat tax Poker jargon Stud poker Mortgage Mutual fund Keynesian economics Bond Public transport Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Windows Vista Interest Debt Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Legal tender Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ELO rating system Annuity Contract bridge Octopus card Microeconomics Personal finance Trademark Life insurance Year 2000 problem Mao (game) Motion picture rating system Social Security (United States) Digital photography Publicly funded medicine Social rule Hard disk Article One of the United States Constitution Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Fixed-wing aircraft Ocean's Twelve Identity theft Betting (poker) Plame affair Canasta Blackjack British national identity card Social Credit Playing card History of Microsoft Windows Password Copyleft RFID Jeopardy!
