parakeet finger training help my three parakeets are like attatched like glue and never let me take them out of the room seperartly i can hold each one there since i keep my cage top of because i don't want to make them feel trapped i play music for them when i'm gone and sometime they let me hold them i have to take my birds out of the room with force if i don't want to play with one in there and once there out they keep chirping to each other plus i could give them each kisses while in the room any suggestions real ones please i'm not quit understanding what your asking but i'm going to assume your talking about your budgies are not bonding with you just each other this will happen when they're all in the same cage or if you only have one and you put a mirror in the cage they'll bond with the other bird and not you if this is the problem you're having you'll need to put your budgies in separate cages and work with each one separately in a quiet room away from distractions do this for about mins to minutes a few times a day after about the first week i'd up the alone time to mins and before long you'll be able to give each budgie the technical name for a parakeet their alone time while they're all in the same room they most likely will still chirp to one another but this is what birds do it's not something you can stop them from doing it is their instinct good luck John Cage Professional wrestling match types Hamster Monk Parakeet Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jason Reso Milton H.
