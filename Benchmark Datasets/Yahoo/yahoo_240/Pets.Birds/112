please help parakeet problem okay i have a parakeet and he used to fly be active and chatter alot with the others now just yesterday i noticed that when he flew to the top of the curtain he didn't land like he used to he would land halfway then climb up today i was trying to help him fly but he would fly but then he would go down and couldn't get back up on his cage and his wings are long does anybody know what might be wrong please help i'm sorry if i don't really make sense i tried my best but with the worries that something my be wrong really stresses me out please help me i don't want to loose my buddy if you can help please e mail me at j tweetyeyes yahoo com to answer the few questions ya'll might have i let him and the other ones fly in my room all day until its their bedtime wich is and i leave their cage open so they can eat drink and play they have enough room to fly around and they seem to enjoy it his wings were clipped but he was still able to fly good when i am there he doesn't hit anything but i still spend time with them and play with them so i am thinking that either like ya'll said he could have hurted himself or maybe its cuz he's too chunky and the weight is weighing him down what do ya'll think well if his wings are clipped they weren't clipped properly if he's good at flying with clipped wings he needs them shorter also if his feathers are starting to grow a little he may be lopsided which will cause him to fly funny as much as you like them flying around it really isn't safe even when the bird is good at flying there are thousands of dangers in a house that you may not realize i've always kept my birds well clipped except for one cockatoo but that was a different story because even though they wont fly away and don't hit things while flying it's still unsafe if he's chubby he needs a new diet is he on a seed based diet if he is switch him to a pellet kaytee exact rainbow pellets are my favorite diet or at least the kaytee fiesta food because it has seeds fruit nuts veggies and pellets in it when a bird gets fat especially when it can fly something is very wrong with the diet if you need more help figuring out what to do with his food please feel free to email me at cockatoorescuetrainer gmail com or through my website http www cockatootrainer com contact Piccolo Junior Saga Guinea pig Chicken Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Hamster Parrot Domestic rabbit Gmail The Ashlee Simpson Show Vegetarianism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Social rule Homer Simpson Matt Hardy Equine conformation Seabird Fecal incontinence GunZ The Duel Dieting Gliding 2000 Australian Grand Prix Heinkel He 100 Heinkel He 112 Friends Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Ferret Veganism Humphrey Bogart Anorexia nervosa Procrastination Glossary of climbing terms RuneScape quests I Want to Hold Your Hand Bubble Bobble Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Kodocha Big Brother (USA TV series) Time Out of Mind Opera (web browser) Acorn Carpenters Little Britain Cuisine of Malaysia Philosophical skepticism Trapping Bird Ron and Fez AFI 100 Years series The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Beatles The Shining (film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Bird migration Falconry Eddie Guerrero Google Shotgun Bon Jovi Good Morning, Vietnam One Tree Hill (TV series) Tenshinhan Raw food diet Ron Weasley Russian joke Danger Hiptop Singlish Rain Man Volleyball EastEnders Jackass: The Movie Spidey Super Stories Hip hop rivalries Poker jargon Transactional analysis Blood (computer game) W.I.T.C.H.
