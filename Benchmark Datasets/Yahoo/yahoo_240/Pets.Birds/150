what is best food for parakeet do they like seeds only or can they eat bread and stuff we eat once in awhile well bird food isn't formulated as regularly as dog and cat food right now the best bird food on the market are the bird pellets they have a uniform look and have all the vitamins and mineral a bird needs though they've noted some birds still have a vitamin a deficiency while on them so they can be fed things like potatoes sweet potatoes etc the downside of these pellets is that they aren't visually appealing to most birds and they don't want to eat them birds on normal birdseed eat favorites so they don't always get all the vitamins and minerals that way either mixing pellets and seeds doesn't always work because most birds will just pick out their favorites some birds will empty the whole food container just to get to that favorite seed on the bottom as for human food you have to be careful some birds will decide they like that better than their food and only eat that once they've been spoiled generally it's best to just let them stick to their own food unless they have a vitamin or mineral deficiency also remember to keep a gnawing stone bone in the cage for a parakeet the white things that attatch to the side of the cage those provide minerals as well as keeping the bird's beak trim Hamster Chicken Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Potato Vitamin C Food Vitamin Nutrition Egg (food) Bread Veganism Genetically modified food Bird Acorn Retinol Cat Fancy rat Vitamin D Canary Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vitamin K Fecal incontinence Tocopherol RuneScape quests Vegetarian nutrition Vegetarianism Potato chips Anorexia nervosa Milk Tooth enamel German cuisine Tooth Pet skunk Coeliac disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coprophagia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Garfield Folic acid Sweet potato Soul food Omega-3 fatty acid Domesticated turkey Hot dog Soybean Blood (computer game) Chile pepper Livestock Tomato Shaggy dog story Korean cuisine Insulin 613 mitzvot Cyanocobalamin Niacin Cuisine of Denmark Dietary fiber Kakapo Rose Zinc Date Palm Carnivore Anemia Fruitarianism Malnutrition Ramen Foie gras Golden rice Tlingit Organic food Jewish cuisine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pine Breakfast Dog food Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Pizza Parrot Irish cuisine Ferret Antioxidant Theory of conduct Japanese cuisine Maize RuneScape economy Human skin color Dodo Capercaillie Raw food diet Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Stomach cancer Shampoo Shotgun John Cage Food preservation
