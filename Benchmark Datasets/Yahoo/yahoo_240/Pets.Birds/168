watery bird poop i have a conure parrot that has been consistently having watery poops for about two weeks he has been to the vet who did a full panel on his fecal matter nothing was found out of the ordinary everywhere i read i see this is bad i have only had him for two months and he was sick when i got him with some bacterial infection his poop was watery then it wasn't watery again until a few weeks ago any ideas what makes a dropping droppings actually consist of three recognizable parts feces clear urine and a white urine called urates you'll want to get a good idea of what each part looks like normally for your bird and monitor all three daily so you can report any serious changes to your vet generally the feces part of the dropping should be green or brown it should be solid and coiled like a snake segmented or in pieces the urine portion of the stool should be clear and watery urates should be an opaque white beige crystalline material sometimes the urine and urates are mixed creating a cloudy looking material but usually they are separate not all changes in droppings indicate a health problem for instance different types of food can change the color of your bird's poop birds that favor pellets of a certain color may release feces that have taken on the same tinge the feces of birds who eat ordinary pellets are usually rust colored strawberries may introduce a slight reddish color and blueberries cherries and cranberries can turn fecal matter black watery foods can make your bird's droppings appear looser than usual sometimes droppings may even be all liquid however as long as any fecal matter remains solid watery droppings are not diarrhea they are perfectly normal instances of polyuria an increase in urine in fact long time bird owners who feed a healthy varied diet including not only pellets but moist foods such as fresh vegetables fruits beans pastas and cooked grains know that extra wet droppings are the norm they mean the bird is well hydrated you can expect to see an increase in urine also if your bird receives a scare or experiences stress such as during a veterinary exam for more information go to http www parrotchronicles com septoct droppings htm Guinea pig Feces Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Coprophagia Fancy rat Prostate cancer Water Urinary incontinence Cat Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Gout Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tofu Breastfeeding Chocolate Dog Food Folic acid Foodborne illness Pet skunk Glass Color Dairy Diseases of the honeybee Schistosomiasis Bulk vending Phase (matter) Plastic Iron Vegetarianism Egg (food) Food preservation Shotgun Crohn's disease Dietary fiber Capercaillie Flowering plant Common bean Atkins Nutritional Approach Opportunity rover Healthy eating Casting Tooth enamel Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Renewable energy Liquid crystal Adjustable gastric band Raw food diet HIV test Insulin Escherichia coli Alcohol fuel Cantonese cuisine Mealy Parrot Ferret Urine Colorectal cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Bread Constipation Wood Organic food Tomato Rotavirus Solar cell Fruit Cocaine Rice Domesticated turkey Vacuum Wood carving Pysanka Breakfast Pneumonia Species Maize Coffee Kakapo Coeliac disease Anemia House Mouse Thermoregulation Watermelon Irritable bowel syndrome Vinegar
