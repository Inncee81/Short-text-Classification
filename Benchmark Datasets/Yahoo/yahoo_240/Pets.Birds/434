my birds won't eat pellet food why i have given my cockatiels seeds for the longest time someone told me that seeds were not as good for them as a pellet diet so i switched none of the birds will eat the pellets most of the pellets would wind up on the cage floor i could see no signs that the birds were eating them so went back to seed which now they are happily eating again should i stick with seed or try pellets again i don't want them to starve but i want them all to have a healthy diet also what should i do your cockatiels are used to the seed diet unfortunately seed diets are not sufficient for them some birds simply do not like pellets but there are some things that may improve their diets first make sure the pellets are small cockatiels will not chew on large pellets you might try crushing the pellets and see if the birds will eat some of them then you can do that by hand or can use a pepper mill of coffee grinder add the pellets to your seeds some seeds are ok as long as the birds get the nutrition they need add fruits and veggies to their food this is a must if they don't like fresh ones they get dried fruits and veggies my cockatiels love their dried foods cut up the dried foods into pieces about one eighth inch across they won't try to eat large pieces of this either add some crushed egg shell to their food this gives them adds calcium you can try adding some cheerios or chex cereal too most birds like some form of cereal although it may take some experimenting to find out which ones get the vitamin enriched ones and try to avoid the sugared ones except for occasional special treats this will provide you with a great diet for your teils i have been feeding mine this diet for years and their colors are bright and beautiful while my birds are healthy and happy good luck Hamster Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Vegetarianism Veganism Fancy rat Rice Chicken Maize Egg (food) Bread Folic acid Nutrition Chocolate Date Palm Cheerios Tofu Ramen Vitamin C Healthy eating Cereal Dieting Omega-3 fatty acid Garfield Food Tooth Shotgun Jewish cuisine Sugar Peanut Hamburger Fecal incontinence Frugivore Apple Chile pepper Stomach cancer Tea Breakfast Tlingit Potato Dog food Milk Raw food diet Cuisine of Denmark Carbon dioxide Acorn Coconut crab Peruvian cuisine Goldfish Kosher foods Food guide pyramid Coffee Coeliac disease Mango Cyanocobalamin Chili con carne Vermicompost Vegetarian nutrition Idli Textile manufacturing Breastfeeding Breakfast cereal Atkins Nutritional Approach Fruitarianism German cuisine Flowering plant Fruit Soy milk Cuisine of Malaysia Agriculture Garlic Capercaillie Kashrut Hypoglycemia Miso Zinc One Piece minor characters Cuisine of the Philippines Nuclear fuel cycle Dietary fiber Albatross Pomegranate South Beach diet Roman eating and drinking Nut (fruit) Pysanka Cockatiel Foie gras Sugarcane Potassium Crohn's disease
