what can i do about coopers hawks eating my pigeons if a coyote eats a pet dog rangers kill it its the same it's illegal to kill or trap a cooper's hawk without a permit though that dosent seem to stop some people i own pigeons and have lost about half my flock to redtails the hawk even entered through the pigeon trapdoor and had to be let out once in fact we had three soaring above today heres what i do to protect my pigeons from hawks i let my pigeons out for about an hour each day and i try to stay outside with them the entire time i use that time to clean the coop and feeders i never let my pigeons fly at dusk or dawn because here that is when the hawks hunt the most during summer although the pigeons dont like it as much i let the out during the hottest time of day when the hawks are resting the coop is locked and secure including the trap when the pigeons are in and i don't use the aviary anymore it attracts hawks i have heard that hanging shiny objects such as cd's or mirrors shines bright into the hawks eyes and deters them i tried it but i'm not sure yet just how well it works also if you have crows or ravens around do whatever you can to attract them since crows ravens mob hawks and drive them away whenever i see a hawk even if it is just sitting on a branch i scare it away sometimes throw rocks sticks and yell to scare it away i've shot slingshots a few times i dont intend to hurt the hawk but a shot when it hits wood makes a loud cracking sound that scares the hawks away anyways good luck protecting your pigeons i know it's frustrating Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Blonde on Blonde Trapping Combine (Half-Life 2) The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story The Invisibles Falconry Poker jargon RuneScape quests Dove Common Raven Dead Like Me Tag Professional wrestling match types Ron Weasley The Amber Spyglass Teen Girl Squad Cat Battle of Mogadishu Gray Wolf 24 Hours of Le Mans New York Giants Tenshinhan Bird Piccolo Junior Saga Stephen Hawking Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Shen Gong Wu Fast bowling Ed, Edd n Eddy Hunting Sheryl Crow The Inside Punk ideology The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Glossary of climbing terms Viva La Bam Blood (computer game) Full Metal Panic?
