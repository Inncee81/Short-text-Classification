i have a parakeet and she used to tweet a lot when we moved she was ok then we got her a biger cage and she was happy for a while when she woke up she would tweet and i would whistle back to her now she barly tweets at all what should i do it sounds like it's just stress related like when you first brought her home and she'd just sit in the cage and be really quiet no move around allot etc until she got used to her new environment when you put her in the new bigger cage did you gradually move her into it or was it all at once alot of people suggest you gradually move them to the new cage for example put the new cage beside the one they're already in for a few days for the bird to get used to it then gradually take any toys you have in the old cage and put them in the new cage along with perches etc and then gradually move the bird in alot of birds get used to the cage they're in and that is their safe zone and they don't like change that happens suddenly give her a few weeks to get used to the new environment and i'm sure you'll have your same ole' bird back in no time John Cage Cessna T-37 Canary Tweety Bird Timbaland Dog training Hamster Mealy Parrot Missy Elliott Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Treehouse of Horror V Dog agility Salad Fingers Shaggy dog story Species The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Guinea pig Sleep Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks The Emancipation of Mimi War Eagle Aerial (dance move) Hansel und Gretel Johnny Cage Wind turbine WCBS-FM Music genre Onomatopoeia USS Arkansas (BB-33) The Ersatz Elevator RuneScape quests Ferret Norway national football team The Birds (film) Ocean's Twelve The Beatles discography Equine conformation EastEnders Dog Mixed martial arts StarrCade Chinchilla Professional wrestling match types London mayoral election, 2004 Chicken Time Out of Mind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Amber Spyglass Showtune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trapping Cliff Richard Slow Train Coming 4___33___ Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lung Garfield Daylight saving time Daredevil (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Origin of language Days of our Lives 2000 Australian Grand Prix Budgerigar Kasparov versus The World Real Love (song) Professional wrestling throws Electrophysiology Silence Superstition The Shining (film) Thermoregulation Marching band Roxette Horslips Christmas tree St. Louis Cardinals 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Leon White Passerine Kodocha Sting (musician) Rayden Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost The Ashlee Simpson Show World Class Championship Wrestling Ivory-billed Woodpecker Professional wrestling aerial techniques Kenneth Bigley Waking the Dragons Red-masked Parakeet Teen Girl Squad USS S-38 (SS-143) Aaliyah MMORPG Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Country music
