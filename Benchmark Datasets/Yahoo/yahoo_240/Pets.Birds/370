bird's nesting in the attic we noticed that there seem to be alot of little brown birds all over our house we think they are finches but we aren't sure we've heard sounds in our attic as if they were nesting are they distructive and how do you get rid of them they are really not going to cause any harm you should wait it out until all the babies leave the nest this should be very soon nesting season is coming to an end once all the birds have left remove the nests and block off the hole they are entering through so you do not have the same problem again next year if there are active nests with eggs or chicks in them it is actually illegal for you to disturb them as all native birds are protected by law Seabird Chicken Capercaillie House Sparrow Kakapo Bird Peregrine Falcon Emu Rhea (bird) Tree Sparrow Leatherback Sea Turtle Australian Magpie Gal__pagos Islands Great Horned Owl American Alligator Ivory-billed Woodpecker Nest box Laysan Finch Peafowl Platypus Birdfeeding Piccolo Junior Saga Spyware Hamster American Robin Egg (biology) Animal communication Rook (bird) Common Cuckoo Brolga Kea Malleefowl Egg (food) Saguaro Kiwi Hedgehog Bird migration Squirrel Life in the Freezer Common Raven Phoenix Albatross Swiftlet Nile crocodile Sea turtle Farne Islands Western Gull Canary Winter Wren Osprey Snowy Egret Towra Point Nature Reserve Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Island restoration Philippine Eagle Finch Ostrich Bristle-thighed Curlew Blue Tit The Inside Bobwhite Quail Sooty albatross Common Pheasant AFI 100 Years series Cock (chicken) Black-footed Albatross Laysan Albatross Red imported fire ant Cassin's Auklet Burrowing Owl Digger wasp Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Cantonese cuisine Paper wasp Charmed Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Christmas Shearwater Bird ringing Giant Cowbird Reptile Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge Cuckoo Cliff Swallow ROOK Carpenter bee Barred Owl Ancient Greek Least Bittern Black-faced Bunting Shaggy dog story Airport African Fish Eagle Bald Eagle Read-copy-update Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong European Kingfisher Blue-footed Booby Minor characters in Tintin Timon and Pumbaa
