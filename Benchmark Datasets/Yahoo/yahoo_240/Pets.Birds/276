questions about african grey parrots and if their a good pet for me i've been researching getting a parrot for awhile but i want to be sure i can cope with one african greys are my favourite but they seem high maintenence i will be at th form till pm in the day on average can they be left alone this long i would be sharing some of its care with other family members although i would be its main carer are they truly one person birds even if you get a young one and socialise it with different family members is biting a big problem don't mean gentle nipping are they very messy how often do they need to be cleaned out do they poop all the time are they easily potty trained to go in their cage any suggestions of other parrots types that are friendly and has anybody heard of or own a type called silver african greys not congos or timnehs i think you mean am to pm that's a long time but as long as you gvie her an hour or so after work school in the evening and maybe even let her be near the family when everyone eats dinner she'll feel included and that will make up for the day she spent in her cage lots of people do that and can keep their bird happy just provide lots fo different types of toys in a big roomy cage and she should be ok my dad's african grey was hand fed by my dad and even though he had picked my dad as his favorite bird slave he was very friendly with other people you just have to let them see other poeple and meet the family when they are young so they form positive bonds with lots of different people it's usually the amazons who are one persons birds more than the grey's a happy bird who is taught discipline at a young age will still bite but not often most of the time a bite is the human's fault anyways just leanr your bird's body language use discipline and set boundries that way you learn hwo to avoid being bitten as well as teaching the bird hwo to behave when they are young and play biting set boundries on where they can perch on you not on the head and probably not on the shoulder since they are a larger parrot and use discipline to help them learn how hard is too hard and what is ok bird poop every minutes on average some more some less they can be pretty messy though by pooping on the floor and furniture throwing food and water and also by chewing on wood furniture sometimes it's like wood furniture taste way better than any toy lol the cage needs to be cleaned at least once a week at least use dawn or even a vinegar solution both work well and are not harmful to your bird just rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse potty training is difficult i think for any bird you have to start by when the poop say look everybody name here just made a whatever you want to call it for the command do this for awhile to the point where the leanr to associate that word with pooping then you can start trying to tell them to do whatever you called it on command it's hard to achieve but once you do you can live a cleaner life lol http www centralpets com animals birds parrots prt html this is the only other grey i know of other then the congo and the timneh but i have never heard of a silver one there are lots of other birds that friendly i love conures there are the larger conures like mitreds and patagonians that are just a little smaller than a grey but are smart and beautiful i am a little biased because i am in love with a conure and everyone i have met has been a sweet heart grey's are pretty needy so if this is your first bird i'd recommend looking into the conures they give you a parrot experience for a less expensive price and they aren't as likely to pluck they learn to entertain themselves during the day better thana grey could but if you are willing to do your research and maybe even volunteer at a bird rescue to get some experience then i would say a grey would be a good choice they jsut take dedication Hamster Dog training Conure Fancy rat Guinea pig Mealy Parrot Social rule African Grey Parrot Pitaten Cat Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Dog Parrot Pet skunk RuneScape quests Textile manufacturing Drill bit Mattress Kodocha Strap-on dildo One Piece minor characters Egg (food) Upholstery Violin Ferret Milton H.
