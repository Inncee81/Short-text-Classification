gray pigeon eggs my pigeons layed four eggs on july one egg's shell was too weak and cracked i cleaned up the nest then three more eggs were layed the other three survived it takes days avg for eggs to hatch i should be expecting them any moment soon the last egg layed turned a light gray ish color i know this because the last egg was significantly bigger than the other two what does this mean is it still alive or not does it mean it will hatch already i live in laredo texas it's usually hot in here but this summer it has been raining practically all summer long luckily my pigeons seem to never leave the nest the climate is finally stabilizing and we have hot days now if you need more information please ask so okay first if you have four eggs in the nest and if those are the only pigeons you have you won't raise babies you have two hens mated together pigeons lay two eggs if you have four both hens laid second if you have other birds in the loft including males then the chances are that the other three eggs are fertile the gray look is often an indication that the embryo is developing the larger egg can be one of two things it might be a double yolked egg if it's really large if that's the case the chances of a successful hatch from it are on the order of in a thousand it could also be that one hen laid that one and the other laid the other two if you do hatch three squeakers be careful if the hens are able to rear them past the soft food stage then they will need extra feed to enable them to carry all three to weaning good luck Chicken Egg (food) Egg (biology) Bird Emu Leatherback Sea Turtle Platypus Kakapo Ostrich Shark Bee Queen bee In vitro fertilisation American lobster Krill Salmon Nile crocodile Coconut crab Sexual reproduction Peregrine Falcon Capercaillie Clownfish Beetle Gypsy moth Octopus Pregnancy Paper wasp Pysanka Dragons (Pern) Seabird American Alligator Rock Dove Head louse Aphid Tank Eggshell Sea-Monkey Ant Mallard Antarctic krill Ladybird Xenomorph Monogamy Pok__mon Abilities Burrhus Frederic Skinner The chicken or the egg Breastfeeding American Robin Twin Musk Duck Sexual dimorphism Kereru Pink Pigeon Frog Tarantula Infertility Ovum Sea star Life in the Freezer Sea turtle Combine (Half-Life 2) Polychrotidae Rhea (bird) Bird migration Cockroach Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Tuatara Zerg Africanized bee Condor Grasshopper Factory farming House Sparrow Flowering plant Minor Harry Potter Beasts Metroid (video game species) Tofu Emperor Penguin Bagworm moth Bobwhite Quail Homing pigeon Biological pest control Poker jargon Abortion debate Mantis shrimp Gharial Hamster Morphogenesis Omega-3 fatty acid Batoidea Tilapia Battle of Jutland Embryogenesis Housefly
