parakeet has droppings sticking to him fluffed up feathers he started acting different about days ago he started breathing harder and fluffing his feathers slightly then developed diarrea i was told to give him antibiotics which i did for days and he seemed to get better his diarrea stopped within a day and he started singing and playing again then overnight he's fluffled up huge and his rear is clumped with droppings i separated him from his mate tonight and they're not happy at all they're still next to each other just different cages she really loves him and she's fed him before i treated her too even though she seems to be fine i tried cleaning him up with a wet paper towel but it's really stuck in his tail feathers his vent isn't stopped up but he looks really swollen like a tumor almost is that possible he's been scratching his tail with his foot and has some droppings around his toenails too how can i clean him without hurting him is this contagious what should i do for him and his younger mate he died thanks for the advice though it may or may not be contagious as antibiotics indicate an infection and yes they can get tumors to clean him carefully use warm water and a soft cloth while it's technically safe to use small amounts of soap i'd personally avoid it since you don't know exactly what's wrong with him and his vent is a fairly delicate area especially if that's where the infection is located take him to the vet as soon as humanly possible the grade of antibiotics available to vets is much better than what you can buy from a pet store and if they can pinpoint what's wrong with him they can give him far more effective treatment good luck Guinea pig Fancy rat Hamster First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Chicken Hyperthermia Common cold Cancer Domestic rabbit Tattoo Otitis externa Upholstery Chinchilla Hiking Kakapo Antibiotic Dog Diarrhea Japanese toilet Tuberculosis Mattress Breastfeeding Escherichia coli O157:H7 Aerial (dance move) Diving Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Diving suit Canary Pneumonia Violin Wound Dialysis RuneScape quests Fire fighting Dry cleaning Manicure Carburetor Thermal power station Acne Chemotherapy Menstrual cup Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shrimp farm Virus Shaggy dog story Customs and etiquette of Japan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Conjunctivitis Dysentery Needle aspiration biopsy Group A streptococcal infection Fecal incontinence Tick Ferret Bird Electrophysiology Diseases of the honeybee Piccolo Junior Saga Textile manufacturing Rebreather Helicobacter pylori RuneScape economy Sento Garfield Prostate cancer Epilepsy Intravenous therapy Transmission (medicine) Eczema Fiddler on the Roof Hearing impairment Internal ballistics Hydrogen peroxide Ringworm Social rule Cellulitis Scabies Frogman The Death Gate Cycle Mina Mongoose Legionellosis Motorcycle M16 (rifle) Radiation therapy American Alligator Callus Hypoglycemia Tlingit
