i found a young baby bird that fell out of a tree can i feed it mashed up worms or do the worms have to be regurgitated you feed it nothing if the baby bird has most of its feathers it is a fledgling baby birds fledge leave the nest before they can fly they need a few days on the ground hopping around climbing low branches and exercising their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if this is a fledgling leave it where you found it and leave once the parents do not see you around their baby they will return and care for it if it does not yet have a lot of feathers it is a nestling if so try to put the baby bird back in the nest do not worry about touching the baby the mother will not reject it birds do not have an acute sense of smell she will not detect your scent on the baby if you can not get the baby bird back in the nest you need to contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species Kakapo Breastfeeding Albatross Chicken Seabird Falconry Bird Capercaillie Bird migration Cat Pet skunk Mealy Parrot Domestic rabbit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 613 mitzvot Dinosaur Ant Peafowl Condor Bat H5N1 Platypus Guinea pig Species Red Squirrel Terri Schiavo Elephant Acorn Ivory-billed Woodpecker Livestock Fancy rat Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Insulin Kashrut Comanche Foie gras Dog American Black Bear Hedgehog Vegetarianism Tetrapod Bird flight Gliding Trapping Insect Orca Domesticated turkey Airport Mosquito Saruman Genetically modified food Peanut Dodo Animal testing Extinction Vermicompost Tasmanian Devil Peregrine Falcon Archaeopteryx Rock Dove Mountain Gorilla Gray Wolf Nurse Insurance Koala Snake Heinkel He 112 Life in the Freezer Trademark Infantilism Agriculture Pterosaur Fox hunting Canary Imprinting (psychology) Bee Kagu Hummingbird Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Clark's Nutcracker House Sparrow Vomiting European Magpie Dog agility Weight training Childbirth Animal communication Baptism Professional wrestling attacks Shrimp farm Fish farming
