lyrics to you cant stop the beat does wnyone have em i meant does anyone have them uhh yeah i have them u want them tracy you cant stop an avalanche as it races down the hill you can try to stop the seasons girl but ya know you never will and you can try to stop my dancin' feet but i just cannot stand still 'cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round and my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound i was lost til i heard the drums then i found my way tracy link 'cause you can't stop the beat ever since this old world began a woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man and so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that i can today 'cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky you can wonder if you wanna but i never ask why and if you try to hold me down i'm gonna spit in your eye and say that you cant stop the beat penny appears onstage transformed into a hot teenage tigress tracy what do ya' have to say penny penny i am now a checkerboard chick you can't stop a river as it rushes to the sea you can try and stop the hands of time but ya know it just can't be and if they try to stop us seaweed i'll call the n double a p 'cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round seaweed 'round and 'round penny and my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound seaweed speed of sound penny i was lost till i heard the drums then i found my way penny seaweed 'cause you can't stop the beat penny seaweed tracy link ever since we first saw the light a man and woman liked to shake it on a saturday night and so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all my might today 'cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above they can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of but they cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay 'cause
