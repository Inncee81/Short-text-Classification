digital slr question i am debating weather to buy the canon d rebel xti or th nikon d advice ok full disclosure i own a d and it is the perfect camera for me the d is also a nice camera and as already suggested at least of the decision between these two fine products will come down to personal preference hold each camera and let your fingers fall on the controls are they in the right place use the menus is one better laid out than the other take a photo with each how does it feel the d does better in my book with having a true spot meter which i use the canon has a center weighted metering but not a true spot meter hopefully dr sam will see this question and if he answers his points will be well worth considering either way you are going to end up with a really nice camera Canon EOS Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Nikon Corporation View camera Advanced Photo System Nikon D70 Canon T90 Nikon FA Nikon FM Nikon FM2 Nikon FE Opportunity rover Nikon FE2 Single-lens reflex camera Point and shoot camera Canon Inc.
