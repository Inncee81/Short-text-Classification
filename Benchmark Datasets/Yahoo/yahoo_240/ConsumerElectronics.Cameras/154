how can i fix my camera i have a sony dsc w and i accidentally dropped it when i turn it on and off it makes a shuttering sound i can still look at my pictures and do everything else on it but it doesn't allow me to take pictures any help thanks you could try a local repair shop to see how much it is likely to cost to fix this may be something simple and worth doing otherwise you might have to get it to a sony repair centre and get them to assess the repair costs my personal experience when i had something similar happen was that the repair cost was similar to buying a new and newer model camera Photography Digital photography Sony 8 mm video format View camera Stereoscopy Movie projector Floppy disk Digital cinema High-definition television Camera Best Buy Digital cinematography Space Shuttle program Single-lens reflex camera Leica Camcorder Cinerama Walkman Pornography Road-rule enforcement camera Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Automatic number plate recognition Machinima Microeconomics Mouse (computing) Videocassette recorder Wind turbine DVD Canon T90 Columbia Pictures General Dynamics F-111 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Supply and demand Rangefinder camera Computer Bluetooth MMORPG Capital accumulation Radio controlled airplane Panavision Computer and video games Atari 8-bit family Surveillance Copy protection USB flash drive Photographic lens Persistence of vision Nuclear power PlayStation 2 GunZ The Duel Helicopter Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Traditional animation Shutter speed Independent film Panoramic photography Electronic journalism Nintendo Entertainment System Sport utility vehicle FireWire PowerBook Point and shoot camera Film Windows 2000 Telephone numbering plan Digital single-lens reflex cameras Counter-Strike Secure Digital card Heinkel He 112 Fixed-wing aircraft RuneScape weapons History of computer and video games Windows XP Videotape Auto insurance Parachuting The Apprentice 3 Oscilloscope Resident Evil: Apocalypse NTSC Public transport FoxTrot Airbus A380 Resident Evil 4 Digital camera back Game controller MP3 MAME Super Nintendo Entertainment System Digital camera PlayStation Portable Synthesizer Shutter angle Pinball Windows Vista Surplus value Wheel of Fortune Bob and George
