what's the best digital camera for getting rid of blur when i take low to moderate light pictures without flash i end up with a blurred photo even though i stand still hold my breath and snap the picture i like the natural look of light without flash but can't seem to get rid of this problem my digital camera is x optical zoom and x digital i don't blow my pictures up to poster size so i don't need a ton of megapixels hi it is quite possible you are suffering from a very low shutter speed such that no amount of stillness unless you use a tripod will work see if your camera has an iso setting a higher iso number usually one step below the max will increase light sensitivity and allow a faster shutter and still get an image which is not all black if you go to the max highest numeric value then the image is usually becoming grainy this number is similar to mm film asa also see suggestions on this website http www sportsflashtech com look at the setup and gym tab ultimately a camera without a good lens and without a very light sensitive sensor will not get a good photo for you in anything other than full sunlight your interests may send you to look at an slr camera a huge step up in image quality and the shutter response time is no longer so slow good luck rich Digital single-lens reflex cameras Film speed Single-lens reflex camera Photography Konica Minolta View camera Photographic film Movie projector Digital camera Exposure (photography) Stereoscopy Street photography Aperture Photographic lens F-number Camcorder Pixel Contax Camera Panoramic photography Cinematography Amateur astronomy Canon T90 Anamorphic widescreen Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Rangefinder camera Macro photography Nikon Corporation Automatic number plate recognition Time-lapse Nikon FM2 Shutter (photography) Nikon FE2 Floppy disk Charge-coupled device Depth of field Canon EOS Persistence of vision Enlarger Nikon FA Bluetooth Widescreen Advanced Photo System Eye Digital video Galileo spacecraft Motion capture Digital cinematography Bullet time Secure Digital card Road-rule enforcement camera Medium format Red-eye effect Canon EF lens mount IMAX DV 8 mm video format Gamma ray burst Oscilloscope Explosive material Motion picture terminology Digital Four Thirds System Panavision Stage lighting Pinhole camera Drill bit 3D computer graphics Technicolor Shutter angle Binoculars Sun Apollo moon landing hoax accusations USB flash drive Computer Canon EOS-300D Image file formats International Organization for Standardization Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Photograph Color blindness Aurora (astronomy) Sensor
