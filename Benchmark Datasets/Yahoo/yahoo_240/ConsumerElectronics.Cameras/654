is there a quality difference between the photo scan machines at wal mart kodak vs walgreens fuji i am scanning all my old family photos to make one good cd to save in case house burns downs and to give as gift to my grown up sons i have scanned with both machines at the two stores my concern is when i do the 'enhance' feature at walgreens when i look at it on my home computer screen there are some white dots as if it was from a magazine but the fuji walgreens prints looked great the wal mart scans looked great too i didn't look at the wal mart enhance pics from the cd i made on my computer as i couldn't even figure out their photo program at all i want the best quality scans in case someone makes prints someday and doesn't have the original pics i almost think i shouldn't even use the enhance but it does brighten them up nicely the prints are definitely better but projected large on a screen like for lcd they look like a copy of magazine pics thanks i think they are basically the sambut it is u preference i like kodak more trusted company thanfuji inthe scaningbusiness and picture business Digital photography Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum Photography Wal-Mart BASIC programming language TRS-80 Apple II family PIC microcontroller Bluetooth Commodore 64 Atari ST Stereoscopy Photographic film Konica Minolta Television Xerox PostScript Image scanner Windows XP Halting problem Cathode ray tube Windows 2000 Sinclair ZX81 Theory of conduct AmigaOS Technicolor Screenshot Liquid crystal display Computer printer System/36 System/34 Patricia Ford Windows Vista Nintendo Entertainment System GIF Fax Apple IIGS Walgreens Widescreen Oscilloscope Amstrad CPC Digital camera Computer Anamorphic widescreen Atari 2600 Game Boy Trusted computing Computer virus MAME Moir__ pattern Online music store Enterprise content management Screensaver GRASS programming language Handheld game console Photocopying Acorn Computers IMac Pixel Knight Rider Apple Macintosh Tungsten Handheld Trademark Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Copy protection Medical prescription Sears Holdings Corporation Computer forensics Digital image editing IBM PC compatible Primerica Financial Services Bank Organic light-emitting diode Brainfuck Sudoku View camera Magnetic resonance imaging Acorn Archimedes Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TI-89 series Photojournalism Warez PNG Gmail Compact disc Common Unix Printing System Dot matrix printer Charmed Outsourcing Firewall (networking) Super Mario Bros. 3 Eastman Kodak Forth programming language Traditional animation Portable Document Format Management information system Killian documents Geographic information system
