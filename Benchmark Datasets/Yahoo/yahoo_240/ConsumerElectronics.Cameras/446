canon powershot s is for year old birthday present i am currently looking at the canon powershot s is as a birthday present it is within my price range and seems to be exactly what i'm looking for there are only three issues i am dealing with before buying it they are high noise at high sensitivity settings no raw support and it is a discontinued model please let me know if there are any better cameras like this or if i should just go ahead and buy it thank you every camera has high noise at high sensitivity settings but think how often will you be using that setting even if you have a little noise it won't show on a x print these reviews say high noise because they enlarge it as much as they can do you even know what to do with the raw resolution only professionals use it canon will back up the camera even if it is out of production so what are you waiting for you are one very lucky birthday boy Digital photography Canon PowerShot G Digital camera Medium format Leica Digital single-lens reflex cameras Camcorder Camera Closed-circuit television Inkjet printer Photographic film Photography Surveillance Canon EOS-20D Canon T90 Digital cinematography MSX View camera IPod Digital cinema Pixel Television Mouse (computing) Widescreen Konica Minolta Analog-to-digital converter Motion capture Hash table Laserdisc 3dfx Binoculars Audiophile ATI Technologies Stereoscopy Canon EOS Shaggy dog story Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital video Atari 8-bit family Computer vision Full frame digital SLR Digital Nuclear medicine WWE RAW Night vision Explosive material Glen Jacobs Automatic number plate recognition Single-lens reflex camera Nikon Corporation Model (economics) Digital camera back Film stock FireWire Japan-United States relations Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Canon EOS-300D Apple Computer Adobe Photoshop Decibel Image scanner CPU cache Contax Windows XP 110 film ZX Spectrum Cinerama Economy of the United States Thermographic camera IBM PC compatible Canon Inc.
