aperature f number f stop question i have a high end sony digital p s camera that goes from f to f i'm getting ready to make the switch to digital slr but as i'm looking at lenses i'm concerned that most only go as small as f i use the smallest size f quite a bit such as taking shots of moving water with a slow shutter during the day light in fact there have been plenty of times when i really wished i could make the aperture even smaller is this something i'm going to have to give up if i go to slr i'll check out antoni's answer in the other section but sinec he copped a plea i'll answer you here in hopes of getting points haha when you see a zoom lens described as f that means that the largest aperture at the wide angle end of the lens if f and the largest aperture at the telephoto end of the lens if f this is because the aperture is a ratio of the lens diameter to the focal length it's not as simplistic as this but the same size opening for one focal length is going to produce a smaller f stop value larger number for a longer focal length if this was not a zoom lens a mm lens set to a mm diameter aperture would be at f a mm lens set to a mm diameter aperture would be at f zooms are not so straightforward as this because of the shifting lens elements and things i don't even understand i'll have to try to learn some more about this stuff when they are talking about zoom lenses they use the term effective diameter and i don't know enough about optics to explain that term as pjgoros says the minimum aperture is going to be more like f in fact i see that the nikon zoom super wide angle nikkor mm f g ed af s dx zoom nikkor autofocus lens is more accurately described as an f lens get it at the wider angle lens the ratio is from f to f at the tele end the ratio is from f to f Aperture Contax F-number Zoom lens Eyepiece Single-lens reflex camera Photography Canon EF lens mount Cinematography Konica Minolta Aberration in optical systems Pinhole camera Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Macro photography Reflecting telescope Movie projector Diffraction Digital camera back Shutter speed Nikon FM2 Rangefinder camera Binoculars Schneider Kreuznach Antenna (radio) Nikon FA Canon EOS Canon T90 Camera Lens (optics) Zeiss Point and shoot camera Stage lighting Terminal ballistics Angular resolution Stereoscopy Camcorder Synthetic aperture radar Nikon FE Floppy disk Radar Pentax Canon FD Optical telescope Nikon FE2 Motion picture terminology Nikon FM Film speed 35 mm film Panavision Parallax Confocal laser scanning microscopy Clementine mission Enlarger Wood Widescreen Fisheye lens Four Thirds System IMAX Eye DVD Laser Internal ballistics Lighting Olympus (company) Street photography Headlight Speed of light Magnification Optical fiber Cinerama Drill bit Shotgun Modem Amateur astronomy Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Aspect ratio (image) 70 mm film Exposure (photography) Autostereogram Television Astronomical seeing Shutter (photography) Schmidt camera Nikon D70 Bloodstain pattern analysis
