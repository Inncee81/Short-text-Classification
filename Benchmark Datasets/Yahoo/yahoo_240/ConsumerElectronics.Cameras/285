how do i turn on my flash so i just bought a sony cybershot dscw and it has different settings none of which the flash will turn on except for one and that mode is called twilight portrait and then you can't capture a still shot i know how to turn the flash on but it won't work i need help try using the p setting instead of the auto mode the click the flash button until the arrow pointing down is on the lcd this should make the flash go off no matter what twilight portrait uses a slower speed and will give you streaky looking photos if you don't hold the camera steady during the exposure Photography Canon T90 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital photography Mouse (computing) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Panoramic photography DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Walkman Camera Dance Dance Revolution Stereoscopy Konica Minolta USB flash drive Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Canon PowerShot G Floppy disk Leica PlayStation Portable Prank flash DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution The Legend of Zelda series Single-lens reflex camera Beatmania IIDX Sony Universal Serial Bus GunZ The Duel Oscilloscope Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Digital single-lens reflex cameras IPod Canon T70 Canon EOS Contax Screenshot Nintendo GameCube Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Pump It Up Camcorder Traffic light Tungsten Handheld Cinematography Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Memory Stick Danger Hiptop Secure Digital card Macromedia Flash Flash (comics) Nintendo DS Digital camera Grand Theft Auto (game) Sharp Zaurus Read-only memory Poker jargon Toyota Prius Game Boy Advance Day of Defeat Computer and video games Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Liquid crystal display Resident Evil 4 Hello world program Bubble Bobble Eggerland series SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Defender (game) Sega Dreamcast Henri Cartier-Bresson EXpanded MultiPlayer Point and shoot camera Resident Evil (video game) PowerPC The Legend of Zelda series enemies Welding Gradius GunBound Knight Rider Handheld game console Dynamic random access memory Counter-Strike Game Boy View camera Platform game Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Digital cinema Perfect Dark Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Photographic film Drag racing Billiards CompactFlash Diablo II Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Unreal Tournament 2004 Team Fortress Classic RuneScape skills Memory (computers) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
