what do you think of this canon combination i am brand new to the world of dslrs having been in the world of normal digital photography for a few years i have come into some money and thought i would finally splash out on a dslr but i want it to last the rest of my life i'm unlikely to be able to afford going to another one although i may increase my lens collection i photograph macro and wildlife eg deer birds here's the combination i came up with canon d body canon ef mm f usm canon ef mm f usm macro lens canon ef mm f hama tripod star ef digital have i made any enormous mistakes here anyone have experience with this kit i'd be really grateful for your help as this is unchartered territory for me and i want to get it right first time i'd like really sharp proffesional looking results thanks for both the answers so far the second one has been particularly helpful i have decided to go with the d the aforementioned macro lens and a canon ef s zoom lens mm is usm the lens you suggested looked amazing but a tad too expensive this is a wide angle but cheaper when faced with the same problem you have i bought a nikon d but that's not your question first of all probably no electronic device camera included will last the rest of your life but the canon d stands a much better chance of lasting than the d please consider that the crop factor aka lens factor lens multiplier etc with a canon dslr you are completely lacking anything in the wide angle end since you are familiar with mm focal lengths you might think that mm is the normal lens but it is not normal for a d or d is more like mm because the crop factor is x mm x mm your lenses as listed would equal the performance of mm f mm f macro mm f if you don't want any wide angle i have no problem with that but i don't want you to be surprised that is going to be a monster to control without image stabilization unless you always use the lens on a tripod you might consider getting a canon is lens the mm should be a good macro lens and it seems to be reviewed well the mm is an okay lens as long as you know that this is not going to be your normal lens but maybe you'd like the f better the f is a killer lens but costs over if you want a normal lens for your dslr look at the canon wide angle ef mm f autofocus lens for if you want a faster lens there is always the mm f l series but that's over canon lenses with the l in the name and red band around the barrel are their pro line of lenses some lens snobs say if you ain't gort an l lens you ain't got nuthin' or close to that is means image stabilization and this is a good thing for long lenses the canon ef s mm f is usm equiv april is a good walk around lens at a good price http www usa canon com consumer controller act modeldetailact fcategoryid modelid http www the digital picture com reviews canon ef s mm f is usm lens review aspx not quite as much of a wide angle the canon zoom wide angle telephoto ef mm f l is usm autofocus lens is a pretty good all around lens this review says if i had only one lens this would be the one http www the digital picture com reviews canon ef mm f l is usm lens review aspx if you got the as your main lens you would be very happy and you could supplement it with the canon zoom telephoto ef mm f is image stabilizer usm autofocus lens for and you'd be pretty well covered i'd much rather see you get the is lens at this focal length if you don't know about this ask another question and i'll send you my link neither one goes close than so you'd be lacking in the true macro range but the mm you mentioned is not crazy expensive since you are looking at the long haul here i'd even rather see you get one lens probably the and the d if you don't have the cash to buy more stuff now in the long run i think you will be happier i didn't count the tripod but your list totals about my d the lens totals i see b h has the canon eos d megapixel slr digital camera kit with canon mm f ef s is usm autofocus lens for it's not an l lens but it's a decent lens and it has a lot of range covered here are some popular canon lens review sites i like the first one quite a lot look at the
