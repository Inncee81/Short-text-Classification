transfer pictures movies from sony dsc h to zen vision w i just purchased a sony dsc h digital camera and a creative zen vision w video player i would like to download pictures video from the new camera to the video player can i do this directly or do i need to first download to my pc first of all i applaud you for getting something besides an ipod creative is a very good choice and that player seems really nice okay didn't the zen come with a manual it should say how to transfer them on there i would guess that you can do it with a usb cord i've read some players have a slot for certain memory cards so maybe it will work this way for you if not then going from camera to computer to player should almost certainly work either way get that manual and read for your answer IPod Creative Zen Digital camera Digital photography PlayStation Portable ITunes Walkman PlayStation 3 FireWire Digital rights management DVD Creative Nomad Copy protection Memory Stick Sony ITunes Music Store USB mass storage device class PlayStation 2 Memory card Commodore 64 Creative Technology Camcorder Floppy disk CompactFlash USB flash drive MiniDisc Apple Computer High-definition television Universal Serial Bus Sony Computer Entertainment Computer and video games Film Xbox 360 Apple Macintosh Bluetooth Photography Computer Nintendo DS Wheel of Fortune Television Apple Newton IMac Microdrive Nintendo Revolution IPod shuffle Independent film Game Boy Advance XD-Picture Card Modem Xbox Video game music Game controller Movie projector Laserdisc Warez Podcasting Flash memory Camera IPod nano Sound Blaster Compact disc Computer bus Tungsten Handheld Digital cinematography Movie camera IPod photo QuickTime Sega Saturn ZX Spectrum Closed-circuit television Game Boy Mouse (computing) Panavision History of computer and video games Slot machine Machinima Archos Stereoscopy Compact audio cassette Windows XP Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Vorbis Pornography DV 8 mm video format Verizon Wireless Nintendo Nintendo 64 Sega SmartMedia TiVo Cinematography MSX Handheld game console ILife EyeToy Atari 8-bit family
