help i think my camera has been lost in the post but is still under warranty what do i do it's a fujifilm e zoom i sent it to fujifilm to get fixed and i have not received any conformation they have it with them they don't say anything about lost or stolen cameras on their website so i don't really know if they will send me a new one or not they gave me i tracking number but didn't write it down and my email deleted it somehow i still have receipt of purchase but will it be any good the only way you will be covered is if you have posted it via recorded or registered post through the post office as they normally ask when you are posting the item what the value is if you have done this and you have your postage receipt then take it to the post office and tell them what has happened when you post items this way they are covered through the post office the only other way i can think of is if you had the camera on your home insurance then claim through it usually when you post something to a company they do not cover loss or damage in the post either way United States Postal Service Digital photography Warranty Data retention Surveillance Internet fraud Mail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Insurance Auto insurance E-mail spam Plame affair Automatic teller machine Phishing Neopets Postage stamp Health insurance Closed-circuit television FairTax Babylonian law Home insurance Mouse (computing) Identity theft Automatic number plate recognition Poker jargon Advance fee fraud Post Office Protocol Grey market Stamp collecting Bohemian Rhapsody Bank fraud Nikon Corporation Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Resident Evil 4 World Series Camera EXpanded MultiPlayer Arbitrage Envelope Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Argos (retailer) Postmark Trademark Digital single-lens reflex cameras Public domain Downing Street memo View camera Sears Holdings Corporation Computer virus BookCrossing United Kingdom corporation tax Stopping e-mail abuse Floppy disk Internet forum Photographic film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Reservoir Dogs Cash register American Depositary Receipt Liability insurance Income statement RuneScape cheats Mensal__o scandal Ex-gay Credit card Photographic lens Road-rule enforcement camera ZIP Code Medical malpractice Life insurance Gmail Transmission Control Protocol Nalgene SCO-Linux controversies Opera (web browser) Implied warranty MapleStory Vicarius Filii Dei E-mail Super 8 mm film Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Brit - British) Plame affair timeline Hash table Digital camera back Cross site scripting Billboard Hot 100 Eastman Kodak Japan Post Jessica Lynch Royal Mail UK telephone numbering plan Contract The Sims 2 Wal-Mart Zoom lens Postcode Something Awful Network Switching Subsystem Lloyd's of London
