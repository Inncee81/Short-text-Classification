when i watch a dvd the sound through my tv decreases what gives if your tv works fine otherwise but has bad audio only when playing dvd's its probably a cabling problem or your dvd player maybe bad i would suggest trying a new set of audio cables from the dvd to the tv if the issue continues even with different cables try moving the dvd player to another tv set and playing it there if the issue stays with the dvd player its the dvd player i'd return it or call the manufacturer to see if its covered under warranty if the issue goes away when you have the dvd player hooked up to another tv that would mean theres some interference between the dvd player and that particular tv set hope this helps Laserdisc DVD Television DualDisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting NTSC Karaoke SCART Audiophile Vorbis Super Audio CD IPod Xbox High-definition television COPS (TV series) High fidelity Poker jargon Musical Instrument Digital Interface DVD player MP3 Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Compact disc Federal Communications Commission Cable television Bluetooth Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Loudspeaker Survivor (TV series) Firefly (television series) Dolby Laboratories Gramophone record Crazy in Love Sound recording Anamorphic widescreen Nintendo GameCube Warranty The Residents Marching band PlayStation 2 Blu-ray Disc Phonograph MPEG-2 Modem Macrovision Videocassette recorder Digital video recorder Timpani CD recorder Live Aid Space elevator Universal Serial Bus Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Pornography VHS Copy protection Car audio Atari 8-bit family Walkman Nintendo Revolution Pioneer Corporation DVD-Audio Equine conformation Video CD Home cinema TurboGrafx 16 Ice hockey Girls Aloud Doctor Who missing episodes Xbox 360 Eddie Kramer Digital audio player Mystery Science Theater 3000 PlayStation 3 Dolby Digital S/PDIF Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Panasonic Farscape Sega Dreamcast DVD recorder Sesame Street BBC Jhonen Vasquez CD-ROM Digital rights management IBook USB flash drive 24 (television) Alias (TV series) Comparison of media players Super Video CD Anchor Mixtape Volleyball Player piano Dubbing (filmmaking) PlayStation Portable Ayumi Hamasaki World Poker Tour
