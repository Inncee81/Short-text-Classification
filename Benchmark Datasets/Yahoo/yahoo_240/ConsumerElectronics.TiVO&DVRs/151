when trying to dub my old vhs tapes onto dvds my recorder won't because of copy protection signal help i have a jvc dr mv suj recorder everytime i try to copy my vhs to dvd it stops a few seconds in saying that it can't because of the copy protection signal endcoded on it i tried taping over the little square on the bottom left corner but it still didn't work so is there an easy and cheap way to override this this is because you are trying to copy video that has embedded macrovision protection tpaeing over the hole on the cassette will not help you this hole is only designed to tell your vcr not to allow you to accidentally record over the cassette this is why vcr dvd r combo units are useless because all they allow you to copy is your own home movies there are devices designed to remove macrovision but they cost well over dollars just starting off and are again useless if you have a all in one unit Videocassette recorder VHS DVD Copy protection Camcorder S-VHS Compact disc Laserdisc Betamax Videotape Compact audio cassette Floppy disk S__CAM Digital video recorder 8 mm video format JVC DV High-definition television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Videotape format war Betacam The Cure Sound recording TiVo Sony Corp. of America v.
