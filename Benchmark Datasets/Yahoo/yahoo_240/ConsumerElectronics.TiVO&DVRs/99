is comcast better than direct tv i may be biased since i live in southern california but the only time i have lost the signal from my directv satellite was maybe times in the last years and for about minute it would only go out when it was raining cats and dogs for normal rain i never lost the signal now when i started with directv i also have their directv tivo which are way better than the directv dvr's they have now directvs newer dvrs are the same as using any cable satellite providers dvr's now the directv tivo's were able to be modified for larger recording capacity and networking which is not available on the newer models directv uses only all digital channels on every channel comcast digital cable does not use all digital quality they still have a majority of analog channels in their programming now to comcast you will get about the same performance on the comcast dvr as you would with any cable satellite directv provider so just look for the best price in your area if you are not concerned about the all digital quality channels i hope this helps Direct broadcast satellite Digital video recorder High-definition television DirecTV Cable television Satellite television Communications satellite Commercial broadcasting Dish Network XM Satellite Radio Microsoft KQED News Corporation Television in the United States Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital Satellite System Digital television Comcast Television in Canada British Sky Broadcasting Television encryption Pirate decryption Public Broadcasting Service NFL Network Broadcasting Telephone Digital audio broadcasting MP3 DVD Must-carry Laserdisc Nielsen Ratings Loudspeaker Audiophile Nintendo GameCube Digital cable NY1 BBC Radio Integrated Services Digital Network Broadband Internet access FSN (Fox Sports Net) S-VHS WGN-TV Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Modem Voice over IP Electronic program guide Television network Analog signal Digital Subscriber Line Television SCART WNBC-TV Hughes Aircraft DVB News program Gramophone record TV Chile Telegraphy TechTV Bell ExpressVu KING-TV Compact disc Televicentro Home Box Office Satellite radio IS-95 Rupert Murdoch Xbox MTV Channel 4 Hard disk Five (TV) Synthesizer GSM services Video on demand DV WNYW-TV American Broadcasting Company Disney Channel G4 (TV channel) Radio One WBPH-TV Logo (TV channel) Oscilloscope Regional television in Australia NTSC Atari 8-bit family ITV Musical Instrument Digital Interface Radio Disney QVC
