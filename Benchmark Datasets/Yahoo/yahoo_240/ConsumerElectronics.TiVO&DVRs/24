directv tivo vs dish network we have had directv with tivo and have never had a problem we are moving and can get a package deal with dish network that will be cheaper a month and includes their dvr i don't really care about hd channels or anything i am wondering mainly about how the dish dvr or whatever they call it compares to tivo has anyone tried both if you have directv with a directv tivo not a directv dvr then you will not be happy with any other dvr whether it is from directv or dish now from my experience with yahoo answers and being a moderator on a dvr forum what i have learned is that many people that have had both directv and dish prefer directv due to its better picture quality better customer support these seem to be the two biggest issues with dish network that i have seen also the dish network dvrs do not function like a directv tivo or directv dvr first off their dual tuner models do not work like directvs you cannot flip between the tuners to see what is playing recording on the other tuner dish dvrs have to connect to two different tvs to be able to use both tuners one on each tv if you have directv you would most likely be better off using their movers package that will install a new dish at your new place and set up your equipment for free if you decide to go with dish their may be charges when they go to set up their dish and equipment also with dish you will have to lease their dvr so you do not own if with directv tivo's most all people who used them own them which allows you to upgrade it if you want take it with you if you want etc some people that jumped onto the directv tivo's about a year ago had to lease their directv tivo units if you need more info on anything i mentioned here or have any further questions please feel free to send me an email also you can get quite a bit of information from sites like http www dvrplayground com http www avsforum com which are two dvr forums for tip and tricks questions about dvrs and issues with dvr's on the www dvrplayground com forum they have a forum for other dvrs other than a tivo or directv tivo called upgrading other dvrs you may find helpful ideas to sway you one way or another Digital video recorder High-definition television DirecTV Microsoft Satellite television Direct broadcast satellite Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Voice over IP Television Pirate decryption British Sky Broadcasting Home Box Office Videocassette recorder Dish Network Domain Name System H.264/MPEG-4 AVC BitTorrent Broadband Internet access Pretty Good Privacy Spyware XM Satellite Radio Television in the United States Linux Electronic Frontier Foundation Set-top box PowerPC Modem GameFAQs Computer ITU-T Internet fraud WCBS-TV Mozilla Firefox PHP Composite monitor Gmail PlayStation Portable Software engineering Windows XP PlayStation 2 Phishing HyperText Transfer Protocol Internet troll Strategic management DVD ATI Technologies Opera (web browser) Digital television Call centre RuneScape cheats IP Multimedia Subsystem Internet Relay Chat Wi-Fi HTTP cookie Windows Vista World Wide Web Owned and operated station Universal Mobile Telecommunications System MDAC Recipe Wireless Application Protocol Software agent The Standard Modding IBM PC compatible Transport Layer Security MP3 Laserdisc General Motors Usenet Web crawler Mozilla Application Suite Secure Shell Internet censorship in mainland China CPAN ITunes GSM services Dog agility Must-carry Oscilloscope Teletext General Packet Radio Service SCART Information Technology Infrastructure Library Media in Canada E-mail spam Xerox Central processing unit Whois ARPANET
