this goes back to any earlier question about vince young being on the cover why do people think that it was because vince young was rookie of the year whoop de do theres one of those every year doesnt mean that they go on the cover come on people whats the real reason and dont say its because they wanted a young gun ok vince young is most likely on it bcuz i dont think there is a person whos a football fan who isnt a fan of his he is a true competitor and is very good at the qb position hes more than the rookie of the year he is a franchise pro bowl qb he is a winner he won the last out of games as a starter last year to help the titans go he won a lot of those games practically by himself hes fast strong and can throw a ball better than most nfl qb's and once he gets better at decision making he could be the very best qb in the league i love the fact that hes on the cover he is one of my favorite players and not just cuz texas is my favorite college football team National Football League New York Giants St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Super Bowl New England Patriots American football Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXIV Kansas City Chiefs Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII American Football League Cincinnati Bengals New York Jets Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXIII Miami Dolphins Jacksonville Jaguars Donovan McNabb San Francisco 49ers San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXV National Football League Lore NFL Draft Toronto Raptors Super Bowl I XFL Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXI Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XII Dan Marino Indianapolis Colts Minnesota Vikings Madden NFL Florida Marlins Super Bowl II Super Bowl V Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XVII Pro Bowl St. Louis Cardinals Green Bay Packers Walter Payton Super Bowl XIX New York Mets College football Super Bowl XI Super Bowl X Oakland Raiders Bud Adams 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl III Bernie Kosar Philadelphia Phillies November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXVIII New Orleans Saints National Basketball Association American football strategy Indiana Pacers Brett Favre Super Bowl XXII Texas Longhorn Athletics AFL-NFL Merger Peyton Manning Houston Astros NFL on television Chicago Bulls Baseball Major League Soccer Kurt Warner Toronto Blue Jays San Antonio Spurs Football (soccer) Joe Gibbs FIFA Series Michael Vick Seattle Mariners Baseball Stars Super Bowl XXXII Ricky Ray Doug Flutie New York Rangers
