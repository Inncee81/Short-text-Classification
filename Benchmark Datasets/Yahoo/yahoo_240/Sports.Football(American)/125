how is dogfighting really any different than fishing you hook fish injure sometimes kill them and lots of times fishermen just throw them back so how is that any worse than dogfighting they're both animals that are being killed injured in the name of sport most live you mean some die for you entertainment that's cruel i'm no fan of mike vick i like the bucs and you are stupid to compare stomping a bug to stomping a baby that is just sick as you are comparing humans to animals i'm comparing animals to animals all you who say people don't eat dogs must have never been outside the usa because lots of people eat puppies and dogs in other countries they are just another kind of animal i'm with you on that i dont care about a study saying fish dont feel pain let me put a hook in your lip and see if you feel pain the fish is bleeding from the hook so i guarantee its feelin pain the dogs were trained to fight so it wasnt cruel and the loser in any dogfight most likely suffers a fatal attack so its gonna die anyway they just help it die quicker by drowning or slamming it to the ground vick would have saved hisself a lot of trouble if he invested in some bullets Fox hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) YuYu Hakusho Glen Jacobs Professional wrestling holds Dog Gray Wolf Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling throws Whaling Speciesism Animal testing Suplex Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling attacks Year of the Spider One Piece minor characters Hunting Characters in the Smurfs Livestock Fishing Cat Kashrut Sesshomaru Professional wrestling aerial techniques American Psycho Characters of Naruto Piccolo Junior Saga Michael Vick Shaggy dog story Kenny McCormick Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Mixed martial arts Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Theory of conduct Pit bull RuneScape quests Vegetarianism Sonic the Hedgehog Naruto jutsu Mario Brown Bear Angling God Emperor of Dune Rabies Jennifer Lopez Kodocha Dog fighting Tenshinhan First aid Israeli Air Force True Crime: Streets of LA The Marshall Mathers LP Ranma __ characters Kurt Angle Sick Puppy Lakitu Poker jargon Cincinnati Bengals Rocko's Modern Life Matt Hardy The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Lycanthropy Professional wrestling slang Ultimate Fighting Championship NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Iditarod Timeline of alternative rock Fatality EastEnders Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Housebreaking Monster Rancher monsters Anthrax Unreal Dog training Animal rights News of the World (album) Taboo food and drink Babe Ruth Radiation poisoning Koopa Troopa Ripped Pants Columbine High School massacre Swimming Leatherback Sea Turtle Pet store Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 Socialization Egg (food) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Torture Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
