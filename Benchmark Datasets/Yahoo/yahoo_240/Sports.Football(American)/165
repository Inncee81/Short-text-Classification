football help i'm a wide reciver most likley going to start on jv next year but theres a slim chance i will dress for varsity i can catch the ball pretty well but my main problem is when the ball is thrown really fast at me i have a hard time catching it especially on a shorter route like a curl or screen i think the main reason why it is coming out of my hands is because its just bouncing out cause its going so fast what drills can i do to help me make those catches and get softer hands are there any specific football gloves thatll help me make those cathes i need a glove that will absorb a lot of the shock from the ball thanks in advance for the help the ball should hit your hands first not your pads you want to begin the catch with arms extended and tuck the ball in it is great when the ball can be caught in the mid section with your hands craddling the ball in tightly the biggest hurdle is to concentrate on the ball and nothing else Volleyball Fast bowling American football Fielding (cricket) Laws of cricket Softball Glossary of American football Canadian football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 American football strategy Four square National Football League Lore Cricket Australian rules football Cleveland Browns Tag Baseball glove Leg before wicket Wide receiver Boxing Basketball Super Bowl V Water polo Baseball statistics Tennis Drill bit Cricket ball Equine conformation Super Bowl XXI 1957 World Series Comparison of Canadian and American football Table tennis Super Bowl XXXVI Field hockey Dodgeball Glossary of climbing terms Super Bowl III Professional wrestling holds Types of bowlers in cricket New England Patriots Side pass (dance move) National Football League Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Diving Super Bowl XVII Sandy Koufax Professional wrestling throws Football Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XIV Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Arena football Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando 2000 Australian Grand Prix Yorker Paintball Pinball Ravi Shastri Parade (military) Left fielder Mouse (computing) Skateboarding trick Super Bowl XXV Climbing equipment Squash (sport) Super Bowl XXVI Peter Shilton Knickerbocker Rules Blitzball Billiards Pitcher Muhammad Ali Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 San Francisco 49ers Brian Close Robot Master Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Floppy disk Wrigley Field Vegeta Catcher Batting (cricket) Snooker 2004 World Series New York Giants Swingout Goaltender No ball Babe Ruth 2005 World Series Wicket-keeper Baseball positions Bryan Robson Coin flipping Rugby union
