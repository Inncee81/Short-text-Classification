umm i just switched school and i gots bad grades at my old school i wont to play football at my new school but my question is will i be able to play or not because of my grades of my previous school your school records travel with you when you transfer so they'll know that you have bad grades for the previous year depending on the school districts policy though they may have lower educational standards that might let you play if you do i'd really recommend hitting the books most people won't get far in life in a sports career so rely on your brains oh if my kids were in the same situation and the new school allowed them to play as a responsible parent i'd set the priorities and require them to bring the grades up before playing Graduate school GED Education in the United States Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China High school No Child Left Behind Act Culture of the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement SAT A-level Primary education Education in Germany Education in Portugal Education in England Education Tripartite System Bristol Grammar School Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Romania Pete Rose Baseball Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kitzmiller v.
