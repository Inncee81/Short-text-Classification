eagles saints in the nfc championship game i don't see anyone else contending against these two as the top teams in the nfc the closest competition comes from the bears no offense at all and seahawks can they rebound from injury and they aren't not even favored to win their division and don't give me the cowboys they haven't won a playoff game in years and the only people that think they'll go all the way are dallas fans eagles and saints will have the best offenses in the nfc and will be with the colts for the entire nfl both have defenses that are more than capable and once again they are in the weak nfc what are your thoughts i'm not predicting who will win the game yet but if both teams are healthy in january either could go to the super bowl gay t you are retarted haha the eagles play the bears in week not the girls can't expect anything more from a girls fan i can't figure out what other teams in the nfc are really any good the eagles and the saints are the best as long as both teams are healthy people who say the cowboys are just cowboy fans the cowboys are so overrated tony romo' s numbers in the last games of the last season went down to a below average qb to aka od is not even the cowboy's top receiver cowboys fans are just dreaming when they wake up they will see how to is a cancer and i can't wait to see to destroy there team and the bears have lost several players on defense and i've heard people say the giants there team won't even make the playoffs there not as good as the eagles or the cowboys in the nfc east go eagles St. Louis Rams Pittsburgh Steelers Donovan McNabb Miami Dolphins Super Bowl Super Bowl XXVII Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore National Football League Philadelphia Eagles Indianapolis Colts Cleveland Browns Super Bowl V Tampa Bay Buccaneers Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl X New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Professional American football championship games Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XIV NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXV NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl VI Cris Carter New York Jets Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XVII Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl XXXIV National Football League championships Detroit Lions Super Bowl XXI Kansas City Chiefs 1978 NFL season Super Bowl XV Joe Gibbs Super Bowl XXIII 2005 NFL season 1987 NFL season Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl IX Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXV New Orleans Saints Terrell Owens NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Super Bowl XVIII NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Super Bowl III December 2004 in sports Green Bay Packers Super Bowl XXII Washington Redskins NFL playoffs, 1992-93 NFL playoffs, 2000-01 NFL playoffs, 1981-82 1994 NFL season Super Bowl I Robert F.
