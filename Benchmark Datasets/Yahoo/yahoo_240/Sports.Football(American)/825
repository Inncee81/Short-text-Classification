detroit lions the lion's looked alright yesterday but if u ask me i think kitna is horrible and that j t osullivan was pretty good what do u think about kitna being the qb for the lions do you people remember the j kitna that i'm talking about that had td's and int's i don't care how many yards u throw for if u give the ball back it dosent mean hit kitna looks like he only has about more years in him so one of those guys will be the future qb sure would it be smart to put kitna at number qb sure it would because sullivan was awesome however you seemed to have forgotten about dan orlosky he actually had a better qb rating than sullivan does and brought the lions to a big comeback also along with that dan knows the offense better because he has sat on the sideline and studied it for two years so if you are going to bench kitna i say you should look at dan first before you look at sullivan but i highly doubt the lions will bench kitna because rod marinelli quote un quote likes kitna so really the only reason why kitna would get benched is if he really stinked or if he got injured however dan sullivan or stanton are the future qb's of the team expect to have one of them be a franchise qb for years to come if i would have to say any of them i would say dan because he seems very calm and i had the feeling he could be a future starter when we drafted him Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots New York Jets San Francisco 49ers 1957 World Series Carolina Panthers Marvin Lewis Dan Marino Brett Favre Cliff Richard Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXVII Toronto Raptors Montreal Canadiens Super Bowl XXV Babe Ruth Detroit Tigers National Football League Lore Carson Palmer World Series National Football League Super Bowl IX Tris Speaker Miami Dolphins Super Bowl V Super Bowl XIX St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVI Detroit Lions NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Indiana Pacers 2005 World Series Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl X Cincinnati Bengals Chicago Bulls Damon Allen Major League Baseball television contracts Iron Bowl Super Bowl XXXVI Kurt Warner Quarterback Boston Red Sox 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Glossary of American football Florida Marlins Shaggy dog story Ryan Leaf EastEnders Detroit Red Wings Leeds United F.C.
