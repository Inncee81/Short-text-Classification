why do lsu fans hate usc so much while usc fans don't give a s t about lsu i just think it is funny how the lsu coaches and fans complain and whine about everything from the shared championship to the rankings to how much tougher their conference is has the whining really gotten them anywhere fight on this isnt math class you can't use the transitive property of equality to determnie who is the better team football is a game of matchups and because of this it is inevitable that the scores will not always reflect the overall tallent of a particular team anyways moving on lsu fans do not hate usc they are jealous and not because usc is better they havent played head to head in recent history so as far as i see nobody is better they are jealous because usc is always making it to a bcs game i think it is fair to say that lsu and usc possess equal amounts of skill and tallent and thusly lsu knows if they got to play usc's schedule they could be in the same situation as usc winning multiple conference titles and playing bcs games every year that said college football moves in cycles and right now the sec is the most dominant conference in football so the sec teams are all going to feel like they have it harder than everyone else but at one point in time the pac was tough and the big was tough or the acc and so on eventually the power will shift and usc may have the tough schedule and lsu gets a few cup cake games its all about taking advantage of your turn to shine NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Nick Saban BCS title game Texas Longhorn Athletics USC Trojans Football Mack Brown Southeastern Conference College basketball Big East Conference 2004 College World Series New York Giants Tulane University Playoff National Football League Arkansas Razorbacks NCAA Division I-A national football champions Auburn University Atlantic Coast Conference American Football League University of Southern California Pittsburgh Steelers NBA Finals December 2004 in sports Louisiana State University Minnesota Vikings Pacific Ten Conference Houston Nutt Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Leeds United F.C.
