whats your take on a defense my school has a whole new playbook this year and has switched form a defense to a defense it is not a normal defense though every player has their assigned nickname for their position except for the db's the line lines up to which side the te is on so that each that half of the d line is always lined up on the strong side the linebackers line up to the passing strength for example if it is twins on one side and a single wr on the other than the passing strength is the side with the receivers or if its quads then its to whatever side the qb throws the ball what is your take on this defense and a defense on general on the quads part its supposed to say on the side of the qb's passing arm my bad its definitely not a because there is no ss and the lb are lbs and never act like safties the is the best utilitarian defense you can play it's simple adaptable and works very well against any defense the way you are running it is more or less correct strong side is the side the te lines up on in a strong left the left dt can hit the b gap while the right dt crashes the a with a defenders in the box you have up to men crashing the line and only to block men will always get through to pressure the qb of a right handed qbs passes will go to the defensive left side of the field a defense leaves dbs to divide the deep secondary but there are linebackers that cover the middle from a a player can learn to negotiate a multiple a nickle d even the series it's a great defense and if your coach has decided to implement it that means he feels it's the best thing for your level of play what i like about it is that each player has his own responsibility so when the offense makes a good play i know exactly who was at fault and why the is our base defense we use a and nickle i also have a but is so simple to learn and implement it stays as our bread and butter good luck American football strategy Glossary of American football Defensive team Volleyball Baseball American football Lineman (football) Canadian football Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XI Softball Table tennis Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIII Pittsburgh Steelers Rugby union positions Super Bowl I Poker jargon Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XVIII New York Giants Badminton Water polo Super Bowl X Super Bowl XII Cincinnati Bengals Fast bowling Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVI Fielding (cricket) Super Bowl VII National Football League Lore Offensive team Super Bowl XXIII Rugby league San Francisco 49ers Snooker Theory of conduct Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXIV Ultimate (sport) National Football League Football (soccer) positions New England Patriots Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XX Rugby union Batting (cricket) Super Bowl XIX Quarterback Shogi Rugby league positions Super Bowl XVI Official (American football) Team Fortress Classic Racquetball Basketball Miami Dolphins Iron Bowl Computer chess Trigonometric function Craps ELO rating system Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Chess terminology 1957 World Series Football (soccer) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Super Bowl XXXVIII Tennis Free throw Field hockey Comparison of Canadian and American football Tris Speaker Super Bowl XXXII Chess strategy and tactics Baseball Stars Dominoes Arena football Box score (baseball) Marching band Final Fantasy magic Ice hockey Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXV French Defence Super Bowl XXII
