who is the greatest nfl player of all time that's like asking which one of your children is your favorite there have honestly been so many great players that the mindset is too hard to imagine personally i've always admired brett favre for his guts and the fact that he plays to have fun as well as admiring joe montana for being easily the most level headed individual to play the game walter payton ranks high on that list because he was the classiest individual and the nicest guy to ever put on a helmet and pads on the defensive side reggie white sticks out because of two things those wild looking eyes and swinging arms struck fear into anyone who played quarterback even phil simms was nervous about interviewing him after his retirement and secondly for the fact that he was one of the biggest reasons the light shone on green bay in the nineties other names that stick out in my mind for defense would be mean joe greene sticks out because he was part of the steelers' saving force in the ' season when bradshaw went down helping them to super bowl x i could go on forever but those were the ones that suck out first in my mind Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League Lore Cleveland Browns New York Giants Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl X New England Patriots Super Bowl XXXII Cincinnati Bengals NFL Most Valuable Player Award Dallas Cowboys Baltimore Ravens Brett Favre Minnesota Vikings Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XIII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXIV Green Bay Packers Kansas City Chiefs Reggie White Miami Dolphins Carolina Panthers Monday Night Football Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXIII Steve Young (athlete) Super Bowl XIV New York Jets Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl San Francisco 49ers Dan Marino San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2001-02 NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Indianapolis Colts Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XIX Kurt Warner NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXV Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl I Super Bowl IV World Series English cricket team Super Bowl XI Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXVII Chicago Bears Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXIV Reggie Jackson Super Bowl VII Walter Payton NFL playoffs, 1993-94 Donovan McNabb NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XVII September 2005 in sports Terrell Owens Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Detroit Lions Running back Terry Bradshaw Boomer Esiason Atlanta Falcons NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award Ted Hendricks Oakland Raiders Ravi Shastri Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl V Joe Gibbs October 2005 in sports Professional American football championship games Joe Paterno Detroit Tigers Ty Cobb
