is it qb or rb really the most difficult position to play i know both qb and rb combine athleticism with brains but they still have some room for mistakes i know that an o lineman does not have room for mistakes neither but you can not compare a sack with a long gain of yards or a touchdown against your team what about cornerbacks they must have a combination of great speed to chase a wr great strengh to bring down a rb at full speed and intelligence to read defenses and figure out the route a cb is usually at a disadvantage vs at least inch taller wideouts who know they route they are running the smallest mistake or losing the battle vs a wr could probably cost points to his team qb is still the hardest position because they have to run the offense and be a leader even if he doesn't want to be any other position you can just do you're job and that's all that is expected of you qbs must know their playbooks inside and out for passing and running plays while defensive players have a smaller playbook also qbs usually have to shoulder most of the blame if the team loses it probably not as physically harder than any other position besides k p but it's tops when it comes to mental preparation and leadership ability Glossary of American football Cincinnati Bengals American football Wide receiver New York Giants St. Louis Rams Super Bowl X Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXVI Volleyball Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXI Canadian football Defensive team Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XI Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl III Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXIII Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Lore Lineman (football) New England Patriots Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIX Quarterback Miami Dolphins Donovan McNabb Blackjack Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXII Offensive team Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl I Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXIV Baseball Super Bowl VII San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXVIII Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXIV Rugby union positions Softball Water polo Fast bowling Comparison of Canadian and American football Iron Bowl Super Bowl V Table tennis National Football League Buffalo Bills Protoss Running back Deion Sanders September 2005 in sports Team Fortress Classic Yao Ming Basketball Super Bowl XXXV Joe Paterno Baltimore Ravens Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XVI Combine (Half-Life 2) Football (soccer) positions Super Bowl XXXII Bernie Kosar Poker jargon NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Miami Hurricanes Football NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Terminal ballistics Indianapolis Colts Michael Vick Battle of Jutland The Apprentice 2 Ice hockey Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXX Natural Selection (computer game) Redundant array of independent disks Kasparov versus The World History of Test cricket (to 1883) Dallas Cowboys Wind turbine American Football League Pete Sampras
