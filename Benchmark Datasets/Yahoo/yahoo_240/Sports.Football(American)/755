how do you feel about michael vick's treatment of his dogs and why i am appalled at michael vick's participation in the dogfighting operation a man with the amount of he has he could participate in any hobby or pastime he chose and he chose this one speaks volumes about his character dogs help blind people live better lives dogs locate missing and injured in rescue operations dogs locate drug dealers dogs offer love and companionship to many seniors and other lonely people a dog will love you unconditionally and only wants to please their owner two stories recently in the news a dog recently jumped in front of a toddler that a rattlesnake was about to attack and took the bites himself a senior who lived in an isolated area and alone backed into a ravine on his property he could not get out of his truck he was trapped his dog who he had rescued from a pound a few weeks beforehand jumped out of the truck and ran to the closest neighbors house and barked and barked until they followed him and rescued the man there are thousands of stories like this so to those who say it was just dogs well you must not know much about dogs you are probably one of those who has one for whatever reason you would considering you don't respect them and puts the animal on a two foot rope outside in the heat with no food and water and leave them there forever with no human interaction what michael vick has done is absolutely mind boggling it turns my stomach to betray a dogs trust loyalty and love by starving it beating it torturing it drugging it and forcing it to fight is beyond comprehension and then to murder in such sadistic methods the ones who still would not fight is so sick and demented that it sends shock waves down my spine to think of it then one must also consider another practice of dogfighting trainers they go through neighborhoods and steal family pets and get dogs from 'free to a good home' ads to use them as bait with their killer dogs the stolen dog is thrown into a cage with the killer dogs and is torn apart in a matter of seconds this is so sick recently a pit bull was found by the road in ohio bleeding profusely and its back legs paralyzed when it was rescued and taken to a veternarian it was determined this dog had been used as a 'bait' dog the dog had been hung by its hind legs and muzzled and then other dogs were goaded into attacking it relentlessly how can anybody defend this type of behavior the cruelty this blood sport represents is so sadistic that it horrifies me if anything good has come out of the michael vick situation is that the public has been made aware of the fact that it does go on in our society and the fact that it is illegal maybe more people will report those who participate in this demented bloodsport Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Gray Wolf Glen Jacobs Cat Reservoir Dogs Obedience training The Death Gate Cycle Professional wrestling match types YuYu Hakusho Domestic rabbit Iditarod American Pit Bull Terrier Knots Landing Capital punishment Kim Possible Rabies Trapping Fox hunting RuneScape quests Professional wrestling aerial techniques Horse Professional wrestling holds One Piece minor characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Days of our Lives Suicide methods Zoophilia Professional wrestling attacks First aid Excel Saga Mixed martial arts Characters of Naruto Professional wrestling slang Sadism and masochism Dog agility Pit bull Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tenshinhan Boxing Michael Vick Bullfighting Plame affair Rais massacre Cockfight Professional wrestling throws Theodicy Blood (computer game) The Amber Spyglass Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Cancer Indianapolis 500 Ferret Working dog Leon White The Inside Richard Chase Shawn Michaels Dog fighting Salad Fingers The Lovely Bones John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Shen Gong Wu Guinea pig Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Firefighter Kodocha Prisoner (TV series) Beltway sniper attacks Swimming German Shepherd Dog Baseball Daredevil Jam (TV series) Keeshond Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Equine conformation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dobermann Shaman King Platoon (film) Sub-Zero Sheikh Abdullah Animal Farm Drizzt Do'Urden Serial killer Tlingit
