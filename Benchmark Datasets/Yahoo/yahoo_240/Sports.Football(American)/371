why do you think vick came out saying he was innocent didn't he think all the evidence would eventually come out because if he pleas guilty or accepts a plea deal he knows his nfl career would be over i suspect he and his attorneys are counting on getting an 'oj' jury whereas the evidence won't matter they will find him innocent regardless this may happen but i do believe that he is done in the nfl whether he is found guilty or not if any nfl team puts him on the field he will be boo'd so loudly that he won't be able to handle the pressure look how he handled a few boo's in atlanta the finger i doubt seriously that michael vick has the moral or mental fortitude to perform well under that kind of pressure Plea bargain Michael Vick 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Atlanta Falcons New York Giants Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Burden of proof Jury trial National Football League Adversarial system NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Randy Moss Passer rating Insanity defense Madden NFL January 2005 in sports Jury Quarterback American Football League Plame affair timeline Washington Redskins Cincinnati Bengals Plame affair Chicago Cubs Gary Ridgway New England Patriots Darrell Waltrip Baltimore Ravens San Francisco 49ers United States Football League Ronnie Earle Brett Favre December 2004 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Capital punishment Guilt Presumption of innocence Super Bowl XXXIX Charles Graner Glen Jacobs O.
