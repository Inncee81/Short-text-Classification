why are they going after vick he just owns the house police don't usually go after the landlords of homes they usually go after the people who live there and commit crimes am i the only one who sees this i mean my landlord can't be responsible for everything i do in my house that would be crazy i make my own decisions my landlord just collects the check every month im not a fan of mike vick but i do respect his amazing athleticism as a football player go bucs by the way its supposes to be innocent until proven guilty wait until he's found guilty then i'll join you in saying he should be punished for it i think it's because he had knowledge of what was going on and even participated in some dog fighting all i hope is that if he's guilty he gets punished hard and if he's innocent then i hope he gets a fair trial what frustrates me is that everywhere i see on all the news channels it seems like they have already convicted him let's not forget about innocent until proven guilty Michael Vick Miscarriage of justice Trials since the Fiji coup of 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schapelle Corby Presumption of innocence Jury trial Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Insanity defense Guilt O.
