who agrees with me that the san francisco ers will make a huge comeback this year at least the playoffs the nfc west is probably the best division in the nfc this year i expect arizona san francisco and st louis to all make the playoffs this year and quite possibly to see nfc west teams in the nfc championship game seattle still has some talent but they are way overrated at least among the media and the fools who believe everything they say the ers have a very good chance of making the playoffs with frank gore arguably the best running back in the nfl though ladainian tomlinson and steven jackson also have a case for that spot and vernon davis he's probably the most talented te to ever step onto the field and i expect to see him be as dominant as to and jerry rice used to be for the ers alex smith while not a great qb is capable of getting the ball to his receievers defensively the ers are above average and will probably get better considering the quality of the coaching staff they've got San Francisco 49ers New York Giants Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII National Football League Lore Minnesota Vikings Dallas Cowboys St. Louis Rams National Football League Cleveland Browns Buffalo Bills NFL playoffs, 2001-02 September 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 NFL playoffs, 1990-91 NFL playoffs, 1998-99 Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2003-04 NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXXII Donovan McNabb Arizona Cardinals Super Bowl XXIII NFL playoffs, 1992-93 Super Bowl XIX Atlanta Falcons Oakland Raiders NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Super Bowl X Super Bowl December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXVI Miami Dolphins Cris Carter NFL playoffs, 2004-05 New York Jets Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXI San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Running back Los Angeles Kings NFL playoffs, 1988-89 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Brett Favre 1994 NFL season Super Bowl XXXVII NFL playoffs, 1993-94 Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXI 1990 NFL season Super Bowl XI Green Bay Packers 1995 NFL season Detroit Lions Super Bowl V 1987 NFL season Super Bowl XV World Series Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2000-01 NFL playoffs, 1987-88 Super Bowl XVII January 2005 in sports Utah Jazz Super Bowl XXX NFL playoffs, 1984-85 Joe Gibbs NFL playoffs, 1981-82 Jacksonville Jaguars NFL playoffs, 1983-84 2004 NFL season Super Bowl III NBA Finals New England Patriots Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Kansas City Chiefs New York Knicks 2002 NFL season Walter Payton 1984 NFL season NFL playoffs, 1989-90 Professional American football championship games San Francisco Giants Texas Rangers (baseball)
