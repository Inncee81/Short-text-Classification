peyton manning or carson palmer i'm not asking whose better i imagine the response will overwhelmingly be manning if you are building a team now who do you take the main thing to take into consideration is that palmer is years younger if you're building your team for the future the clear choice is carson palmer as far as numbers go they're already equivalent and that includes a season when palmer only had of his offensive line and was coming off of major knee surgery for a potentially career ending injury they both have the arm although palmer throws a better spiral and is slightly more accurate with his throws as well as being a little bit more mobile manning has better timing with his receivers but also has four years experience on palmer which factors into his slight advantage in intangibles and it is very slight so if i were building a team to win for the next years i'd go with the elite quarterback who will still be in the league and playing at a high level for that length of time and that's carson palmer Quarterback New England Patriots New York Giants Cleveland Browns American football Carson Palmer Volleyball San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl V Cincinnati Bengals American football strategy PGA Tour Glossary of American football Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXV Daunte Culpepper Ryan Leaf Super Bowl XXXIV Carolina Panthers Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XIV Baseball National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXII Michael Vick Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVI Miami Dolphins Canadian football Water polo Super Bowl X Softball USC Trojans Football Super Bowl VI Al Michaels New York Jets Arnold Palmer Matt Leinart Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl III Mario Lemieux Super Bowl XXVI 1957 World Series Super Bowl XV Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXIV Alex Rodriguez Super Bowl IV Football (soccer) Passer rating Troy Glaus San Diego Chargers National Football League Super Bowl XIX Steve Young (athlete) Yao Ming Dan Marino Notts County F.C.
