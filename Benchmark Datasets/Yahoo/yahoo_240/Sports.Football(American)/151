so i guess west virginia is going to win the national championship alot of people call me the crazy person my comments about wvu obviously stirred the pot the only reason wvu has an outsiders shot of making it to the national championship is because their schedule is favorable then dosen't that speak volumes about their conference they play in a crap conf the only good team is louisville and they are pretty much brand new to the conf sure rutgers had a good season last year but what bowl game did they go to again and usf isn't even in the top five schools in florida well the big east went in the bowls last season and west virginia rutgers and louisville all finished in the top last year pitt and syracuse have had a few down years south florida is a rising program and uconn is steadily improving too so i wouldn't call it a crap conference that is a moronic statement west virginia and louisville are considered national championship contenders especially wvu with the lethal combo of pat white and steve slaton brian brohm is also a heisman canidate for louisville pitt has landed top recruiting classes so they will be back sooner than later wvu has a great shot at winning it all Big East Conference Bowl Championship Series College football 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Southeastern Conference Georgia Institute of Technology West Virginia University Boston College Athletics Atlantic Coast Conference University of Connecticut International League Joe Paterno Super Bowl XXXVI Mack Brown Pittsburgh Steelers College soccer Syracuse University Orange University of Pittsburgh University of South Florida Texas Longhorn Athletics Super Bowl XXI College basketball New England Patriots John Calipari Oakland Athletics National Football League St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXI Cleveland Browns Kansas City Chiefs USC Trojans Football Super Bowl Oklahoma Sooners Iron Bowl State university New York Knicks Fight song Playoff American Football League Carolina Panthers University of Florida Michigan Wolverines March 2005 in sports Buffalo Bills Super Bowl I Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XVIII Cincinnati Reds December 2004 in sports Chicago Bulls National Basketball Association Super Bowl XXV Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XIII Cincinnati Bengals San Francisco 49ers Poker jargon NBA Finals Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXVII World Championship Wrestling 1986 NBA Draft University of Texas at Austin Orlando Magic Craps University of San Francisco Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl II University of Michigan Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl X Tampa Bay Buccaneers BCS title game World Series Super Bowl XXIV Miami Dolphins Rose Bowl (game) Minnesota Vikings Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXIII Nick Saban Los Angeles Kings Utah Jazz John Layfield 2005 English cricket season Super Bowl XV Freedom Hall Houston Nutt Super Bowl XVII
