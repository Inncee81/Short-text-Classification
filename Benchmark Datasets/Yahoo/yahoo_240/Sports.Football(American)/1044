should i quit football football season just started and i've been dreading it the whole summer i'm in my junior year and i have a good chance of starting last year i was one of sophomores to dress varsity and i lettered too i just don't want to play anymore it's not fun for me i hate every second of it same with last year i already stuck it out last year and i don't know if i can for more years i have other things in mind to do instead like getting a job and getting ready for wrestling season i'm just scared to do it i don't know what my teammates and coaches will think i don't want to hurt the team or regret it for the rest of my life the only other things i've quit before were baseball and band and i'm sure happy i quit them i have no regrets with those i would not quit i would stick it out and build mental toughness for lessons to be learned later in life quitting now will only lead to quitting bigger issues later stick it out and have the most fun you can it will only make you stronger it is not fun to do all those drills i speak from experience i quit football to get a job i have regretted it ever since i wish i stuck it out One Tree Hill (TV series) Buffalo Bills Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Babe Ruth Cincinnati Bengals Humphrey Bogart West Bromwich Albion F.C.
