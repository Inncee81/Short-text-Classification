cat dilemma regarding condo rules last year i adopted cats i've since bought and moved into a condominium where i am only allowed cats one of them has gone to live with my sister but she is not getting along with my sister's roommates' cat their cat is not willing to accept any new cats my sister upon the advice of one of her friends has put out an ad to find a new owner but she is not comfortable with the idea of giving her to the first person who wants a cat i've suggested my mom taking the cat but both my sister and i know that's not fair to do that to my mom my condo association does not check in on me the way my old landlords had to as i'm now responsible for my own repairs being an owner now i don't know anybody in my new building and as i have odd working hours i doubt i really ever will do you think i could just take the cat back have all of them in my own place and no one would be the wiser i think they may be happier too when they're all together again oh honey i would never give up one of my cats i have three too well four if you count the stray that has essentially become a member of the family and i adore them they have every right to have their own family and friends all together i'm assuming your cats are indoor cats and also if it ever comes up simply smile and say oh no that's my sister's cat she has to stay with me while my sister's on vacation you have every right to keep your family together cats are way cleaner than kids and most husbands Friends Condominium Phoebe Buffay's songs Laura Schlessinger Rent (musical) Cat Kodocha Avenue Q Tag EastEnders Pitaten Donald Trump Marilyn Monroe The Catcher in the Rye The Fairly OddParents Alcoholics Anonymous RuneScape quests C plus plus Pet skunk The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Housing cooperative Kevin and Kell Morphology (linguistics) The Golden Girls Doraemon KaBlam!
