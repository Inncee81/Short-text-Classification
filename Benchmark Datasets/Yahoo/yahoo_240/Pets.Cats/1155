female tabby cat is very territorial loyal help there was a time where all three of us my parents and i left my cat at home and had my grandma come to the house to feed maui our cat while we were gone the cat attacked grandma from behind by grabbing and scratching her leg and biting her leg my grandma got cut pretty bad and had to go to the emergency room today my family and i were at our various jobs and grandma had to come by to tidy up the house because potential buyers of our house were going to come by and look at it my grandma wore long pants and taped her legs to protect herself once again the cat attacked her but this time not from behind my grandma was facing her when maui attacked her luckily she wasn't hurt as bad because of the extra protection maui doesn't act like this with my parents and i but she really doesn't like any strangers she is not the kind of cat that hides she will confront people and growl and hiss any suggestions please help it's true that cats are very territorial they also rely very heavily on their sense of smell does your grandma have any pets of her own perhaps the scent of another animal or even the fact that your grandma doesn't have the communal scent of your home might have made maui feel threatened when cats are afraid they have two basic reactions flight or fight maui might have lashed out at your grandma because she was the source of the unfamiliar scent or simply because she was the nearest person to take her aggression out on it also sounds like you may be in the process of moving home is there a lot of upheaval and packing going on at the moment this could be making maui feel stressed territory is very important to a cat it's their source of food love and shelter if they feel that they may be about to lose all that they can become very aggressive in defending it is she allowed outside at all if she's an indoor only cat would you consider allowing her outside for brief periods either on a harness or under supervision this would help take the focus off your home as the centre of her existence and make her less likely to exhibit territorial behaviour indoors feliway is a produce that containing pheromones that have a calming effect on cats perhaps you could purchase a bottle and spray visitors just before maui next meets them to see if this will help her to be more accepting of them eventually she will become accustomed to them the web sites below offer advice on feline aggression towards humans and moving to a new home with your cat http www sniksnak com cathealth fear html http www allaboutpets org uk web site aap factsheetlist asp mainpettype hope your grandma is okay she must be a real animal lover to have risked being attacked a second time good luck in finding a solution Cat Dog Animal communication Housebreaking Pet skunk Dog training EastEnders Pitaten Ferret Social rule Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fruits Basket Ranma __ characters World Wide Web Maison Ikkoku Domestic rabbit Skunk House Mouse Kakapo SpongeBob SquarePants Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shark Tenshinhan Felis sapiens Natural Selection (computer game) The Death Gate Cycle Fancy rat Insect The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ant Olfaction Hamster Trademark Fiddler on the Roof Aikido Ajax (programming) The Amazing Race Attachment theory Paranoia Agent Socialization Garfield Rocko's Modern Life Friends Mutual fund Cross site scripting Professional wrestling holds Kasparov versus The World One Tree Hill (TV series) Martial art Beavis and Butt-head Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma LiveJournal Gray Wolf Galaxy Angel Narcissism Spanking The Amber Spyglass Plame affair Organic farming Royal Assent Karen Horney FoxTrot Neopets Force (Star Wars) Monster Rancher monsters Tyrannosaurus rex The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Alignment (role-playing games) Emergence The Star Wars Holiday Special Glossary of climbing terms Poker jargon Storytelling Uniform Resource Locator American Black Bear Agriculture The Dalek Invasion of Earth Infantilism Equine conformation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism HTTP cookie Battle of France Oh My Goddess!
