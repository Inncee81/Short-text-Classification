why are cats so fluffy i was reading on the wikipedia cats are from the near east that is to say places such as iran iraq turkey israel lebanon syria and so on they were domesticated years ago from desert wildcats so my point is that it is so warm there that fluffiness is not required for their survival i believe domestic cats are also much more colorful than their wild ancestors so could it be cats are so fluffy to give more pleasure to their human masters thereby increasing their sucess as a species what evolutionary advantage would fluffiness be for a cat actually they are fluffy due to the constant breeding and experimental breeding that humans have done to them for thousands of years you know we have bald cats now too huh Domestication Cat Wild Cat Kakapo Ferret Guinea pig Hybrid Island Fox Palearctic Species Horse Gulf War Lion Camel Domestic rabbit Assyrian people Middle East Feral cat Bengal cat Kurdish people Primate Gray Wolf Tiger Bird migration Cradle of Humanity Biodiversity The Origin of Species Felidae History of the Middle East Arab Kitten Evolution Extinction Domestic sheep Asia Rabbit Rice Global 200 Reproduction Dog show Inception of Darwin's theory Shetland Sheepdog Human skin color Lebanese Civil War Cheetah Tabby cat Leopard History of Islam Feral Lazarus Long Turkish Angora Liger Arab world Livestock Guns, Germs, and Steel Mink Whale Fertile Crescent Religion Daniel Pipes Football World Cup 1990 (qualification) Saddam Hussein Jewish exodus from Arab lands Neolithic Syria War on Terrorism Arab-Israeli conflict Hezbollah The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Maine Coon Domestication of the horse Mediterranean Basin Natufian culture History of the Kurdistan Workers Party Dingo History of Iraq Arab League Black (people) Honeybee Artificial selection Manx (cat) Aurochs Arabian horse Geography of Israel Islamic world Timeline of 20th century Islamic history Lebanon Koala Incirlik Air Base 1948 Arab-Israeli War European Rabbit Demographics of Israel History of Iran Balinese (cat) Land of Israel Domesticated turkey Fauna of Australia Creationism
