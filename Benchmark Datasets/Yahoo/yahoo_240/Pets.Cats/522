is it safe to use a perimiter electronic fence on cats i'd like to allow my cats time outside i have done a little checking on petco about the availability of these electronic yard fence systems but i'd like to hear from someone that uses or has tried this with cats well i havent tried it on my pets seeing as i like to compare myself to what they are feeling how would you enjoy getting a shock to the neck whenever you accidentally stick your foot out of your boundries or the foot leg ear drum or any other body part for that matter i wouldnt suggest getting one cats are fragile and very tempermental and it could distance you from your animals you could be accidentally harming your relationship with them they have emotions just like all of us humans do dont forget try getting a pet collar tags and a regular fence if you want your cats to go outside or one of those little seethrough shed looking things that are attached to your house brain fart ugh my cousin had one whatever it was Dog Cat Horse Garfield Fancy rat PETCO Park John F.
