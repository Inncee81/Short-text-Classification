my new sofa is getting attacked by my cat help i gave advice last week to someone with the same problem now my answer to her is not working i tried sticky tape my suggestion i tried misting water at him i don't want to spray anything on my sofa the tape worked just last year on a new loveseat but he is scratching this one my wonderfull new pillows too he has a scratching post and toy's everything he needs it must be the great fabric i have never had a piece of furniture costing this much before what do you think thanks everyone i am trying to find a slipcover to put on the sofa it is a custom made so the size is not regular i'am having a hard time finding one quickly so i temporalily put king size sheets on it covering it completely he started to scratch the bottom but stopped i have had a scratching post next to the last sofa and it is in the same spot next to this sofa that is his space he loves that tall post he sleeps on the base when not on my bed the material on sofa is soft like chenile that may be appealing to him he does dammage overnight thats common for cats i believe it's hard correcting him at that time and i clipped his nails the day before he started the sofa was there days i had a lot of cats but i can not sit on my sofa unless i remove all that tape then replace it i am going to try the nail covers and the spray thanks again soft paws are a start and will help curb the destruction while you retrain him first off try adding more scratching posts both horizontal and vertical so he has more options of where to scratch put a nice tall sisal post next to your couch where he's been scratching generally the sisal post is more appealing to cats than couch fabric is if possible you can confine him to a different room during the times that you're not home to ensure that he's using the post if you see him scratching the sofa immediately relocate him to a scratching post and scratch the post with your own hands in my experience cats usually like to show you up and scratch the post when you're done they just can't help themselves have treats on hand and praise him extensively when he scratches the post taping aluminium foil to the side of the couch may also dissuade him from scratching there there's also training aids that make a startling sound when your cat goes near them which frightens them away they're fairly expensive though Upholstery Chair Cat Gramophone record Couch M16 (rifle) Seismic retrofit Bed (furniture) Textile manufacturing Laserdisc Strap-on dildo Plastic Floppy disk Ferret Drill bit The Shining (film) Compact disc Thermal power station Brewery Equine conformation Bulk vending Atari 8-bit family Dog training Woodworking Dog Welding Guinea pig Dog agility Volleyball Gas metal arc welding Shaggy dog story CPU design Casting The Time Machine Geodesic dome View camera Planet Waves Aerial (dance move) Carpet Billiards Mars Exploration Rover Rail tracks Bong Cheating in poker Fire fighting Rail transport modelling Fancy rat Housebreaking Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Windows XP Betting (poker) Glossary of climbing terms Heinkel He 112 Dilbert Semiconductor device My Little Pony Gothic rock Remix Bread Public transport Ron and Fez Marching band Whose Line Is It Anyway?
