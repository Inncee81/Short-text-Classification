do animal groomers clip cat claws and will they put those caps on to protect kitty from scratching my couch my cat's claws need to be clipped i'm kind of scared to do it myself i don't want to hurt her she's an indoor cat so she doesn't need sharp claws a groomer might i think they usually just do dogs your vet might do it also if not you can do them yourself if your cat starts to freak out or trys to scratch you you can wrap her up in a bath towel and just pull out one paw at a time to work on if your cat has white nails just trim almost to the pink part ie the quick if you trim into the quick it does hurt the cat not horribly bad but it might give them a bad thing to associate with the nail trimming so just almost to it if your cat has black nails most have white so this shouldn't be an issue you can just take a little off just enough to get that sharp tip off so she wouldn't scratch everything up i've never used those caps on my cat nor have we ever used them at the animal hospital i work at just trimming them regurlarly should stop the problem if not i'd ask your vet about those caps i don't know how they could possibly work if the cat's claws grow back out Cat Nine Inch Nails The Fairly OddParents Road Rovers Garfield Guinea pig Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Brown Bear 2000 Australian Grand Prix Manicure Hamster Pekingese Nail (anatomy) Claw Inspector Gadget Dog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Housebreaking Veterinarian Domestic rabbit Dog training Boxing Fur Equine conformation Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Shen Gong Wu Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Dodge Neon Poker jargon Internal ballistics Tenshinhan RuneScape quests Kodocha Portuguese Water Dog Kasparov versus The World Pitaten Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Colours, standards and guidons Bart Sells His Soul Galaxy Angel Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Professional wrestling match types Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dragon Booster Steven Wright Ron and Fez Cheetah Town Musicians of Bremen Characters of The Sandman New Morning Black Cat (comics) Menstrual cup Knife Ranma __ characters Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
