i had my cat spayed at mos of age why are male cats still trying to mate with her she is months now and has developed a hairless patch in her neck area where male cats try to hold her she is not doing any mating calls now she seems afraid of going out the house my cat went through this too she would be confused and upset by it keep her inside for now and if you know the owners of the males let them know what is happening and ask them to neuter their cats if you don't and they are strays get a cat trap on loan from the county shelter or humane society and trap them and take them in this seemed to go in phases as if my cat had heat cycles even though she didn't it happened about once a year usually in spring after a few weeks it would stop she was properly spayed by a reputable vet that did several of my animals and never got pregnant but for some reason she would still attract males from time to time none of my other cats ever had this problem Cat Dog Feral cat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Kitten Ferret Animal shelter Housebreaking Estrus cycle Castration House Mouse Manx (cat) Lion Sterilization (surgical procedure) Animal euthanasia Panthera hybrid Feral God Emperor of Dune Garfield Menstrual cycle Microchip implant (animal) Chinese calendar Gender Kakapo Spider Pregnancy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pitaten Sexual selection Kangaroo Hair One Piece minor characters Treecat Giant Panda Sphynx (cat) Dairy Sexual reproduction John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Tigon Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Puma Maneki Neko Trapping Rabies Ovulation Animal communication Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Beluga Ice The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Elephant Sento Tsetse fly Rabbit Liger Alaga__sia Orca Motorcycle Pok__mon Live!
