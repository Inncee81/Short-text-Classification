why does my cat get violent when she smells certain things for example usually its things like dirty clothes but it got really bad when my mom used some icyhot earlier that ointment stuff for pain shes just sitting there growling wont let me pet her scratching and biting me whats up with her shes usually not like this at all and yes she ate but she has me really worried i had the same type of experience with my cat only it was vanilla scented hand lotion that sent her over the edge whenever i used this hand lotion she attacked my hands and did not want to be petted when i stopped using the lotion she returned to her normal sweet self the only thing i could figure out was that cats have very sensitive noses and some scents just hit the panic button in their brains i'm sure some scientist can give a full explanation of what's going on but once the offending odor was removed all was okay as far as the icyhot is concerned that is an odor that can stick around for awhile so air out your house and lock up the icyhot and see what happens i hope kitty will settle down Cat Teen Girl Squad Olfaction Skunk Sin City Flatulence Eric Cartman Dog Pet skunk Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood (computer game) Sense Fancy rat Animal communication Ferret Poker jargon Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Odor Ginny Weasley Inspector Gadget Eczema EastEnders Red Dwarf characters American Black Bear Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Pep__ Le Pew Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Psoriasis Burial 2000 Australian Grand Prix Perfume Kim Possible Kakapo Guinea pig Felis sapiens Static Shock Professional wrestling holds Scent hound Teacher's Pet (Disney) Abduction Phenomenon Fast bowling Catscratch Garfield Tobacco smoking Shoe Phoebe Buffay's songs Police dog Aromatherapy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Aerial (dance move) Sluggy Freelance Knots Landing One Piece minor characters FoxTrot W.I.T.C.H.
