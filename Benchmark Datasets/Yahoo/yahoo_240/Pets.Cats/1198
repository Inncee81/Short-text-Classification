please help i just found out that my really sick cat has an upper respiratory problem and the vet is making him stay for the night he has problems breathing and has a high fever the vet says that he has some fluids in his cavity and that made me worried sick i need to know any website that could help me understand this better the vet sounded as if my cat could die please help me find another way to heal my cat if not keep him alive longer ' hi hun i am so sorry that your kitty is so very sick but your best bet all the way around is listen to your vet and anything that he she says that you don't understand ask them to explain speak up you say the vet sounded like your cat may die come right out and ask them what the prognosis the outcome best case scenerio worst case scenerio is for this type of respiratory infection a lot depends on the age of your cat and you didn't say how old he is unfortunately i do not believe that any web site can be of much help to you because they all speak in generalities and you can't do this when you are dealing with a serious medical problem i surely would not trust any web site including the forum right here with the life of my cat my child or my own life your own vet has your cat right there in front of him her and your own vet knows what is going on now i know that this may sound cold but it surely is not meant to be but depending on the age of your cat yrs or younger probably a good chance that he'll pull thru much older and depending on what your vet tells you as to the expected out come of this sometimes as much as it hurts and yes it is going to you just have to let go and have the cat put down i cannot imagine why you would want to extend his life if the poor thing is going to be in constant misery this is very cruel to your kitty yes i know that many many people do this keep them alive under any all circumstances this is for strictly selfish purposes because these people just can't let go and sometimes we just have to as much as we hate to do it but if your vet tells you that this does not look good and that he is not responding to the medications do yourself a favor and i hate to say it this way because i'd be shattered too but cut your losses now and have your vet put him down and get him out of this misery if this infection is really bad all you're going to do by trying to extend his life is continue to have a sick cat perhaps many more trips back to the vet who will most likely die on his own if he is gasping for every breath he is not going to be able to eat or drink and if the infection itself doesn't kill him he will surely die of dehydration and or starvation please don't do this to your kitty in the end all you will be left with is one dead cat and still an enormous vet bill to pay off now it's a totally different thing if your vet says that he is responding well to the medications that his fever is down and you can tell yourself just by looking at him if he appears to be breathing much easier then yes you will want the vet to perhaps keep him in there another day and this would be for reasons to ensure that your kitty is getting the best of care and getting stronger before you bring him back home and ask your vet if this type of infection is infectious contageous and if there is anything special you need to do to your home kitty's bedding etc to prevent him from getting re infected with this and if so you will need to keep him at the vets office for that extra day while you do some serious cleaning with a product that is an anti bacterial anti viral cleaner ask your vet what to use they may carry some type of product there in the office that you can buy right there that you cannot get at any store i'd start with the litter box and go from there and if by chance the litter box is getting a little worn out quite frankly i'd replace it rather than cleaning it if it's in good shape take it to the bath tub put to ths cup of bleach in the litter box and fill the whole thing up with very hot water under normal circumstances you never want to use bleach to clean the litter box cats have very sensitive noses and they hate the smell of bleach also pine sol and citrus cleaners but in this case if you thoroughly rinse it out with hot water then take it outdoors and allow it to sun air dry leave it out there most of the day this will kill any of the bleach smell then follow your vets instructions as far as cleaning the rest of your home and finally before you're ready to bring your kitty back home ask your vet if there is a vaccine to prevent this sounds like pneumonia to me your cat from getting this again if so how soon can he be given this i doubt that the vet will give him the shot while he is still on anti biotics and still recovering from this 'bout but if available do make sure that just as soon as possible you get kitty in there to get this shot i know you don't want him going thru this again and finally on behalf of all of us on this forum we're all pullin' for you and your kitty for the very best out come on this situation and for a speedy recovery for kitty also if this has been an indoor outdoor cat after this please consider keeping him as an inside only cat this is just one example of what can happen to cats who are allowed to go outdoors they catch these type of infections and worse from other cats there is really nothing good out there for a cat to get into except trouble it is a proven fact that indoor only cats live at least twice as long as a cat who is allowed outdoors best of luck for a good outcome and a speedy recovery for your kitty please let us know or at least you can e mail me and let me know how he is doing god bless you for getting kitty to your vet asap Poker jargon Common cold Social rule Guinea
