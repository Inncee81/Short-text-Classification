are my cats messengers sent from on high to help me in my spiritual walk i think so yes i think that cats can be messengers sent from on high to help us on our spiritual path i'm a believer fourteen years we lived in a farmhouse the barn and land was leased to a local farmer one day my son came to me and told me that the cat in the barn who had just had kittens wanted him to have one of her kittens i asked him how do you know his answer she told me that cat is still with us and yes i believe he was sent to to help him by the way he named him merlin and merlin and my son are very close four years ago i was rushing off to work one morning when a kitten no more that a few months old jumped into my car as i opened the car door i couldn't just leave him so i brought him into the house separated him from merlin who was then years old as i didn't think merlin would take too kindly to this kitten and planned on finding out who he belonged to when i got home after knocking on doors later that day and no one in the neighborhood claimed him i was torn about what to do i thought that introducing this kitten to our family would really stress merlin he was getting old and made it known that he didn't like the kitten and hissed at him every chance he got even though we kept them separated i planned on trying to find a home for the kitten a few days later i came home from work and found my son merlin and the kitten playing and merlin wasn't hissing my son told me that he had a long talk with merlin and the kitten apparently the kitten had chosen me my son told me that the kitten's name was arthur and merlin's apprentice they have been great friends ever since and as for arthur he has been a god goddess send in fact he is sitting on my shoulder as i type this just as merlin senses when something is wrong with my son arthur senses when things are wrong with me i firmly believe these two cats are messengers who were sent to help us and for those sketpics out there who are thinking something is wrong with my son he is a wonderfully intelligent and spiritual person who is currently a senior at the university of wisconsin madison majoring in biological anthropology and zoology Shaggy dog story EastEnders RuneScape quests One Tree Hill (TV series) StarCraft: Hybrid The Inside The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Miss Saigon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Milton H.
