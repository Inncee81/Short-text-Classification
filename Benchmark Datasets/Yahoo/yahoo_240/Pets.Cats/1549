car travel with cats i'm planning on moving to the west coast and i'm going to drive from texas between hrs with my two cats i was wondering if it would be better to put them both in a large breed dog carrier or keep them in seperate cat carriers the cat carriers have just enough space for them to stand up lay down turn around but aren't really very big so i feel kind of bad for cramping them but i'm afraid that a dog carrier may be too big they may get tossed around more or something cat carriers will be ok the cats will mostly sleep anyway they won't eat or drink anything i have made it available to them at rest stops and they ignore it i also put shredded newspaper in bottom of cages and could never see any evidence of use they made themselves at home and ate ok at motels except for one i had that liked to hide under the bed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sonic Adventure Cat Andr__s Galarraga Poker jargon Invader Zim Livestock Richard Chase One Tree Hill (TV series) Professional wrestling match types Equine conformation Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 1957 World Series The X-Files (season 1) Sin City Vampire Hansel und Gretel Naval mine Ferret Fiddler on the Roof RuneScape quests Ron Weasley Rest area Steven Wright Pok__mon Live!
