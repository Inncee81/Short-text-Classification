impotant question about cat neutering please answer if you really know i'd like to know what is the earliest a cat can be neutered but i don't want to know the ideal circumstances which i know is at months old i need to find the earliest because i have taken a feral kitten to the vet for an eye problem the kitten will be operated but he has lost an eye already he will go back to being a feral cat in his neighbourhood where i found him so we won't have the chance to catch him again but i don't want him to get into cat fights with one eye he can't afford to lose another eye the vet says he can be neutered later but i am under the impression that in the us you neuter them much earlier at the vet hospital where i work we usually neuter kittens when they weigh four pounds which is at about to months of age however studies have shown that earlier neutering and spaying does no harm and the cats mature normally many animal shelters neuter and spay kittens at the earliest age they allow them to be adopted which is usually at weeks Cat Feral cat Kitten Socialization Ferret Pet skunk Guinea pig Dog Domestic rabbit Garfield Animal shelter Manx (cat) Castration Housebreaking Animal euthanasia Sterilization (surgical procedure) Puma Bob Barker The Joker's Wild Treecat Red Fox Bobcat Through the Looking-Glass Turkish Van Cheetah Great Dane Phoebe Buffay's songs Prostate cancer Peter Singer Czech language Spanish pronouns Game show Asiatic Golden Cat Microchip implant (animal) Domestication Grammatical gender The Price Is Right Bulgarian language The Contender (television series) Kangaroo Feral child Gray Wolf Veterinarian Big Brother UK series 5 Louis Wain Fancy rat Rabbit Breastfeeding A Star is Torn Chuck Jones Polish language Pet store Cuteness European Rabbit SMTV Live Goatse.cx Cats (musical) Introduced species Cowboy Bebop Albatross Wild Cat Sabretooth (comics) Joy Division (band) Abortion debate Kakapo Randomness German grammar Seabird Stuttering Gender Pitaten The Aristocats Delta Goodrem Animal communication Minor Harry Potter Beasts Planetary nebula House Mouse Puss in Boots Azumanga Daioh Octopus Horse Cat Stevens Hamster Siamese (cat) Feral cat colony Southern American English David H.
