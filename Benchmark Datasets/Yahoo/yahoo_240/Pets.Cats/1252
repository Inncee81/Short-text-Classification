something is incredibly wrong with my kitten i have no idea what happened an hour ago my kitten seemed perfectly healthy i went ahead and let the two sleep on their own i took a quick nap for about minutes i went into the kittens room and i find one of them lying on the floor appearingly dead i went to pick it up it couldnt move its body at all it could only meow and it had the most ear defying sad meow i've ever heard there was a big white streak along its belly looked almost like liquid and it had severe diarrhea a couple hours ago i saw it poop and its waste seemed just fine i dont know what to do with him and there are no vets open and there is nowhere for me to take him what should i do hes still alive and im feeding him water through a feeding syringe because he's probably dehydrated i'm just incredibly confused and sad i feel like its my fault this happened to my kitten they were on a perfectly normal diet for that age i had been giving them kitten formula and canned kitten food and water there is only one emegerncy vet thats miles from my house i live in the country and the only vet closest to me is miles and its closed for the night no one is there i am home alone im only and i only have my drivers permit i honestly cant go anywhere and i have no idea what the number is for the emgergency vet i know this may seem cruel but if i have no options i was thinking of killing it and putting it out of its missery i have a in my shed i really dont think i can kill the poor thing but if its my only option i will i cant stand to see this poor thing suffer anymore i have a heating fan and hes bundled up my baby blanket he's keeping warm and drinking water but the diarrhea isnt stopping any time soon i doubt they got in a fight there are no blood marks on the other kitten i only have two these kittens were at first orphans they were dying and abandoned on my doorstep and were severly cold from the rain i can't leave my house i have only began to start driving with my permit and i highly doubt i'd be able to make it on the highway alone i really dont know what to do is it possible that this disease my kitten got is contagious the yellow one is beginning to sneeze the black one hadnt began to sneeze at all and if it did im sure it would've been longer before whatever happened to it i was just about to call my nearest neighbors so they can give me a ride to the emergency vet as i was about to call them the kitten died i did what i could i dont know what happened i am curious though if it is contagious and how it got the disease in a matter of hours thank you for all the help you guys gave me i will defintially remember this for future reference i called my parents and they said they'll be able to take my other kitten to the vet first thing tomorrow i still have to pay for all the shots and everything there goes my new computer processor anyways i'm going to go bury the poor kitten thanks agian for all the help everyone supplied first time i've cried in years oh kay is there any chance that the cat could've eaten something in the room something on the floor or on a table if so here is the number for the aspca animal poison control center and here's the number for the pet poison control hotline if poison definitly isn't the cause then i urge you to call someone for help humane societies have emergency contact numbers in the phone book and they have access to vets or if you have an animal control department in your area then you can call them to ask for help many animal control departments have contacts at the humane society or a vet's office worst case scenerio look up the non emergency number for the police in your town and ask them if your town has any services to help you they may be able to help you contact the animal control the humane society or a local vet call your parents cell phone if you can and ask them what to do call a neighbor and see if they can come over and help or see if they can give you a ride somewhere i took an online pet first aid course and here's the text from our vomiting and diarrhea section it may help you vomiting may be caused by a variety of factors including
