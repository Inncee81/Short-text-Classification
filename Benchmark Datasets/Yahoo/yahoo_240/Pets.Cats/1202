what colour is my cat my hubby insists rio is a silver tabby i say tortoise shell http img imageshack us my php image riopiccx jpg nommo you're so sweet to me xx the vet told me he was a tortoise shell i thought he was a bit dark to be a silver tab he looks a bit greenish black oh well hubby wins so i am slave for a day your cat is definitely a tabby the definition if you will of tortoise shell is a female cat that has a mixture or patches of orange and brown could be solid or tabby markings if rio is a male cat then that alone would disqualify him from being a torti because the color combination of orange and black can only occur in female cats same with calico cats which have orange black and white coat colors if a cat is a torti or calico then you can bet your bottom dollar that the cat is female the reason why the colors orange and black cannot co exist in a male cat is complicated and cannot be explained without giving you a lesson in genetics and how the genetic codes for those two colors are not compatible to produce an offspring with an xy chromosome i e male so take my word on this one either way male or female just by looking at this pic and seeing the lack of orange coat pattern in this kitty plus the presence of white patches on neck and end of toes makes your cat a tabby of sort and not anything like a tortoise shell Tabby cat Tortoiseshell cat Cat Tiger Turkish Van Horse Color blindness Color theory Dog Maine Coon Bengal cat Siamese (cat) Leopard Liger Maneki Neko Lion Iris (anatomy) Species Manx (cat) Cheetah Ferret Panthera hybrid Puma Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Southern Pacific Railroad Mitosis Silver Intersexuality Biology and sexual orientation Tincture (heraldry) White tiger Wallpaper group Colours, standards and guidons Roan (color) Chocolate Black Tortoise Casting Object-oriented programming Parthenogenesis African American Vernacular English Pysanka Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Race Oriental Shorthair Black (people) Emergence Eye color Baldness Sex Gene DNA Vehicle registration plate Human skin color Drill bit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mink Orgasm White (people) Angora (cat) Chlorine Meiosis Traffic sign Fancy rat Hair color Butterfly Discus (fish) Turkish Angora OpenBSD Spider Guinea pig Sulfur Heraldry Sega Dreamcast Felix the Cat Keeshond Rum Photographic film Aluminium Power Rangers Dice Melanin Cell (biology) Y chromosome NTSC Tea Mendelian inheritance Control character Red hair Chimera (genetics) Hamster Tom and Jerry (MGM) Tai shogi HTML element James McNeill Whistler
