why does my kitten suck on my clothes and how can i stop it premature weaning can be a cause of this behaviour often a kitten will transfer it's infantile dependence on it's mother to it's new owner however it is a habit that should gently be discouraged though rare some cats will progress from sucking to eating fabric a condition known as pica it's a case of being cruel to be kind i'm afraid in order to reduce your kitten's attachment to you as mother figure you need to be a little less available if during cuddling sessions the kitten begins suckling on your clothes gently move him aside and walk away it sounds mean but it's the same way the mother cat rejects her kittens when she is weaning them if there are other people in the home get them to help with feeding and grooming duties as this will spread the kitten's loyalties and shift the focus away from you as mother figure set aside time every day for regular play sessions which will help your kitten focus on something other than nursing on your clothes toys that dangle off the end of a wand stick are great because kittens can practice their hunting skills on these hope this helps good luck Cat Breastfeeding Kitten Garfield Domestic rabbit Ferret Kakapo Elephant Comanche Infantilism Hamster Cephalic disorder Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.
