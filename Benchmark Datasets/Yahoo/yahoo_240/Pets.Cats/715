my kitten won't eat and won't do anything but sleep she is about months old and we just got her from the animal shelter yesterday is it something we need to go to the vet about she may have been vaccinated the same day you took her home that is pretty common at shelters if so she may be feeling a little punk from the vaccinations human babies often do too look on the paperwork you got when you adopted her it should tell what vaccinations she has received and when you don't mention if she was spayed recently if she was up to two days before you got her that would also explain lethargy you didn't put any flea products on her did you if you did you need to take her to a vet right away because she may be having a reaction to that it would be a good idea to take her to a vet for an exam anyway to determine her general health in fact many shelters give a coupon for a free vet exam when you adopt a pet Ferret Pet skunk Socialization Kitten Guinea pig Garfield Dog Animal shelter Microchip implant (animal) Veterinarian Animal euthanasia Domestic rabbit Poliomyelitis Autism Vaccine MMR vaccine Flea Externality Kodocha Foot-and-mouth disease Housebreaking Vaccine controversy Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Generation X Singlish House Cliff Richard Measles Malaria Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pretty Good Privacy Hikikomori Microeconomics Pitaten Phoebe Buffay's songs Cancer Anthrax Jon Secada Human papillomavirus Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Dog training Economics Red Hot Chili Peppers Ethics Bond Deluge (mythology) Atomic Kitten Hedgehog Mumps Influenza pandemic Ebola EastEnders Philadelphia Phillies Thimerosal OPV AIDS hypothesis Maison Ikkoku Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Education in Australia Chagas disease Pop punk The Sims Paul Is Dead Homeopathy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stomach cancer Biosecurity Prostate cancer Negima Rat Chocolate Monkeypox Tooth enamel Wyeth Genetically modified food H5N1 Sesame Street Bat Boy Girly Simone Weil Breastfeeding Randomness Weightlessness Squirrel Nutrition HIV Public health Punisher Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban American and British English differences Knots Landing Pet Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Neighbours Sin City Ramones We Didn't Start the Fire
