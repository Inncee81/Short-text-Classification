some time ago i read about a herb which helps animals who suffer from arthritis can anyone remind me which my year old cat is happy and healthy but getting old she sometimes limps but once up and about she is fine she does'nt et about like she used to whih maes me think she is suffering from stiff joints or possibly arthritis and having read about this her i would now like to give it try to help her out anyone know the herb my cat also is and like yours is healthy but she has arthritis everyone told me how good syn flex is for their pets and in the few days i've been giving it to my cat it allready seems to be working i only started on thursday when i came home and found she could barely walk now shes a lot better it contains glucosamine but also has eleven other ingredients its a bit expensive but one bottle will last a pound cat days it says it costs less at some places so shop around the vet gave me cosequin capsules enough for one week its supposed to do the same thing as glucosamine but starts working a bit faster i dont know how people say they sprinkle something on the food and their cat eats it i guess they are lucky if anything is different my cat wont touch it i take a small amount of milk i mix in the syn flex and cosequin from the capsule stir it well so its all mixed then heat it just a little so she will like it suck it up in a eye dropper pull her head back a little by the fur on the back of her neck and slowly squirt the mixture in to the back of her mouth another thing i did i got her a hot water bottle but she was too suspicious of that so she wouldn't go near it so i plugged in the electric heating pad i had and she lays on that all older cats like warmth and its supposed to help pain as well dont give aspirin and especially not tylenol my vet said aspirin can cause stomach ulcers in cats in as little as three days cats often try to hide their pain until it is so obvious they cant hide it any longer i read to percent of cats over age have some arthritis if your cat is not getting about like she used to your probably correct she is suffering pain some use acupuncture for their pets but it is quite expensive and it has to be a vetrinarian acupuncturist not a human one i hope this helps and i hope you enjoy many more years with your cat also if you can get ahold of the august issue of cat fancy magazine it has a lot about aging cats Cat Osteoarthritis Fancy rat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Hamster Bread Equine conformation Dog Chocolate Ferret RuneScape quests Plastic Social rule Happy Tree Friends Coffee Garfield Tea Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Cannabis (drug) Bong Domestic rabbit Diarrhea Carpal tunnel syndrome Gray Wolf Methylsulfonylmethane Piccolo Junior Saga Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma COX-2 inhibitor Aspirin Diving Tuberculosis Adjustable gastric band Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Acupuncture Veganism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Paracetamol Spider Rheumatoid arthritis Little Britain Carburetor Brewery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Limp Bizkit Taboo food and drink Snake Traditional Chinese medicine Oral sex Cheese Reiter's syndrome Mercury Atlas 6 Rabies Internal ballistics Janet Jackson Tiger Stomach cancer Arthritis Migraine Aloe The Suffering (game) Spidey Super Stories Naruto jutsu Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Avenue Q One Piece minor characters Professional wrestling holds Chinchilla Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Kosher foods Customs and etiquette of Japan 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paget's disease of bone Fugu W.I.T.C.H.
