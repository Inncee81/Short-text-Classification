cats months together still dont play together have cats both female months and months have had them together for months total now and theyre tolerant of each other and have been this whole time but they still wont play together its very frustrating because they both are a lot of work in terms of playtime and so i have to play w both of them separately so it actually doubles my playtime i got a second cat so they would play together so that i wouldnt have to spend so much of my day with them and they would have each other yet they just really avoid each other also the older one is not only bigger by age but is also a bigger breed so there is a size difference between them so when they do play its usually the older one kinda smackin around the younger one so the younger one just usually ends up running away which probably doesn't help them in becoming better friends lol anyways lookin for tips on how to get them playing with each other so they arent so dependent on me thanks more info im usually playing with them hours plus a day jessie the older one was here first but only for a month or so so not too long and its actually not the older one disliking the younger one cause every so often the older one will jump the younger one like she wants to play but its really the younger one avoids the older one mostly due to size difference i believe older one is almost twice the younger ones size im starting to think that they dont have any chance of getting along til they are both full size maybe instead of having any of them sleep with you have a designated spot for both of them to sleep so they won't be dependent on you put them with a cat bed or someing ina certain room with their cat box food water toys ect and close your door have them sleep together Sleep Cat Capercaillie RuneScape quests Mattress Hamster Housebreaking Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Daylight saving time Undergrads Fancy rat Spot the Dog Shaggy dog story Social rule Passenger car Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Andr__s Galarraga Chinese calendar Poker jargon Fertility awareness Friends Kitchen The Cure Japanese tea ceremony Big Brother UK series 6 Dog 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Smoking Room Aerial (dance move) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Equine conformation Invader Zim Characters in the Smurfs Betting (poker) Textile manufacturing Drill bit Kitten Garfield Lion Dog agility Ferret Natural Selection (computer game) Apollo 8 Pok__mon Live! 2005 World Series The Catcher in the Rye Pure Pwnage Maine Coon Diazepam Platypus Minor Harry Potter Beasts Planet Waves Seabird Big Brother (USA TV series) Thermal power station Twin Pitaten Harmonica Tigon EastEnders Big Brother (Australian TV series) Atomic Kitten Baseball Dairy Rainbow Islands The Amber Spyglass Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Tai shogi Unreal Glossary of partner dance terms CPU cache Norway national football team Theodore Roosevelt Contract bridge The Big Sleep Red Squirrel 2channel Glossary of American football Dieting The Empty Child Flea Game programming Bed (furniture) Kodocha Pet skunk Burglary Roxette Non-native pronunciations of English Panthera hybrid Goofy 2000 Australian Grand Prix $ale of the Century Schr__dinger's cat Spandau Prison The Diary of Anne Frank (film) Little Britain The Strangerhood
