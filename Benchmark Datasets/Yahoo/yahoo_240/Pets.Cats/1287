cat rescuers what would you do we have a stray it took days of feeding before he would let me pet him i have treated him with cestex for tapeworm and advantage for other worms he is now incredibly affectionate finally putting on some weight and is respectful of our other two cats he has eye discharge and a cough so when we took him to the vet's today for a booster they said to wait two weeks to see if the respiratory infection clears before vaccinating if it doesn't he may have herpes virus or calicivirus and is not a good longterm pet he did test negative for felv and fiv though my question is even if he does have one of the viruses would you euthanize or try to give him as much help as you can my other cat's are vaccinated and spayed he still needs a neuter and booster if he improves i am in a financial position to treat him long term i disagree with the vet for the first time ever about euthanization that's all thank you everyone for your kind words the little fellow will be named lucky the calicivirus and herpes virus are not a death sentence for your little rescue the herpes virus will always be in the cat's system it is when the cat is stressed is when it will resurface with symptons of runny eyes sneezing and runny nose this can be treated calicivirus can be prevented with regular vaccines the school of thought now is vaccinate every three years not yearly it sounds as if this little guy has the will to survive and fight if you are in a position to provide the veterinary care and vaccines he's gonna need go for it and give him another chance he'll probably turn out to be your biggest fan Pet skunk Common cold Herpes simplex virus Domestic rabbit Rabies Pneumonia Antiviral drug Guinea pig Dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Influenza Measles Feral cat Tuberculosis Herpes zoster Fancy rat Ferret Computer virus Virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Ebola Influenza pandemic AIDS H5N1 Hepatitis B Pertussis Cytomegalovirus Rabbit Smallpox Chronic fatigue syndrome Hepatitis HIV vaccine Avian influenza Garfield Dog training Anthrax Medicine Hepatitis C Allergy HIV test Poliomyelitis Transmission (medicine) Hay fever Marburg virus Urinary incontinence Human papillomavirus Animal shelter Heartworm Feline immunodeficiency virus Socialization Pathogen HIV Feline leukemia virus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Asthma Red Dwarf characters Childbirth Sterilization (surgical procedure) Lung cancer Vaccine Hamster Castration Infectious mononucleosis Genetically modified food Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Rabbits in Australia Monkeypox Lassa fever Duesberg hypothesis Theory of conduct Diarrhea The Ashlee Simpson Show Rubella Autism Kitten Progress of the SARS outbreak Prostate cancer Multiple sclerosis Medical analysis of circumcision Diseases of the honeybee Extreme Programming Drowning Silver Gonorrhoea Chickenpox Guillain-Barr__ syndrome Streptococcus pneumoniae Colorectal cancer Insulin Spanish flu Louis Pasteur West Nile virus Vaccination Henipavirus Otitis media
