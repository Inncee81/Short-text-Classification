my cat pees i have two cats and they are both about year and months old i got them both neutered about months back coz they were peeing all over the place and were getting nasty on each other altho they are both males although one of them has stopped peeing immediately after i got them neutered the other finds any opportunity to go anywhere he wants however he only pees and doesn't poo he has peed in my room and in all kinds of places i am growing sick and tired of this can someone plz explain how i can stop this from happening i am at my wits end note he tends to do it when the litter box gets a bit dirty let me guess it's the older one that's still peeing all over right that's called spraying dear and most unaltered adult male cats do it to mark their territory he's not sick he's not being spiteful and it probably won't matter how clean you keep the litterbox he's being a normal male cat and doing what his instincts are telling him to do since you got them neutered he may eventually stop this behavior but some never do once they start that's why it is imperative to get males altered before they are months old it's much easier to prevent this behavior than to stop it after it's started your best bet is to keep that litterbox pristine to make it more appealing for him and you must thoroughly remove all traces of his urine from your home shampoo everything and saturate it with white vinegar or a product made for this purpose available at any pet store to remove any lingering odors he will continue to go to the same places if he can smell where they are if you must keep the doors closed to rooms he favors after cleaning if there's one spot he prefers that you can't keep him out of place his food dish there cats won't pee where they eat you can try a product called indoor no for cats it's available at any pet store also it's supposed to discourage them from doing this sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't depends how determined your cat is citrus scented cleaners or citrus fruit peelings will sometimes deter cats they usually hate the smell just spread them around where he likes to mark try all these suggestions until one works at least one should if all else fails ask your vet for advice if nothing works with this cat you may have to look for a nice home in the country where there isn't much traffic or give him up to a rescue group or no kill shelter i hope it doesn't come to that and it probably won't usually if you keep after it you can find a way to stop it if you get any more cats in the future get them fixed by their month birthday at the latest and you won't have this problem good luck Domestic rabbit Hamster Pet skunk Housebreaking Fancy rat Ferret Dog Guinea pig Animal communication Ron and Fez Sin City Ranma __ characters Skunk Pitaten Ron Weasley Theory of conduct Social rule Feral cat Friends Shaggy dog story Japanese tea ceremony Toilet humour Kitten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Japanese toilet Poker jargon Jam (TV series) Toxoplasmosis The Price Is Right Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Betting (poker) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Perfume Cannabis cultivation The Inside Rocko's Modern Life Kakapo Sento Kim Possible Urine Jackass: The Movie Fire fighting Calvin and Hobbes Kodocha The Dalek Invasion of Earth Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Extreme Programming The Critic W.I.T.C.H.
