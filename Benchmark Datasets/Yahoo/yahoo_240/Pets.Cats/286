my kitty cat has eww worms oh my god i just got this very anorexic kitten about days ago from some people who obviously didn't care too much about her she is nearly skin and bones but her energy has increased significantly in the time that i've had her because she's eating like a pig now but i saw her napping in my window sill and i went to pet her and saw a little maggot like thing on her tail i lifted her tail and saw a long white flat worm crawling out of her anus i'm so disgusted is there any chance that i could end up with parasites from the past days that i've had her here i bathed her in dawn dish detergent because i couldn't find the kitten shampoo i'm about to vomit just thinking about this is she too young to be de wormed i don't know her age but the previous owners said she was just weened the mother cat couldn't feed her anymore because she was too thin herself she's about inches tall and long how much are shots and how old should she be for them help you can't contract the worms from your cat however the only way to get rid of all the worms is to take her to the vet find out what kind of worms they are and have her de wormed the vet can give her something age appropriate so don't worry your kitty will feel much better and will start to gain weight after she is wormed Garfield Cat Kitten Ferret Fancy rat Anorexia nervosa Guinea pig Animal Ranma __ characters Taboo food and drink Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape quests Snake Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Equine conformation Myxobolus cerebralis Sonic the Hedgehog Domestic rabbit Philip J.
