new kitten scared me and my family just bought a siamese kitten today it seems very scared and whenever it hears a loud noise it hisses or when you put your hand near it it hisses it sat in my lap a couple of times but it's still scared to death my stupid dad brought in the dog a while ago and now the kitten is like growling she's scared to death i feel bad what can i do to make her more comfortable or will it just take time this is all new for your kitty and it will take time for her to adjust it was a bad idea on bring in the dog so soon this will only keep your kitty in fear perhaps you can take your kitty in another room where the dog isn't and spend some time with her in quite time she needs to be loved and learn to trust you the calmer and more loving you are with her will only help to bring her out of the uncertainty good luck and thanks for asking Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Shaggy dog story Kim Possible Ranma __ characters Badly Drawn Kitties Red Scare Avenue Q Eric Cartman Wonderland (McFly album) Dog training Maison Ikkoku Futurama (TV series - season 5) Butters Stotch Atomic Kitten Milton H.
