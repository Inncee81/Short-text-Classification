why won't my kitten pee in the litter pan we just found a stray kitten about a week ago i recently caught her peeing on a towel that was on the floor kids she will poop in the litter pan but i don't understand why she won't pee in it she does have an appointment with the vet and i am going to try different litter i believe she is almost months any suggestions your kitten used to have the entire outdoors as its litter pan just give it some time to adjust to the new rules and restrictions trying a new litter as well as getting a second litter pan are excellent ideas confining the kitten to a small room for awhile may help condition it to use the litter pan it may have also just been one isolated case there is also the chance that your kitten has a bladder infection so have your vet check it out Ferret Guinea pig Pet skunk Fancy rat Cat Domestic rabbit Feral cat Toilet humour Prostate cancer Manx (cat) Garfield Socialization Housebreaking Dog Fire fighting Big Brother UK series 5 Urine Tick Hamster RuneScape quests Menstrual cup Tobacco smoking Education in Japan Daylight saving time Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong House of Leaves She Loves You Cat litter Urination The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Kasparov versus The World StarCraft: Hybrid Smoking ban AIDS Madonna (entertainer) Sailing Marburg virus Carnivorous plant Species Chinchilla Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pan Am Flight 103 Docking Eric Bischoff Equine conformation Chess terminology Albatross National parks of England and Wales Tag Cartridge (firearms) Traumatic brain injury Drag racing Traumatic incident reduction Betting (poker) Lacrosse Ice hockey Poker jargon Sento Penis Gray Wolf Kakapo Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sharon Tate Dialysis Swimming Treecat Blackjack Paul Reubens Ron and Fez HIV Feral Toxoplasmosis Through the Looking-Glass Japanese toilet First aid Wok Weighing scale Enceladus (moon) San Francisco 49ers 28 Days Later Cheetah Quarantine Timeline of AIDS Labrador Retriever Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Ben Johnson (athlete) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Eventing Planetary nebula Multiple sclerosis Volleyball Magical objects in Harry Potter Bear History of South Africa in the apartheid era Rabies Thermoregulation Lung cancer
