my best friend is really getting on my nerves please help it's important okay so my best friend and i have been best friends for over years we know everything about each other and that could come as a problem if i ever wanted to leave i know her and she would spread every secret i had to the entire world she gets really annoying and immature at times when it is not appropriate she tries to hurt my feelings saying she is so much prettier than me and she can do everything better etc after years of her saying this i believed it and now i see what she was really trying to do break down my self esteem i have been depressed for about and starting just this summer i am finally happy again every time i talk with her she tries to tell me these things and that's why i hate talking with her we also make plans and then an hour before she is suppose to pick me up she's like oh didn't i tell you i already went yesterday she hasn't come to my birthday parties ever she's sick the sad part is that she is really the best best i know i am in the cat section i forgot to change the things i've had friends like that before and it took me a long time to realize what they were really up to good for you for realizing that this isn't a healthy relationship and reaching out for help you don't say how old you are so it's a little difficult to give really age specific advice when it comes to friendships things change a lot between the ages of and after that we're supposedly mature adults and it's basically the same my suggestions are as follows talk to her about it she might not really realize that she's doing these things and you may really do her a favor by bringing this to her attention phrase it by saying something like you know insert her name here the other day my feelings were really hurt when you did whatever she did or said or didn't do and i don't think that you intended to hurt my feelings but i feel like i need to bring it up from there hopefully she'll say something like oh no i never meant to hurt your feelings i'm sorry or something like that ask her to please be aware of when she is saying these things and whenever she does something that hurts you let her know your feelings are important and they deserve to be respected what should raise red flags is if she starts making excuses for why she did that thing starts telling you that you're a wimp or something like that for feeling that way or other berating such as that real friends help build you up they don't push you down if that doesn't work then i suggest spending less time with her don't allow yourself to be her punching bag don't just stay her friend because she knows your secrets if you feel the need to confide in someone i suggest that you look to other friends who you know won't hurt you a person in the clergy or even a parent or sibling you deserve to feel safe hopefully you don't feel so alone in this i had a friend who i would have run in front of a bus for who i loved dearly but who i ended up needing to break off the friendship with because her morals and priorities were completely out of sync with mine i finally realized that her calling me names was not what a real friendship was about and after a whole lot of tears and sadness i decided that i would not and could not subject myself to that kind of friend i mourn the loss of her friendship but i feel much stronger within myself because i know i did what was right for me good luck and i hope everything works out Pitaten Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Theory of conduct Kodocha EastEnders Knots Landing Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga God Emperor of Dune Big Brother (USA TV series) Ty Cobb The Smoking Room Narcissism Cindy Sheehan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada The Emancipation of Mimi Pok__mon Live!
