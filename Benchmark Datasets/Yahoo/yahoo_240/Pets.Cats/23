cat pregnancy my cat is pregant we dont know how far along can anybody give me some tips on whatt to look for and i need tips for during the birthing of the kittens what to do supplys this was a stray we picked up about months ago we didnt want to spay neuter whatever you do to a female cat because we didnt know wether or not she was going to stick around so do make a big deal hey there you may notice her nipples are pink and large when she is close she will start to lactate and you can find that out by squeezing a little on her nipple to see if any milk comes out keep checking her private area for mucus or blood or a bubble this will indicate that she is in labour i hope you have made her a nesting bed for when she gives birth you need to have it in a quiet room away from noise and any other cats because when she is in labour and there are loud noises or people or other cats she will delay the birth and it isn't good for mother or babies another way to tell when she is labour she will become very restless getting up and sitting down alot and cleaning her private area when she is labour just pat her and keep her calm if this is her first litter she will be nervous and not really know what is going on and she could bite or hiss at you so be careful and just reassure her now after you have been a bubble coming and it has popped that was the water breaking there will be a baby coming any moment you will be her face all pushed up like she is pushing you know it is coming and you will see waves in her tummy when you see a bubble it will be a baby now the first could take a little while to come out but don't stress but when it is out and its still in the sac and she doesn't seem to be doing anything you need to intervene and rip the bag open you will need to be wearing gloves and you will need scissors to cut the cord once it is out and the placenta is out you can let her eat it but never to many as she will vomit and have the runs now dont panic if it takes half an hour to an hour in between babies my cat held her last one for up to hours Cat Breastfeeding Childbirth Guinea pig Obstetrics Kitten Pet skunk EastEnders Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Feral cat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nipple Shaggy dog story Dog Elephant Infant RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Pregnancy Bong Toilet humour Hamster Social rule Professional wrestling holds Escape from New York Platypus Atomic Kitten Mammary gland The Amber Spyglass Kodocha Tasmanian Devil Happy Tree Friends Coeliac disease Blood Simple Menstrual cup Breech birth Fecal incontinence Characters in Bleach series Manx (cat) Ferret Fertility awareness Premature birth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Insomnia Ron and Fez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drawn Together Sleep Placenta Blood (computer game) Humphrey Bogart Cephalic disorder Doug Characters in the Smurfs Trailer Park Boys Giant Panda Blue Whale Jackass: The Movie Baldrick Minor Harry Potter Beasts Poker jargon Fire fighting Fetus Characters of Lost Comanche The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Vomiting Surveillance Condom Aerial (dance move) Toxoplasmosis Kakapo First aid Nile crocodile Spina bifida Tenshinhan Menstrual cycle The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Violin The Legend of Zelda series enemies House Mouse Gramophone record Textile manufacturing Domestic goat Internal ballistics Sharon Tate The Caves of Androzani Socialization Dialysis Umbilical cord
