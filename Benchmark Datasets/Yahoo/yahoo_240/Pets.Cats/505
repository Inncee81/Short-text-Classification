pack of dogs attacks child with kitten kitten killed i was the child still feel guilty horrified advice when i was yrs ago i was out with my dogs in the road we lived in the country in rural north carolina there were no leash laws my neighbor had a new kitten i picked it up was cuddling it the next thing i knew i was surrounded by my dogs other neighborhood dogs the other dogs started biting me i tried to run but they closed in around me and started jumping up i tried covering the kitten and then tried holding her up high which made the dogs act even crazier i was really scared it was awful the dogs got the kitten and i ran i heard the cries of the kitten i was in shock the dogs fell on the kitten with the excitement of wild animals i was so freaked out that my own dogs were part of it it was over in a flash i went over saw the kitten with its intestines pulled out i never told anyone because i was afraid i'd get in trouble for picking up the cat i wanted a cat loved them i'm having trouble getting over this experience i think somehow i could have prevented it or kept trying to get the cat to safety or shouted for help or i shouldn't have picked up a cat that wasn't mine or should have thought that dogs might do something like this at the time i'd had no experience with cats it was a dog neighborhood dogs everywhere i thought my dogs were good dogs who wouldn't hurt anybody plus i couldn't fight the other dogs i couldn't control any of them and i let the kitten go it really is a lingering trauma answering you i've rescued placed dogs since i've been on my own adopted a shelter cat taken in stray cats adopted cats unwanted by neighbors my first cat had her litter of right by my pillow on the floor bed was on floor of attic nook in college i found homes for all of them got one back when mom was run over by a car at age now i feed a group of cats all related near my work i also feed water a group of dogs in the same area most of them related i'm not the main one taking care of them people like to watch when i do this sometimes take photos dogs seem to follow me everywhere i go people remark on this i'm thinking strongly about this 'cuz a few days ago one of the cats was casually following me after i fed them i told him i was going to feed the dogs they usually stay farther away but were closer surprised us jumped out chased my friend cat tried to come to me i picked him up dogs returned cat got away trauma revisited what a horrible traumatic experience for a child i'm so sorry this happened to you i am an animal lover and that memory would be hard for me to deal with too keep in mind that you were a small child and unable to manage several dogs also your dogs were dogs they have prey drive and did what was instinctual for them you did nothing wrong you picked up a kitten to pet it something any child would do and were unaware of the danger that you and the kitten were in you need to forgive yourself i recommend getting some counseling to work through the trauma you experienced by keeping it to yourself it continues to haunt you i also think that doing something to help animals like volunteer at an animal shelter may help you you can help raise kittens and walk dogs since you need to forgive dogs and get over what happened to the kitten by helping other animals you may be able to put the past in the past good luck my thoughts are with you Shaggy dog story Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests EastEnders Dog Dog training Ferret Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sin City Milton H.
