why does my cat think she is a dog i love my one year old cat dearly but she's driving me nuts she has stolen all my hairties also known as bobbles scrunchies etc and hidden them around the house she steals them out of my handbag despite the fact that i keep it closed she is clearly smarter than she lets on but then she starts acting like a demented dog she will the bring a bobble to me in her mouth and drop it nearby then jump up at me until i throw it for her if i don't throw it she starts yowling she then chases the bobble and brings it back in her mouth she doesn't care whether i am asleep or awake she'll still leap on me with the damn things surely as a cat she should have more self respect no offence to dogs or doglovers i just find that cats are more independent generally speaking how do i get her to stop being such a numpty i've tried everything indulging her telling her off keeping her out of the bedroom at night nothing works olgy don't get me wrong i love the kitty to bits she is my baby it's just the way she runs around screeching at am leaping on my head to get me to throw something for her to chase when i have to be yup for work hours later she's actually bvery clever she just acts dumb when it suits her typical kitty skiowl i do play with her constantly it's just the am thing you know my cat behaves this way too one year olds can still be very playful as they are just maturing from teenage hood some cats are playful by nature and some mellow down after they get older leave some hairties out so she can learn to play with them herself believe me cats like to play with themselves quite often try ignoring her or close your door to your bedroom this worked for me my cat developed this game where he would come at my bed at two am and try to pounce on my feet under the blanket hide your hand bag somewhere out of her reach up high in a cabinet etc but the best solution is to just let her be i think she's cute and that makes her unique if it makes you annoyed soooooooooooo much then don't give her anything she wants attention throwing it to make her stop etc eventually she'll get the point and will probably go somewhere and sleep or she'll playwith them herself have fun with her Garfield The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Sin City Poker jargon The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Cat Pitaten Theory of conduct The Subtle Knife Aerial (dance move) Social rule Dilbert Blood (computer game) Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Fairly OddParents Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tag Ranma __ characters Little Britain Dog Azumanga Daioh Diving Charles Peace Saved by the Bell Ren and Stimpy Jam (TV series) One Piece minor characters Dog training RuneScape quests Breath of Fire III Blankets (graphic novel) Joke Damn Yankees Dial M for Murder Milton H.
