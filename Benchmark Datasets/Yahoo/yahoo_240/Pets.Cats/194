cat eating and drinking i adopted a cat and the problem is that she would eat anything but cat food and drink anything but water i though maybe she does not like the kind i got for her so i bought different kinds in dry food and in canned ones but she wont eat them all she wants is whatever we eat if she sees us eating for example salad she will start crying and wont shut up until i give her some she would literally eat anything that i am eating and she only eats it when i am eating it like if you give her apple she not gonna eat it but if i am eating an apple she tries to get it from me or cries for it and in drinking she store my coffee basically came over and put her mouth in the cup and spoiled it so she drinks juice pepsi or coffee but not water so any suggestion will be appriciated i am going nuts over this since i already spend about hundred and fifty dollars over buying different kinds of food for her to see if she likes them and she just wont eat pet food period the cat's got you trained pretend you're eating canned cat food will she have it then Soft drink Friends Food preservation French cuisine Breakfast Hamster Coffee Ramen Pepsi-Cola Fancy rat German cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Coca-Cola The Smoking Room Food Caffeine Alcoholic beverage Cat Cuisine of Malaysia Chocolate Salad Fingers Sauerkraut Tooth enamel Potato Hypoglycemia Cha chaan teng Shaggy dog story Homer Simpson Hangover McDonald's Ron Weasley Jewish cuisine Tea Apple Tomato Healthy eating Bread Roman eating and drinking Wine Tlingit Halitosis Milk Raw food diet Tooth Kosher foods Taboo food and drink Book of Isaiah Beverage can stove Characters of The Sandman New Coke The Coca-Cola Company Domestic rabbit Rocko's Modern Life Squidward Tentacles Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of Laos Genericized trademark Chili con carne RuneScape quests One Piece minor characters Tofu Meal Fasting Korean cuisine Urinary incontinence Mormonism and Judaism Veganism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cuisine of Turkey Japanese tea ceremony Fruit Oyster Garfield Carrot Cuisine of Argentina Doraemon Coconut Ferret Cuisine of Thailand FoxTrot Phoebe Buffay's songs Lemon Organic food Carnivore Dim sum ITunes Music Store Word of Wisdom Dieting Bubble tea 7-Eleven Acorn Swedish cuisine Dairy Pitaten Food storage Customs and etiquette of Japan Jackass: The Movie
