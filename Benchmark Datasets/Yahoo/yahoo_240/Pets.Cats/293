male cats and spraying i'm making an appointment for my cat on tuesday to go in to the vet i usually have females cats so i know all about their behaviour when they go into heat but i have no idea how male cats are when they are horny my sister lives in the same building as me and has a female cat so i think that's why he has been spraying lately but i was just wondering is it normal for male cats to have blood mixed in with the spray i'm thinking no because i've had cats my whole life and have never experienced this i'm wondering if this is something i should be scared about i've been worried ever since last night when i saw the blood i'm thinking he might have a bladder infection too it definitely smells like cat spray i know that smell too well but a lot of the times when he is licking himself there he'll start growling so he must be in pain too again i am making an appointment for him but right now i'm just scared for him until tuesday monday is the civic holiday so i can't call then yes it probably is a urinary tract infection but only your vet can tell you for sure i had a male cat who was prone to these infections and he would let me know by going to the bathroom in places other than normal like in the bath tub and there would be tinges of blood in his urine he would also spray keep an eye on him until tuesday when you call the vet if he starts acting weird or gets worse you may have to find an emergency vet and take him sooner make sure you tell the vet when you call that he has blood so they will get you in right away good luck Urinary incontinence Cat Urinary tract infection Urine Urinary system Prostate cancer Kidney Garfield Penis Intersex surgery Cystoscopy Vulvovaginal health Kidney stone Schistosomiasis Ferret Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Pet skunk Fancy rat Urethra Prostatitis Diabetic neuropathy Menstrual cycle Dutch Schultz Medical analysis of circumcision Pepper spray Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Avenue Q American lobster Urination Sauna Fire fighting Sin City Pneumonia First aid Common cold Childbirth Endometriosis Thermoregulation Traumatic brain injury Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Milton H.
