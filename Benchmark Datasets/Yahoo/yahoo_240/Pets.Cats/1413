what do you think i should do with this feral kitten first of all let me tell you the situation where i live not in the us there are no shelters etc and there are many feral cats in the streets these cats are care for by the people who feed them and everything but of course there is no medical care for them and there are many accidents now to the point i found a feral kitten recently whose eye was hanging out it lived in a nice neighbourhood with low traffic with other cats and kittens eating at the tavernas there i took it to the vet who operated the eye and neutered him there is no question of keeping the kitten as i have already and i am not allowed or able to take more in a flat so there are options take the kitten back to his old neighbourhood with his family at the place which he knows supposing he will remember my husband says to do that since i wouldn't have taken it away if it was healthy take it to a friend's garden in another neighbourhood she feeds all the cats who come to her garden however she doesn't keep them in the house if the kitty strays away he will be found in an unknown area all alone which option is better if he stays at my friend's garden though he will have good food and no danger but will he stay there will the other cats accept it the ideal of course would be for you to find someone to adopt this unfortunate kitten and keep it indoors of the two choices i would choose giving the kitten to the friend with a garden hopefully the kitten would stay in the garden where it is fed and be safe it will have to fit in to the group of cats your friend is already feeding but if you return it to the place you found it it will have to re establish itself there too because it has been gone and it will smell different when it returns thank you for going to the trouble and expense of helping a little stray cat Feral cat Socialization Kitten Feral Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Garfield Ferret Hamster Social rule Mid-levels Manx (cat) Animal euthanasia RuneScape quests Health insurance Terri Schiavo Pitaten Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Treecat Kodocha Feral cat colony Animal shelter Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Taboo food and drink Stomach cancer Girly Breastfeeding Honeybee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kakapo Goldfish Spider Air-raid shelter Azumanga Daioh Poker jargon Albatross Through the Looking-Glass Internet phenomenon Domestication Physical attractiveness Flat tax Animal communication Divorce Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Badly Drawn Kitties Stray Cats Organic farming Hello Kitty Happy Tree Friends Little Britain Prostate cancer Transformer Gas metal arc welding Toxoplasmosis Alcoholics Anonymous Jumpstart 3rd Grade Veterinarian Rabbit Chocolate Livestock 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cats (musical) Sam and Fuzzy Friends Japanese tea ceremony Infantilism Big Brother UK series 5 Paintball Anorexia nervosa Microchip implant (animal) Food and Drug Administration Raw food diet Arguments for and against drug prohibition Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hunting Veganism Dairy Tick Rescue group Swimming pool Koi Airport Seabird Trailer Park Boys Ultimate Spider-Man Sailing Brian Griffin Fugu Prisoner's dilemma Discus (fish) Gray Wolf House of M Paradox
