my normally placid fixed cat has started attacking the neighbours cat they actually have two cats they are both female and fixed but he really rips into this one cat he has never done this before or displayed behaviour like this nothing has really changed in the house to cause him stress and now i have to lock him inside for fear that he will kill this other cat help anyone please i realyl dont want to have to put him down usually this happens when there are tomcats in the neighborhood especially when there are tomcats plus a female in heat the air is full of pheromones and even neutered and spayed cats are affected they get all riled up and full of fight even though they probably have no idea why their own hormone producing organs are gone but their brains are still stimulated by the scent of sex in the air why it stimulates one cat to tear into another cat in particular is a mystery but cats have definite likes and dislikes in other cats at the vet hospital where i work the mellow office cat gets along with every animal that comes in whether they're cats or dogs or guinea pigs except for one cat who was with us for a couple of months while we were finding her a new home she was a perfectly nice inoffensive cat but he absolutely hated her he would go into her cage and pee and poop in her bed which in the cat world is declaring nuclear war none of us could figure out why he hated her so much i think things will settle down around your neighborhood in fairly soon the female who is probably the root cause of the problem will go out of heat and hopefully the toms will go away and everyone can relax again Cat Dog Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Ferret Pet skunk Feral cat Richard Chase House Mouse Socialization Ranma __ characters Fancy rat Estrus cycle Housebreaking Kitten Fruits Basket Garfield Animal communication Hamster Pitaten The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Red Dwarf characters Azumanga Daioh Neighbours Rabies EastEnders Chronic fatigue syndrome RuneScape quests Biology and sexual orientation Animal Liberation Front Castration Stuttering Sexual differentiation Kim Possible Jam (TV series) Liger Orgasm The Fairly OddParents Color Livestock Menstrual cycle Perfume Avenue Q Semen Puberty Child sexuality Thermoregulation Domestication F-14 Tomcat Feral Animal rights Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Grammatical gender Olfaction Phoebe Buffay's songs Sexual attraction Cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chocolate Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Black comedy Randomness Mickey Mouse Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Urinary incontinence Ed, Edd n Eddy Microeconomics Kimi Finster Transsexuality Animal testing Nuclear warfare Signal transduction Shaggy dog story Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Coprophagia Species Philosophy of language Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sinfest Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Greyhound Gender role SpongeBob SquarePants Paranoia Agent American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Animated television series Borderline personality disorder Animal Farm Days of our Lives Invader Zim Spider About a Boy American Black Bear Trapping General Dynamics F-111 Elephant Cats (musical) Insomnia
