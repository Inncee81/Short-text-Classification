help for newborn orphaned kittens ok i found a newborn kitten in the road by my parked car and there was no mom anywhere but there was a trail of blood and birthing fluids leading to my shed where i found another kitten and still no mom so i moved the kitten from the road to the shed and wiated in my house and the mom never came back and they were still wet they hadn't even been cleaned yet so i took them in and did what most websights say to do all of the websights said to stimulate them to go potty however they don't poop when i stimulate them too they do pee but they just started going on their own but it's pretty runny is that ok they are eating good also all the websights said that there poop should be a mustard yellow but it is a dark brown is that ok i heard greyish and white are really bad but i didn't hear anything about dark brown finally i am sure they didn't get their mom's first milk what are their chances fro survival will they have long term health problems it is wonderful that you have taken on such a daunting task i have posted a link on newborn kitten care and they likely have worms having gotten it from their mother the mother gets the worms from the critters she catches but that is a vet issue right now keeping them hydrated is a key concern in the link i posted there is a section on orphans which you definitely have the special milk that is sold in pet stores will be adequate just a doll baby bottle would probably be the right size again there are hints in the link i provided as far as survival you are giving them a far better chance than they would do otherwise consider that a step towards victory Breastfeeding Kitten Childbirth Infant Pet skunk Cat Guinea pig Milk Cytomegalovirus Domestic rabbit Chocolate Dairy Toilet humour Kodocha Ferret Pitaten Phoebe Buffay's songs Hamster Premature birth Kyle Broflovski Garfield Urinary incontinence Futurama (TV series - season 2) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Marshall Mathers LP Hypoglycemia Married... with Children Knots Landing Eric Cartman Ron and Fez Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insulin Kashrut Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Terri Schiavo Internet phenomenon The Fairly OddParents Kimi Finster EastEnders Blood (computer game) In vitro fertilisation Joke Joy Division (band) Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Elephant Prostate cancer Shit Herpes simplex virus Tag Snake Jackass: The Movie Social rule Chicago Cubs Adoption Red Hot Chili Peppers Grandview, U.S.A.
