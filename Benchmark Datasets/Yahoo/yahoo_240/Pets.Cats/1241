overweight cat hello my cat is very overweight it weighs about pounds and it only gets like a half a cup of dry food twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon it's been eating like this for about a year and a half now and hasn't lost any weight what should i do my cat is about years old by the way the previous owner of this cat overfed it big time just about every time i'm in the kitchen my cat is begging me for food why does he do this why hasn't he lost any weight oops mistake it only gets a cup of dry food not a half as you've found out you can't get a cat to lose weight eating dry food unless you put them on starvation rations no one is happy but if you feed species appropriate food your cat can eat a reasonable amount and still lose weight species appropriate food for carnivores is meat protein and fat low or no carbs you will find this to varying degrees in good quality canned foods you can go the raw feeding route which really is the best way to go but it does require some research i decided to stick with canned food so that's what i'll suggest the average cat can eat oz per day one can and still lose weight poppy once weighed pounds too this is what i did to get her to lose weight and it worked wonders but remember it takes time cats should only lose about pound per month so don't expect dramatic results Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Milk Dieting Dairy Anorexia nervosa Food Cat Guinea pig Brown Bear Domestic rabbit Raw food diet Vitamin C Hypoglycemia Tyrannosaurus rex Adjustable gastric band Garfield Insulin Vermicompost Salmon Dodo Peanut Chocolate Carnivore Breastfeeding Hamster South Beach diet Veganism Tofu Binge eating disorder Hamburger Low-carbohydrate diet Tasmanian Devil Coeliac disease Food preservation Cheese Ferret Livestock Famine Protein-energy malnutrition Crohn's disease Dog Puberty Taboo food and drink Terri Schiavo Healthy eating Sperm Whale Orca Homer Simpson Fancy rat Blue Whale Pet skunk Herring Albatross Bread Kosher foods Fasting Protein Jewish cuisine Ham Mountain Gorilla Kitten Sewage treatment Domestic goat Ostrich Hot dog Sea Otter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tocopherol Kashrut Chicken Ramen Little Britain Gastric bypass surgery Whaling Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor Harry Potter Beasts Little Shop of Horrors Tooth Falconry Acorn Weight training Sugar beet American Alligator Gold standard Stomach cancer Apple
