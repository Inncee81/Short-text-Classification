there was krautrock band who released an album with what appeared to be a clothes peg on a washing line what was the band and title of the album forget my babel below ha ha it's amon duul ii's 'vive la trance' i don't know how the heck i overlooked the best known krautrock band in the world i was checking all my obscure lp's and it never dawned on me that it was this http tinyurl com j pig man is a wicked song i've owned this album in various forms over the years and i never really noticed the clothes line peg thing before it's actually my favorite album by them too well that's not entirely true i think the last time i took a close look at what was going on on the cover was back in or something there was a band from the 's who many people mistook for being a krautrock band as their music had a distinct krautrock sound they were called 'far out' only problem they're not from germany they're from japan they also had a self titled album with peg holding a glove on a clothes line http rateyourmusic com release album far out far out to me krautrock was a genre that started in the late 's and continued throughout the 's 's and 's german bands playing 'industrial rock' 'ambient' or 'post punk' would not be considered 'krautrock' in most circles at the moment i'm stumped what's funny is the fact that i probably own the album as i am a huge collector of all things krautrock Krautrock Music genre German rock Neu!
