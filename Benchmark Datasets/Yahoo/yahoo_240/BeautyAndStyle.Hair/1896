how to create a haairstyle any ideas you know how you see celebs these days with bee hives can anyone give me pointers on how to create this look myself i do not want an amy winehouse beehive but i think that the slightly heightened beehive look for hair can look classy thanks the keys are backcombing and hairspray begin by making sure that super curly or wavy tresses are flat ironed or blow dried straight although curls and waves will create major height and volume they will also have a tendency to be more easily damaged avoid backcombing hair that has any natural texture without first straightening to prevent excessive tangling if hair is flat ironed before it is backcombed be sure that the strands are cool before teasing begin by using a soft boar s head brush or similar natural bristle brush to make sure that all knots and tangles are completely removed from all strands before backcombing never backcomb strands that are not first detangled completely using a rattail or metal comb or teasing brush part off a section of hair from the rest of the strands clip the remaining hair out of the way using your hands in conjunction with a comb or brush gather a small section of hair approximately inches in thickness hold the ends of the new section straight up and out from the scalp with one hand in essence you will be backcombing your strands in the opposite direction from its natural growth pattern with the other hand run the comb down the length of the hair from the end towards the base of the scalp in short sharp and uniform strokes spray newly teased sections with a firm hold hairspray repeat after each new section is created once the first section is completely teased pick up the next section of hair and repeat the process until all of the desired sections of hair have been completely backcombed select a firm hairspray l'oreal elnett is a cheap celebrity favourite to completely spray all of the teased hair when the backcombing is complete now take the brush and smooth the top hair back over the backcombing it creates a sort of balloon on the top of your head gather the loose ends into a neat chignon or roll held in place with hairgrips voila since teased hair can sometimes look rough around the edges consider using a shine serum apply the shine serum or spray of choice to the palms of your hands rub the product into the palms and then lightly glide over the top of the teased style to add instant shimmer and shine and remove any roughness good luck honey Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Drill bit Haircut Hair Knife Violin Pottery Diseases of the honeybee Woodworking Drawing Brush Gas metal arc welding Textile manufacturing terminology Honey Leaf Wood Equine conformation Fast bowling Langstroth hive Beehive (beekeeping) Japanese tea ceremony Honeybee Soldering Top-bar hive Carding Knitting Tofu Aerial (dance move) Worker bee Glass Glossary of climbing terms Pubic hair Shampoo Three Stooges Dog Professional wrestling throws Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Typewriter Canoe Upholstery Baldness Dundas Square Kitesurfing Scapula Tea Carnivorous plant Katana Curling Tire Coffee Gesture Guinea pig Strap-on dildo Mouse (computing) Fire fighting Bong Psoriasis Keeshond Christmas tree Guqin Kimono Thermal power station Volleyball Cross-country skiing Welding Heavy metal music Diving Brewery Backstroke Sonic Advance 3 Transformer Laws of cricket Swimming Poker jargon Jazz Manicure Coir Plane (tool) Bread Timpani Africanized bee Hair conditioner Cast iron Double bass Gong Son Gohan Pachypodium bicolor Seismic retrofit
