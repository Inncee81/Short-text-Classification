i have over bleached my hair advice i have over bleached my hair and some of it its breaking i need to back to a healthy standard soon i've heard many ways to help it milk oil shampoo and conditioner but not sure if any will work any personal experiences will be helpful did you use something and it helped or use something and it got worse let me know asap thanks professional advice from hairdressers is extremely appreciated thanks any particular products shampoo's conditioners oils etc are appreciated cutting your hair is a good start depending on the length and how short you dare go will determine how much you cut off i would suggest at least one inch if you can go up to three inches even better this will get all that dry damaged stuff off dead hair will not improve sufficiently and keeps what healthy hair you have from being able to grow and thicken for hair apy try the three minuet miracle by aussie it is sold in single doses or by the bottle you can use as suggested or what i like to do is shampoo and then cake on the the miracle then wear a shower cap and let the heat of the shower allow the hair cuticle to open and absorb the nutrition wear the cap for the three min or even five then when you rinse use cold water this will close the hair cuticle allowing the moisture to stay inside do this or times a week when you style if possible let your hair air dry not using a blowdryer if you can keep from it or look into getting one with a cool air setting my only other suggestion is to get mane and tail shampoo and conditioner if you don't see it in the shampoo aisle look in the pet department i know it's for horses but it is widely used by people and smells great if your hair is bleached chances are this is not your natural color unless you are determined to be blonde look into taking your hair back to it's natural color this way you won't have to keep applying a damaging color to your hair work on getting your hair healthy and once it has grown out enough to tell what your roots are visit a hair dresser to see about dying the bleached hair back to the same color as your roots i say go to a stylist because trying to match a box color is hard and if your hair is really damaged and really light you could end up with disasterous results best of luck to you Hair coloring Shampoo Tofu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Sento Psoriasis Explosive material Polyethylene terephthalate Wood Milk Breastfeeding Bong Dairy Stomach cancer Sewage treatment Dog Hemp Radiation therapy Coffee Knife Guinea pig Horse Fire fighting Comanche Water Plastic Leather Leaf Textile manufacturing Menstrual cup Prostate cancer Drill bit Manicure Grunge music Hydrogen peroxide Air conditioning Nutrition Baldness treatments Equine conformation Thermal power station Ranma __ characters Carbon dioxide Insulin Mario Solar power E85 Orchidaceae Kimono Desert Folic acid Fancy rat Aloe Puberty Tire Tea Food preservation Comet The Apprentice 2 The Ashlee Simpson Show Dog agility Menstrual cycle Professional wrestling match types Climate of the United Kingdom Hair color Domestic rabbit Tank Chernobyl accident Upholstery Paint Rice Spark plug Organic food Severe weather terminology (United States) White phosphorus incendiary Nuclear explosion Tocopherol Bread Baldness Fecal incontinence Social rule Skinhead
