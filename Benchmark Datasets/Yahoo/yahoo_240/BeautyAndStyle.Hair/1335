how do you cut your own hair layers how do you cut your hair and cut your own layers i just trimmed my own hair using the technique to brush it all forward and trim the ends and it worked out great does anyone know how to cut your own layers i just cut my own hair using the technique to comb it all forward while wet and slowly work from one end to the other it worked wondefully its a great saver so i dont have to go to the salon so much i have very long hair that grows very quickly and great for inbetween significant cuts i was wondering if anyone knows how to cut their own layers i will still be going to the salon to upkeep them but id love to know how to cut them inbetween salon visits any help is greatly appreciated well if you're not afraid to try it here's a way i've tried and it worked out fine i'm a hairdresser but if you follow what i say it should turn out fine too i've done it a few times now on my own hair the best suggestion i can give you is for you to buy one of those combs that hairdressers use with the measurements marked along the back of the comb unless your hair is much longer than the length of the comb this may not work for you but if you have a good eye for length this could still work so once you decide how long you want your top layer to be you take a x square inch section of your hair at the top of your head to start with or to use for a guideline or a couple of centimetres square and hold the comb with the measurements beside it and decide your length be sure to hold each section of hair at a degree angle out from your head to be sure of it's length this is how to measure it once you decide what length you want to cut that layer the rest is just the same cut all your hair on your head the same length by sectioning it all off into one square inch each time you plan to make the cut so if for instance you decided to cut all the hair on your head to inches then that is the length you measure off in each section and then just clip it at the inch mark or what ever length you desire it to be if the length you desire is longer than the comb you can likely guess how much beyond the length of the comb you would like to cut it and then just do the same to the rest of your hair once you have completed cutting all your hair to the same length from your scalp to the end then you could lean forward and comb all your hair forward towards your face and if any hairs are standing out too long just trim them down to match the rest of your hair you may have to blend it some at the fromt corners of your hair to ensure there are no long pieces sticking out i hope you find this helpful maybe it sounds a bit too complicated but it really isn't it may take you a little while but always make sure you are holding your hair out from your head at a degree angle when you are measuring and cutting it it would likely be best if you could get someone to help you with it in the back as it can be a bit difficult to see what you are doing yourself to the back of your hair unless you are good with mirrors you may have no trouble it also can be a bit trying on the arms especially if you are not used to using them above your head well here's wishing you the best of luck with your hair but this is a good trick to layer your own hair or to get someone to help you with it good luck if you already have layers and you are wanting to trim it for a healthier look and feel the same method could be applied and just trim about an inch or a couple of centimetres to give it a fresh look hope this is helpful Textile manufacturing Knife Internal ballistics Drill bit Equine conformation Drawing Screw Pottery Hair Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling throws Swingout Poker jargon Stairway Cross-country skiing Woodworking Baldness Violin Kodocha Mattress Professional wrestling holds Casting Table tennis Double bass CPU cache Diamond cut Billiards Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Katana Radar 2000 Australian Grand Prix Opportunity rover Strap-on dildo Wood Sailing Breastfeeding Vegeta Archery Wood carving Diving Aerial (dance move) Depilation Bong Apollo Command/Service Module Suplex Password Skinny Puppy Welding Kurt Angle Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Lawn mower Upholstery Joker (comics) Professional wrestling slang Gramophone record Shaggy dog story Skateboarding trick Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Heinkel He 100 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Colours, standards and guidons Comanche Glossary of American football Charmed Parade (military) Eyepiece Leaf Pitaten Taikyoku shogi Floppy disk Mouse (computing) MP3 Tour de France Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February M16 (rifle) Pachypodium bicolor RuneScape quests Terminal ballistics Batting (cricket) Manicure W.I.T.C.H.
