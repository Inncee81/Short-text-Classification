hair breakage i've recently been having a lot of hair breakage at first i thought my hair was starting to thin out but i noticed a ton of really short wispy hairs at the top of my head i figure that it must be from sun damage chlorine damage and also damage from highlights that i got done a while ago i was just wondering what i can do to try and keep my hair from ever doing this again what sort of vitamins should i take should i start using a wide tooth comb what are some really good hair products i should use any suggestions are appreciated if you swim a lot and get chlorine damage try protecting your hair before you go just soaking your hair in non chlorinated water can help if your hair is already full of water it can stop it soaking in so much chlorine or cover it with conditioner or oil coconut oil or olive oil this can be a bit gross though it does help protect your hair make sure you rinse out all the chlorine in the shower after when you're out in the sun try to keep your hair covered with a bandana or hat remeber your scalp can get sunburnt if you don't protect it if you don't want to do this treat your hair to an intensive conditioning treatment after a lot of sun exposure again coconut oil or olive oil make excellent and cheap conditioning treatments apply it to your hair overnight or a few hours before you wash brushing your hair can be the cause of a lot of breakage don't use a brush with plastic balls on the ends of the bristles as they are the worst apparently a wide tooth wooden comb is good to prevent both breakage and static comb your hair out in sections from the bottom up be careful when combing wet hair it's far more prone to breakage then and never brush wet hair if you wear your hair up a lot think about the elastics or clips you use metal barrettes and the elastics with metal joins can rub on your hair causing breakage you can get elastics without the metal bits products such as shampoo and conditioners differ for everyone what is good for my hair won't necessarily be good for your hair try to avoid harsh shampoos also 'repairing' or 'anti breakage' conditioners cannot actually repair your hair instead they coat your hairs with usually silicone related substances this can help protect your hair but can also prevent your hair getting the moisture it needs and can leave a build up that makes your hair lank and greasy feeling if you do buy a conditioner like this use a clarifying shampoo occasionally to remove this Drill bit Acne Corrosion Brush Textile manufacturing Plastic Violin Tooth Baldness Dandruff Seismic retrofit Brewery Sento Diving suit Gramophone record Glasses Mattress Ultraviolet Welding Solar power Baldness treatments Hair conditioner Hyperthermia Hydrochloric acid Sewage treatment Manicure Menstrual cup M60 machine gun Dental brace Leather Equine conformation Explosive material Tire Hair First aid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sauna Wood Motor oil Textile manufacturing terminology Fecal incontinence Radiation therapy Skin Pottery Knife Breastfeeding Headgear Ozone depletion Swimming Bong Haloalkane Thermal power station Bulk vending Friction Soldering Naval mine Screw Ozone hole Human skin color Dog Chlorine Hat Dental caries Water purification Aloe Upholstery Manual transmission Coir Woodworking Diamond Rice Asthma Tattoo Anorexia nervosa Use of poison gas in World War I Scar Nunchaku Cancer Carbon nanotube Methamphetamine Hard disk Glass Printed circuit board Bicycle brake systems 2000 Australian Grand Prix Eczema Solar cell Strap-on dildo Keeshond
