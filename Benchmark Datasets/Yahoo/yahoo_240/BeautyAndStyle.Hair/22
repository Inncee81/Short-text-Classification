i'm bleaching my hair right now and i've gone past the minutes it says not to exceed but my hair is still at the orange golden stage is it safe to leave it on for a bit longer i'm using live colour xxl in ice blonde help thanks thanks guys killers blog really helped i waited a little longer and i've just washed it out it seems okay now just going to go and put the conditioner on then dry it fingers crossed it turns out okay ok please listen carefully what you have put on your hair is bleach i have trained in all aspects of hairdressing and chemistry for years and i know the schwarzkopf brand very well both otc and professional products what is happened is that either you have tried to bleach on top of a colourant on your hair is your hair currently coloured if so you have made a big mistake as bleach cannot lift out all that colour hence why people should use a colour remover first like colorfix by robert craig or schwarzkopf igora phantom before they use bleach colour remover removes the artficial pigment that was put in the hair by a colourant leaving your hair as a blank canvas for the bleach if this is your situation then you may never get past the gingery stage i am afraid so you will either have to use a toner where you are at and be a strawberry blonde or colour it dark again if your hair was natural when you applied the bleach then it may be that your hair will need or rounds of bleach very dark hair takes more bleachouts than naturally lighter hair the only reason they give you guidelines of when to remove the bleach is because once it has been mixed with the peroxide developer then it starts to decompose but it should last for mins after it has been mixed it will not harm your hair to leave it on longer but neither will it help as the lightening effect will have stopped due to it decomposing you will need to purchase another kit and re bleach now you are at the orange ginger stage then you don't have far to go to get to pale yellow hair goes through stages of lightening from brown to red orange ginger to yellow and finally pale yellow so you will only need to lift more stages to get to pale yellow do you have your toner ready for afterwards if not then you will need one you can purchase born blonde toners to tone to platinum here http www clairolprofessional com dispensary swatches bb swatches html choose precious platinum or here http www allcures com shared product asp id txt born blonde Blond Hair color Hair coloring Hydrogen peroxide Textile manufacturing Color theory Color Red hair Human skin color Double Dragon Bleach Snooker Horse Ammonia The Ashlee Simpson Show Tattoo Link (Legend of Zelda) Shampoo Tooth enamel Tour de France Cosmetics Acne Water purification Ultramarine Hair Drag racing Organic peroxide Michael Jackson Bob and George Dragon Booster E number Reservoir Dogs Tofu Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Acetone peroxide Traffic light Arsenal F.C.
