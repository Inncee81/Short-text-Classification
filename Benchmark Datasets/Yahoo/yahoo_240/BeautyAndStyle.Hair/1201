help bad bad bad haircut i got my hair cut yesterday about shoulder lenght i wanted it really layered and have bangs so i could sweep them off to the side like so many girls have these days my hair's naturally wavy but i love to straighten it so when i got home i tried to straighten it it turned out just frightening i looked like a punk rocker person which is not at all my style my hair is layered way too short and my bangs are also way too short any ideas on ways to style my hair so i don't look scary thanks the main thing to remember about a new style and cut is that you'll probably need to change your regular routine from the old cut you had experiment with it and when in doubt pull it back and go but for a little while it's not going to look like what you planned anyway if you chose your haircut from a book the hairdresser will cut it shorter so that it will grow into that style and actually keep it longer the unfortunate thing is that when you first get it it doesn't look anything like it's supposed to do you use a straightening iron or a chemical straightener either way you might want to let it go natural for a while until the style grows in about a week or two then gradually see what sort of styling you can do with it Haircut Emo fashion Aerial (dance move) Ranma __ characters Mullet (haircut) EastEnders Equine conformation Incarnations of Immortality Skinhead Spice Girls Theory of conduct Depilation Hey Jude Cliff Richard The Lovely Bones Sin City Journey (band) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Superman III Empire Burlesque Characters in the Smurfs The Emancipation of Mimi Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha The Star Wars Holiday Special Kender One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Pok__mon Live!
