scene hair ok so i wasn't aware of it before but apparently i have a scene haircut and style its very choppy with short layers i tease it like no other and i go through more hairspray and wax than you could imagine anyways i have blonde hair and want to do something different to it as i was looking through pics of hair color cuts style on ya how i discovered my scene hair i saw a few things that i liked but of course i would tweak them to be my own anyways one of the most common was for girls to have like jet black hair with a random slice or two of pale blonde now i already have blonde hair on top at least the bottom is a fairly rich but dark brown and i wouldn't trade it for the world so what if i put a chunk or two of black or very dark brown through it and then color the bottom of it to match i'm sure its been done before and was hoping to see a picture of it somewhere but i've had no luck anybody have any other similar pics or maybe even any ideas oh and i'm not going for the scene look i just thought that would give people something to relate my hair to i also have what you might call scene hair lol my hair is naturally black though i would do dark red and dark brown slices for you black is aweful to get out of blonde hair Hair Hair color Emo fashion Haircut Trigun Human skin color Patricia Ford Race of Jesus Characters in the Smurfs Red hair Bread Death rock fashion Melanin Color Black (people) Netsuke Bonus Stage Kasparov versus The World Marilyn Monroe Horse The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Fist of the North Star Charlie Brown Turquoise Reservoir Dogs Doug Blonde on Blonde The Inside Staining (biology) Hot dog Paul Is Dead Afrocentrism Dragon Booster Kodocha Kenny McCormick Drawing Black White (people) Pysanka Mummy The Rasmus Cheating in poker Cowboy Bebop Yu-Gi-Oh!
