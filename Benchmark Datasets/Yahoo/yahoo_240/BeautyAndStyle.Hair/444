help hair colouring disaster hi everyone i have just dyed my natural brown hair black permanent dumb idea i kno cos its too harsh against my skin tone is there any way i can tone the colour down without bleaching it i have read all the answers you have gotten and some of them were suppose to be from stylist and each and everyone of them are incorrect advice sorry to bare the bad news i can give yoiu several possilbe solutions to lighten your hair maybe one to two shades lighter this is if you haven't washed your hair after you dyed which is probably not the case however here is what you can do you will need to take a bleach activator that is not the bleach itself it is the activator that you mix with bleach clariol has one you can find it at a sally's beauty supply store the formula is to take oz of the activator and mix oz of warm water apply to wet hair and run it through your hair for no more than minutes then rinse well and shampoo hair as normal however you will need to re condition your hair you can do this with one of two products from sallys ic by fantasia or infusuim both are leave in conditioner you will use this everyday for at least a week this formula is use to lift off the color just a little bit like i said one to two shades at the most you can add some highlites to the hair with three levels lighter than the dark color you have they will off set the darkness and make it only appear lighten up you can use this formula to try to lift color off your hair however color will not remove or change color but if the formula is use correctly it will lift one to two shades first you have to determine how dark you are the level of darkness levels come in the range of one being the darkest of dark and the level being the lightest lets say you are a level and that is pretty dark to most ppl they see that level as black you can possible find your level on the box of color any way lets say you are a level and you want to be a level this is how you determine what color to use p resent color is level d esire color is level you mutiply by the d x you will get the sum you then subtract p the level you use is you would then find a color with the level mix with vol h o hydrogene peroxide equal parts and apply for the time specfied the trick is as long as the sum isn't higher than a you can do it without bleaching now you will not become the level from a level you probably only make it to a level but that is better than being dark than shampoo and re condition your hair warning do not buy a stripper of color it will strip your hair to the colors of orange from black and i assure you will have more of a mess than being black this i promise if you have any more questions you can email me i will be glad to help you with your color problems dont touch your hair stop where you are at break out the piggy bank and go to a professional who knows what they are doing yes it is gonna cost you some green backs but better to be happy then be on here asking again what to do i have given sound advice as to what you can do however the choice is solely up to you good luck Color Shampoo Hydrogen peroxide Color theory Blond Human skin color Hydrogen Microeconomics Technicolor Inflation Leather CPU cache Drawing Chemoluminescence Textile manufacturing Horse Organic peroxide Vector (spatial) Upholstery Digital photography Tattoo Economics Trigonometric function Violin Theory of conduct Lighting Vinegar Halitosis Dither Fischer Random Chess Polar Bear Keeshond Breastfeeding Ammonia $ale of the Century Color space Dishwasher Dandruff Sento Kimono Diamond enhancement Labor theory of value GED Black (people) Expert system Jennifer Lopez Color blindness Meriones unguiculatus Physical paradox Water (molecule) Quaternion G__del's incompleteness theorem Psoriasis Route assignment Sodium hypochlorite Casting Leaf RGB color model Amstrad CPC Urinary incontinence Phoebe Buffay's songs Transformation problem Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hair Decibel Atari 8-bit family Gramophone record Laserdisc Hard water C-41 process Snooker Labour economics Software testing Social rule Pump It Up Probability Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cigar Primary color Bicycle lighting Spot the Dog Halting problem Soap bubble Light-emitting diode Coffee Rebreather Volleyball
