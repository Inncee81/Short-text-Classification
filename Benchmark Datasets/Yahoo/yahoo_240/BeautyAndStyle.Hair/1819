asking black women i am just very curious please explain to me more about weaves braids etc are weaves actually sewn into the scalp i've heard of weaves being sewn in doesn't that hurt i would think it hurts like hell i have some good friends who happen to be black but i am too embarassed to ask don't want to sound stupid also can you wash weaves like you would your own hair also does it cost a lot of money to get them put in and how long should they be kept on i'm just bored and wondering ok to answer your questions not just black women get weaves anyone can get a weave and there are many different types of techniques to put the hair extensions in the most traditional way is to get a weave sewn in this means that your real hair is braided in to cornrows or some kind of braid pattern and then the hair extensions are sewn into those braids so it doesn't really hurt but what does hurt is getting your real hair braided into cornrows but you can tell your stylist that they are pulling your hair too tight yes you must wash your hair when you have a weave and it is like washing your own hair and it does cost a lot of money and usually you get what you pay for so if you pay not so much then you will have a not so good weave the part that costs the most is the actual hair that you buy to be put in human hair cost a lot of money and the better the quality the higher the cost depending on what techniques is used to put the extensions in a weave can last anywhere from one month to six months go to a reputable stylist and ask them i hope this helps here's a link that has pics of a weave being put in Cornrows Haircut Textile manufacturing terminology Kimono Baldness Comanche Social rule Hair Upholstery Dreadlocks Afro textured hair Milton H.
