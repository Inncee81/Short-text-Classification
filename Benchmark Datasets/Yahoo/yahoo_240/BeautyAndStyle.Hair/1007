hair dye misfortune please help any hairdressers here my friend dyed my hair dark brown today just to change the colour because it had faded from when i dyed it a sort of brown ashy aurburn colour then after she put on blonde streaks but they have come out ginger and it blothches and spots and are really messy s i dont know what to do because im thinking of buying another darkish brown hair colour and just shoving that on and hope it will cover it all and just leave it brown and mabye lighter brown where the streaks are i cant really afford profesional sort out right now any one help what can i do ps my hair is quite dry and in an elastic frizz sort of condition after today so i would hate to make it worse by bleaching etc s x thankyou okay big mess on your hands i of course say go to a professional ideally this is a hard fix blotches and spots are not easy to fix even for a professional however i hear you about so if you must do it at home try all of these steps they are all important gather all the supplies prior to coloring do a reconditioning treatment with both protein and moisture rinse out very well mist hair with spray leave in detangler dry hair well using thick conditioner in the foils isolate the lighter pieces that you like just apply the conditioner to the hair like it is bleach in the foil it is only holding it in place for you using a semi perm color that is one shade lighter and warmer than you want your base color apply sparingly to the blotches and spots now over all the hair not in the foil apply your semi perm formula of desired shade color over the the places you placed the other color too keep a very good eye on this even though you did a reconditioning it can grab very quickly it is best to start in the nape area to insure if you are slow at applying it will be darker there not in the front you have to be fast but not miss any places after min check a strand in the middle section from root to end by scraping off the color and holding against a white piece of paper to see true color check every at different places until either the processing time is up or you are at the desired level this could be min or up to this sounds like a lot of steps but if you skip any your hair is going to look like poo you will still have streaks and a darker base like what you originally wanted do not bleach entire head it doesn't make sense why cover the streaks that you like best of luck Wood Hair color Hair coloring Textile manufacturing Human skin color Hair Horse Pottery Red hair Leather Drawing Dog Upholstery Color theory Haircut Staining (biology) Tag Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Color Blond Supply and demand The Ashlee Simpson Show Gramophone record Textile manufacturing terminology Dragon Booster Fischer Random Chess Hemp Mushroom hunting Quicksort Equine conformation Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers Guinea pig Microeconomics New York Giants Violin Cigar Aerial (dance move) White (people) Paintball Casting Coffee Shampoo Welding Debugging Shaggy dog story Skin Skateboarding trick Pysanka Chess strategy and tactics Fecal incontinence Dye Paint Knife Fencing C-41 process Fire extinguisher Turquoise Kodocha Wheat Stereoscopy Billiards Hair conditioner Leopard Cat coat genetics Laser hair removal Wok Diamond enhancement Johnny Appleseed Professional wrestling holds Mach kernel Inflation Joker (comics) Diving suit Eye Poker jargon Bassoon Collision detection Oscilloscope Anti-aircraft warfare The Amazing Race Kimono Undergarment Fancy rat Professional wrestling slang Psoriasis Handloading Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 CPU cache Salad Fingers
