hair extensions i am thinking of getting hair extensions before i do it though i was wondering if anybody can tell me how its done and would you be able to tell it extensions by just looking at it if you had never met me before also how much would it cost sorry i have asked a lot of q's but even if you can only answer a few it will help thanks x i live in the uk there are a lot of different ways to do hair extensions there are ones that are braided into your hair they tend to stay the best there are once that snap onto your hair it is pretty expensive it can range anywhere from depending on where you live and who is doing it it is a really long process if you're hair isn't super short and if the person is a true expert in extensions you can't tell a difference extensions are high maintenance so be ready for the up keep Violin Milton H.
