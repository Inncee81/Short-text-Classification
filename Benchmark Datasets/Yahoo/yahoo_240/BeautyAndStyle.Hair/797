how can i convince my aunt to let me dye my hair ok i've wanted dye my hair for about a year now but im afraid to ask my aunt who i live with because i know she'll say no she says she doesn't want me to damage my hair well my mom said if my aunts ok with it she'd help me since neither me or my aunt would no what to do so how can i convince my aunt to let me just getting highlights wouldn't make me any happier because i wanted darken my hair dark brown or black and then get a lighter color on the tips green red blonde one of those colors i'm not sure why your mom isn't making that choice over your aunt but that's none of my business so i'd suggest you and your mom sit down to talk with her about it maybe if you earned the money to have it done professionally and saved for it you've already waited a year and being able to put the money aside can show how committed you are she'd feel better about it with a professional colour there is less room for error so that might help her feel more comfortable about it home dye jobs often go wrong and you should know a lot about your skin tone so you dont' choose a colour that doesn't suit you not everyone can wear copper orange for example and not everyone can wear black or blonde etc especially if you're going lighter you're in for a lot of damage no matter which way you do it not to mention if you're a dark haired girl going very light you'll have to have it touched up every couple of weeks which can get damaging and expensive there is a lot of upkeep with coloured hair often ask your aunt why she feels this way ask her for details once you know more about her worries you can start to come up with reasons why her concerns may not be totally valid this not only shows commitment but maturity too good luck Pitaten Characters in the Smurfs The Inside Blond Hair color Dragon Booster The Ashlee Simpson Show Human skin color Blood on the Tracks Color theory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Red hair Color Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kimono Marilyn Monroe Friends Time Out of Mind Great Teacher Onizuka Hair coloring My Little Pony Kender Snooker Phoebe Halliwell TLC Androgen insensitivity syndrome Avenue Q Bob and George W.I.T.C.H.
