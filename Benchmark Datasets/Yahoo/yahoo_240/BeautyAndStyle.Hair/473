stripping hair help hi eveyone i am stripping my hair tonight from black to a dirty blonde i am a very poor student so doing it myself any tips anything would be brilliant are you mad you cannot strip your hair from black to dirty blonde if you are using colour remover to remove artficial pigment from your hair then it will end up orange first then you need to bleach and tone if you have colour on your hair currently and just try to bleach it out then you will never get further than the orange stage hence why you need to first use colour remover if your hair is natural then you can just bleach but everybodys hair goes through the same stages whilst bleaching from brown to red then orange ginger to yellow to finally pale yellow it is impossible to bleach to dirty blonde dirty blonde is obtained by bleaching to the yellow stage and then toning for dirty blonde you will need seperate toners as dirty blonde is a mix of dark blonde and lightest blonde i would suggest using miss clairol n dark neutral blonde on some areas and then dn starlit blonde on other areas http www clairolprofessional com dispensary swatches mc swatches html you will find this difficult though to seperate off the different areas unless you are experienced which it sounds like you're not so i would leave it alone and go to a professional Hair color Blond Hair coloring Color theory Color Red hair E number Snooker Human skin color White (people) Cheetah Leopard Ultramarine Orange (colour) Flag of India CMYK color model Bonus Stage Hair Cat coat genetics Eric Cartman The Ashlee Simpson Show Bob and George Blonde on Blonde Color blindness Death rock fashion Black (people) Guinea pig Cosmetics Race of Jesus Political colour Flag of South Africa Pigment Queen of Wands Tour de France Reservoir Dogs Black tea Hermione Granger Michael Jackson Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Violin Hydrogen peroxide Menstrual cup Colonial mentality Kingdom Hearts II Skinhead Staining (biology) Double Dragon Iris (anatomy) Beret Diamond AFI 100 Years series Primary color Tincture (heraldry) Heavy metal music Laser hair removal The Inside Diamond simulant Black Retina Doug Joker (comics) Link (Legend of Zelda) Meriones unguiculatus Color space World Wide Web Fencing Textile manufacturing My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Sodium hypochlorite Stereoscopy Cello Pubic hair Keeshond Camouflage Kenny McCormick Donovan Rainbow Brite I, the Jury Tibetan people Crayola Perfect Dark Kender Discus (fish) Madonna (entertainer) Tooth enamel Nickname Emo fashion Depilation Monofloral honey Jani Lane Chlorine BG James Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Boy's surface Polar Bear Mummy Synaesthesia Color printing
