what are some great hairstyles for a round face i'm an asian girl very short and chubby i have a round face and i was wondering if any of you know great hairstyles or haircuts for my face shape i would stay away from the short hair cuts because those tend to make faces look chunkier and rounder so go for a long hair cut and just to give it some volume try layers you can't loose not to mention long hair cuts have more options for hair styles hope it helps Haircut Hair Emo fashion Leaf Mohawk hairstyle Beard Mullet (haircut) Mr. T Dreadlocks Kodocha Barber Heavy metal fashion Skinhead Depilation Knife Greco-Buddhist art Poker jargon Physical attractiveness Kender Cliff Richard Vidal Sassoon Ami Mizuno Drill bit Hair metal Price discrimination Rod Stewart Brush Internal ballistics Son Gohan Gay slang Undergarment Beautiful Life Death rock fashion The Ashlee Simpson Show Kit Kat Ranma __ characters Geodesic dome Negima Hair coloring Shaving Sexual dimorphism The Amber Spyglass Pyramid Han Chinese clothing Barbie Pachypodium bicolor Ponytail Violin Doug Headgear Texas hold 'em Skin Social role of hair Head Teen Girl Squad Dilbert Great Teacher Onizuka Avalanche Rifle All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku Mercury Atlas 6 Equine conformation Tire Rastafari movement Screw Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Razor 21st Century Emo Flapper Felicity Anorexia nervosa Social rule Archery Wolfrider Violet Beauregarde Hair conditioner Hillary Rodham Clinton Cornrows Bow (music) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Parachute Veronica Lake Totally Spies!
