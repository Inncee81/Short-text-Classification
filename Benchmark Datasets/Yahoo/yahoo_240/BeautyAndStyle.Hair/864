new hair cut for school i want to get a pertty haircut for school but i dont know what to get i have light brown hair it is pertty thick but its not corse or anything its mostly one length except at the very front its about an inch longer than my arm pit all i have right now is a plain cut and i always wear it behind my ears becuase if i dont i think it looks to thick it lands on my shoulder and makes my hair look like a triangle i never wear it up because ever since i was little i had short hair not anymore so i have never worn it up and i would feel werid to wear it up i would feel like people were looking at me becuase i would look differnt it usually gets kind of frizzy but i think i finally found out a way to help control the frizz further testing of this method is needed i need to find out if this product did it or if i just had a good hair day i dont know if i want layers one time i went and asked for layers but they said it would look choppy if i didnt spend alot oftimeonit sorry about the last part i ran out of letter is should say alot of time on it i never did get layers maybe get some heavy layers even in the back if its really thick then layers will help thin it out or you could just ask the hair dressure to thin it then get either highlight or lowlights not both trust me i tryed blonde and brown at the same time before or maybe you could get some dark maroon highligts those usually look good in brown hair but make it look natural looking though then you could straighten your hair when it gets frizzy but just make sure to use lots of conditioner leaving conditioner in for a while then rinsing it out under cold water helps keep it moist and shiny when you go to the hair dressure they ususally use this product on your hair that makes it feel really nice and fluffy ask them what it is then buy it Haircut Hair Knife Diving suit Kodocha Equine conformation Casting Mattress Leather Opportunity rover Leaf Textile manufacturing Welding Textile manufacturing terminology Tetrapod Shampoo Mullet (haircut) Hermione Granger Hair color Bread Brewery Pitaten Menstrual cup Emo fashion Baldness One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Campfire Japanese tea ceremony Katana Bicycle frame Afro textured hair Fast bowling Tire Puff pastry W.I.T.C.H.
