do i really have to bleach it my hair is black and red but i want to change it to more extream colors like blue or purple but i really dont want to bleach my hair because im afraid that it might damage my hair so could i maybe just dye it blond first but not beach it trust me from one who has had the rainbow in her hair you have to bleach it and i recommend having this professionally done to go from black but especially the red if you try to do this yourself you could end up with more problems such as orange and gray instead of white all the way and having to bleach it a second time to get it the way you want it ah maybe you can keep it up yourself after you have the stylist tell you how to depending on what color your roots are but there is not way that you can dye it blond now and get the results you want you need the bleach to remove the color first Hair color Technicolor Blond Hair Color theory Color Death rock fashion C-41 process Dragon Booster The Rasmus Bleach Cascading Style Sheets Pigment Skinhead Emo fashion Tooth enamel Guinea pig M&M's Ganguro Light-emitting diode Rainbow flag Yoshi Hydrogen peroxide Bob and George Pysanka Laser hair removal Red hair James McNeill Whistler Joker (comics) Indigo dye Eye color Piet Mondrian Captain Scarlet Melanin Purple Cat coat genetics Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Hair (musical) E number Kimono Flag of Israel Rainbow Islands Red CD-R Rainbow My Little Pony White bread New York Mets Red-black tree Black body Black (people) Political colour Primary color Tattoo Textile manufacturing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Tanning Chicago White Sox Gamut RGB color model 25-pair color code Film colorization Link (Legend of Zelda) Rainbow Brite The Warriors Colours, standards and guidons The Ashlee Simpson Show Color Graphics Adapter Judo Tampon CIE 1931 color space Menstrual cup Colonial mentality Human skin color Crayola Beret Iris (plant) Bromine Sodium hypochlorite Laserdisc Food coloring Dumb blonde Elric of Melnibon__ Staining (biology) Color blindness Cashmere wool Photographic developer Sodium perborate Iris (anatomy) Logo Jade Academy Award for Best Cinematography Horse Pansy Double Dragon Lightstick CMYK color model Ammolite
