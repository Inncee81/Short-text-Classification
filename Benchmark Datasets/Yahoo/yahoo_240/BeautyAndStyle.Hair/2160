i was wondering about how often i should go to my hair dresser to get my hair trimmed and shaped up since im letting my hair grow long i wanted to ask this i am not sure what my goal is yet but i think ill keep it at the current length for now about every weeks or everytime you see your haircut is lost although since you are thinking about layering it when you see your hair starts to loose shape get it trimmed and make sure to tell your hairdresser that you want it just trimmed so it goes back to your current lenght basically get it trimmed if you feel your haircut is lost or if you have split ends or something like that that might make it not look at its best good luck Haircut Hair Social role of hair Kimono Knife Anorexia nervosa Fur The Ashlee Simpson Show Pubic hair Beard Kender San Francisco 49ers Kodocha Baldness Wildcat cartridge Mullet (haircut) The Contender (television series) Emo fashion Beautiful Life Leaf Dreadlocks Pottery Shaving New York Giants Show hunter The Apprentice 2 Extreme Programming Ranma __ characters Manicure Casting Sailing Poker jargon Thank God It's Doomsday Adrian Adonis Pittsburgh Steelers Puberty The Origin of Species Padm__ Amidala Dog agility Kyle Boller Pachypodium bicolor One Tree Hill (TV series) Newcastle United F.C.
