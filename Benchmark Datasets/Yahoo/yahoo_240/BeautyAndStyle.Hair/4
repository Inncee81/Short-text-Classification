i need help with my hair okay so i always loved the way that my hairdresser layered my hair until recently i hated the way how she made it really layered in the back then angled it to really low choppy layers in the front i was so mad so i went online and searched how to layer your own hair yes i know oh no it turned out horrible on the one side and okay on the other so my mom called her friend who's really good at cutting hair who used to have her own salon and she said she'd fix it for me she saw the one side and was like this isn't bad at all just needs a bit of fixing then she saw the other and gave me that look and told me she didn't know what she would do so she layered my hair shorter and gave me side swept bangs but it still looks pretty bad on the one side i don't want to constantly wear ponytails any tips that don't involve scissors that i could do with my hair besides ponytails if you put your hair in a messy half pony tail you cant see the uneven layers also you can try scrunching your hair because i fidn that if your hairs curly you can't tell how uneven the layers are if you can still tell try taking a cm wide hair at the front and twist it gradually adding hair going back then put a bobbypin in the direction facing your face i know it sounds confusing but it basically looks like cornrows of twists i usually only do it looks really cute if you put your hair in a headband and push your hair off your face you cant see the layers once in awhile you can even do a cute updo or if your hair is long enough try doing a side pony tail Haircut Professional wrestling throws Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Helicopter Skateboarding trick Kodocha Ponytail Aerial (dance move) Hair Barbie Internal ballistics Paul Is Dead Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Ski Volleyball Ranma __ characters The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Leaf Swingout RuneScape quests The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Physical attractiveness Wind turbine Dragon Booster Great Teacher Onizuka Baldness Glossary of American football Horse Totally Spies!
