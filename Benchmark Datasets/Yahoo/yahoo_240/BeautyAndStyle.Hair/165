damages how many hair perms i've had my hair permed and i really liked it and i would like to do it again because its gone frizzy my hairdresser says its time after months to perm it again but my stepmom says you should only perm your hair once a year for hair damage reasons so i was wondering if anyone knew how many times you can perm your hair wothout having some kind of damage also what kind of damages come from perming your hair in general because i've read a lot of articles that say dry and brittle hair but i never had that and i don't want to have that anything would be great thanks i ve permed my hair since i was about and i usually do it every months i m not sure how many times you can perm it without damage but my hair is healthy it s good to have your ends trimmed after getting a perm as well for less damage Haircut Hair Shampoo H-1B visa Kender Perm Oblast Beard The Ashlee Simpson Show Paula Jones Depilation Puberty Social role of hair Radiation therapy Hair (musical) Teen Girl Squad Permian Drug test Shaving Pubic hair Altai Republic Dreadlocks Marilyn Monroe Kalmykia Trigun Preston, Minnesota Theory of conduct Udmurtia Barber T__dai-ji Prostate cancer Baldness FC Amkar Perm Tanning Rostov Oblast Subdivisions of Russia Baldness treatments 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Urinary incontinence Sebaceous gland Welsh Terrier Time Out of Mind Chita Oblast Johnny Appleseed Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stem cell Vasily Tatishchev Yaroslavl Oblast Paul Is Dead Trichome Quake III Arena Skin Buryatia Tooth enamel Gerome Ragni Plame affair Napoleon Dynamite Kamchatka Oblast Giant Sequoia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma North Ossetia-Alania Republic of Karelia Overkill (band) Five Ks Salad Fingers Stomach cancer Pitaten Nail (anatomy) Negima Human skin color Bob and George RuneScape DNA repair OMON Spontaneous human combustion Keeshond Rei Ayanami Hair metal Tammy Wynette Biotin Comanche Contract L'Or__al Permyakia Headgear Fur Leather Acne Son Gohan Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Vidal Sassoon Galactic Civilizations Bonsai Dandruff Jon Heder Radio Yerevan Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Makoto Kino Thank God It's Doomsday Gwen Stefani
