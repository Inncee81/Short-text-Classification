flat iron review have you used digital ceramic flat iron by miracle a hairdresser recommended it to me but i'm sceptical it's a good looking flat iron but i don't know if it's worth the price about i've read a lot of good reviews for chi if you've tried both which would you recommend i have one from sally's beauty supplies can't remember the brand but it's not very impressive doesn't do much to my freezy hair and i have to run it through several times to see any difference tia i've been using a chi for over a year now and i swear by it i have very fine thin hair that gets damaged very easily even though the chi gets very hot it has never caused my hair to break and never gives me split ends plus it is great at calming down frizz and getting rid of waves curls i have the one and it's also great for getting my hair to flip out on the ends it gets hotter than a curling iron so when i use that my hair never goes flat halfway through the day i had used a conair one prior to getting the chi and the difference is like night and day Shampoo Haircut Hair Casting Cliff Richard Shen Gong Wu Mattress Billboard Hot 100 Spark plug Solar power Sub-Zero Tai Chi Chuan Sport Great Teacher Onizuka Knife We Belong Together Cookware and bakeware Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Japanese tea ceremony Brush Loudspeaker Microeconomics Vacuum tube The McGuire Sisters Cool (song) Roof Hot 100 Airplay Late Night with Conan O'Brien Oscilloscope Piccolo Junior Saga Drill bit Digital photography Black Books Vietnamese language Red Hot Chili Peppers Gramophone record Anne Boleyn Whitewater Sailor Chi Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Aerial (dance move) Social rule Prostate cancer Mercury Atlas 6 Violin Wu-Tang Clan affiliates The Ashlee Simpson Show Welding Glass Physical characteristics of the Buddha Pug Poker jargon The Demon Sorcerers Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Mario Bros.
