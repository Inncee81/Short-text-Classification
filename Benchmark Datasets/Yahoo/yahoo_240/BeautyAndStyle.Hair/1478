what type of haircut should i get i was wondering what type of haircut i should get and i was thinking about bangs but im not sure if you have any suggestions please let me know thanks http i photobucket com albums z chandb jpg you are gorgeous ok for bangs i'd get slightly longish ones like maybe eyebrow length because they are cute and if you don't like them they grow out fast and can be clipped back to blend in with the rest of your hair also if you get them cut too short you have to wait for them to grow back but if you cut them too long you can just snip more off i think layered hair is very pretty but it looks like you could pretty much pull off any hairstyle and any length you wanted Haircut Hair Emo fashion Mullet (haircut) Skinhead Physical attractiveness Kodocha Social role of hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Mohawk hairstyle Beard Baldness Havanese Death rock fashion Hair metal Mr. T Kylie Minogue Van Morrison Oasis (band) Desire (album) The Rolling Stones Totally Spies!
