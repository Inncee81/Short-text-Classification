haircut advice anyone so im thinking about getting my hair cut ive have long hair my whole life and i love it i take good care of it and its gorgeous but now alot of damage is catching up with it so i was thinking about cutting more off than i ususally do and letting it grow out so it can be healthy i just dont know how short to go right now its about inches past the mid back i want to cut a least inches off because thats the most damaged i want it to look different than it does but i still want it to be long enough so that i can curl it pull it back braid it and put it up i will not cut it more than past the shoulders so how much should i cut off so that it gives me a differnt look but is still long enough for me to do alot of things with it im just confused as to how short i should go so if anyone has any suggestions id be happy to hear them please and thank you to everyone if you look at my avatar that is almost exactly what my hair look like now except for longer inches is good just get rid of the damaged part nothing more Haircut Hair Mullet (haircut) Knife Kodocha Dreadlocks The Inside Phoebe Halliwell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Internal ballistics WCBS-FM Charmed Guinea pig Puberty The Amber Spyglass Ayyavazhi mythology Dog Ranma __ characters The Invisibles Plane (tool) Theory of conduct EastEnders Mr. T The Ashlee Simpson Show Baldness Prostate cancer Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Drill bit Humphrey Bogart Laura Schlessinger Nine Inch Nails Milton H.
