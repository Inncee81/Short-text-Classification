i want to dye my hair brown my hair is naturally dark brown this summer i decided to use sun in to get a lighter color for the beaches however i have very dark eyes and my hair looks terrible my mother says that there's dying and bleaching and sun in is bleaching so i can't reverse bleaching but i'd really like to get my hair back to normal is there any way to dye my hair back or could i dye it really dark and just progressively wash it out sun in is the devil it sort of 'bleaches' but also ruins your hair most hairstylists will not touch your hair once you've used it it can cause bad breakage and horrible damage if you dye over it if you really really want to do something about your hair be very careful do this dye it first with a semi permanent brownish ash tone color that will tone down the blonde in it a bit and make sure that the color you dye it later stays in longer then dye it with a neutral or ash tone permanent brown color it may still wash out tho good luck Hair coloring Blond Hair color Pysanka Kender Technicolor The Rasmus Emo fashion Death rock fashion Yami no Matsuei Hair Sun Physical attractiveness Human skin color Photographic film Dye Joker (comics) Textile manufacturing Dragon Booster Kimono The Ashlee Simpson Show Color theory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Leather Horse Melanin Characters in the Smurfs White bread Staining (biology) Shampoo Pitaten Red hair Wolfrider Camouflage Diamond Haircut Indigo dye Sunglasses W.I.T.C.H.
