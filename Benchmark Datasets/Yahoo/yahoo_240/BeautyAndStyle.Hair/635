i have naturally black hair and i wanted to put teal and blue on the bottom but will bleach fry my hair bleach will dry out your hair and make it more prone to breaking but it is only through multiple applications that the bleach will fry hair the problem with coloring hair teal and blue is that you need the hair to be yellow for the teal and pale yellow for the blue since your hair is black it will take between to bleaching sessions to get it that light depending on the strength of your hair you might be able to withstand that damage but most hair types will be extremely damaged after that much chemical exposure the good news fortunately is that many bright haircolor manufacturers make their products very conditioning if you manage to lighten your black hair to a yellow and pale yellow the teal and blue color you throw on afterward will condition your hair and give it a less damaged look i recommend trying a strand first that way you can always dye it back to black or cut the hair off if things don't work out good luck Hair coloring Light-emitting diode Hair color Tooth enamel Textile manufacturing Dragon Booster Diamond Chlorine Photographic film Welding Color theory Blond Color Menstrual cup Aluminium Sunglasses Wood pulp Wood Textile Discus (fish) Hydrogen peroxide Cat Aspartame Diamond enhancement Pysanka Leather Corrosion Hair (musical) Elric of Melnibon__ Bleach Food coloring Drill bit Digital photography Human skin color Ammonia Mario Potato Diamond simulant Textile manufacturing terminology Mummy Kimono Chromium Technicolor Teal'c Iron Melanin Radiation therapy Material properties of diamond Tofu Death rock fashion Wassily Kandinsky Leaf Bob and George Fluorine Shampoo CMYK color model Thallium Drawing Inkjet printer Uranium Albinism Sulfur Color blindness Joker (comics) Plutonium Photography Cat coat genetics Common bean Ultraviolet Chicago White Sox Pikmin Emo fashion Red Beret Meriones unguiculatus Characters in the Smurfs Judo Skinhead Flag of India Methamphetamine My Little Pony Tampon Spark plug Brush Semiconductor device Diabetes mellitus Glass Gamut Cascading Style Sheets Egg (food) CD-R Explosive material Tattoo Turquoise Titanium Psoriasis
