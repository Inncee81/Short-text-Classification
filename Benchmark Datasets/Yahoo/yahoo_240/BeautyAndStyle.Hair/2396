hair coloring highlights i got my hair highlighted and was wondering how lond i should wait to get my haor relaxed it really depends on how much bleaching had to be done to get the highlights if it was one of the drug store kits i would wait at least shampoos before trying relaxing solutions i really suggest you talk to your hairdresser since it depends on the relaxing solution and your hair type on whether it will work or worse if it will damage your highlighted hair Hair coloring Shampoo Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Cosmetology Haircut Color Urinary incontinence Drug test LSD Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Digital photography Mr. T Afro textured hair Psoriasis Dandruff Hydrogen peroxide Myocardial infarction Quantum computer Sento Hair Drawing Drug addiction Laser hair removal Death Community emergency response team Syntax highlighting Leaf Hair color Nuclear magnetic resonance Redundant array of independent disks Fire extinguisher Apostolic Constitutions Carbon nanotube The Pet Sounds Sessions Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Medicare (Canada) Chemotherapy Battery (electricity) Hashish Sleep Blond Menstrual cup Intravenous therapy Leisure Illegal drug trade Ethernet Hypoglycemia Depilation Skin Insomnia Human skin color Organ transplant Ethidium bromide Lung cancer Baldness Liquid crystal Aikido The Penultimate Peril Hyperhidrosis Liquid crystal display Enceladus (moon) Hearing aid __douard Manet Cannabis (drug) Dijkstra's algorithm Orgasm Dollar store Tarantula Ranma __ characters The Inside Karen Horney Japanese tea ceremony Second Battle of the Atlantic Orders of magnitude (numbers) Hydrochloric acid Leslie Cheung Polar Bear Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sedative Sun Radiation therapy Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Chlorine Aromatherapy Social rule Divorce Simpson and Delilah Permittivity Water purification Treehouse of Horror V Concerto L'Or__al Migraine Multiple chemical sensitivity Power-up Diabetes mellitus Ozzy Osbourne
