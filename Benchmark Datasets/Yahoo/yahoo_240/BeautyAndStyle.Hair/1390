how do you curl thick hair fast no curlers they do not work for me i want some cute curls but i can never do my own hair i need help i have fairly thick hair and what you should try is getting a chi flat iron don't stop reading yet the chi flat iron can do more then straighten your hair haha or you can try finding a rounded flat iron it takes about mins and the more you practice the quicker it gets put half or of your hair in a pony tail take small peices of hair grab your flat iron and start at your roots and curl your hand inward like using a regular curling iron and have the hair go all the way through as you are curling it inwards if any of this makes sense you don't have to do ever peice you have on your head to curl just do peices and then take down more hair from your pony tail and curl some of that and continue on i am pretty sure it works with regular curling irons but to me it seems quicker with my flat iron after wards use mousse or gel and hair spray to make them hold i'm sure this is really confusing but i suggest going to a hair stylest to really show you hands on how to do your hair Hair Curling Dog Equine conformation Haircut Skateboarding trick My Little Pony Aerial (dance move) Knitting Violin Casting Guinea pig Wing Chun Only Fools and Horses Japanese tea ceremony Teen Girl Squad Sub-Zero Professional wrestling throws Carding Tai Chi Chuan Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Puberty Gesture Afro Tokusatsu Brush Horse Satyr Futari wa Pretty Cure Shaggy dog story Plane (tool) Woodworking Gas metal arc welding Normal distribution Musical mode Professional wrestling holds Bacon Professional wrestling match types Clarinet Afro textured hair Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Paul Is Dead Hair conditioner Marilyn Monroe World War Three (Doctor Who) Rail tracks Sea serpent Kodocha Scuba set Drill bit Softball Mohawk hairstyle Swingout Toilet humour Wig (hair) Physical characteristics of the Buddha The Amber Spyglass Bladderwort Coir Good Morning, Vietnam Suplex Platypus Negima 24 Hours of Le Mans Tire RuneScape quests Bookbinding Jheri curl Spark plug Vietnamese language Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of graph theory Shaving Randy Ferbey Official Monster Raving Loony Party The Wotch John Steinbeck The Demon Sorcerers Milton H.
