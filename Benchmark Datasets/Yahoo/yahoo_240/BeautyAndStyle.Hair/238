how can i dye my hair at home i want dye my a light brown and then blonde streaks is there like a guide to do it at home honestly i would go to a proffesional because if you try something too ambitious then it can end up as a catastrophe but if you really want to save money then i would say do the brown yourself go to sallys for the color then go to a salon and ask for just a partial highlight and i think you would be much happier Hair color Blond Hair coloring Chicago White Sox World Series The Rasmus Pysanka Staining (biology) 2005 World Series Hair Charlie Brown Technicolor Food coloring Ink Emo fashion Red hair L'Or__al CD-R Preston, Minnesota The Ashlee Simpson Show Leather Mandy Moore Bob and George Marie Antoinette Ashlee Simpson John Layfield Pigment C-41 process Pittsburgh Steelers W.I.T.C.H.
