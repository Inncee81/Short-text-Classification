if i keep my hair dark what color highlights can i get with olive toned skin you could do several different colors with your hair and skin tone especially since fall is coming up i would probably choose a warm caramel brown and a coppery red color those would complement your skin tone and look great for fall and winter i would definitely stay away from blonde especially very light white blondes if you don't already have a good colorist stylist that you can trust go find you one stop by different salons and tell them what you would like and dislike ask about their credentials and even references they should be willing to tell you and you should call their references to see what they think about the way they do their hair Hair color Dragon Booster Human skin color Red hair Blond Melanin Color theory Laser hair removal Color Race of Jesus Skinhead Hair White (people) Polar Bear W.I.T.C.H.
