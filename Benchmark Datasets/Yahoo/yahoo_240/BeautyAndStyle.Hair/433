the hairstylist dyed my hair way too red i used medium brown box dye a month ago i liked the color however it was not shiny at all and my ends had a greenish tint so i went to the salon toni guy and requested an all over color the hairstylist recommended a brown color not much darker than my current brown with a bit of a reddish tint when she was done however my hair was auburn i think it's too red and makes me look pale but i thought i was just having second thoughts because change is scary anyway i told her i liked it and left now that i'm home i feel that it is too red i don't know what i should do should i call and tell her i think it's too red will i have to pay if she tries to make it less red and what would she have to do to my hair to get the reddish tint out pleaseee help you should wash it a couple times because red fades quickly if you still don't like it call the stylist and tell her it just didn't grow on you she should redo it free of charge she would probably put another one process color on again to cover up the red never use an at home color again the color layers on improperly is harder to get out and is always uneven and usually takes multiple visits to the stylist to repair costing you more than you saved and don't use henna it is impossible to get out and turns out orange or more red than you had to start hope this helps good luck Hair color Color theory Hair coloring Henna Tattoo Diamond Red Geology of the Grand Canyon area Haircut The Ashlee Simpson Show Diamond enhancement Paul Is Dead Blood on the Tracks Red hair Technicolor Laserdisc Discus (fish) Human skin color Pysanka Dog Glass Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Detroit Tigers The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Textile manufacturing Color blindness Amber Gaia Online Mohawk hairstyle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Light-emitting diode Opportunity rover Diamond simulant My Little Pony Photography Pittsburgh Steelers Kodocha Hillary Rodham Clinton Horse Physical attractiveness Bon Jovi Leaf Xiaolin Showdown Paint Chicago White Sox Double Dragon Joker (comics) Cleveland Browns Kender Death rock fashion The Times They Are A-Changin' Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Anodising Team Fortress Classic Cascading Style Sheets Link (Legend of Zelda) Clothing Totally Spies!
