how does a man look with long hair do you consider it manly i think a man can look very sexy with long hair only if it is well groomed and isn't an attempt at overcompensating for going bald that is about as unsexy as it gets personally i like short hair on my guy it just looks better on him but long hair can look good good grooming and a nice cologne helps or the scent of patchouli oil to me it sort of looks like the man is an artistic person or an intellectual person perhaps from a liberal urban area like berkeley which is next door to me like a man who is so into his artistic or intellectual pursuits that his hair is his own and the world's opinion doesn't matter or it can look like the guy is a total hick dweeb if he has dirt under his nails and drives a tractor to the store it's all about image at that point baby bb lady morgana ps i will add a however long hair on a man looks best in a nice pony tail just my opinion pps manliness is all about what is inside a and long hair can be manly it is all on what is projected from his bared heaving chest and sweaty brow if his sexuality is aimed at my tender feminine flesh long hair don't matter none if his gaze goes longingly to brad pitt i know i am sol and the vibe is not what i would feel to be manly Hair Baldness Ranma __ characters Cool World Sexual attraction Equine conformation Depilation Physical characteristics of the Buddha Theory of conduct Cat Comanche My Little Pony Gender role Friends Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Radio Yerevan Brush The Amber Spyglass Gay slang Seinfeld Shot of Love Guinea pig Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Madonna (entertainer) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sydney Riot of 1879 Late Night with Conan O'Brien Undergarment Keeshond The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Bon Jovi Great Teacher Onizuka Ron and Fez Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Kill Bill Physical attractiveness The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie William II of England Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Salad Fingers Jon Secada Something Positive Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Coming of Age (TNG episode) Hair (musical) Kodocha Sex and the City Narrator Social rule Ocean's Twelve Humphrey Bogart Team Fortress Classic Aristasia Beard Women in Islam Eastern Orthodox Church God and gender Seven (film) Characters in the Smurfs Cruising (film) Codename: Kids Next Door Married... with Children Effeminacy Sin City Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Opus Dei Mami Wata Human Reservoir Dogs Singlish English grammar Kyle Broflovski Trigun Bertrand Russell Mozilla Firefox Michel Henry Bradley McGee The Apprentice 2 Mystique (comics) Pubic hair Theodicy Mahoraba Tommy Atkins Textile manufacturing Rose Haircut William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham 613 mitzvot The Ashlee Simpson Show New York Giants Original sin Perfume Gaze Baldness treatments Horse Karen Horney MAME Vanilla Ninja
