i just got a perm and it is hideous how can i get it back to straight i'm so upset i went in for a routine hair cut to my straight hair i asked the lady if there was a book i could look at while i waited i saw a picture of a woman with big curls and asked if it was a perm or if someone curled her hair for the picture she said that it was a perm after much talking with her i decided to take the plunge as she was rolling my hair i told her that the rods looked too small to look like the picture they looked like poodle style rods if you know what i mean the kind that older women get she assured me it was just like the picture i asked two strangers what my hair looked like they said it looked like someone crimped it i'm so upset i'm calling them this morning and giving them a piece of my mind can they straighten it is it possible to straighten out this mess someone help me i did the same thing however i allowed my friends to perm my hair i wanted soft waves and i got frizzy and kinky it was awful what i suggest you do is wash it and heavily condition often the perm will calm down however it will never fully go away after about a month and a half i chemically straightened mine and it worked great but my hair was severely damaged and eventually both the perm and the chemical straightening grow out and your roots and flat you should buy a good ceramic straightener and redkin smoothing heat glide serum for now that is really all you can do wait a month or two and see how the perm looks then if you really don't like it get your hair straightened good luck i know how horrible it can be my hair was very long and severely damaged i ended up cutting off about inches Haircut Textile manufacturing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drill bit Curling Pitaten Kodocha Lauren Bacall The Ashlee Simpson Show Eddie Guerrero Social rule Humphrey Bogart Afro textured hair Dreadlocks Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blonde on Blonde Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Taxi Driver Theory of conduct Equine conformation Friends Poker jargon AFI 100 Years series Teen Girl Squad The Amber Spyglass Meat Loaf Aerial (dance move) Rod Stewart Wood Ayyavazhi mythology Paula Jones Paul Martin Paragliding Knife The Contender (television series) Seppuku Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind EastEnders Characters in the Smurfs Mattress The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kender Japanese tea ceremony Rastafari movement Dog Knots Landing G-Man (Half-Life) Gliding The Smoking Room Pete Rock The Catcher in the Rye Time Out of Mind Superman III Great Teacher Onizuka Leaf Poodle Woodworking Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Badly Drawn Kitties Green Day Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cliff Richard Good Morning, Vietnam Little Britain Shark Have I Got News For You The Time Machine 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shampoo Ashton-Tate Highway 61 Revisited The Times They Are A-Changin' Afro Prostate cancer Guinea pig Heinkel He 100 Opportunity rover Scoliosis Pittsburgh Steelers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Acne Ocean's Twelve Sharon Tate Piccolo Junior Saga Timpani The Isley Brothers Customs and etiquette of Japan Tire Trish Stratus Illegal drug trade Stem cell Extras (sitcom) Ben Johnson (athlete)
