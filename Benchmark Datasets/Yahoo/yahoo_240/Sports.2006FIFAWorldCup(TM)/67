would you say that evading offside is a skill and if you think 'yes' would you consider it more in the realm of vision or timing it is a skill that involves both vision and timing plus a little luck i played striker for many years career goals and sometimes it was just luck the ref didn't see that i was offside one of the ways you can help the ref and assistant refs make the call is to note their positioning if they tend to run behind the play you will tend to look offside even if you are not due to the angle so you need to hold back a bit one other way is to run parallel to the imaginary line created by the last defender which determines offside it's much easier to change direction when the ball is played if you are already moving than it is to move when the ball is played or to time your run so you are just onside when the ball is played you also need good vision so you can see how the field is organized before you make your run often a defender away from where you are playing will keep you onside even if you are behind the defender who is marking you vision helps one see those opportunities and to pounce on them you also need to be a little aggrssive if you are never called offside you are not aggressive enough in your attack Offside law (football) Glossary of American football Football (soccer) Rugby union Fast bowling Australian rules football Volleyball Fielding (cricket) Touch football (rugby league) Canadian football Football (soccer) positions Baseball Finesse American football strategy Comparison of Canadian and American football Water polo Wide receiver Laws of cricket Ice hockey Football Rugby league Onside kick Paintball Rugby union positions Norway national football team Midfielder Super Bowl XXVI Harrow Football Penalty (rugby) Cricket Cincinnati Bengals Billiards Super Bowl XIII Cleveland Browns Quarterback Internal ballistics Ruy Lopez Pittsburgh Steelers Defender (football) Table tennis Batting (cricket) Marching band Scrum (rugby) Tenshinhan Badminton Snooker Tag Rugby league positions General relativity Softball Batting average Dog agility Super Bowl III Broomball Corner kick Leadership Baseball Stars Chess strategy and tactics Line-out Laws of the Game Peter Lorimer Indoor soccer Field hockey Super Bowl XXXII Fuzion ALGOL 68 Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Super Bowl XXXIII Hockey rink Hand of God goal Strategic management Dennis Bergkamp Beer Pong Binocular vision Super Bowl XXI Iron Bowl Parade (military) San Francisco 49ers Running back Super Bowl XXX Double layer British national grid reference system Strategic planning Leg before wicket Professional wrestling attacks New York Giants Super Bowl XXVII Batsman Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Carolina Panthers Eye Penalty kick (football) Super Bowl XVII Offensive team Skateboarding trick Origins of baseball Baseball statistics Eight ball
