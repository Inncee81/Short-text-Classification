does it matter to my kids and yrs that my ex and i are not that friendly with each other we are both great involved parents that have been divorced for yrs we have joint custody so we see each other often the problem is my ex has not gottten over the divorce he left me and can't even look at me in the face at school fuctions kids games ect he will never sit with me so the kids end up running back and forth between us cause they want to be with both of us if i pick the kids up he will never come to the door he just sends them out whenever i call if he sees its me calling he will have the kids answer it he will only talk to me when he has to anytime i have a party for the kids and invite him he alllways has an excuss why he can't come now like i said hes a great dad and he never says anything bad about me to the kids and we never fight infrount of the kids i just wonder if the kids can feel the tension between us and how it will affect them as they get older and more wise of whats going on yes kids grow up to mimic their moms and dads if you don t want your child saying or doing something you don t like then try not to do those things in front of them and kids are emotional detectors they might not know or understand why you are mean angry or don t get along but they sense trouble The Fairly OddParents Fathers' rights The Adventures of Pete & Pete Divorce Kyle Broflovski Teachers (film) About a Boy Friends The Jeffersons (South Park) Social rule Silent Night, Deadly Night One Tree Hill (TV series) Transactional analysis Father's Day (Doctor Who) Calvin and Hobbes The Marshall Mathers LP The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Grandview, U.S.A.
