would you be angry about this too my husband and i work different shifts and we can only afford one car for now he works an hour away from home and he has to take the car to work because he doesn't get home from work until late at night anyway i have to go and pick my daughter up from school everyday and lately it has been very hot and humid here over degrees with a heat index of i am not joking my neighbor has a car and they can see our house from where they live and my neighbor's daughter goes to the same elementary school as my daughter does they have never offered us a ride when it has been so hot and humid outside for the past week and i want to know if i have every right to be angry and upset at them for just ignoring us when they know that we have to walk in the heat everyday they were my friends until now and i am not going to forget how they conveinently ignored my daughter and i when it has been so hot and humid outside and we have had to walk four blocks to the school and back home i am sorry but i could never just ignore somebody that i cared about when i knew that they didn't have a car to go and get their child from school especially when it has been so hot and humid outside it just amazes me how selfish and self centered some people have become when they won't even offer their neighbor a ride and i have even offered them money to take me back and forth and they still have some lame excuse as to why they can't do it i could never ever live with myself knowing that i could help my neigbor if i had a car and just knowing that a parent and child were suffering in this hot and humid weather would just break my heart maybe i am odd but i would offer to give my neighbors a ride if i knew that they had to walk back and forth in this heat and humidity i am sorry but i have to totally disagree with almost everyone elses answer here these neighbors were friends of yours and your child is young and this is the reason you are walking her in the first place and if it were me i would be angry not only were they your friends but they would not be going out of their way and you even offered them money for blocks my child who is has a problem with the sun and heat and she cannot be outside between the hours of and and if the humitidy is up she can't go out at all even if well hydrated i don't understand why these people are acting this way especially when a young child is involved but apparently they are very selfish i am very aware of what this world is coming to and how we are all forgetting that one act of random kindness makes this world go around it would do no harm to help out a neighbor it would do no harm to help out a child it would do no harm to drive two extra people in the same direction you are going to the same place you are going for the same place you are going i would have to say this neighbor has some reason unknown to you and i would when you have the chance i would ask her i would ask her why why did you feel the need to do this to us when we were friends even if you felt it was only blocks sure we are not in africa and we don't have to walk miles to get water and we praise god for that here in america but the question was would you be angry about the way this friend and neighbor treated you not if you lived here or there or blocks is a good walk get over it i suffer from a very rare nueromuscular disorder and i cannot even walk block do you know if the writer of this post has a problem with walking through a lot of answers i see so many put downs its unreal when asnwering someone remember these are people who are deserving of respect and dignity in your response you can be honest and you should be but you never have the right to be nasty and to be hurtful so my answer is yes i would be hurt by the actions of this former friend of yours because its hot outside and the heat effects us all differently and if it were me and my little girl we would end up in the er Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.
