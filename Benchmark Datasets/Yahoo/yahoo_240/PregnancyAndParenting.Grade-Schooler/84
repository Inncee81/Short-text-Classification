i neeed help what can i have i would have to have some help lol unless i read the directions but i have trouble sometimes focusing sometimes mostly all the time i have trouble pay attetion ill listen then something gets my attention my aunt is trying to help me but my mom and dad dont do anyting bout it but my parents they dont really help as much they would just tell me im fine just try but it isnt to easy byw am year old turning in sep and am going to th grade i got in a lot of truouble in elemetry school like am always hyper my friends thinks i have adhd but idk can i have it yes you may have it and if diagnosed you can be placed on mind altering drugs that will make you into a shy little gnome that doesn't get along with too many people or you can work towards controlling it yourself i know adults who are on medication and have relied on it for all their lives it now does them little good and they have no way to cope my son is also add and has been free of medication for years he's a very outgoing and happy child who has learned to put his 'disorder' to his advantage first and foremost understand that you don't fit in a 'normal' world there are billions of people in the world and none of us are the same there is actually nothing 'normal' in this world only the perception of what people should be for instance when my son does his homework he has a tv on the ipod stuck in his ears is munching on food and quite often is also playing x box this is not normal there is no way i could possibly do that in my way of thinking it can not be done you must sit in a well lit room with no distractions and do your homework thats the normal way we would work for hours doing homework the normal way until i would finally break down and finish it for him he accepted that he was not normal long before i did when i finally accepted that it was possible for him to do all that stuff and his homework at the same time he started finishing the homework in minutes instead of hours and he did it right too so when you are trying to focus try to not focus understand that you are picking up things at a much faster rate processing them getting bored by them going onto a different subject processing it getting bored by it then going on to a different subject over and over it goes so as the teacher is talking silently recite in your head the preamble of the constitution and with your foot gently tap out the rhythm to some song that you like don't focus on any one of them go back to each in its turn you will find that you understand more of what the teacher is saying you may find that you comprehend all of it also and very importantly talk to your teachers on the first day of class or in the first week tell them that you have troubles paying attention that you are working on it and would like their help and understanding a student that does that is a lot less likely to get in trouble and a lot more likely to get help edit many 'brilliant' people are also add people have pegged them also as abnormal they are smarter then average the big difference is that they naturally have learned to control their ability to process information at a much higher rate its the same ability you have to learn but once you learn it the same advantages they have from this 'disability' will also be yours Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dyslexia Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Hearing impairment Milton H.
