is it too young for my son my son just started karate classes but it requires me taking him on the city bus for a minute ride not far at all there will come a time because i'm pregnant that he will have to take the bus alone my husband and i have been arguing about this all day he says even tho my son is yrs old he is too young to ride the city bus alone despite the fact he has a cell phone should he run into problems also the nieghborhood in which he is going is a very wealthy neigborhood and has a very very low crime rate do you think yrs old is too young to ride the bus alone or do you think it is ok given he i s almost a teenager i think this experience would be good for him as i was riding a city bus alone when i was yrs of age sorry if this soo long thanks for your input p s i live in hamilton ontario canada not that it matters lol good for you people need to stop babying their children does he know not to talk to strangers does he know who appropriate authority figures are that he can go to ask for help if he needs it can he read a bus route in case he misses his stop can he figure out how to get back to where he needs to be does he show good situational awareness does he have good instincts for bad situations vs safe ones what you can do is both you and your husband trail him on a couple of bus trips let him know you're doing that but ask him to try to manage it all by himself don't interfere the entire time and ask him to pretend you aren't there and you do the same then you'll both get a sense for how ready he is to be independent kids are abducted or fall into bad situations because they aren't taught common sense independence any more and everyone coddles them sometimes into their late 's don't do the same disservice to your child encourage his independence at this age and you'll be pleased to see what a mature and independent adult he turns out to be when he's just and he'll have a more successful life for it Theory of conduct Marriage Public transport Social rule Bus rapid transit Motion picture rating system Shaggy dog story Unemployment Infantilism Kodocha The Magic School Bus Knots Landing Toronto Transit Commission Dog The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breastfeeding Friends Martial art Equine conformation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act School bus MTA New York City Transit buses Incarnations of Immortality Second language acquisition The Karate Kid, Part III Scientology beliefs and practices Universal Serial Bus Microeconomics Theodicy Surveillance Kender Saved by the Bell The Amazing Race Days of our Lives The Death Gate Cycle Ben Johnson (athlete) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taxicab Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Human sexual behavior Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Education The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Canadian Pacific Railway Alexander Technique Autism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Phoebe Halliwell Adolescence San Francisco Municipal Railway The Family from One End Street Taken Sharon Tate Speed limit Electrophysiology Tupac Shakur GO Transit Procrastination American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Driver's license Sleeping Murder Hitchhiking Rosa Parks Kevin and Kell Determinism Miami-Dade Transit Deflation (economics) Neighbours Bus models used in New York City Transit Statutory rape The Giver Goodness and value theory Baroque chess Midnight Run Pattaya Rape Mary, the mother of Jesus Beaumont children disappearance The Regina Monologues The Catcher in the Rye Stewie Griffin Prisoner's dilemma Generation Y Segregated cycle facilities In vitro fertilisation Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Drowning Miscarriage Light rail Goldstein's book Dog training Paintball
