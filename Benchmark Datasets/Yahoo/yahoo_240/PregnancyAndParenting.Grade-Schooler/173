what do you do when your y o says i want to get dead it's a typical 'bad day' for my boyfriend's y o i stay at home and take care of him while his dad is at work i've gotten on to him all day for various things giving the dog his toys to chew up back talking giving smart alleck remarks etc i told him that i would give him lunch at noon at 'til noon i was about to fix his lunch when he got in trouble again for smarting off again i told him that he would have to wait at i fixed him leftover pasta salad he complained about that he loved it days ago i told him to eat it so he whined and finally said fine in rude mannor i told him that i was tired of his smart comments and that he would have to wait even longer i send him to his room and i was only going to wait a few minutes before i called him back unfortunately he started throwing things so i went in there and spanked him no comments about that because me and his dad won't listen to it continued with 'additional details' afterwards he started saying i wanna get dead over and over i've gotten i don't love you you're not my friend you're not my family plenty of times but what he's said now scares me i walked in there after standing outside his door listening a few minutes and asked him if he was ready to eat he said yes but he also said you're killing me i said what he said you made my head hurt and it's killing me he gets headaches when he gets really angry or plays rough for hours on end he's in there eating right now with no complaints the boy has been through way too much as a kid his mother isn't in the picture anymore thank god and i'm doing the best i know how i don't have any kids he also has adhd and is taking meds for that as well as bipolar disorder what on earth do i do now he already sees a therapist and a psychiatrist this is ridiculous i do spend plenty of time with him we read books play games and i tutor him he's a little behind in school however when he's bad he knows that we can't do fun things together i can't take tv away because his tv time is limited to only when he's good he gets irritated and frustrated when he watches too much tv i can't take toys away because then he has a reason to sit there and stare at the wall his favorite pasttime pretend i don't hear him i do that all day long i pretended that the dogs didn't chew up the first toys i pretended that he didn't smart off the first few times this question may be pointless flower girl i do use positive reinforcement we have a chart of 'smiley faces' he gets one every hour he knows that he will be rewarded for the smiley faces he gets he doesn't get one if he's been bad the past hour at we were supposed to play topple together i need to do research on adhd for one i'm a psychology major for two i was diagnosed adhd at wrong diagnosis however at i was diagnosed bipolar trust me i know what he's going through my parenting style is almost the same as his dads maybe i should go drop him off at his mother's house where she can ignore him and beat him with a belt when he gets on her nerves then she can send him home in soiled clothes the boy doesn't know what 'family' is he thinks his friend's are his cousins he thinks his 'mammaw' gave birth to him he thinks his ex stepmom is his real mom and his real mom is his step mom and yes me and his dad do correct him and explain the truth i give the f ck up when was the last time he was good just now he's being good in the living room i didn't get on here to talk about when he was good yesterday we watched beauty and the beast together played school and i let him help me cook wow i'm such a horrible person didn't i mention that i'm bipolar on meds and they're working great i deserved every spanking i got as a child bipolar or adhd or not i went in the living room where he was at about he was a totally different person we talked about his anger and frustration that's been going on up until now i told his if he was good until that we would do something fun together then he read me a book he's actually ahead in reading now when at the end of the school year he was a little behind too many people responded with rude comments why insult my parenting style when none of you know the whole situation i've gathered my parenting style for my mother grandmother sister and friends with kids yahoo answers is apparently not the place to go if i insulted you and your parenting style why would you listen to what i have to say maybe if people on here were a bit nicer i'd be more inclined to listen to what they have to say i won't insult you i don't even get a hint that you're a bad parent from what you've said the reason i'm answering this is because my y o says the same thing to me here's the thing my daughter was confronted with death at a very early age days before her th b day we lost her week old sister however even though she has had sthand experience with death she still doesn't understand what it means and i doubt your son does either death is a hard concept for an adult to grasp much less a little kid i think when my daughter says i wish i was dead and i wish you never borned me she's actually just expressing an intense desire to get out of whatever situation she's in at the moment occasionally she has said that she wants to be dead to see her baby sister and that is very obviously different she's not wishing herself out of something but instead missing her sister your son is trying to express a concept that is very common he's just using words that are taboo because he doesn't know how else to say it i just always say to my daughter no you don't sweetie or something like that and sometimes we talk about how death is forever and problems are not how much i say about it really depends on the situation i don't want to make a huge deal about it but i also don't want her to think that dying is an appropriate solution to a problem trust yourself you seem to be doing well with the cards you've been
