how to stop violent reactions from violent games hello i'm already addicted in violent games help me when i'm outside i really don't have the idea of getting mad actually i'm the most friendliest kid but when i'm at home i become violent if my mom tells me to stop i yell i know its bad how to stop my reactions before it gets outta hand need help don't suggest that count seconds thingy or see a professional doctor or something i'm here i have no money everybody gets angry it's how you behave when you're angry that is important i have taught my son that when he gets mad he needs to go to his room and spend some time alone until he gets control of himself that doesn't mean stomping slamming or destroying things it is simply a cool off period you have no business yelling at your mother go be alone until you can be civil Grandview, U.S.A.
