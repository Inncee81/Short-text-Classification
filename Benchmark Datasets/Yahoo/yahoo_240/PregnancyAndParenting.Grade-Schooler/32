what do i do please answer mi question recently i got in a fight at school and im suspended for days i would have been expellled but since i was povoked they did not i'm in the th grade and school has been back in for about a week i've never been in a fight before and i've never even gotten one detention or anything the reason i got into a fight was because this girl named alana kept teasing me in class she called me names like dummy loser the b words and all sorts of names but she never got in trouble not once because she never does it in front of teachers but this time she did and in front of my whole class she has been bullying me for years so finally i had enough and i punched her many times in the face until the teacher pulled me off of heri would have kept going if she hadnt stopped me they brought her down to the nurses office and she was bleeding all ove her face they called my mom and sent me home and now my com grounds me for the whole week and i only have minues too go on my laptop eachday its not it's not even fair that i got in trouble and her mom called my mom today to tell her off and make her pay the medical bills from when she toook her to the hospital because apparently i broke her jaw and damaged her eye and now im scared and dont know what to do her riends and her are probly going to try to fight me i dont know what to do please help im really sorry for hurting her but i wasnt thinking i called her today and her mom cursed me out she told me that her daughter didnt say anything mean to me and that im a low life brat im scared and i tried to say i was sorry but they dont want to hear it sweetheart violence is never the answer but the damage has already been done you have now shown her friends that you are not afraid of the bully the thing with bullies is that they are cowards deep down and when they don't have an audience they are too afraid to start anything i would be willing to bet that she had an audience every time she was bullying you anyway when you do go back to school she may even try to become your friend because now she fears your anger just let it go don't stoop to her level you be the better person if someone is bullying you in the future just walk away and ignore it if it gets out of hand report it to the teacher let the school board handle it and they will the schools are cracking down on bullying now it been going on too much because you say her parents want your parents to pay the doctors bills i assume you live in the usa because health care is not free there so unfortunately your parents will have to pay for it even if the other parents take your parents to court your parents will loose and have to pay it's a hard lesson to learn but hopefully you have learned it now and you will be a better person for it when you go back to school Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Columbine High School massacre Kodocha Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) Breastfeeding The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pok__mon Live!
