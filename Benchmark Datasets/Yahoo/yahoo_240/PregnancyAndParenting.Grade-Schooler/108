any military schools for yr olds my son is years old he has been diagnosed with a severe case of adhd and he is absolutely unrully he fights with his younger brother he fist fights with me he steals he lies and cannot participate in regular classroom activities he doesn't have many friends because he is mean to them the other day he wrapped a cord to mini blinds around his neck until he broke the skin i want to check him into military school or something but can't seem to find any for his age group does anybody know of any for his age roup and before people start giving me there opinion please understand i have exhausted all other efforts and forms of discipline his adhd testing lasted months of externsive testing to be sure he actually had it and it is frequently checked to make sure it was not misdiagnosed i am not looking for a bunch of rude comments on how to raise my son if people have any legitimate advise i am willing to listen but primarily looking for military schools for year olds thanks my son is very smart he is going into the th grade and has the intelligence level of a th grader he is on medication for his adhd your son sounds a lot like my nine year old son however my son has been diagnosed with aspergers syndrome which is often confused with adhd i would suggest your healthcare provider look into aspergers too i wouldn't go to the extreme of sending him away as he will feel like you are punishing him and it will make it worse and he will resent it try to make sure you avoid confrontations with him remove him from volatile situations before they get out of hand try to ignore the bad and praise him at every opportunity even for silly little things try to spend some activity time with him try jungle charts website for behaviour charts which may or may not work with your son but it's worth a go here's a bit of advise for bedtime get him in a warm bath and play with him let him splash about let him get thing wet they'll dry dry him off and have him lie down massage him with lavender moisturiser start with his neck then his shoulders then move onto his upper torso then his legs and his feet take your time he will enjoy the physical contact and the massage will calm his body while the lavender will calm his mind this always works for my son and he wakes up feeling well rested and calm i know how difficult life can be sometimes you just feel like pulling your hair out people think your a bad parent because of his behaviour and think he's a bad child when you know he's got problems i would urge you not to give up just yet i've been there myself many a time things can seem so impossible but try to remember that your son has no more control over his behaviour than you have he probably feels as impotent about it as you do he will have no idea why he behaves that way or how he can stop himself he is a lost little boy who needs a hand finding the right way to go remember that regardless of how nasty people are you are not a bad parent and your son is not a bad child good luck Asperger syndrome Social rule Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autism rights movement Theory of conduct Massage Fecal incontinence Adult attention-deficit disorder Human sexual behavior Insomnia Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Kodocha Spanking Dog Childbirth Drowning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Professional wrestling holds Ludwig Wittgenstein Professional wrestling attacks Procrastination Infantilism Swimming Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling aerial techniques Controversies in autism Goodness and value theory Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Methylphenidate Theodore Kaczynski Professional wrestling slang Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Poker jargon Sleep Weight training Cephalic disorder Scientology beliefs and practices Pitaten Eczema Abortion debate Boxing Dog training Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story Combat stress reaction EastEnders Autism epidemic Hyperthermia Bondage (BDSM) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Piccolo Junior Saga Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Autistic spectrum Puberty Violin Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jam (TV series) Hey Jude Children of Dune Chlorpromazine Meat Loaf Obsessive-compulsive disorder Ron Weasley Diving suit Son Gohan Migraine Vulcan (Star Trek) Eddie Guerrero Medicine Anger management Sauna Martial art Transactional analysis StarCraft: Uprising Dragon Booster Columbine High School massacre Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Characters in the Smurfs The Invisibles Swingout
