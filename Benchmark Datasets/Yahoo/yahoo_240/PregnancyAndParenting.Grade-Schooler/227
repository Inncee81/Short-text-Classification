should i change what i call him my son is startin school this fall he has gone by nicky since birth but everyone is gettin on my case because they say i should start calling him nick since thats what he will want to go by when he gets a lil older should i have him start getting used to nick if you ask him his name he says its nicky so thats what he knows what would you do don't go by what other people tell you what the heck do they know what your kid likes my advice listen to your son if he likes nicky go with nicky when he reaches that age where he wants to go by something else then go with it your son should be the guide not what other people think or even you think your son has to live with the name so go with what he likes Nicky Wire The Marshall Mathers LP Avenue Q Knots Landing Nick Cannon Pepper Ann All That Boston Public Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Will Smith Nicky Campbell Empire Burlesque Garth Brooks Nicky Cruz The Adventures of Pete & Pete Family name Usher (entertainer) Rich Mullins Smiley Smile Doug Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Daz Dillinger My Family (television) 21st Century Emo Paris Hilton All Grown Up!
