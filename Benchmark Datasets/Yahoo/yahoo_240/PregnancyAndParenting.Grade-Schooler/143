children and walk don't walk lights i am interested in what other parents do my kids are and and have been taught by us and at school about traffic lights and walk and don't walk i was with my six year old son in cedar rapids a few weeks ago and the sign said don't walk one couldn't even see a car at all and we were slightly in a hurry so we walked across the street my son asked me why did we walk when the sign said not to and obviously i didn't have a good answer anyone else been in a similar situation i think i screwed up and should have patiently waited rather than send my son a mixed message what do you think when i was little my mum always made me and my brother wait until the lights changed but my dad would hurry us across streets if he thought it was safe my young brain told me that if daddy was there it was safe because he was a grown up and it was allowed i don't really condone that i work with kids and always make them wait but if you want to explain that to your children then they will probably understand say something like when you're a grown up you'll be able to tell when it's safe to cross a street but children must always always always wait for the 'walk' sign also explain exactly why you knew it was safe ie there were no cars at all and that you would never ever try to race across if you saw traffic coming Shaggy dog story About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
