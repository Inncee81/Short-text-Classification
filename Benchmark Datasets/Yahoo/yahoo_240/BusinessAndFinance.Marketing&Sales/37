does anyone know of a good website that will help me i'd like to patent an idea i have a few marketing idea's products i was wondering if someone know's of a legit company to get your idea going you can search the patents already on file at the u s patent and trademark office i added the search page below at least you can see if someone already has a patent for your idea just because you can't find the product online or in stores doesn't mean there isn't a patent i found this out for one of my ideas it just means the person didn't pursue marketing it for whatever reason be careful of the patent kits or inventors' kits because some of them are a marketing ploy and don't do much for your idea or it's a way for them to steal your idea by modifying it just enough to be able to say it wasn't stolen and then they go out and market your product if i were you i would research it myself first at the online patent site and if you think it's available go see a patent attorney good luck Intellectual property Trademark Public domain United States Patent and Trademark Office Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Google Alexander Graham Bell Pretty Good Privacy OpenDocument Patent application Amazon.com MP3 Insurance Copyleft Google search Spyware Person having ordinary skill in the art Software patent Copyright Xerox Star LexisNexis Theory of conduct Microprocessor IPod European Patent Organisation Monsanto File Allocation Table Yahoo!
