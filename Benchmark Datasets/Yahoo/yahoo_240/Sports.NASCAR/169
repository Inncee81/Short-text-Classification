good nascar quotes esp tony stewart i'm adding quotes to my facebook profile and i wanted to add one dealing with nascar it would be great if it was by tony stewart but if not thats ok anything that portrays nascar in a positive light for example some people say nascar isn't a sport maybe they're right its a way of life so any good suggestions oh i have some tony ones i'm going to say this because i know my fans like my brutal honesty every year all the competitors go out to the bar and try to get me drunk so i can't run the next day it didn't work this time for a fat kid like me it felt like mount everest i'm dying right now too tired to chase fences right now give me five minutes and i'll be ready i'm too lazy to work my real job i love what i do i've been doing it for years he's an idiot biffle they name streets after people like that one way and dead end i like the guy we play poker together but if i found him right now i'd strangle him if the car was here i don't think we would have the same problems in this series as we have stewart said he always had a way of letting drivers know where they stood and when to move and when not to move there's going to be someone else dead if nascar keeps letting good year supply us with these junky tires Tony Stewart Roush Racing NASCAR Indianapolis 500 Hendrick Motorsports Dale Earnhardt, Jr. NASCAR Rookie of the Year NEXTEL Cup Penske Racing Poker jargon Auto racing The Jim Rome Show The Catcher in the Rye Ernie Irvan Dodge Charger Craftsman Truck Series Drag racing Indy Racing League Indianapolis Motor Speedway EA Sports Moe Szyslak Sprint cars Chip Ganassi Racing Darlington Raceway Sin City Dale Earnhardt Casey Atwood Stock car racing NASCAR Video Games Darrell Waltrip The Contender (television series) Sim racing Tim Richmond Mark Martin (NASCAR) EastEnders Paul Is Dead Carl Edwards Friends NASCAR Realignment NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup Formula One Geoff Bodine Jamie McMurray Talladega Superspeedway Humphrey Bogart Dan Gurney Avenue Q Baseball May 2005 in sports Elliott Sadler 24 Hours of Le Mans Dead Like Me Bristol Motor Speedway Greg Biffle Knots Landing Jeff Gordon Terry Labonte April 2005 in sports Oasis (band) Robby Gordon Reggie Jackson Carburetor Ocean's Twelve Watkins Glen International The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie SPEED Channel Survivor (novel) Sears Holdings Corporation Lake Speed Pepsi 400 Cliff Richard Grand Prix Legends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sterling Marlin Touring car racing True Crime: Streets of LA Homer Simpson June 2005 in sports Papa's Got a Brand New Badge 1957 World Series Michael Schumacher Little Britain August 2005 in sports Galaxy Quest NASCAR Thunder 2004 Evernham Motorsports Champ Car Rod Stewart The Body (Short Story) Kodocha English cricket team Blood on the Tracks Richard Childress Racing Matt Kenseth Bill Davis Racing Ben Johnson (athlete) Tobacco advertising
