did nascar show its best or worst side in canada article on yahoo said nascar brought the best and worst to canada i think the worst was the best after that race i bet next year the crowds will be even bigger i think nascar owes robby a little thanks i can't speak for my fellow canadians but i don't think gordon's actions are going to cause many to jump off the nascar bandwagon up here it's funny that they'd even worry about it so much given that there are many of us who are already more than a little familiar with nascar you're not going to find jeff gordon on any pepsi machines here but it's not like we don't get coverage of every race the same as you do i've noticed little dropoff really since moving back to canada for fans who are on the fence about nascar in canada it's tough to determine which way they'll go so many of my canadian friends love f that it will be hard to convince them that racing three wide is the better choice but i just try telling them that it beats the heck out of watching an f race where the first lap leader is usually the guy who wins the race Tony Stewart Hendrick Motorsports Jeff Gordon NEXTEL Cup Richard Petty Darrell Waltrip Indianapolis 500 NASCAR Roush Racing Greg Sacks Casey Atwood Kevin Harvick Richard Childress Racing Talladega Superspeedway Robby Gordon Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
