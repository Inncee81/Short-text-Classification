can kyle petty win one more race before he ends his career as a big kyle petty fan i am afraid with his tnt broadcasting that he may be trying to end his career could he win just one more if he could what track does he have the best chance its a really nice thought and i too would love to see him win one more but in all reality probably won't happen but i'll say this that guy represents nascar like no one else yes he's the son of the king but kyle has carved his own niche in auto racing and no one can doubt his or his wife pattie's impact on the sport we all love it has given him many things throughout his life and it has also taken the ultimate from him i remember a race that kyle got taken out by a rookie mistake by someone can't remember whom but kyle instead of being as mad as a hornet simply went over to the guy had a heart to heart slapped his back and walked away pure class that guy be nice to have in him the booth soon full time but if anyone asks why i love nascar i can point to kyle and say find me an athlete in any other sport with half the heart that man has and i'll watch that sport too NASCAR Richard Petty Hendrick Motorsports Dale Earnhardt Tony Stewart Blood on the Tracks New York Giants Kyle Busch Kyle Petty Empire Burlesque Darrell Waltrip Bristol Motor Speedway Roush Racing Cliff Richard Kevin Harvick Terry Labonte Auto racing Dale Earnhardt, Jr. NASCAR Rookie of the Year Penske Racing Jeff Gordon SpongeBob SquarePants Talladega Superspeedway The Inside Tim Richmond Drag racing Indianapolis Motor Speedway NASCAR Thunder 2004 Jon Secada Indy Racing League Rusty Wallace Watkins Glen International Little Britain Sports timeline Humphrey Bogart Biff Tannen Ernie Irvan Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chicago Cubs Formula One Herb Thomas Kurt Busch The Jim Rome Show New Hampshire International Speedway New York Knicks Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Geoff Bodine Recurring South Park characters A Day in the Life Texas A&M University Clint Eastwood Pure Pwnage Ty Cobb Phoebe Halliwell February 2005 in sports Methos Martin Truex Jr. Kart racing Sim racing Tris Speaker Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Time Out of Mind Stock car racing New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Pittsburgh Steelers Carl Edwards Ayrton Senna Fox Broadcasting Company Evernham Motorsports Sprint cars Lake Speed A Course In Miracles Daytona 500 Tom Petty Charmed Reggie Jackson Indianapolis 500 Kyle Katarn Jim Thorpe Cyndi Lauper Sex and the City Major League Baseball television contracts Aerial (dance move) Darlington Raceway Hey Jude Sterling Marlin Eric Cartman Kyle Broflovski C__line Dion Jacky Ickx Roxette Chariot racing November 2004 in sports Amy Grant Subway 400
