is richard petty's record sort of like what barry bonds has just done in baseball i ask this because watching the historical accomplishment of hitting the most homeruns got me thinking about the king winning the most races you have to look at it in context and the situations surrounding them as they did their remarkable feats both are all time greats but are they the best ever petty and bonds would probably both be on almost everyone's top or lists in their respective sports but how many people will still put them even though there are valid questions as to how they did what they did i was just wondering if this made anyone else think about stuff and what those thoughts are i'm not trying to disrespect richard petty he's still an all time great and did a lot towards building the popularity of nascar matt c you're right about how most fans feel about each as a person but i don't know that everyone would say petty's record is shining gold he raced in an era of almost races a year until the modern era with some of those only being car fields the rules and regulations were a joke and who can forget the season where nobody had an answer to the supersized mopar engines it could be said that some of the king's cars were on steroids but yes he still had to drive them skillfully there are similarities and differences in comparing bonds and petty both hold records for what the fans of the respective sports deem extremely important petty wins bonds home runs both also accomplished their feats by having arguably superior equipment or in bonds' case i guess i should say it as equipment however i think the main difference between bonds and petty lies in the fans views toward them bonds is looked down on and dismissed by the fans and is carrying little respect and adoration with him into the record books while petty on the other hand is loved by everyone that could possibly call themselves nascar fans so in saying that i can't really compare petty's record to bonds' long story short according to the majority of the both fan bases respectively bonds' record is tainted petty's is shining gold Barry Bonds Baseball Sports timeline Richard Petty Troy Glaus St. Louis Cardinals NASCAR Dale Earnhardt Hendrick Motorsports Andr__s Galarraga Hank Aaron Darrell Waltrip NEXTEL Cup Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants Theory of conduct Penske Racing Auto racing New York Yankees Formula One Indianapolis 500 Dodge Charger Jeff Gordon Willie Mays Billboard Hot 100 Terry Labonte Bristol Motor Speedway Ted Williams Alex Rodriguez Major League Baseball television contracts Toronto Blue Jays Appeal History of baseball in the United States Major League Baseball Starfleet ranks and insignia Boston Red Sox Baseball Stars Drag racing James Bond Bobby Allison Talladega Superspeedway Chicago White Sox V8 Supercar Game show Table tennis Kevin Harvick The Jim Rome Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Tom Petty Tony Stewart Shaggy dog story Stock car racing New York Jets Chip Ganassi Racing Evernham Motorsports Nolan Ryan Roush Racing Softball The Game (rapper) Jos__ Canseco Playoff Warrant Officer Sammy Sosa Whose Line Is It Anyway?
