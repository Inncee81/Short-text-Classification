danica patrick all hype no substance alright here motor heads i am curious what the feedback on this will be i am frustrated by the amount of publicity that danica gets because she's a woman truly i don't think she's worth the hype that she was given she didn't earn anything she's a pretty face and led a few laps at an indy years ago who cares irl is a joke anyways that's why all their drivers are looking to try to jump to nascar it's not that i think that a woman will one day compete but i do believe that she has to earn it not just be given the hype look at bill lester one of the first african americans to race in nascar he said that he looked forward to the day that his story would not be newsworthy that's classy not the prissy little brat who stomps her feet when she's upset i've never seen dale jr stomp his feet up and down the track like a year old the comparison to bill lester is the difference between a person with honor and a spoiled brat they are both minorities in their respective sport that's exactly why i said if she came to nascar she would wreck everybody every time she passed a camera she would have to pose go jr Indianapolis 500 Danica Patrick Indy Racing League NEXTEL Cup Indianapolis Motor Speedway May 2005 in sports NASCAR California Speedway Dale Earnhardt Tony Stewart Ernie Irvan Penske Racing Talladega Superspeedway Hendrick Motorsports Roush Racing Darrell Waltrip Auto racing Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Ayrton Senna Sim racing The Jim Rome Show Bristol Motor Speedway Terry Labonte Craftsman Truck Series Drag racing Chip Ganassi Racing NASCAR Rookie of the Year Shaggy dog story New Hampshire International Speedway NASCAR Thunder 2004 24 Hours of Le Mans Tim Richmond Richard Childress Racing Lake Speed Oasis (band) Kevin Harvick American Championship Car Racing Richard Petty Formula One Champ Car September 2005 in sports Stock car racing Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
