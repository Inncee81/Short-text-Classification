nascar fans what do you think of your commentators in my part of the world they do not show nascar races anymore so i havent really watched a full race since i watch a few clips on youtube recently and i noticed that nascar commentators are boring as hell in the race in canada all hell was breaking loose there were cars spinning and overtaking during the yellow flag the commentators if anything talked even slower someone said that it was espn's nascar coverage crew that were boring but all the races commentary are all the same it all sounds like some announcement on c span or something what do you think as a hardcore f fan i would just like to say that the idiot bombarding this section with all those negative comments about nascar is not a regular over at the f section so don't hate on the rest of us because of the comments of one idiot i agree with the exception of fox coverage it's the best to me and d w makes it exciting try listening to it on the radio the announcers on there are a lot better than the ones on tv they are having to paint the picture so you can see it through their voice i listen on the radio when i'm not at home or when the dish goes out it's much more exciting than watching the race and having to listen to announcers that know nothing about nascar someone on here asked if anyone had tried listening to the radio announcers while watching the race on espn said it was great and now you have my cents worth hope it anwers your question drive for free the fox rules NASCAR Major League Baseball television contracts The Jim Rome Show Dale Earnhardt Indianapolis 500 Rush Limbaugh Penske Racing Tobacco advertising Craftsman Truck Series Richard Childress Racing WFAN (AM) Hendrick Motorsports Tony Stewart MLB on FOX The Star Wars Holiday Special Wheel of Fortune The Ashlee Simpson Show Bristol Motor Speedway SPEED Channel Auto racing Talladega Superspeedway The Price Is Right Ayrton Senna The Amazing Race Stock car racing The Simpsons Monday Night Football Sim racing Murray Walker Delta Goodrem Don Imus International League Watkins Glen International Phil Hendrie Baseball Poker jargon Opie and Anthony ESPN EA Sports SpongeBob SquarePants American Idiot NFL on television Darrell Waltrip Howard Stern Sharon Tate Ocean's Twelve Pop punk The Colbert Report Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Kevin Harvick 2005 United States Grand Prix Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Formula One 2000 Australian Grand Prix Indy Racing League Have I Got News For You David Beckham Gramophone record John Layfield Jeff Gordon Mystery Science Theater 3000 Sonic Youth MTV Garth Brooks National Public Radio 50 Cent Vin Scully I Am Furious Yellow The Daily Show The Goon Show Racing flags Michael Schumacher Fahrenheit 9/11 Indianapolis Motor Speedway Fox Broadcasting Company Edward R.
