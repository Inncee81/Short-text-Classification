who thinks robby gordon is an embarassment to our country when he purposely took out marcos ambrose ignored all the black flags and took away kevin harvick's moment of glory in the debut race in montreal btw robby did apologize to his fans at www robbygordon com but no one even goes there except the few fans he has he is a disgrace to our country to nascar why doesn't it surprise me that the bush car fans blame nascar when robby clearly ignored all black flags then pretended to win he made more of a fool of himself than he a ready is http sports yahoo com nascar news slug ap nascar gordonsuspended prov ap type lgns you r right about juan pablo montoya took out his team mate pruette and that was in mexio i had forgotten about that one i have personally been to a race where i saw robby taking other racers out on purpose so i guess robby was just being himself and he got caught this time he deserves to pay to nascar fan i know that is jeff burton in the cup but in the bush race robby gordon is number i would never say anything about burton but jeff gordon will always be the best like he is now ok i get what you all said not to our country but he was definately wrong in what he did by ignoring the official's black flag when he caused the caution and still kept right on going in that little world of his he is definately an embarassment to nascar ok my bad i gave inaccurate info on robby when i said that he caused the caution what really happened was that he banged ambrose on the re start then later ambrose hit gordon as the caution came out and now that i have read all of your answers and have read more info on this i now believe that gordon was right except for the fact that he did not maintain his speed during the caution it's really hard for the drivers to even know when the caution comes out because up stairs they look at different t v s at different angles and then decide whether or not to put out the caution any other comments will be appreciated like i said my bad i should have had all the facts for making such a snap judgement and for that i do apologize http www nascar com news headlines cup rgordon reaction penalty html for his actions taken when nascar had ordered him to do something i do know nascar was partially at fault but his response was uncalled for its ridiculous he should be banned from the sport permantly now that was childish and uncalled for very detrimental to the sport robby gordon no class and this is not the first time he has done something stupid also remember at daytona he throws something on the track on the back stretch to cause a caution they need to do something about this little baby NASCAR Richard Childress Racing Dale Earnhardt Jeff Gordon Roush Racing Kevin Harvick Auto racing Talladega Superspeedway Craftsman Truck Series Chip Ganassi Racing Tony Stewart Penske Racing Robby Gordon New Hampshire International Speedway Dale Earnhardt, Jr. 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Drag racing NEXTEL Cup Lake Speed Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
