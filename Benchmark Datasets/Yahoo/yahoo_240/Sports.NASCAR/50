did earnhardt jr win its about time the bum won a race if he figgures to hang around nascar very long no he didn't win but he will when his contract negotiations came into play i did not care where he went as long as it was with rcr gibbs or hendrick in which case he did he needs that strong leadership of these types of organizations i think next year we will all see a difference in jr's perfomance and dispel once and for all that he can drive he has two busch championships lest anyone forget that and since he has been in cup he lost his icon of a father and has had to carry the name the organization and everything else on his shoulders he didn't even own the rights to his own name until last year so i think with that said lets give jr time to come into his own i think we will see good things for him to the dismay of all the jr haters i am sure Hendrick Motorsports Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Richard Childress Racing Roush Racing Kevin Harvick NASCAR Dale Earnhardt Tony Stewart Terry Labonte Jeff Gordon NASCAR Rookie of the Year NEXTEL Cup Penske Racing Joe Gibbs Tim Richmond Greg Sacks Kyle Busch Jeff Green (NASCAR) Kurt Busch Martin Truex Jr. Jimmie Johnson Craftsman Truck Series Busch Series Bill Davis Racing Darrell Waltrip Chip Ganassi Racing Geoff Bodine Joe Gibbs Racing Richard Petty Stock car racing FC Rostov Carl Edwards Jason Leffler Derrike Cope Casey Atwood Talladega Superspeedway Rusty Wallace Matt Kenseth Lake Speed Daytona International Speedway Bristol Motor Speedway Evernham Motorsports Rich Bickle Bobby Hillin, Jr. MB2/MBV Motorsports Watkins Glen International International Race of Champions Brett Bodine New Hampshire International Speedway Auto racing Adam Petty Jamie McMurray NASCAR Realignment Mark Martin (NASCAR) California Speedway Detroit Red Wings Riverside International Raceway Dover International Speedway Sterling Marlin NASCAR Thunder 2004 October 2004 in sports NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup Atlanta Motor Speedway Bill Elliott JJ Yeley Brazil national football team Washington Redskins Neil Bonnett June 2005 in sports Reggie Jackson Greg Biffle Harry Hyde Robby Gordon Pocono Raceway Adrian Fernandez Trade union Bobby Hamilton Elliott Sadler Nashville Superspeedway Christian Fittipaldi Chris Amon Lowe's Motor Speedway Tennessee Titans Shawn Michaels Brian Close Alcohol advertising Alan Kulwicki Indianapolis Motor Speedway Norway national football team St. Louis Cardinals Kyle Petty Felix Sabates Contract May 2005 in sports Nick Faldo English cricket team Table tennis Denis Law
