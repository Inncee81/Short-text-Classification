battery life lithium ion primary battery im getting a laptop and i was wondering how many hours a whr cell lithium ion primary battery or a whr cell lithium ion primary battery last the more cells and the higher the whr rating the longer the charge will last lithium ion batteries are the some of the best if not the best right now there is no difinitive answer for how long they will last because that is determined by how much demand you put on the unit while you are using it Lithium ion battery Battery (electricity) Lithium ion polymer battery Battery electric vehicle Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Action potential Lithium Laptop Hybrid vehicle Galileo spacecraft IPod Hydrogen economy PowerBook Membrane potential Bipolar disorder Electrolysis Nuclear fusion Fusion power Ion Cardiac action potential Non-volatile memory Game Boy Advance SP Galvanic cell Hydride Future energy development Diode Nuclear weapon design Plasma (physics) Resting potential Cathode Technetium Ionic bond Geomagnetic storm AC Propulsion tzero Anode Carbon dioxide Lewis Urry Liquid crystal display Electrochemical potential Zinc-carbon battery Current (electricity) Bussard ramjet Potassium Electrophysiology Hydrochloric acid Lithium aluminium hydride Electric vehicle Electrochemistry Ion channel Torpedo Stroke Solar car Capillary electrophoresis Solar power Baseball Corona discharge Senescence Segway HT Myocardial infarction Electrolyte Signal transduction Specific impulse Pyroxene GED Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Toyota Prius Solar cell Nintendo Particle accelerator Rocket fuel Automated analyser Thermal power station Kidney Electrospray ionization Tritium Deep Space 1 Protein sequencing Spacecraft propulsion Cancer Cowon Radiation hardening Cell (biology) Ion thruster Lead-acid battery STS-87 Bicycle lighting Floppy disk Proton Electromotive force Television commercial Mass spectrometry Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Ionizing radiation Chromatography Tapwave Zodiac Lithium chloride Redox Pleiades (star cluster)
