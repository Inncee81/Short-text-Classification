laptop screen won't turn on any ideas i have a gateway gz notebook and it seems to like to give me a hard time lately i've been leaving it on for a few days at a time and just closing the lid at night instead of turning it off when i open it in the morning it turns on just fine from standby i did that last night at about am and when i woke up at and opened the notebook the screen wouldn't come on i've tried restarting a few thousand times pulling out the cord and starting it from battery only pulling out the battery and starting from the cord only just anything out of desperation mwahahah it just won't turn on when i turn the computer on the fan starts up and the caps lock and numlock lights light up but then they turn back off and won't come on again the lights that stay on are the power light the charging light and what i believe is the wireless internet indication light i've gone to all sorts of support sites and found nothing it's an lcd screen but it seems to be a computer problem alltogether there should also be a light for hard drive usually one with something that looks like disks stacked one on top of each other if that one does not blink at all then your hard drive might have died if that's the problem then you can take it to a repair center and they might be able to recover your data if that's not the problem well still take it to a repair center anyways if it's under warranty replace 'repair center' by 'manufacturer' in all the sentences i wrote above Windows XP Mouse (computing) ThinkPad PowerBook Hard disk IBM PC compatible Embedded system IPod Liquid crystal display Floppy disk IMac IBook Atari ST Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis System/36 Canon T90 Sega Saturn Universal Serial Bus Windows 2000 Toyota Prius Game Boy Advance Bluetooth Thermal power station Computer PlayStation Portable USB flash drive Sharp Zaurus System/34 Pinball Desknote Personal computer Stereoscopy Desktop computer Digital photography Wi-Fi Game Boy Television 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Redundant array of independent disks Oscilloscope 24 Hours of Le Mans Handheld game console Commodore International Vacuum tube USS Yorktown (CV-5) The Time Machine De Lorean DMC-12 Steven Wright USS Aylwin (DD-355) Iditarod Wind power USS San Francisco (CA-38) Second Battle of the Atlantic Apple II family USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Hoel (DD-533) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Computer virus Apple Macintosh USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Thresher (SS-200) Altair 8800 Xbox 360 Sega Traffic light Blue screen of death Nintendo DS Nintendo Entertainment System IBM PC Nintendo Computer forensics Master Control Program USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Copy protection Incandescent light bulb Voice over IP Sinclair Research Ltd History of Microsoft Windows Hybrid vehicle Poker jargon CPU design Xbox USS Waters (DD-115) IPod nano Commodore 64 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Macintosh Portable USS Wichita (CA-45) Solar power Early IBM disk storage Atari 8-bit family Apple Computer USS Washington (BB-56) USS Terry (DD-513) Amiga Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
