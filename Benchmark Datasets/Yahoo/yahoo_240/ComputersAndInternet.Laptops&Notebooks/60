in the market for a laptop i am just starting to look at laptops and would like to spend under i dont know too much about whats out there since ive never owned one before what are good brands to go for and what brands do i stay away from what key components hardware should i look for when buying the laptop will be used for lots of office documents and internet use basically for college work hp is the best in my opinion they are the top of the line compaq is owned by hp but is like the toyota and hp is the lexus acer can be ok but i don't like them dells are horrible sony and toshiba are very good as well as hp when buying a laptop look for at least a gb of ram which is your memory speed of the computer gb is top notch right now in a laptop look for a amd dual core processor amd is a little better than intel but either will do as long as it dual core or says x on it this means that it has two processors that can process twice as much but not speed just handling wise the ram is where your speed will come in because the more ram you have the easier the computer can find things and the fast it will work look for at least gb or higher hard drive which is your space to save things on the computer but those are the basics to buying a computer so good luck Laptop AMD Microprocessor Compaq IBM PC Windows XP Hewlett-Packard MIPS architecture Timeline of computing 1990-forward PowerBook Pentium 4 Computer 64-bit PlayStation 3 Apple II family Personal computer PowerPC Floppy disk IBM NX bit Overclocking Athlon Computer workstation Embedded system Wintel Central processing unit History of Microsoft Windows Athlon 64 Cyrix X86 Random access memory IBook Pentium M History of computing hardware (1960s-present) AMD64 VIA Technologies Mac OS X TRS-80 Dual-core Desktop computer Transmeta Amstrad CPC Opteron Pentium Cell (microprocessor) ZX Spectrum Hard disk Atari ST PlayStation 2 Sun Microsystems Sound Blaster Celeron EMachines Dell, Inc.
