wireless keyboard conflicts with built in keyboard help i just purchased a wireless keyboard for my laptop and now it conflicts with my built in keyboard help i'm running xp and want to switch between the two different keyboards instead of having it recognise just the wireless one there was nothing wrong with the wireless mouse but the keyboard definitely conflicted it's strange because using usb port external keyboards were not a problem it's just the wireless keyboard that conflicted i don't have a wireless keyboard so i can't exactly give you personal experience suggestions but i do have a few wireless mice since the mice i have are usb devices they need specific drivers to function i installed the provided software to operate them logitech provided the drivers on my laptop i am able to use the wireless mouse and the track pad at the same time also i can remove the wireless mouse by turning it off or disabling it and continue to use the track pad i strongly believe that both keyboards cannot be used simultaneously because of a shared resource restriction if you want to switch from wireless to non wireless then you should disable or turn off power to the wireless device to see if you can switch Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Bluetooth IMac USB flash drive Windows XP Apple Macintosh Wi-Fi Windows 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Laptop IBook Personal computer Desktop computer Nintendo Revolution Microsoft Windows X Window System IBM PC compatible Computer IPod Device driver Floppy disk Apple Computer Xbox AmigaOS Computer keyboard Atari ST BlackBerry History of Microsoft Windows Computer and video games Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Secure Digital card Mac mini Verizon Wireless Architecture of Windows 2000 Cheating in Counter-Strike Amstrad CPC Modem Computer surveillance X10 (industry standard) Wireless LAN WordPerfect Game controller Danger Hiptop Booting PowerBook Speech recognition PowerPC IBM PC PlayStation 2 Hard disk Super Nintendo Entertainment System OpenBSD Linux Tablet PC Wireless Application Protocol Digital photography Object Desktop USB mass storage device class Tungsten Handheld Ethernet PlayStation Portable IPAQ Atari 8-bit family Surveillance Computer bus PlayStation 3 Modchip Wireless Sharp Zaurus Nintendo DS Windows Vista ZX Spectrum WiMAX FireWire Closed-circuit television Computer hardware OpenGL Control-Alt-Delete Xbox 360 Mobile phone VMware Cellular network Telephone PCI Express Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Opera (web browser) Palm OS AlphaSmart Flash memory TGV Hearing impairment Internet Computer accessibility PIC microcontroller
