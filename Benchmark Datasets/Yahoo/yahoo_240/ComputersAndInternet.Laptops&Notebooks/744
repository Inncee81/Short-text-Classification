secure does this mean another person can log into my network i set up my wireless network the other day and secured it today i noticed two odd things i notice when i connect to it the key is already there and all i have to do is click connect its in bullets but the key is already there i don't have to put it in the second thing i noticed is just to see just how secure it is i decided to put in a different figure for the key to see if it will connect and it did does this mean that my neighbor can pick up my network and put just anything in the key box and connect to it although i secured it how do i fix this i thought it was secure did you punch in a key your self its usually a wep key digit or digit depending on which you used you can use the digit and of the time they are not going to get in but if you tried on your computer your computer may have bumped the changed key and auto connected using the other key it will go down your wireless list until it finds a connection but that will only work on a computer that already has the key to begin with if someone does not have the key they can not log on to your wireless network try connecting to your network with another computer that does not have the key and try different keys to log on it will not log on i have a laptop and if i move the main connection to the bottom i can try to connect to my connection with a different key it will try then it will move down the list of known connections til it connects if it can you can also look to see if your using windows to manage your wireless it will say secured or padlock type note if it says that your are pretty much safe from the average computer user thanks Wi-Fi Wardriving Public-key cryptography Windows XP Bluetooth Wireless LAN Password 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Modem Wired Equivalent Privacy Windows 2000 Pretty Good Privacy Wi-Fi Protected Access USB flash drive PlayStation Portable Freenet BlackBerry Computer Wireless access point Global Positioning System Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible IEEE 802.11i AirPort Computer security Internet Telegraphy Internet Relay Chat Telephone Cable television Closed-circuit television Palm OS Computer virus GSM services Lock picking Rootkit Common Unix Printing System Apple Macintosh E-mail Mac OS X Transmission Control Protocol Wireless mesh network MDAC Phase-shift keying Database Vertical service code Cellular network Secure Shell Hash table Floppy disk Cryptanalysis Surveillance Computer keyboard Spyware Computer forensics Password cracking Embedded system History of Microsoft Windows Malware Google Talk Geographic information system Cisco Systems Domain Name System File system System/34 Television Xbox File sharing Laptop Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Security token IPod Network Switching Subsystem IEEE 802.11 Wireless network Nortel Networks Cryptography Mobile phone Extensible Authentication Protocol Gmail Enterprise content management Cryptographic hash function Passphrase HTTP cookie Acorn Computers Nintendo GameCube Control-Alt-Delete Windows Vista Personal computer Steam (content delivery) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Apple Open Collaboration Environment Btrieve Java programming language Friend-to-friend Skype RC4 NSA encryption systems
