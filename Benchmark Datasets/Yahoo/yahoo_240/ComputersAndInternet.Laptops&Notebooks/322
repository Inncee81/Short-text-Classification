my niece is going to college and she needs a computer should i get her a laptop or notebook computer i'm going to assume that by notebook you mean desktop i hope i'm not wrong in that laptops are awesome for college students it allows them to take notes quickly and comfortably during class and allow for really easy search and find functions when reviewing their notes however you need to ask her what all she'll be using it for personally i used my computer for a lot more when i was at college gaming programming watching tv etc for those types of things a laptop that would be powerful enough gets very expensive very quickly desktops have the distinct advantage there i went my whole college career with only a desktop in my room and the old fashioned pen and paper in the classrooms and did just fine however i do see that a laptop would have been a really nice luxury in short find out what she wants a computer for if it will mainly be used for taking notes and instant messaging spring for the laptop it'll be more convenient but if she wants a graphics card a bunch of memory and a ton of storage for games videos music it may be a lot more economical to get a good desktop Laptop IBM PC compatible Personal computer Desktop computer Computer PowerBook Windows XP Apple Macintosh Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows ATI Technologies Computer hardware Commodore 64 Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Floppy disk Atari ST Wi-Fi Desknote Linux Microprocessor IMac Supercomputer CPU design Linked list Computer bus Notebook Radeon OpenGL Musical Instrument Digital Interface RISC Computer virus Mouse (computing) Computer and video games Expert system Calculator Oscilloscope Bluetooth Atari 8-bit family Google Desktop PC Engine Internet AmigaOS Crown Court 2D computer graphics Digital photography Apple IIGS Desktop publishing Read-only memory IBM PC Pretty Good Privacy Cruising (maritime) PlayStation 3 Bubble Bobble ThinkPad Stereoscopy Palm OS Wearable computer Portable Document Format Lisp programming language University of Massachusetts Amherst Java programming language Mach kernel BASIC programming language GNOME Graphics card Extreme Programming Graphics processing unit The Inside Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Windows 2000 Computer forensics America Online IBook Halting problem Machinima GED PLATO Computer workstation Acadia University Google Bridgewater State College Embedded system Computer and video game genres Memory card Screenshot One-time pad PostScript Internet fraud Pentium M Video game music X Window System USB flash drive Object Desktop Burroughs B5000
