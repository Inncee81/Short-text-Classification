hard drive rpm affect gaming i'm soon going to get a dell inspiron mostly for media and gaming question is if i upgrade the hard drive from rpm to rpm both are gb sata hard drives would i notice any significant difference while playing games and or in general and will there be any side effects like uses more battery power etc note laptop will have mb nvidia geforce m gt and gb ram if that helps any getting intel core duo t ghz mhz fsb mb cache a t an gt and gigs should be a extremely good setup for a the rpm is only good if you want faster load times but game performance will be exactly the same if you need to sacrifice anything because of money this is the order you should do it downgrade hard drive to rpm downgrade memory to gig but keeping in mind that adding an additional gig in the future is a must downgrade processor to anything lower than the t downgrade video card this is a last resort option only and no battery should not be affected that much by a rpm hard drive probably no more than minutes if it's used regularly Pentium 4 PowerBook ATI Technologies Apple Macintosh Athlon Radeon Pentium M Hard disk Celeron PlayStation 3 PowerPC Overclocking Xbox 360 IBook Xbox NVIDIA Xeon CPU cache Laptop PC Engine Pentium III GeForce 4 IBM PC PowerBook G4 IBM PC compatible Floppy disk Atari ST GeForce 2 Redundant array of independent disks Windows XP NForce4 Radeon X Series AMD 3dfx ZX Spectrum Nintendo 64 Windows Vista PlayStation Portable Front side bus Apple II family Xserve PlayStation 2 Graphics card Central processing unit ThinkPad Pentium D RISC Toyota Prius PowerPC G4 Windows 2000 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis GeForce FX MIPS architecture Power Macintosh G3 Nintendo Revolution Personal computer Atari 8-bit family Itanium 2 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Turbocharger Graphics processing unit DDR2 SDRAM Acorn Archimedes Cyrix CPU design GeForce Doom 3 Sega Dreamcast Far Cry Game Boy Amstrad CPC EMac MIM-23 Hawk Gramophone record Mandriva Linux Sega Saturn Mac OS X VIA C3 NForce2 Sharp Zaurus Optimization (computer science) Moore's law X86 assembly language VIA Technologies GeForce 7 Series Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sinclair ZX81 Dual-core The Sims 2 IA-32 Super Nintendo Entertainment System TRS-80 Serial ATA Commodore 128
