in a laptop can graphics card be changed like ram i have an intel gma card with mb shared ram is it possible to get it replaced by a gforce one have a standalone ram for your case and most laptops the answer is no your's cannot be changed because it is an integrated graphics card meaning there is no real graphics card in your computer you cannot upgrade graphic cards on most laptops because they are built right on the motherboard for heat space reasons there are in fact some laptops that video cards can be upgraded these laptops use a mxm or later type of connection that lets the user install a graphic card with the same kind of connection but this does not even guarantee you it is upgradeable even if the laptop does have an mxm video card connection that is no guarantee the card will physically fit in the laptop right now very few laptops support this kind of function those being only top of the line laptops like the asus c s or top of the line clevo computers even if you own one of those laptops and can find a card that uses the same type of connection and physically fits in the laptop it is still a poor choice to upgrades because it is extremely expensive it is just best to think of laptops being unupgradeable expcept for ram and the hdd of course Laptop IBM PC compatible Atari ST Windows XP Personal computer Desktop computer PowerBook Hard disk Windows 2000 Windows Vista Computer ATI Technologies PC Engine History of Microsoft Windows Wi-Fi Apple Macintosh Computer bus Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X v10.4 Bluetooth Mac OS X Radeon Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 64 Floppy disk Graphics card Apple IIGS TRS-80 Color Computer PC motherboard Timeline of computing 1990-forward IMac Graphics processing unit Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 IBM PC CPU cache GeForce 6 Series NVIDIA Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBook Power Macintosh G3 Xbox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Overclocking Computer hardware Sound Blaster Windows 3.x GeForce 4 Cyrix IPod Commodore 128 AmigaOS Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 ZX Spectrum Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Nintendo GameCube AMD IA-32 Sinclair ZX81 Acorn Electron Intel Counter-Strike BBC Micro Object Desktop Apple Intel transition Pentium 4 CPU design Motherboard System 7 (Macintosh) Random access memory PlayStation Portable X Window System Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI Express Sun Microsystems Virtual memory Pentium M Capacitor plague Mac mini Amstrad CPC BIOS Softmodem Dynamic random access memory Commodore PET Modchip Color Graphics Adapter ThinkPad Acorn Computers IPAQ Linux Burroughs B5000 PowerPC Trusted computing S3 Graphics Server Nintendo 64
