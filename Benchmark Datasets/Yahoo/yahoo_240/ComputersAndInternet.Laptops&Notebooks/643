blue screen comes up as i am trying to re install windows after i did system recovery help i've been having problems with my laptop the blue screen keeps coming up so i decided to do a system recovery my laptop has this system recovery and windows vista setup built into a separate partition it's restored my c drive but as it's going through the vista setup the blue screen comes up again please help me thank you hi julie the blue screen or blue screen of death is normally a sign of a hardware problem or failure and theres not much can go wrong on a laptop however one of the main problems with laptops is the vents which keep the laptops cpu and mainboard cool this is a small vent on the side and rear of the laptop and you can hear it when the laptop is running however after time the vents become blocked with dust and muck and if it gets too bad and the c p u and mainboard start to overheat then you will start to experience blue screen errors and crashes the blue screens are normally saftey features built into vista to stop any further damage to your processor and other internal components i recommend you clean these vents out with a air duster one of these http direct tesco com q r aspx and blast out the dirt and muck from the area of the vents this is totally safe to do as the air duster only blasts with compressed air so no solvents are used after you have done this leave for about minutes and then boot back up upon boot press the f key to enter set up and then you will enter bios find the option to set to bios defaults or set failsafe defaults this will set your laptop to settings that will work every time these wont be allways the best settings but at least they will work after you have done this remember to press save and exit set up to save your changes to cmos during the save to cmos do not switch off your laptop this could damage your p c s bios and in the case of a laptop this could mean certain doom once all this has been done you can re try installing the windows vista recovery as windows vista set up is quite a technical installation the stress put on your processor during installation can make your processor get too hot and this is whats making your laptop crash andd display the blue screen if this continues to occur then you need to take the laptop to a experienced p c technician not p c world for some further diagnostics any more advice or problems let me know good luck julie Windows XP Blue screen of death Hard disk IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Windows 2000 Laptop Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Booting Mouse (computing) Redundant array of independent disks Oscilloscope BIOS Knoppix Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk IPod Microprocessor Embedded system PowerBook AmigaOS TRS-80 DragonFly BSD NTFS Capacitor plague PC Engine Virtual memory NX bit Power-On Self Test CPU design Personal computer M16 (rifle) Spyware Linux Sega Dreamcast Space disaster System/34 Television Apple Intel transition Commodore 64 Atari 8-bit family CPU cache Mercury Atlas 6 System/36 Emacs Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer forensics Black screen of death PaX Modchip Computer virus Mac OS X Motorola 68000 Jet engine Mac OS X v10.4 Universal Serial Bus ZX Spectrum Galileo spacecraft Partition (computing) Windows Server 2003 PlayStation Portable Central processing unit Windows Me IMac Overclocking Bluetooth Dodge Charger Mozilla Firefox MDAC Sinclair ZX81 Apple II family Upper Memory Area Thermostat Screenshot OpenGL Sega Saturn PowerBook G4 Amstrad CPC Supercomputer Desktop computer Windows registry Thermal power station RISC Wintel Unicode Acorn Computers
