general laptop question i'm looking into buying a new laptop and was wondering what brands models people thought were the best i don't need anything particularly fancy i mainly just use it for internet music storage and word processing i currently have a dell which has served me fairly well although now it's incredibly slow even after defrag and checking for spyware and i get the occasional blue screen of death thanks well to my knowledge dell has a large problem with blue screening even after a brand new purchase of a dell laptop my girlfriend had a blue screen times the first day she used it along with other friends who have them they have been a problem gateway is a good brand i have a gateway and have experienced a few problems but my warranty covered everything everyone has their own opinion i'd just say steer clear from hp and dell look on websites for reviews is another suggestion Windows XP Laptop IBM PC compatible IPod Commodore International Spyware Desktop computer Digital audio player Oscilloscope Floppy disk Best Buy Surveillance Dell, Inc.
