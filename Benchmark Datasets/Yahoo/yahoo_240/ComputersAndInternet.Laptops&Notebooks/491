if i bought a mac book ok this might sound stupid but i've been a pc user all my life i need a notebook for school and i was wondering if i bought a macbook and since it wouldn't have microsoft office how would i create presentations like with something similar to powerpoint and then play them on the school's computer and then also if i created a document like similar to word how would i be able to transfer it to the school's computer to print it if i had to would they be compatible can i create documents and presentations on a mac notebook and then plug my flash drive into a pc and have it work hope this makes sense thanks or does it have microsoft office i'm so confused which is better mac or pc ok so if you create something with iworks how can you show it or present it on a non mac computer i don't get it does it just work because i can't show my mom any of my powerpoints because she doesn't have powerpoint so i just don't get it can someone please explain macs are very easy to switch to you're microsoft documents presentations will still work with either microsoft's office for mac or it works with apple's iwork both need to be purchased unfortunately however i strongly recommend switching to a macbook i myself bought one and i love it to answer all your questions yes everything is compatible Apple Macintosh Microsoft Office Microsoft PowerPoint Laptop WordPerfect ITunes Mac OS X Apple Computer IBM PC compatible Pages AppleWorks Floppy disk Copy protection Keynote (software) Personal computer Mouse (computing) Apple II family Amiga Microsoft Word Computer virus History of Microsoft Windows Ashton-Tate Mac OS X v10.4 Hard disk File Allocation Table Microsoft Commodore 64 Macintosh Plus HyperCard Linux Microsoft Excel Digital rights management TRS-80 Perl Stardock System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Windows ILife AmigaOS Universal Serial Bus Unicode Windows Vista X Window System CP/M Wine (software) Thread (computer science) Visual Basic Icon (computing) PowerPC USB flash drive MS-DOS OpenDocument Apple IIGS IMac Windows XP Atari 8-bit family Computer and video games File system Mozilla Firefox OpenStep TeX History of the graphical user interface Mac OS BASIC programming language Atari ST Trusted computing Mach kernel Killian documents Vorbis Peer-to-peer ITunes Music Store QuickTime Computer GNU General Public License Common Unix Printing System Emacs Portable Document Format ZX Spectrum Object-oriented programming Screenshot Secure Digital card XML Opera (web browser) Keyboard layout Desktop computer Xerox Star Mac OS history Mac mini WebObjects MSN Messenger Computer forensics
