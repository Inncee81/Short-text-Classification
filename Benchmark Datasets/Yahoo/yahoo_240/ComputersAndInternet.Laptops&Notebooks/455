which graphics card is better im looking to buy a laptop and im a gamer dont know if i should go with the macbook pro with its nvidia geforce m gt or hp's mb nvidia geforce m gs which is a better computer well because it is a laptop one thing you need to be wary about is the shared memory or hyper memory or something like that it usually say something like this vga xxxxx mb shared if you spot something like this do not buy it means that the vga have mb only if you cut some ram and distributed it for example gb ram with mb vga dedicated up to mb that mean if you want your vga to be you have to cut you ram and add it to vga otherwise it will only be in the end it will be something like this mb ram you transfer mb to vga with mb vga in the end it done nothing vga and ram is working together very closely you cannot got a good frame rate with one and not without the other so look for the one without share memory another thing i don't think macbook is well suited for playing games even if you can use windows on apple well it's just not comfortable imho ATI Technologies 3dfx Radeon GeForce 4 Graphics processing unit Graphics card Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Video Graphics Array GeForce 2 GeForce 6 Series PlayStation 3 GeForce FX Xbox Nintendo GameCube GeForce Windows Vista Doom 3 GeForce 256 DDR2 SDRAM GeForce 7 Series IMac Radeon X Series Computer bus PC Engine History of Microsoft Windows Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic IPAQ GeForce 3 Sega Dreamcast Xbox 360 PCI Express AMD TRS-80 Color Computer Monkey Island Windows XP Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Timeline of computing 1990-forward Far Cry TRS-80 Laptop Apple Computer Random access memory Acorn Archimedes Sequent Computer Systems PowerBook G4 Dawn (demo) History of computer and video games PowerBook Windows 1.0 Mac OS X IPod IBook Personal computer Digital Visual Interface Windows 3.x PlayStation Portable Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Commodore 64 Display resolution IBM Personal System/2 Power Macintosh G3 Scalable Link Interface Computer and video games Quake Apple II family First-person shooter Overclocking World of Warcraft Amstrad CPC Windows 2000 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mac mini Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Windows Original Amiga chipset System 7 (Macintosh) ZX Spectrum Sound Blaster Quest for Glory Library (computer science) VIA Technologies Mouse (computing) OpenGL Deus Ex: Invisible War Apple IIGS Super Video Graphics Array Amiga SCUMM FIFA Series RISC Dynamic random access memory Accelerated Graphics Port
