are there roles for tweens i have a talent agent but my mm was telling me there are not alot of roles for year olds is that true i know what you're talking about and your mom is absolutely right a few years go when i had first joined my agency i was getting frustrated because there were practically no auditions for people my age however i'm almost and i've noticed that there are much more roles for than for it's based on groups the young kids like then preteens like then young teens like but when it comes to and producers just say what the heck we'll just cast a or year old kid to play or they would rather have someone older that's not a minor and can drive be able to work etc than have a real year old but bottom line is the vast majority of roles that an agent will get are for year olds it also depends on your region since the dallas region needs more year olds that's why my agent is the way it is just hang in there you'll get a real good job eventually and it'll be worth it Shit Neopets Kate Moss Corporate governance Objective-C Advertising America's Next Top Model Web banner Stuff (magazine) Micropayment Network effect Chris O'Donnell Ken Chu Online advertising Craigslist Internationalization and localization Richard Cromwell (actor) Legal research The Ashlee Simpson Show The Best Page in the Universe Internet fraud Wendy's Care Bears Sanford and Son Craps Team Fortress Classic Rich Mullins Sharon Stone Claudia Schiffer Attack of the Show!
