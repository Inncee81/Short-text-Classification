i am auditioning for guys and dolls and i need some general acting dance and voice tips to get a good part i've been in plays before so i have the basics down i really want the part of sky masterson so how should i mold my character i am actually in a production of guys and dolls right now i play sarah brown so i'm pretty familiar with sky's character since he's sarah's romantic lead in the show your best bet would be to watch the movie and see how brando does the role very suave and debonair very confident in himself maybe even a little cocky it isn't until he falls in love with sarah that he becomes unsure of himself and much more likeable sky is like a big football jock at the high school not afraid to make big crazy bets well known by all the other gamblers in new york and claims he can get any doll he wants however you should probably make sure not to overdo the role the actor playing sky in the production i'm in does a very good job drawing the line between a believable character and a caricature the difference a caricature more or less is making fun of a stereotype instead of being a believable character if you're not much of a singer don't worry about it sky's songs are fairly easy and if a sarah is cast with a strong voice it'll be even easier as most of sky's songs are duets not much dancing is involved with sky's role either there's a little dancing when sky and sarah go to havana and a little bit of dancing in sky's big music number luck be a lady tonight other than that the role is fairly simple no matter what part you end up getting guys and dolls is one of the most fun musicals i've ever been a part of and you're sure to have fun too just remember not to overdo it and it should all be smooth sailing have fun and break a leg Marlon Brando Rod Stewart Cliff Richard Jon Secada Whitney Houston Jennifer Lopez Sarah Jessica Parker Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Janet Jackson Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Craps Cyndi Lauper Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Actor David Bowie Spice Girls Eric Cartman Ed, Edd n Eddy Sinfest AFI 100 Years series Recurring South Park characters Ray Winstone Britney Spears The Jazz Singer Can't Hardly Wait The O.C.
