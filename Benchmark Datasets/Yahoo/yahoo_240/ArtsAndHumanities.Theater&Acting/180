how do i get discovered for acting and modeling i live in pennsylvania what are some tips on how to get discovered im short blonde blue eyed and i'm really good at acting and modeling i need to be dicovered we dont have much money for agents and stuff though names of free modeling or acting agencies would help too um im sorry but i dont really think that there are free agencies because i am and i loved to act sing model since i was or and i went to an acting school for they said i have incredible acting skills but i need to work on memorizing a bit so i am practicing a lot i was looking for agencies and coaches but they all require money i think someone in your family can be your agent though which would pr bably be free not sure but its hard because they have to find auditions and stuff for you im sure you will need to spend money though on your way to become a star so try babysitting or something just to earn a couple extra bucks you know it sucks cuz my family isnt rich so we cant spend thousands of dollars for this well i hope you get discovered i understand how much you love to act cuz i would do so much for singing and acting i really wanna get discovered too but i would recommend doing school plays to practice cuz there's always room for improvement and even if you don't get a big part in the play remember that you have to start somewhere and if you dont get the lead youre not bad it just means that someone else fit the part a little better because theres probably other people that wanted the lead lol any more questions you can always try to email me and ill help you as much as i can hope we all get discovered and good luck finding an agency Hamlet Ghost William Shakespeare King Claudius Shakespeare on screen The Lion King Hamlet (1996 film) Blackadder Shakespeare's reputation Tales from the Public Domain Thou Mary, the mother of Jesus Richard III (play) Soliloquy Shakespearean authorship Julius Caesar (play) Shakespeare's sonnets Rom__o et Juliette Reduced Shakespeare Company Gertrude Stein Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead Tragic hero Macbeth Tom Stoppard Highlander (film) Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand References in Star Trek Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Christopher Marlowe Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Pansy Pericles, Prince of Tyre The Dunciad A Midwinter's Tale Mark Rylance Sarah Bernhardt Gesta Danorum Thomas (Apostle) Subjunctive mood The Conscience of the King The Tempest (play) Tragedy Cunt Minstrel show Royal Shakespeare Company Euphemism BBC Television Shakespeare Soul Hathor John Updike Pentagram Sharon Tate Dulwich Hamlet F.C.
