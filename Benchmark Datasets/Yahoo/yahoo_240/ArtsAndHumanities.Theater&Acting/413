acting for a twelve year old i love to perform i am young tho and live in a really small town i one numerous baby pageants and been in many plays what should i do that doesnt involve wasting a whole lot of money thanks wasting and spending are two different things are your parents supportive of your efforst it's great that you've done theatre that's a one giant leap above many of the kids here you still need training so consider if you're not already in them acting classes voice lessons dance classes most agents will not consider you unless you have training and credits no matter your age you need support from your family and friends if you're under age you absolutely need to have the full support of your family because they not only need to sign off on your contracts and be your advocate be fully aware of all child labor laws and help uphold them while you're on set but they need to drive you to all your auditions and stay on set with you at all times or hire someone to be there with you if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying good luck Screen Actors Guild Internet fraud Open access Modelling agency Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Poker jargon Domain Name System MMORPG Advertising Advance fee fraud Divorce Slot machine Corporate governance Professional wrestling slang The Jackson 5 Cable television Database management system Microeconomics Voice actor Enterprise content management Cameron Diaz Plame affair HTML element Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Security (finance) Principal-agent problem United States Postal Service Appeal Minor league baseball Child support Mattress X Window System Government of France Oakland Athletics Windows XP RuneScape AmigaOS Airline Virgin Mobile Search engine optimization World Wide Web Teletext Mail fraud Financial audit United Kingdom corporation tax Tax 2005 Kashmir earthquake Outsourcing Jennifer Lopez Credit card Citigroup Notary public Corporate finance Macromedia Flash Lauren Bacall Marlon Brando Mozilla Firefox Survivor (novel) Fair Game (Scientology) Film Screenwriting Capitalism ITV State The Price Is Right Bond Google Alexander Technique Gmail System/36 Social Security (United States) American Football League Insurance Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) MapleStory Ra (board game) Pittsburgh Steelers Open Directory Project America Online Monopoly (game) The Standard Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Channel 4 Supply and demand Kazaa Mail-order bride Finance
