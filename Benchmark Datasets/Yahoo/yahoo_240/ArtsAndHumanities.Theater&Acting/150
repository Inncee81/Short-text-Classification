acting please reply i've always been interested in acting except i can't find that many auditions close to where i live i'm and turning in a month does anyone have any suggestions on websites i should check that's a rough age to cast unfortunately but not impossible you might try to get involved in shows where the cast is slightly older maybe as a stage hand or production assistant get immersed in what they do how they do it etc call up directors or producers who have numbers out for casting calls and see if they need stage help that kind of experience goes a long way to building relationships as more people get to know you you may have an advantage you'll know who their acting coaches are where they're going to audition next and when a casting director sees you he she will recognize you as a hard worker and smile that is worth gold best advice i can give get to know people in the biz any possible way you can be set crew be construction crew be anything they need you to be and learn anything they are willing to teach you work hard and get a reputation as a good person and a hard worker avoid light crew if you can unless you just plain like it they tend to be a bit more isolated from the action good luck Filmmaking Sharon Tate Social rule Drama Poker jargon Drill bit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Indian caste system Humphrey Bogart Alias (TV series) Milton H.
