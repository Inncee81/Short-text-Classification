getting started in acting la and chicago staring absolutey from the begining no agent no formal training where do i start most of the people who ask questions about getting started in acting on television and in the cinema are fans of the shows they want to work on and there is nothing wrong with that but you need to realize that being a fan dose not mean that you should be an employee of the show too many people have the idea that they are going to go to an open casting call wow the casting director and get a spot on their favorite show honestly your chances are probably better at winning the lottery than this scenario ever happening there is no magic formula to follow that guarantees you success if there is this business wouldn t be this hard to get into to but what i can show you is the path to start on if you really want to make a go of this as a career you have to figure out if acting is really what you want to do or if you only want to do it because you are a fan of a particular show or movie or if it s a passing trend would you be just as happy if no one outside of your community knew who you were but you got to act every week at the local theatre or are you after the money fame and celebrity status that might come your way if your answer has anything to do with the second option stop right now and find another line of work start getting training you can take classes in your school all the way through college or if your town offers a professional acting class all the better you have no idea how many people say i love acting and i know i could be great but i have no training and i ve never acted before that s like asking an airline to make you a pilot but you don t know how to fly a plane obviously foolish start with local plays and build your experience any actor worth their trade will tell you that you never stop training read read read read books not only on the art of acting but also the business of acting as well you re never to young to arm yourself with information concerning the business and how it really works later in life if this becomes your profession the information you ve gained will be invaluable you can buy tons of books on line or check out your library once you ve gotten to the point where you ve done the research and got some training you need to get yourself professional headshots and this is going to cost money if you want to be taken seriously as a professional you need professional headshots digital copies from mom s camera ain t gonna cut it nor will photos from your yearbook or glamour shots you will need to find a reputable headshot photographer and hire them to book a session prices usually range anywhere from and up make up artists are extra and will range from dollars extra now you need to get a couple hundred copies made to prepare for your auditions and mailings now a reality check if you want to make a go of this you will need to be in los angeles la is the film and television mecca for entertainment likewise if you wanted to work in theatre you need to be in new york it s just a simple fact that you will need to adjust too how many professional surfers have you ever heard of who spend all their time in iowa after you have your head shots you or your parents need to start submitting to auditions simply put unless you have a very specific look or talent no reputable agent is going to take you on with no experience they need to know that they can sell you and in turn make money if they can t then it s not in their best interest to represent you you can find auditions through on line services such as la casting actor s access and now casting keep in mind that these sites usually charge a monthly fee for their services again this will cost you money up front we never said getting into acting was cheap after you have landed a few jobs you can start to submit to agencies or invite agents to see you in showcases if an agent likes what they see you can structure a deal with them keep in mind that a legit agent will never ask for money up front however they will get at a minimum of your earnings once you ve booked a job tell the agent up front if you have aspirations to work on a certain show of type of film but the reality is you ll have little chance to select the work you go out for initially a good place to start would be the publications put out by wolf press or through http ww sag org so you still want to be an actor actress then you have to be proactive about it do the research find the agents and make the contacts no one is going to do that for you without you paying for it acting as a profession involves long hard hours of training and work possibly thousands of dollars in headshots monthly bill fees and training and that s just to get a chance to audition long answer short get your training read to get yourself informed do plays locally to get experience get your headshots do small parts to build upon to get experience for your resume submit to agents then finally you may have your shot as fun as it sounds and from time to time it is fun acting is still a job you have to respect it and prepare for it just like any other job if you think you can stand in front of a camera repeat a few lines and make millions then stay in school and look for another profession on the other hand if this is really what you want to do and you re willing to make the sacrifice and do the hard work early on we may just see you on the screen before you know it best of luck Marilyn Monroe World Wide Web Confidence trick Spyware HyperText
