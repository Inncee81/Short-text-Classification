more then one acting agent can u have more then one agent for acting in the same city it's entirely possible some actors have multiple agents for various reasons but the main reason is that certain agents only handle certain aspects of a performer's portfolio for instance you may have one agent that only books you for commercials and one that does tv film while another handles stage or music there are pros and cons to this approach of course however if you sign a contract with one particular agent for let's say theatrical work there is usually a provision in th contract stipulating that you will not sign with another agent for theatrical work until after this contract has expired if you decide to go with multiple agents you may want to find an agency that is large enough to house all aspects of the agents you want into one place it'll just save you time running from one agency to the next best of luck Onion Dehydration Tofu Water Diarrhea Rehydration Acne Hyperthermia Skin Glycerin Prostate cancer Humidity Fluoride Fire fighting Fecal incontinence Hair Eye Nutrition White phosphorus incendiary Cetacea Sulfuric acid Cyanide Condom Common cold Traumatic brain injury Mattress Human physiology Blood Carbon dioxide Aquatic ape hypothesis Motor oil Dieting Personal lubricant Radiation therapy Ceramics Zinc Shampoo Tide Standard enthalpy change of fusion Ammonia Intravenous therapy Water (molecule) Spider Animal communication Riot control agent Tetrapod Stomach cancer Menstrual cup 613 mitzvot Human Elephant Animal testing Gray Wolf Protein-energy malnutrition Kilogram Chocolate Insulin Capital punishment Engine cooling Puberty Rocket fuel Shaving Smoke-screen Siphon Tea Wound Diabetes mellitus Gravity Polychlorinated biphenyl Vulva Tocopherol Crocodilia Nerve agent Hiking Scarification Freeze drying Penis Homeostasis Drinking Paint Milk Lubricant Characters of Naruto Sperm Whale Dialysis Isotope separation Coffee Dairy Uranium Domestic rabbit Scar Devil Fruit Sweating Jon Secada Moisturizer Urinary incontinence Kitchen Vinegar Cantonese cuisine
