why do spring awakening have lyric changes i was watching a video of the song of purple summer and i listened to the actual track off the cd and its totally different lots of changed lines and i was wondering how come that is is it because of the off broadway to broadway transition yes when a show is first being made they record the songs on a workshop or demo cd these are usually slightly different from the finalized broadway versions they might have found a better way to make the show flow or they needed to change a bit for the sake of the plot if you listen to the nytw version of rent workshop it is very different from the show you'd see today Avenue Q Jim Steinman Vision of Love Bolt Thrower (band) Rent (musical) Boards of Canada The Holy Bible (album) The Wall Empire Burlesque She Loves You Madama Butterfly ABBA Sesame Street Quarashi Weezer Hole (band) Mixtape Chess (musical) Joy Division (band) BMT Canarsie Line Red Hot Chili Peppers Broadway (Manhattan) MBTA buses in South Boston Destiny's Child Tommy Pump It Up The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Dream Theater Seramyu Silverchair The Ashlee Simpson Show Meat Loaf Real Love (song) Therion (band) Musical theater Smile (album) Linkin Park Jonathan Larson Wonderland (McFly album) Time Out of Mind Spamalot Crazy in Love Candide (operetta) Nirvana (band) Tony Bennett Rodgers and Hammerstein A Day in the Life Wonderful Town Incubus (band) Louie, Louie Jerry Herman Ira Gershwin Chris Rice Porgy and Bess Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys God Save the Queen Push It (Garbage's song) Multitrack recording The Emancipation of Mimi Law & Order The Beatles discography Air (band) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Blink-182 Missy Elliott Sake The Little Mermaid (film) Shot of Love Pearl Jam WQHT (FM) Independent Subway System Music genre "Weird Al" Yankovic Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat Rent (film) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
