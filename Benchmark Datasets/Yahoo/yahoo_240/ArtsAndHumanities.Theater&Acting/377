should i believe this lady that wanted to scout me and referred me to a website of this site i dont believe it because she has never met me or heard my talents but she works for an agency and referred me to a site that looks pretty proffesional what should i do well it's like this you probably have a look or the look and whatever that may be the agency has already schooled her on what to look for when she is out scouting so that you will get caught up in the glamour and excitement of being discovered and if they tell you about fees that maybe associated with your discovery you won't have a problem with paying the fee because after all you are going to be famous they may hit you with fees on the site or get you to come to a casting call with 's of other people and then tell you about the fees for photos and the costs to market you etc etc etc i can tell you this because i used to be a scout and it was all just one big scam within a scam i got tied up with wilhemina scouting network which was alledgedly affiliated with lou pearlman who is credited with successes for backstreet boys and n'sync the network trained us by telling us who and what to look for when we were scouting the goal was to get your scouted prospects to casting calls that occured several times during the week and then they would select the people who looked like they could pay the fees if lou's name sounds familiar it might be because the authorities were looking for him and he was found overseas he was just on the news a few weeks ago i saw video of him as he was taken into custody his company has bankruptcy and some other issues and in doing all the work we did as scouts none of us every got paid our discoveries were paying the fees but wilhemina scouting network didn't pay us every time we would ask when is payday they would say in two weeks in to weeks everybody i started working with we all had quit so i say to you if they invite you to a casting call by a scout and it doesn't cost you anything go everyone should go to at least one casting call in their life just to say you did it it makes good practice for when you have a real casting call to attend best wishes Thelma Houston Diana Ross Michael Jackson God Save the Queen The Star-Spangled Banner Ray Charles John Lennon Billie Holiday Delta Goodrem Tom Waits Elton John I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Jim Rome Show Led Zeppelin Cliff Richard Whitney Houston Blood on the Tracks Please Please Me Bee Gees Ella Fitzgerald Avenue Q Fiddler on the Roof U2 (band) Enrique Iglesias The Miracles Sting (musician) Jim Steinman Street-Legal Usher (entertainer) Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Nu metal Hymn Magick Hip hop music Frankie Laine Country music Hey Jude She Loves You Slow Train Coming American Idol Megadeth Porgy and Bess The Beatles On the Road Janet Jackson Harry Nilsson Kanye West Carpenters Tina Turner Bryan Adams Journey (band) Johnny Cash Billy Ray Cyrus Unreleased Madonna songs Witchcraft Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
