does anyone know the cost of an imta convention i would like to compare the cost of the convention to the price my daughters manager gave me if your manager is charging you and you're considering going to one of these conventions that's going to charge you i think you're going about this all wrong legitimate people do not charge you up front they believe in you and help you to get started yes things cost money like taking classes and getting headshots etc but getting representation should not cost you one red cent if you want to find a legitimate agent to represent your daughter for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your daughter's headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out www actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to www backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying for modeling info start here http www fordmodels com main cfm click on global scouting http www elitemodel com flash html click on be discovered another good resource is www workingactors com even if you're not in the la area you can get an idea of what you're looking for by looking at the guide those listed in this guide do pay to be in here so you still have to check them out before you use them but it's still a great guide also www sag org and www aftra org have info for newcomers please don't give anyone your money until you've checked out other options good luck Led Zeppelin Dave Grohl Led Zeppelin II Led Zeppelin (album) Led Zeppelin IV John Bonham Timeline of heavy metal Rush (band) Def Leppard Swan Song Records Phil Collins John Paul Jones (musician) Led Zeppelin III Get Back Jimmy Page Robert Plant Stairway to Heaven Dread Zeppelin Sheryl Crow Cliff Richard The Song Remains the Same Journey (band) Metal music Black Sabbath Dream Theater M__tley Cr__e Led Zeppelin (DVD) Heavy metal music Primus (band) C.C.
