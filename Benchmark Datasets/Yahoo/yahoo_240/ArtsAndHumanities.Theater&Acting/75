do you know any us acting agents who also take on people from the uk please help me the us websites seem more helpful than the uk websites i believe some will but you'll need to be able to come out to the us for an interview and then for auditions so it's going to be hugely inconvenient and expensive also you will need various forms to work over there although i think that's provided when you get a job so the short answer is no you should look for a uk agent first maybe when you have an established uk agent and some credits they will hook you up with someone in the us if that's what you want like established british actors who start working over there i would say exhaust your local market first Call centre Real estate broker Financial audit Modelling agency Dwarfism Offshoring Voice actor Licence to Kill 24 (television) Charmed Predictive dialer Britpop Outsourcing Stamp Act 1765 Bretton Woods system Student loan Sleeper agent Insurance Whose Line Is It Anyway?
