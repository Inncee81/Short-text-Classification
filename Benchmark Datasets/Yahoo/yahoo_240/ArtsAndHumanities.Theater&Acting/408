why would analyzing a script be important to an actor what would they have to know about the play to do well no sarcasm please i die inside every time someone answers sarcastically the period the setting the plot the characters the lines the blocking why does theatre productions go through the process of rehearsals to become familiar with the script call it analysing memorising researching what ever there are so many different things an actor has to know in order to play a part well one important aspect for me both as a director and actor is how the lines make me feel when i read them when i say them i also learn how many different ways i could play the lines or words and which ways are definitely not going to work another thing is words or phrases that i may be unfamiliar with heck i want to be able to say them right otherwise the meaning is lost so i read the script to find those bits i do not understand then i research them reading into the script can also tell you a lot about the author and what they wanted to convey what blocking do they offer if any or do they leave a lot of the interpretation up to the actor what sub plots underlie the overall message plot them of the play what are the possible relationships between the characters i am about to direct a period piece and even for me as the director knowing where we are setting the play the dialogue of the piece ie period language possible character traits or idiosyncrasy's and so forth are just as important as learning the lines these come firstly from the script Uniform Resource Locator Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway HyperText Transfer Protocol Punk rock Johnny Depp Belo Horizonte Wales Oasis (band) Slash (punctuation) Tyson Beckford Web server Slashdot trolling phenomena PlayStation 2 Unix Web crawler Bill Haley Goatse.cx British Royal Family Bon Jovi Windows Vista The Offspring Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Enya CPAN Image Matchbook Romance 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Tex Ritter Digital photography Domain Name System Wget World Wide Web Tysons Corner, Virginia Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) Aerial refueling Independent Media Center JPEG Sega Dreamcast Bad Religion New England Jani Lane Toto (band) Common Unix Printing System Ian and Sylvia Domain name Kylie Minogue Photography Scalable Vector Graphics Declaration of Independence (United States) HTTP cookie ASCII art PlayStation Portable House Mouse Francisco Zurbar__n Warez President of the United States Rome Urania (magazine) Original Dixieland Jass Band Wireless Application Protocol Mary Cassatt Session Initiation Protocol V-2 rocket Wallpaper group Mozilla Application Suite Deep Impact (space mission) WebSphere Web cache George Bellows Jaguar (car) Hawaii Hollywood Forever Cemetery BitTorrent Cadillac Henry Hobson Richardson Taunton, Massachusetts Moth Helen Frankenthaler Representational State Transfer Christian Bale Hapa Beijing SAML 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Edward Norton Eurocopter Dauphin Apple II family Jos__ Clemente Orozco Fiftieth United States Congress Rancid Pow__zki Cemetery Xbox Squid cache Popular Science WebDAV Thomas Cole John Loder MxPx International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
