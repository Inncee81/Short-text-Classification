italian but no italian last name im italian and english i look italian people think i look italian but i have an english last name does that matter if i identify myself as italian but i have an english last name maybe of the folks who drop by the genealogy area deal with this same misconception your last name is just a label that comes from your father and it comes to him from his father grandfather so forth when thinking about your heritage background remember you have grandparents just to explain imagine that your grandfather born in england moved to france and married a french woman you are also equal parts of your mother's parents and let's assume all of them were completely french thus of of the grandparents here are actually french or fill in the blank the only one who happens to be not french is the paternal grandfather which is where the name gets passed down take that back one more generation where you have gr grandparents again all of those are individuals with their own background by this time the name becomes only th of your actual background with me so far when you start looking at all the persons who are your ancestors and who you are part of it should take just a few minutes to realize that someone's surname is only a very tiny tiny part of ancestry and of course it is always fun when someone drops by here gets intrigued and says hey i want to know how to find those ancestors and know more about who each of them were Family Family name Genealogical DNA test Blood purity (Harry Potter) Chinese surname Maiden name Genealogy Who is a Jew?
