does anyone know of a free website to locate a family member in idaho i only have a last name i take this as a live person and the lds files don't do live persons they do ancestors there are online directories such as yahoo people search zabasearch peoplefinder com all of which are geared to live people you can search for any smith in idaho is your person's last name unique enough that you will know it if it comes up you might also try using google for the surname and state tends to be better if you have a full name and put the name in quotation marks by the way nothing wrong with asking about live people on this board but it is not ethical or wise for me to post direct identifying information a fine line we tread here Genealogy Search engine optimization Google search W.
