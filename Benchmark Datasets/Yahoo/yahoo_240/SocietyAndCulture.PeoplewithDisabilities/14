dont you find it interesting how so many people posting here assume that being disabled also means being mentally and intellectually disabled and or in a wheelchair to quote lilykdesign canada has very strict discrimination laws employers walk a fine line when they deal with anyone who seems a little different i find that highly offensive disabled people are something employers have to deal with and all disabled people even those with invisible physical disabilites seem a little different no one ever assumes i am disabled in fact most people dont believe me that has been the biggest stumbling block to getting my disability pension and any assistance this kind of bigoted crap just burns my butt disabled people all look funny act funny are different stand out in the crowd as not normal and of course no one ever discriminates against them because we have laws these kinds of assumptions are behind discrimination in hiring if i tell an employer i am disabled then are they doing assume i am a little different and wont fit in with their other employees and they will have to deal with this fictional difference what does a little different mean anyhow odd strange behavior looks weird talks funny doesnt understand things the way normal people do or does it mean this person is intelligent capable a hard worker she will be an excellent part time employer so she needs a chair with a good back support no problem in an ideal world it would and it should but it seldom does there are different kinds of discrimination there is the stigma of difference there is the lack of understanding that some things come with more difficulty than for others you may have a disability that when accommodated you almost seem as if you are not disabled but that does not mean you are not disabled sometimes it seems like you have to fake being more disabled than you are because people fail to understand your real level of disability without the visible reminders of it this is partly why an invisible disability is in many ways the most difficult to deal with Disability Unemployment Mental retardation Insurance Autism rights movement Asperger syndrome Learning disability Affirmative action Autism Microeconomics Mental illness Dyslexia Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Stuttering Social Security (United States) Discrimination Supernatural Volleyball Infantilism Civil rights Franz Boas Atheism Normal distribution Contract Divorce Neurodiversity Law of value Recurring South Park characters Pedophilia Political correctness Martial art Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion in the United States Psychology A Course In Miracles Labour economics Noam Chomsky Same-sex marriage Controversies in autism Combine (Half-Life 2) Ontological argument Intelligent design Atomic Kitten Dilbert Cyberspace GED Invisibility Employment discrimination Shit Power (sociology) Capitalism Sexual orientation Pension The nature of God in Western theology Human sexual behavior Gay rights Capital accumulation Mediation Stairway Stupidity Equal Protection Clause Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hearing impairment Poverty Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Science Philosophy of space and time Redundant array of independent disks Economic inequality Combat stress reaction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism RuneScape quests Coercion Social rule Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Sant Thakar Singh Disability Discrimination Act 1995 Jennifer Lopez Victor Cousin American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Information warfare Down syndrome Animal rights Cephalic disorder Gender role Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Disability etiquette W.
