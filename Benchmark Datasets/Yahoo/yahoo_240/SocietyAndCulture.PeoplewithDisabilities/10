from what you know of persons with mental or emotional disabilities it could be you a relative or a friend would the person be interested in participating in a cooperative volunteer arrangement in which they put in hours of service in something they do well such as reading aloud or child care or mowing lawns in exchange for another person offering them a service like cooking meals for them several times a week or tutoring in a difficult subject or driving them to doctor's appointments how well do you think this idea would be received if a person with a mental or emotional disability is given the opportunity to work in a field of a particular expertise they have they should be paid accordingly studies being done have shown that if a person can participate in the community as a normal person for want of a better term they do better especially if paid fairly for a fair days work i think you mean well by what your asking but bartering a person with a mental or emotional disability out in exchange for other services could have some serious problems as people by shear nature will use and abuse this system leaving the already vulnerable person at risk of further abuse for this to work you would have to have police screening of participants including the very people your trying to assist have written contracts between participants to prevent abuse misuse conduct assessments of the venue where the person is working etc this includes oh s you would need to have some sort of policies procedures and feed back forms to continue to improve and met each participants needs and wants i would suggest you do check with local authorities about legislation relating to volunteers services so you do not breach any laws please be mindful that people with mental or emotional disabilities are still people who are quite capable of thinking for themselves even if at times a little cloudy Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mental Health Act 1983 Social work Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act LiveJournal Schizophrenia Education in the United States Involuntary commitment Traumatic brain injury Unemployment Scientology beliefs and practices Publicly funded medicine Abortion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Health care in the United States National Institutes of Health Copyright Abortion in the United States Ethics Learning disability Mental illness Insurance Intellectual property Corporate governance Stroke Eugenics Down syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Surveillance Stanford prison experiment Health insurance Asperger syndrome Public domain Adult attention-deficit disorder Clinical depression Autism Infantilism Mind Education in the People's Republic of China Community emergency response team Social justice Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Independent agencies of the United States government Supply and demand Prostate cancer Social rule Offer and acceptance Drug addiction Scientific method Nurse Borderline personality disorder Goodness and value theory Grief Dyslexia Stuttering GED Polyamory Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland Terri Schiavo Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Employment in Hong Kong Civil rights Combat stress reaction Addiction Domination & submission (BDSM) Transsexuality Psychology Public-key cryptography Ludwig Wittgenstein Alcoholism Childlove movement Apprenticeship Gun politics Deprogramming Mediation Democracy Homeschooling Unlawful combatant Law Pedophilia Breastfeeding Hypnosis Fathers' rights Administrative law of the United States No Child Left Behind Act Hillary Rodham Clinton Internet troll
