how many people have there been since the beginning of modern man i read a question with this same title but it was looking at it from a creationist standpoint my question is this what is the total number of human beings to ever have lived since the dawn of homo sapiens sapiens i've looked it up and found nothing maybe you'll have better luck if you feel like going through the trouble for me dear thankjesus ever i'm touched by your concern but i'm fine all right we have one little problem here the inner workings of evolution are not such that one day an archaic homo sapien is in birth and then voila out pops the first true anatomically modern homo sapien irregardless of the fact that evolution is a rather slow process however the earliest sites of anatomically modern homo sapiens date back to around years ago qufzeh and skhul in the middle east are the oldest sites to have be dated definitively at years ago but there are also sites at klasies river mouth in south africa and omo kibish in ethiopia where anatomically modern homo sapiens have been found the s african site has been dated with electron spin resonance and resulted in being classified as between and years ago and the ethiopian site was dated to years ago but the finding of a much more primitive skull in the same soil formation has led some to believe that the site had been disrupted and the finding may have come from a higher soil layer so again this site is not with certainty more recently dna evidence has suggested a starting point of or earlier and a recent discovery in ethiopia unearthed a fossilized skeleton that dates to but is still be debated as to if it is an archaic homo sapien or a true anatomically modern homo sapien anyways years ago is as good a date as any for the beginning of anatomically modern homo sapiens but given the fact that the change would have been gradual you could easily put behind that to account for this evolutionary change to have occured in full and to account for our uncertainty in our original period of speciation from archaic homo sapiens so if the earth's history were put into a large book with each page representing million years making the book pages long then that gradual change and the first fully anatomically modern homo sapien would be written down as taking his first step and walking on the face of the earth at the bottom of the last page now that we have pegged the date of homo sapiens emergence at years ago you also want to estimate a head count for all mankind truly this is not possible looking at mitrochondrial dna for instance it is evident that there was a bottle neck in the human population years ago such that the reproductively involved individuals assumingly all that were present would have been no greater then individuals one hypothesis to account for this is the eruption of the toba supervolcano in sumatra indonesia who's impending ash cloud and sulphuric acid rain had a catastrophic effect on the african continent thus reducing the number of humans present at that point and also resulted in a year long ice age at that one squeezed point on human development it is possible to estimate our population because of the extreme restriction that was put on our gene pool but other less destructive events can not be estimated the years since were also marked with an ice age between and years ago and even a mini ice age that started in ad that resulted in famine and death throughout medival europe so considering that our population was truly not a linear progression the numbers can not truly be estimated accurately if anyone was to produce a number they would be lying at best because there is truly no way to know all the past variables or to know how they would have effected our human population i hope all of this helps Cradle of Humanity Human migration Olduwan Macroevolution Flood geology Human extinction Single-origin hypothesis Homo floresiensis Natural disaster Homo (genus) Stone Age Prehistoric Britain Evidence of evolution Origin of language Biodiversity Ape Famine Creationism Human skin color Climate change Multiregional hypothesis Volcano Cro-Magnon man Mungo Man Creation science Homo erectus History of evolutionary thought Created kind Sea level rise Mount Pinatubo Ozone hole Fermi paradox History of the World Indo-Aryan migration History of Africa Young Earth creationism Effects of global warming Solar system Ice age 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Archaeology Global warming Impact event Supervolcano Paleoclimatology Scientific classification Neolithic Europe Origin belief Population bottleneck Creation-evolution controversy South Africa Permian-Triassic extinction event Day-Age Creationism Tyrannosaurus rex Age of the Earth Anthropology Human genome Hominidae Intelligent design Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Franz Boas Carbon dioxide The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Santorini Noah's Ark Glacier Milford H.
