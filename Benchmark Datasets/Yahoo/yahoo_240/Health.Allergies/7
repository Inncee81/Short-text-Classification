if you are somewhere without an inhaler what do you do this problem has happened to me on a few occasions if you start to have an attack assuming its asthma the results vary depending on the trigger if its an stress or panic response then try to relax dont panic as this can make you hyperventilate consentrate on slow steady deep breaths if you find yourself hyperventilating then a paper bag can help recycle the excess oxygen in your body if its due to a allergic reaction then follow the previous actions try to get medical help a chemist will prescribe an emergency inhaler as long as you give them your gp's details so they can get the prescription later if you are not near a chemist then a hospital is your best option as the airways will be inflamed need the reliever to open them again i always keep a spare at work incase i forget Asthma Panic attack Rebreather Hyperventilation Carbon dioxide Hay fever Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Insulin Pneumonia Intracranial pressure Myocardial infarction Drowning Hypoglycemia Sleep apnea Childbirth Fire fighting Emphysema Cannabis (drug) LSD Haloalkane Physical therapy Cocaine Caffeine Anxiety Anesthesia Homeopathy Acute respiratory distress syndrome Combat stress reaction Pulmonary alveolus Oxygen first aid Diazepam Drug addiction Shock Triage Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Medical cannabis Anaphylaxis Insomnia Diver rescue Coeliac disease Hydrogen sulfide Eczema Decompression sickness Diving regulator Fecal incontinence Plastic Apnea First aid Stroke Multiple sclerosis 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate 7 July 2005 London bombings Lung Liquid breathing Angina Lung cancer Polyvinyl chloride Tobacco smoking Immune system Aluminium Meditation Suicide methods Helium Diabetes mellitus Route of administration Methamphetamine Breathing gas Migraine Scuba set Sedative Massage Air pollution Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Medicine Aromatherapy Clomipramine 2001 anthrax attacks Cystic fibrosis Medical record Stomach cancer Acne Common cold Alexander Technique Aspirin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Nuclear fallout Vomiting Salbutamol Bipolar disorder Bong Explosive material Angioedema Breath Gasoline
