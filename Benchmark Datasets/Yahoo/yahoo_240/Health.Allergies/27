am i allergic to eyeliner whenever i use eyeliner during the day some type of nasty mooshy stuff forms in the crevices of my eyes and the next morning my eyes are red this happens everytime i tried to change my eyeliner to see if it was old but it didn't work then i bought the hypo allergenic eyeliner and it still didnt work i'm worried that i can never use eyeliner due to this reaction i had to stop due to this reaction too if it makes you feel any better listening to my anecdotal tale i was at the doctor's office when i gave up the makeup for good he was studying the redness of the whites of my eyes when he told me he'd give me patanol for the eyes if i'd make better choices about my allergies if someone doesn't like you coz you're not sporting something that makes your eyes go bam then they're not looking at you hard enough and you don't want someone who doesn't see what's inside anyway right Allergy Food allergy Cosmetics Hay fever Mast cell Time Out of Mind Social rule House dust mite Eczema Empire Burlesque Eye contact Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asthma Shaggy dog story Peanut Hal Trosky Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cat coat genetics Piccolo Junior Saga Jackass: The Movie Jam (TV series) Kodocha Immunoglobulin E Conjunctivitis Ocean's Twelve Doomtown Hall & Oates Grandview, U.S.A.
