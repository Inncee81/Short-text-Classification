m old son sticking fingers in throat often my son is m i'm pretty sure he has acid reflux is it normal for a formula fed child of his age to still spit up often he does eat table foods and baby foods also he goes to the allgergist on the th with me he is on isomil advance because he was allergic to the regular milk based formula he doesn't drink cow's milk yet i'm wondering if he's sticking his fingers in his throat because of the reflux or if it's for some other reason i called the dr office yesterday and the nurse said that it's probably just a behavior but it could also be from his tummy bothering him cuz of the reflux she also said to avoid citrus foods if anyone has any suggestions on what we can do for him or to stop him until he sees the allergist i would appreciate it he isn't being treated for the relfux currrently but i'm hoping that the allergist will do so he does this to the point of gagging and choking if you pull his hand out he sticks it right back in what to do my oldest daughter did this and she had severe reflux at that age she was just trying to reach where it hurt i suggest you call a pediatric gastroentrologist as soon as possible reflux in older babies can cause sleep issues anemia and food intolerences better to know for sure Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Coeliac disease Heartburn Milk Elephant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soy milk Food allergy Insulin Infant formula Allergy Dairy Breast milk Diarrhea Professional wrestling holds Cat Crohn's disease Cancer of the larynx Kodocha Anemia Joke Sin City Drawn Together Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hera Cheese FoxTrot Salad Fingers Hypoglycemia Rayman 3 Folic acid Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Asthma Acne The Shining (film) Gastroparesis Veganism Hansel und Gretel Vitamin C First aid Milton H.
