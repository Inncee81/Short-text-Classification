pile problem i had constipation during pregnancy and after my first baby with c section dr gave me laxative whenever i used laxative i felt good but when i left the medicine i again found constipation which one day turned out with piles i saw too much blood in toilet after that i didnt see anything like that thaen afte months i felt difficulty in passing stool i went to drs they said they couldnt see anything but gave me cream to apply which i didn't the problem was not severe now this time after my second baby i m feeling piles with every bowel movement either there is constipation or not when i go to toilet i find a kind of pinching sensation with passing stool but no blood and after that an hour of burning sensation but nothingelse i m scared of going to dr coz i have heard that there is no cure except surgery please tell me if there is any other cure is this cureable without surgery please tell me how to get rid of this problem it is not severebut it couldbe in future the best product i have ever seen or used is by michael's of texas inc i think it's called haemorrhex or rhoid x or something close to that you could contact the company via e mail and state that their hemorrhoid cream was recommended to you and could they pls mail order you some as piles or hemorrhoids for the person who didn't know what piles are are essentially varicose veins of the rectum anything that will help treat varicosities will also help your hemorrhoids these would include horsetail thyme butcher's broom rosemary witch hazel comfrey yarrow and any astringent tonifying antibacterial antipruritic herb any salve that contains myrrh goldenseal comfrey olive oil and or leaf echinaecea yellow dock will help you and there are many others as well your self treatment could be as simple as taking cotton balls dipped in witch hazel and cleansing the area this is a traditional home remedy i would strongly suggest that you also try a course of circucaps by sanhelios about for and available at any co op or healthfood store if they don't have them they can special order them for you i also suggest that you change your diet and strongly avoid foods that make one's digestion sluggish especially red meat and most hard cheeses coffee can actually stimulate one to go so it's not necessary to remove that from the diet there is a product called malt soupex used in hospitals and nursing homes to gently treat constipation it is just barley malt and is warmed and just given by the teaspoonful you can buy barley malt very cheaply at almost any healthfood store or co op i would avoid laxatives like the plague as it's too easy to become dependent upon them and they can significantly worsen the problem stop taking iron supplements as well as they worsen the condition eat salad and greens fruits vegetables grains and beans several times day every day ultimately hemorrhoids are just a minor complaint of pregnancy usually and will often resolve themselves as long as you are not bleeding profusely do not worry having babies too close together is not good for this condition and if you have rectal varicosities you usually have or will soon have varicose veins in your legs as well this can be serious as you then will have a higher risk or milk leg or deep vein thromboses dvt's i would consult w an herbalist and an acupuncturist as well as an nd naturopathic doctor regarding this condition as your screen name sounds indian have you considered consulting w an ayurvedic physician Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Crohn's disease Colorectal cancer Veganism Folic acid Ulcerative colitis Dietary fiber Coffee Comfrey Cheese Medicine Cat Ayurveda Aloe Cuisine of Denmark Migraine Clinical depression Cancer Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acupuncture Essential oil Anemia Tocopherol Irritable bowel syndrome Garlic Breakfast Obesity Chronic fatigue syndrome Escherichia coli O157:H7 Stroke Traditional Chinese medicine Eczema Omega-3 fatty acid Dialysis Tea Vitamin C Japanese toilet Atkins Nutritional Approach Jewish cuisine Flatulence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hamster Mouth ulcer Medical prescription Naturopathic medicine Chicken Dairy Menstrual cup Diverticulosis Chlorpromazine Dieting Diarrhea Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Alternative medicine Insulin Prolactinoma Organic food Adjustable gastric band Botulism Vinegar Stuttering Gastroparesis Hirschsprung's disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Althaea (genus) Food preservation Domestic rabbit Toilet humour Anorexia nervosa Herbalism Autism Acne Raw food diet Anal fissure Addiction Natural health Human feces Patent medicine
