what is the correct dosage for melatonin i was going to get some today but i'm a little confused on it some said contains mcg some said mg whats the difference hi nico the first few answerer's are incorrect mcg is micrograms one millionth of a gram mg is milligrams one thousandth of a gram therefore mcg equals mg mg is too much to start with it is best with hormones such as melatonin to use the smallest dose that works for you generally a mg pill mcg is adequate dosage for most people so get the mcg pills and take one or two pills one hour before bedtime if this does not seem to work for you then add one or two more for a total dose of to mg best wishes and good luck LSD SI prefix Medical prescription Folic acid Melatonin Caffeine Oral contraceptive Kilogram Hormone Sleep SI Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Delayed sleep phase syndrome LD50 Insulin Tocopherol Parts per notation Apollo 8 Sildenafil Hypoglycemia Maprotiline Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Menstrual cycle Philippine peso Hormone replacement therapy Forensic toxicology Dietary fiber 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Diazepam Chlorpromazine Lorazepam Tide Methamphetamine Fluvoxamine Plutonium Simethicone Estrus cycle Doxepin Ketamine Guinea pig Chemotherapy Antipsychotic Nicotine Trimipramine Buprenorphine Topiramate Clinical depression Vitamin C Designer drug Drug overdose Progesterone only pill Acromegaly Migraine Ionizing radiation Fertility awareness Bupropion Paracetamol Omega-3 fatty acid Amiodarone Phenylbutazone Medical cannabis Cannabis (drug) Sewage treatment Homosexuality and transgender Niacin Birth control Amanita muscaria Polonium Clozapine Radiation poisoning St John's wort Antidepressant Naproxen Veganism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Care Bears Jet lag ITunes Music Store Cocaine Standardized testing Hebrew calendar Chlorprothixene Tryptophan Pharmacokinetics Radiation therapy Daylight saving time Bodybuilding Bipolar disorder Haloperidol Micrometer Post Polio syndrome Political correctness SAT SmartAsk Growth hormone treatment Vitamin poisoning Salvia divinorum Ton
