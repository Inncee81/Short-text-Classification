javascript mysql hi i want to make web for example of news messages etc when you read news you can every second get a message don't you the messages are all in mysql database so i want for example make a link messages become bold once i get a message without reloading a page can someone write or copy a code showing how to do that i guess it is possible to make that with javascript but i have no idea how to take results from database with mysql if i am wrong suggest me something p s i am using html php javascrip mysql on my server thanx take a look at yahoo's ui library it takes care of most of the underlying functionality with ajaxian type stuff there's plenty of other libraries out there all with their pros and cons i like yui http developer yahoo com yui there's a thousand different ways you could do this but i'd recommend something very simple write a php script that accepts a userid and looks up in mysql to find out whether there are any new messages for that user have it simply output true or false with no html or other markup you can use the yui connection manager to create an ajax request to newmessages php userid it will fetch the results of that behind the scenes and load it into a javascript variable you can check that variable to determine whether or not to notify the user of a new message PHP MySQL Web hosting Managed learning environment LAMP (software bundle) Stopping e-mail abuse Wikipedia GameFAQs Web application TikiWiki Apache HTTP Server BitTorrent Open Database Connectivity GNU General Public License Linux Perl Database management system Moodle WAMP E-mail PHP-Nuke Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet Speculative Fiction Database VBulletin SQL injection Web design Free software Ruby on Rails Uniform Resource Locator Object-SQL mapping Web server Ajax (programming) Gmail Load balancing Host file Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Arianne Comparison of relational database management systems Windows 2000 X Window System CPAN Whois Quest Software Categorical list of programming languages Mac OS X Server Localhost Flat file database Novell NetWare Serendipity (weblog software) Typo3 Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing IP address Web traffic IP Multimedia Subsystem MediaWiki Cross site scripting Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bliki Microsoft Access Search engine optimization Independent Media Center WebObjects Everything2 Captcha Associative array MySQL AB Bash.org Website Groupee, Inc.
