missing columns when importing an access report into excel i'm using access excel winxp sp i've got a report which totals some values when i export the report to excel my totals column is missing this has only just started to happen and i can't think that i've made any changes that might have caused it i've discovered that if i put the report into design mode then without making any changes go back into view mode then export again the totals column is no longer missing however if i just run the export again the totals column is missing again wtf so i can work around the problem but would like a solution if poss as i'm not the only user of this system and the other users would be stuck i read that this is a known bug but details on how to avoid it would be good exporting to excel from an access report is 'icky' excel needs to understand columns etc which can confuse it i haven't heard or come across this exact problem in my years of experience with access excel i would suggest one of two things export your report directly from the query not the report or use ms query from excel to pull the data through into the spreadsheet this is also useful because you can amend the setting of the query so that you can always have totals at the bottom or by the side etc not matter how many lines of data you have PHP Ajax (programming) Btrieve SQL PHP-Nuke Database management system MySQL Microsoft SQL Server Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Microsoft Oracle database Open Database Connectivity Microsoft Access Cross site scripting Apache HTTP Server Lotus Notes Ragnarok Online HyperText Transfer Protocol Web design Perl MapleStory PostgreSQL Oracle Corporation Database MDAC Search engine TikiWiki BitTorrent XML BZFlag Microsoft Jet Database Engine DB2 Object-SQL mapping Google MUMPS BEA WebLogic Blog Sybase Google search Proxy server Website Base64 SQL injection Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server GameFAQs Wget EMule Enterprise content management Categorical list of programming languages Common Unix Printing System Computer security Electronic commerce CPAN Domain Name System Mozilla Application Suite Cheating in Counter-Strike PL/SQL Wiki Windows XP Java programming language Python programming language Tandem Computers ASP.NET Mozilla Firefox WebObjects WebSphere Freenet SAS System Ingres Mach kernel HTTP cookie Spring operating system Wikipedia Novell NetWare Web server Open Directory Project Relational model Transmission Control Protocol Mac OS X Microsoft .NET Informix Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Web hosting Windows Vista Search engine optimization Quest Software Web service Apple Computer Visual Basic Whois Typo3 Java Database Connectivity VBulletin Diablo II Final Fantasy XI Web traffic World Wide Web Representational State Transfer Flickr
