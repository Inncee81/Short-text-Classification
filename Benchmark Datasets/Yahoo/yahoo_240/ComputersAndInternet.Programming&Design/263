how do i make my website load like this when u first go to websites u will see a bar where a web designer designs it for loading such as http www barbie com u see when u visit this website do u see a loading bar how do you create this does it have anything to do with html if so what is the html then so how can i make it the loading bars are typically flash or java however there is a way to sort of fake something like this without having to learn a programming language you'd still need a bit of javascript though basically without spending a lot of time on a javascript programming lesson here's the idea at the top of your page you create an image a banner of some sort that says loading but the text is in the image you assign a javascript function to the onload event and have it reassign the source file for the loading image to an transparent gif image with small dimensions say x pixel so that the image effectively dissapears after the page has loaded there's always more than one way to do things Web design Uniform Resource Locator CPAN HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP-Nuke Scalable Vector Graphics Gaia (mythology) Apache HTTP Server PHP Web server Mozilla Application Suite Ajax (programming) BitTorrent Ultraman Gaia Gaia Online Otakon Wget SAML Terranigma 3D computer graphics Armin van Buuren Storm (comics) Environmental ethics Files-11 World Wide Web Dvorak Simplified Keyboard GameFAQs Lotus Notes The Simpsons Stevie Wonder Ragnarok Online PNG Slashdot trolling phenomena HTML Cardcaptor Sakura Z__oty Mozilla Firefox Patricia Ford Domain Name System James Lovelock Macromedia Flash The Isley Brothers ISO 4217 HTML element Associative array Grantley Adams International Airport ZGMF-X88S Gaia Gundam HyperCard TOC protocol Solar variation Web browser Python programming language Zeus Comparison of layout engines (XHTML) Gaia (Foundation universe) Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Pitaten Captain Planet and the Planeteers Call to Power II Kuja Internet forum Vila Nova de Gaia Ultra Series The Who discography Enterprise content management J-pop MySQL The Book of Mozilla Unix History of ecology Maurice Noble Origin belief Yugi Mutou Quotation mark Lynn Margulis Jennifer Lopez Yearbook OpenDocument Pentagram Gaia theory (science) Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition Polymorphism in object-oriented programming Xanga Foundation and Earth Mary Midgley Meaning of life Biosphere Homeostasis MTR MegaMan Battle Network Ecclesiastical Latin Cosmic Era list of characters Principia Discordia Chessington World of Adventures Gaia philosophy Biodiesel Website XMLHTTP Rhythm Nation 1814 Carpal tunnel syndrome
