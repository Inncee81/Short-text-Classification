is c better than java lately i have been getting fairly good at c programming with the help of about thousand online tutorials i chose c because it is a compiled language i heard it was portable assembly from a few good sources and you have a lot of control over the computer without the major difficulty of assembly code i heard it ran quite fast once compiled both python and java are interpretted and my th grade training told me 'slow as hell' but for kicks i did a search for c vs java and most websites have been saying java is better i dont really want to learn java i became morally opposed to it when it was able to crash my computer and my blackberry but if it is a much better language would it behoove me not to learn it i actually already know c i simply wanted to know if its really necesarry i ever learn java in the next lets say years c and java both have their good points and their bad points java might be a little slower than c because as you say it is interpreted but i don't think you or any other human can see the difference except for the slow initial load once loaded java programs execute lightning fast on my computer a benchmark program of course could detect that a c program does indeed execute faster java is easier to learn than c even though they both have a very similar syntax c is portable to more systems than java is because all platforms don't support java although more and more are picking it up i personally prefer java but your mileage might vary Macromedia Flash OpenOffice.org C plus plus Portable Document Format PostScript Perl Visual Basic OpenDocument Objective-C Java programming language C programming language Web template Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems TeX TrueType PHP Scalable Vector Graphics Ebook Object-oriented programming JavaScript C Sharp IPod Unicode Opera (web browser) ColdFusion WordPerfect XSL Transformations Windows Vista Nintendo DS Adobe Illustrator Flash memory String (computer science) Mach kernel XForms StarOffice Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Standard Template Library Computer virus Digital photography USB flash drive OpenType Mozilla Firefox Programming language Commodore 64 GIF Xbox 360 BASIC programming language Expert system BIOS Something Awful Common Unix Printing System Linspire Warez Web page HTML M16 (rifle) Polymorphism (computer science) Microsoft Office Generic programming Compiler optimization Apple typography Pretty Good Privacy Dance Dance Revolution BitTorrent Comparison of generics to templates Function object PowerPC Killian documents Casting Read-only memory Podcasting Copyright infringement of software StepMania Drill bit Plugin PIC microcontroller Microsoft .NET Sharp Zaurus Linux Microsoft JADE programming language Version Spline (mathematics) Theory of conduct Ajax (programming) Explosive material Windows 3.x 2D computer graphics Name mangling SWF Software engineering Pharmaceutical company Logo programming language LaTeX PLATO IBM PC compatible Software cracking Embedded system
