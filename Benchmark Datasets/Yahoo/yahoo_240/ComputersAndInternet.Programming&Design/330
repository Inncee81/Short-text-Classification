java awt textbox wierdness hello friends i'm playing around with making a java applet but i'm finding some strange things happen as i play with the awt package my code this is the code i have in my init function setlayout new gridlayout label labeluserid new label userid add labeluserid label labelname new label name add labelname textfield textname new textfield add textname textfield textuserid new textfield add textuserid now what i am intending to do is add label components with two associated textfield components in a table layout unfortunately i want more of an edit box line component not a full textbox thing how can i make these text boxes look like edit boxes with labels identifying them thanks you need to first of all get rid of using the gridlayout that layout manager forces all components in the grid to take the size of each cell which is why your textfields are blown up to the size they are normally they are regular text boxes like you are looking for but being that they are in grid layout you get those monster boxes so once you take out the gridlayout use setlayout null you can go about setting the size of components using setsize and setbounds to also place and size controls in specific locations those in combination with panels to group controls together and you can build some simple interfaces hope that helps Internet Apache HTTP Server Python programming language Free software Wget World Wide Web HyperText Transfer Protocol Website Unix Ragnarok Online Web service Ada programming language Wireless Application Protocol Web server Uniform Resource Identifier Mozilla Firefox Integrated development environment Software engineering Commodore 64 Fortran AOL Instant Messenger Firewall (networking) C plus plus Computer software Uniform Resource Locator Astrology Microsoft .NET Dictionary Software agent E-learning Managed learning environment LaTeX Maya (software) Free/Libre/Open-Source Software Java programming language Flashcard Free Software Foundation Opera (web browser) Common Lisp Statistics Programming language Internet forum Spyware Netscape Communications Corporation Computer virus Internationalization and localization CPAN Online poker Wikipedia Free audio software Ultima Online MSN Messenger Phishing Linux Apache Software Foundation Configuration management PLATO Microsoft Secure Shell Service-oriented architecture America Online Web browser Source code BitTorrent Oracle database Greek language Software patent debate Linux on zSeries Moodle Genealogy Chinese language Object-oriented programming Aggregator Game programming Oxford English Dictionary Software development kit Session Initiation Protocol Software architecture System/36 Open Directory Project Interactive fiction WebSphere Domain Name System XUL Computer-supported collaboration Copyright infringement of software Open-source software German language OpenGL Software testing Streaming media XML Web application IBM PC compatible Stopping e-mail abuse Portable Document Format Biology Open access Bbc.co.uk HyperCard
