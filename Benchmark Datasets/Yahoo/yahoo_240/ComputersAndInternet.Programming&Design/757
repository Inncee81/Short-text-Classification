hiding entire page in css then printing something hi i want to make it so that when a page displays i can add css coding in there that will hide the entire page except for a line of text i want to display instead for example a user loads a page and instead of what is supposed to be displayed it displays a line of text that i want on there how would i go about doing that thanks simple put a div element around the elements of the page you want to hide and give it a style of display none this will even remove the rendering box from the page so it doesn't even look like there's something missing however the user can still see the content if they view the page source to hide the content completely you would need to use a server side language like php that the client has no access to MDAC Database SQL Visual Basic Microsoft Jet Database Engine Isolation (computer science) Database management system Flat file database C syntax SAS System System/36 MUMPS Relational algebra ADO.NET Tcl Perl Ajax (programming) CPU cache PostgreSQL C programming language Domain Name System PHP System/34 Hello world program ALGOL 68 Abstraction (computer science) Prolog Hash table C Sharp Web crawler Join (SQL) Halting problem Python programming language ADO JavaScript Dynamic random access memory Index (database) BASIC programming language Read-copy-update Geographic information system SQL injection Metadata Whois MySQL Nemerle Associative array Control flow Microsoft .NET Punch card Object-SQL mapping Unicode Computer File Allocation Table Quantum computer Database normalization IP Multimedia Subsystem RFID Compact disc Btrieve C plus plus Lisp programming language Objective-C Atari 8-bit family Enterprise content management Tuple relational calculus XML HP BASIC for OpenVMS Astrophysics Data System Forth programming language Cocoa (API) Redundant array of independent disks Bloom filter Microsoft Access Component Object Model Common Unix Printing System Icon programming language COMMAND.COM Master Control Program Transposition cipher Burrows-Wheeler transform RS-232 OpenDocument Orthogonal matrix Compiler optimization On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences AWK programming language Information Management System Array Relational model Gmail Internet Group Management Protocol Linked list Object-oriented programming Transmission Control Protocol Page table JADE programming language
