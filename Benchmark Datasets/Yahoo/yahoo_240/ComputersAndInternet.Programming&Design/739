what's the best free c complier one that has a nice gui can make simple programs for vista thanks i just want a complier for messing around and trying to learn a bit more c on my own visual studio express it is free it includes sql server c c visual basic vb net visual web developer http msdn microsoft com en us express aa aspx the beta version is here http msdn microsoft com en us express default aspx ok let me spew my opinion microsoft was founded by bill gates he wrote an implementation of the basic language i don't know if you remenber writing code like go sub for x to y go sub next x bill gates was language and development centric now bill is stepping down aside business analysts look at the numbers and see that windows and office is their biggest money maker languages such as vb or vc probably brought in less than of their revenue linux and open source came into the picture and there is a definate alternate to windows for servers the cost to get into developing is an issue as to the platform that developers will develop to if it costs money to get the tools to develop for one platform and it costs no money to develop for another platform there will be more developers developing for the platform that it does not cost any money to start developing in developers are the people that specify the target platform that the system will run on if the developers pick linux as the target system that is what they will sell to the end users i am sure that microsoft wants the developers to pick windows the next big trend for applications is to be web enabled or just be a web based apllication the interface to allow links to every other system in the world is just too efficient to use so microsoft needs to not loose their market to the linux apache mysql server market which costs no money for developers to get into how do they do it microsoft takes their development software and makes it free just like linux gcc apache perl php they want to sell operating systems for all of those servers they have made the development environment so advanced that nothing compares they have billions to spend in research and development and they have spent their money well they have also developed the net framework that is designed to best of practice standards sun has developed java and its virtual machine it is too strictly licensed and controlled by sun for it to eventually win out the net framwork is simular to java but it compiles into psuedo code when developed and compliles into executable code on the target machine when it is installed and run for the first time this allows the compiler on the target machine to look at the system and add all of the compiler options specific to the cpu on the production machine so forget the linux unix vs windows wars i am a unix linux die hard i have come to the realization that the new tools from microsoft are just too good to ignore microsoft does not want to loose the operating system market it also does not want to loose the office sales to protect those sales it is giving away the development environments which probably amount to less then of their total sales to ensure that developers will devlop targeting windows the cost of windows can just be added to the total cost of the project which is paid for by the customer windows is less complicated to manage for the average person than a unix linux based os unix linux systems may be more efficient but cpus have become so fast that it is almost not even an issue anymore especially if the software on the unix linux based system is running in java as in java server pages and the software on the windows environment is based on net ok i spewed Visual Basic Microsoft Office Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Windows XP OpenOffice.org Ajax
