need help adding something to my site ok first thank you for helping i always award best answer points so i please help me ok ok i have a web page on aol hometown and i want to add on were i can allow people to add there music to my site so other user can listen to there music so is there a html code to make this happen or what the best way to do this do i have to go to a second party site to host there songs if so which one please leave your ideas and let me know i will vote for best answer asap thanks hi i don't think this would be possible on aol hometown for two reasons first of all you only have mb of webspace which would probably only store about three or four songs at maximum the other reason is that in order to create an uploading tool you need to use a server side language such as php asp net perl etc that can take the file your user is sending to your website it's simple to put a file browser in a form on your page input type file id file but telling your web server to store the file requires that you have access to your server in a way that aol hometown doesn't allow if you were to try it on a professional web server where you had enough webspace you'd need a good web host and probably your own domain you could use file input code to access the file a server side language to post the file onto your web server when the user submits the song submission form and flash to list all of your files and play them back hope this answers your question GIF Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Web page Quicksort PNG Beatmania IIDX IPod Mouse (computing) HTML element Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Firefox EMule Object Desktop QuickTime Speed of light Mozilla Application Suite System 7 (Macintosh) Floppy disk Gmail Musical Instrument Digital Interface Manual transmission Faster-than-light AmigaOS Screenshot Mandelbrot set Favicon Lossless data compression Traffic light Nintendo Revolution TGV Parachute MAME Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution Warcraft III P__li Computer virus Nuclear option (filibuster) Harmonica Prank flash Mac OS X v10.4 Recumbent bicycle Data compression Embedded system Image file formats CPU cache Film BZFlag Windows API Daigasso!
