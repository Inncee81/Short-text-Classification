what is the best programs to make a rpg web based of course so yeah i cant download em cos they are always to big and i have slooooooooooooow net so ill just make one and i would like to make it d none of this stuff with no animation or n e thing lol haha yes indeedy i am a kid but excell in i t the teacher asks me for help ha yeah i pick up programs pretty quickly i may not pick up this program like that but over time i will lol ah well although i dont use techinical programs i still get asked for a lot of help flash power point mod editor thing for mount and blade if you know what that is and yeah he asked me for help in power point my teacher is a bit of a dumb ass lol any way i really want to try and make my own game and my friends think i can do it p you can use adobe flash to create web based games that incorporate stuff like shooting walking fighting killing yadadada dudadi bliblablu yagagabuahaha creating games in flash is so simple that its almost laughable of course there's a certain learning curve but if you are a quick learner ask for help at forums and read up a little you should master it in no time many people have said that flash actionscript is the baby of all programming languages and i absolutely agree another programming language that is web based is java but java is slooooowww realllllyyyyyy realllyyy slooooowww and that suckkksssss away all the fun anyway i absolutely hated runescape back to flash if you feel you are well versed enough in actionscript after creating a handful of games you can even try your hand at creating mmorpgs like club penguin via the xml flash socket servers like smartfoxserver electroserver oregano palabre unity server red or web based rpgs like adventure quest smartfoxserver and electroserver have example apps and extensive documentation and though the trial is free and not time limited it only allows up to concurrent connections the oregano server is free and open source so perhaps you could try looking into oregano if you are interested in making an mmorpg having played the mmorpg club penguin for a while has shown me that only the chat and movement around the map is sent from client to client much of these is relatively simple to do although you can consider making turn based games that do not need to take into account the server latency cpu delay and other things real time games on the other hand are much too complicated as there are many variables to look into anyway if you are able to code a chess game along with the ai tower defense game google desktop tower defense a simple connect four game a pool game like yahoo pool and have a good idea on oop concepts then you are on your way to scamming money out of people who will pay for the games you have created of course you can always consider the product newly marketed by microsoft silverlight termed the flash killer as it is also web based technology i do not know much of silverlight but you can do research on it and tell me alternatively you can also get gamemaker engine and create applications with a touch of your hand but i believe its not web based like flash or java http en wikipedia org wiki game maker edit sadly i have to concur with the guy above me you don't sound like you have a clue about what making games involve making something like starcraft or even a simple rpg like adventure quest is very difficult it is entirely possible that you would likely not enjoy playing the games you have made on your own and the process in making a good one would involve a lot of testing edit haha yes indeedy i am a kid but excell in i t the teacher asks me for help ha yeah i pick up programs pretty quickly i may not pick up this program like that but over time i will so what programs do you use anyway i can use microsoft word and excel and say i excel in it too edit good for you then seems to me like your friends have a lot of justified faith in you and perhaps you are on the way to becoming a renowned programmer maybe someone who can become our next bill gates but i still would like to ask you a question though are you good in mathematics its because many algorithms in gaming like pathfinding and collision utilises some mathematical concepts perhaps not exactly the advanced kind but its still better if you do have some form of expertise in it if you are good in it which i'm sure you are then you should have have no problems going far or making that game which you are so keen on PHP MySQL Apache HTTP Server Ajax (programming) Web application Object-oriented programming CPAN BitTorrent
