how do you use a c program to execute another program with a parameter variable i need a program to execute a simulation program a specific number of times each time the simulation should be slightly different so i created a variable that makes the appropriate changes how can i make a program both run the simulation and specify the parameter i can also change the simulation if i have to actually the whole reason i have to do this is because the simulation can't free all of its memory unless it closes instead is there a way to free all memory except for the variable and start over that would have the same effect thanks well actually i didn't write the code to start with i'm just working with it and the person who wrote it has disappeared off the face of the earth but how do you call a program with arguments that's what i can't figure out what's the actual procedure by the way i'm using visual c on windows as foolish as it is how can i make a program both run the simulation and specify the parameter take advantage of the command line arguments that is when calling a program you can also give it arguments these arguments are accessible from main's definition int main int argc char argv actually the whole reason i have to do this is because the simulation can't free all of its memory unless it closes which suggests really bad code and program design so to deal with bad code and inefficiencies your idea is to repeatedly open and close the program another layer of inefficiency does this sound ok to you instead is there a way to free all memory except for the variable and start over the big question is how is this memory being allocated in the first place and why are you unable to control when it is deallocated edit well as i said the big ugly hack here is to use command line arguments that you can pass into a program so if you have a third party program to control create a controlling program that repeatedly calls it modifying the arguments as needed calling the commands is os specific and you haven't mentioned which one you are on in any case linux has a set of commands to spawn other processes as does the windows api look at createprocess in msdn you'll have to google to find out what works on your os my points about this being inefficient still remain but it's an option the other one is to refactor the code and clean it up so memory isn't leaking everywhere generally speaking if you see a lot of new and delete left and right without any sense of good memory management it's a lot of terrible code i don't know what you're working with so you'll have to make a few judgement calls and see whether a hack cuts it or something more involved is worth it Macromedia Dreamweaver Opera (web browser) Web browser Lotus Notes Web design System/36 Windows XP Atari 8-bit family System/34 Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox AmigaOS HyperText Transfer Protocol Game controller Blue screen of death Blender (software) Microsoft Windows Apple II family Enlightenment (X window manager) Plan 9 (operating system) Secure Shell System 7 (Macintosh) Embedded system Mozilla Application Suite Windows Vista Apple Macintosh PC Engine IMac Windows Mobile Uniform Resource Locator Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis HTTP cookie Windows 3.x MSN Messenger Sega Dreamcast History of Microsoft Windows Windows Server 2003 Netscape Navigator Emacs Cascading Style Sheets Window Maker Wi-Fi Internet Explorer for Mac PowerBook Macromedia Flash Apple IIGS Server Mac OS X v10.4 Xbox 360 WordStar Apple typography ATI Technologies Commodore PET Apple Computer Apache HTTP Server Video Graphics Array Portable Document Format Nintendo DS Internet Relay Chat Palm OS OpenOffice.org Mouse (computing) Wget Radeon BlackBerry ASP.NET Website MDAC Amstrad CPC Files-11 Cangjie method Commodore 64 Atari ST Microsoft Screenshot Finale notation program XML Screensaver BBC Master X Window System Windows Presentation Foundation Domain Name System C plus plus Handheld game console Minesweeper (computer game) Mac OS X AppleTalk ColdFusion Object Desktop Oscilloscope Commodore 128 Resident Evil (video game) Adobe Illustrator Resident Evil 2 VME Virtual Network Computing Sega Saturn Internet Explorer
