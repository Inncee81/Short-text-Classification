where can i find infomation to create a pop up model css html apparantly it's a pop up but in the same window that overlaps the window with a transparency to bring the pop up to your attention i think its spelled modal can it be done without javascript and just css html any tutorials would be helpful in order for an event to be created you must use some form of scripting such as javascript or vbscript a 'pop up' must be triggered by such events but you are right the model of this kind of pop up would be through css html you would create a div layer set to an absolute position javascript could be utilized to switch the display or visibility attribute from on to off none or block it would be my recommendation to review websites referring to javascript and css programming of course if you are not allowed to use javascript then it would be a waste of time unless you are like so many others that just love to learn about languages have a wonderful day PNG GIF Adobe Photoshop Mouse (computing) Macromedia Flash Macromedia Fireworks Microsoft .NET WordStar Screenshot 2D computer graphics Cursor (computers) Web page History of the graphical user interface Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox NTFS IPhoto RGB color model Microsoft Office Windows XP Mozilla Application Suite Portable Document Format Quake III Arena MP3 Transparency (computing) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Me Tagged Image File Format GIMP Comparison of web browsers PlayStation Portable Vi Mandriva Linux Blue screen of death JPEG 2000 Windows Vista Adobe InDesign IPod MDAC Minesweeper (computer game) Proxy server GNU Free Documentation License Lemmings 2: The Tribes ICalendar ITunes Archy Glass Icon (computing) OpenDocument BitTorrent Partition (computing) Typeface Something Awful Forums Perl Uploading and downloading Tux Paint JavaScript Digital image editing Photoshopping ImageMagick Common Unix Printing System HTML element TeX Bryce QuickTime Frog Copy protection FreeBSD Vorbis OpenBSD Monkey Island Adobe Acrobat Stardock Digital photography Comparison of media players Comment Mac OS X v10.4 Invisibility Modem Object Desktop Final Fantasy III KDE ASCII art Ebook Unicode MAME Kazaa Linux Image Direct Client-to-Client Microsoft PowerPoint ANSI art System 7 (Macintosh) Printed circuit board Warez WordPerfect Linux distribution Cascading Style Sheets Miranda IM
