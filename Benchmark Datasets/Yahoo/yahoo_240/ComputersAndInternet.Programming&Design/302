php error when passing string i am passing this via post select from tbltesting where upper title like ' ' or upper category like ' ' but when i echo it after being passed it looks like this query select from tbltesting where upper title like ' ' or upper category like ' ' obviously this doesn't work because of the extra slashed how do i prevent this from happening not sure what 'pot' is that your referring too i need to pass this via post and i know there is a way to manipulate the sting so it won't auto escape certain variables but i can't think what it is ewang do not have access to modify server settings analprogrammer not using the url to pass variable plus it would strip out initially which i need in the end sonny mostafaphp not sure what you are getting at the issue is that the slashes are inserted after the pass thus making the query unusable i want it to pass and be identical to the original value quick answer is stripslashes but as said you should pass the variables through your urlquery not the whole mysql query through the url reason you dont want to do this is all someone has to do is change the string to select from tbltesting where upper title like ' ' or upper category like ' ' delete from tbltesting as the url query Tai shogi Collision detection Debugging Musical mode Interval (music) Dai dai shogi Tenjiku shogi Chu shogi Wa shogi Dai shogi Marching band Mathematical induction Heian dai shogi Counterpoint Hash table Abstraction (computer science) Web crawler Ko shogi Minishogi Tori shogi Cocoa (API) Judkins shogi Luhn algorithm Expert system Hand shogi Microshogi Yari shogi Polymerase chain reaction Cannon shogi Contredanse Objective-C Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Information Services Procurement Library Solfege Synthesizer Glossary of partner dance terms MDAC Gmail Digest access authentication Equal temperament Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Domain Name System Complexity classes P and NP Eight queens puzzle Substitution cipher Datatype Serialization Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Return-to-libc attack Denial-of-service attack Internet pornography Programming language Whale shogi Scholarship Stairway Ruffini's rule C plus plus Condom Legal research Kyoto shogi Unified Modeling Language Drill bit Secant method Hardware random number generator Umphrey's McGee Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Financial audit GunZ The Duel Web accessibility Iterative and incremental development Object-oriented programming Link spam Error correction and detection Central processing unit Musical Instrument Digital Interface Musical ensemble Chromatic scale Filling station Simulated annealing Single (music) Western blot Information Technology Infrastructure Library RSS (file format) Software testing Counter Wine making BitTorrent Block cipher modes of operation Tonality Analytical chemistry Dynamic Systems Development Method Software development process Objective Modula-2 Scientology beliefs and practices Computation Avionics software Steps Alcoholics Anonymous Pick's theorem
