font problems i am working with adobe indesign cs pc and i own baskerville old face regular i want the font to appear bold and i have been told the best way to achieve this is to purchase baskerville old face bold i cannot use a different font this is a corporate brand must use this font and i am planning only to purchase the bold variation not the entire font family i am not sure which bold font style will match my current baskeville font when i went to www fonts com to purchase this font style i found different variations of the font and i am not sure which one to get the variations found are the following monotype baskerville new baskerville itc new baskerville it does not appear itlaic so i dont think itc stand for italic baskerville book baskerville small caps itc new baskerville ce bold itc new baskerville cyrillic expert bold osf what the differences and how do i know which one to get itc is an acronym for the international typeface corporation they make approximately fonts and the itc lets you know which ones they designed and distributed the itc new baskerville fonts you have there are all from the same family you have a regular version a cyrillic expert bold version and a cyrillic expert bold old style figures bold version what makes me upset when companies use a particular font for their image the designers who created it often fail to look at how broad of range the font can actually be used for italic bold black the baskerville of bold font you need to find doesn't exist but you have plenty of baskerville fonts all not in the same family which is why they are called something different but all that look the same and are part of different families baskerville old face was a font used for centuries on old type setters but there was no bold italic or anything mainly used for old text in books new baskerville was designed to be an updated version that had a broad range of uses one that has bold italic black bold italic etc they are the same font but one is slightly more modern purchase the new baskerville bold and you'll be golden compare the upper case q for the old face baskerville you already have on your pc and the new baskerville bold you purchase and you'll see one of the subtle changes others changes exist but this is the most obvious it's the tail of the q most changes only happen to the weird and less used letters figures q z x etc new baskerville bold will do the trick for you http www myfonts com fonts linotype itc new baskerville bold Adobe Photoshop Microsoft Office GIMP Adobe Systems Adobe Illustrator PNG IPod Adobe Acrobat Corel Digital image editing Photoshopping Microsoft Weekly newspaper Apple Computer ImageMagick IPhoto Paint Shop Pro 2D computer graphics Visual Basic .NET Apple Macintosh Microsoft Windows OpenOffice.org Linspire Favicon Text editor WordPerfect Vector graphics editor Ebook GIF RGB color model Editor Macromedia Flash GNU General Public License JavaScript Adobe InDesign PostScript Bryce Finale notation program Trademark Windows Vista OpenDocument Graphic design IPod photo Game programmer Microsoft Paint Desktop publishing Digital audio workstation Tagged Image File Format C plus plus Playboy (magazine) Mac OS X 2000 Australian Grand Prix Windows Mobile Microsoft .NET Forth programming language First-sale doctrine Counterfeit Portable Document Format Version Macromedia Fireworks Game programming Xerox Star OpenType FrameMaker Windows registry Chess Visual Basic MacPaint Microsoft Word Opera (web browser) Fark.com Girls Aloud Style guide Yearbook Java programming language Tux Paint Multiple document interface Inheritance (computer science) Library (computer science) Apple typography IBM PC compatible HyperCard Visual C Plus Plus Atari 8-bit family Pornography Microsoft Flight Simulator The Sims Emacs Windows XP Plugin Edlin Ashton-Tate Windows API Drawing MDAC Poker jargon Internet fraud History of Microsoft Windows System/34 The Star Wars Holiday Special
