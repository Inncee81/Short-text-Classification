how would i do this with words its kinda short but heres what i mean in livejournal you can type a whole bunch but then put that in brackets with lj cut or something and it blocks it out to a read more button when you click it it loads everything you wrote now how would i do this for myspace and how would i change it from read more to whatever is inbetween the cut part you either need to use javascript or something similar that would allow you to change what's displayed on the fly without re loading the page but as the other guy said i don't believe you can use that type of code in your myspace profile so i'm not sure of any solution that will work with myspace Microsoft .NET Sun Microsystems Grid computing Java programming language Virtual machine Windows Server 2003 Java platform Windows 2000 Windows XP Domain Name System Web hosting Microsoft Windows Ajax (programming) Linux C plus plus Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Mainframe computer Novell NetWare Game programmer Visual Basic Web service Website X Window System Macromedia Flash Server Message Block ASP.NET Perl Component Object Model Java virtual machine VeriSign Trademark Mac OS X Lotus Notes Domain name Operating system Google search Oracle Corporation Enterprise service bus Amiga Distributed computing Remote procedure call WebObjects JavaScript Open source culture Vorbis PHP Categorical list of programming languages CP/M AS/400 Borland Platform (computing) Internet JINI Object-oriented programming E-mail HTTP cookie Service-oriented architecture Stardock BPEL Workflow Stopping e-mail abuse Videoconferencing Visual Basic .NET Forth programming language GNOME Microsoft Spyware Windows Vista Application server Google Maps Atari ST Teletext Visual Studio .NET Windows 3.x Universal Serial Bus Python programming language Name mangling Spring operating system World Wide Web .uk Unicode MP3 Kazaa Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition Windows API MMORPG IP address Microsoft Office Data mining Packages in Java Berkeley Software Distribution Airport security Voice over IP Dot-com Web crawler WNET Web 2.0 Reflection (computer science) IBM PC compatible
