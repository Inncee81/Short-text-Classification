i would like to learn assembly so i would like to learn the assembly programming language so i want to know of what assemblers you use and which one you think is best i would like to be able to download the assembler free on the internet if you could give a link that would be great then i think i will need a compiler links for those would be great too if there are any assemblers that come with a compiler sort of like dev c i would rather have that than an assembler and a different compiler and finally if you know of any good assembler tutorials on the internet could you give me some links for those or books thanks assembly tutorials lol not assembler tutorials okay i'll check out masm i'm not gonna set it up right now because i'm doing a disc defragmentation but i will later masm is probably the more popular one for windows most available source code online seems to have been done it in it comes with a decent simple ide http www masm com i havn't messed with this stuff in a long time but books i read always started out just using debug but i don't have any books handy i can recommend assembler is cool to learn about you'll learn a lot more about how your computer really works it's really useless for most practical applications however remember it technically is not even a programming language but representative machine code PHP Visual Basic Python programming language C programming language C syntax Perl Datatype Polymorphism (computer science) Name mangling C plus plus Control flow SHA hash functions JavaScript Icon programming language BASIC programming language Scheme programming language Boolean datatype Common Lisp Cross site scripting Explosive material C Sharp Comparison of generics to templates Objective-C Prolog MySQL Associative array UTF-8 Boolean logic Smalltalk PL/SQL CPAN RPL programming language IP (complexity) Compiler optimization Ajax (programming) String (computer science) MUMPS HTTP cookie Object-oriented programming Slashdot subculture Gmail Exception handling Quicksort Pattern matching Killian documents Phase-shift keying Abstraction (computer science) Printf Forth programming language JScript .NET Ruby programming language Boolean algebra Euphoria programming language Linked list Software documentation Generic programming HTML HyperText Transfer Protocol Captcha Emacs Cyclone programming language VHSIC hardware description language Hungarian notation Hash table Software testing Variable Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Transport Layer Security Punycode Pointer Apache HTTP Server Lisp programming language PHP-Nuke Spyware Rabin-Karp string search algorithm Halting problem Password Reflection (computer science) Cyclic redundancy check AS/400 Command Language Randomness Domain Name System Violin JavaServer Pages Lambda calculus Brainfuck Collision detection Categorical list of programming languages CPU cache Regular expression Dylan programming language PNG Tcl Character encodings in HTML Microsoft .NET Hash function Wget Files-11
