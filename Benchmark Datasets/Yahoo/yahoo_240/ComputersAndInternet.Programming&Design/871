how do i make photoshop make my hair look fuller in photoshop i only have the demo version of photoshop elements and also how do i make teeth look a little whiter if you have a demo version then the features may be limited but to make your hair fuller there is not much you can do unless you selct a section of your hair with the lasso tool then copy and paste it and use the blur too to blend them i wouldnt suggest making your hair fuller though because i doubt that it would look real as for whitening the teeth using the polygonal lasso tool outline the teeth once it is selected with the blinking dotted line then go to image adjustments hue saturation or brightness and contrast and lighten them there i say you should go ahead and download the trial version of photoshop cs Mouse (computing) Microsoft PowerPoint Macromedia Flash Screenshot Mozilla Firefox Windows XP Google Presentation MSN Messenger Tabbed document interface AmigaOS PlayStation Portable IPod Stardock Slideshow Internet Explorer History of the graphical user interface Google Desktop Windows Vista Microsoft Office P__li Computer wallpaper HTTP cookie AppleScript MapleStory Game Boy Camera Internet Explorer for Mac Photography Double-click (computing) Windows Mobile Konqueror Macintosh Finder Opera (web browser) Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Self-organized criticality Windows 2000 Stereoscopy Sound effect HyperCard Digital photography Pie menu Unicode Comparison of web browsers Object Desktop SAS System GLOCK Tab (GUI) IBM PC keyboard Microsoft Paint Map Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test Cascading Style Sheets Manual transmission Multiple document interface Skateboarding trick Search engine optimization Baseball Stars Oldsmobile Silhouette Amstrad CPC Presentation program Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Mortal Kombat II Bass guitar Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Professional wrestling holds Taskbar Slot machine Gmail Limit Break Fitts' law PLATO ITunes Web traffic Icon (computing) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Function key SAT Keynote (software) Gramophone record Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Newton OS WordPerfect Context menu Nuclear weapon Dictionary Marching band Floppy disk Window Maker Avant Browser Halo: Combat Evolved Menu (computing) Mozilla Application Suite PIC microcontroller Persuasion technology Combat Mission (computer game series) Visual Basic .NET Hell's Kitchen (television) Broadband Internet access High-definition television Combo box
