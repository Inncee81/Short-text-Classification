how do i make objects proportionate to the form in visual basic properly the question title can't really be that good so let me explain i have to make this form in visual basic i have here a filelistbox and some combo list boxes and an imagebox where i'm making an image viewer how do i keep the combo list boxes remain at least a few cms away from the form even if i resize it the file list box also needs to decrease its height proportionate enough not to go through the other buttons but expanding just enough to remain proportionate to the form same with the image box but i have added a stretch function too that's supposed to make the image stretch when a checkbox is clicked i want that the imagebox should be proportionate to the form even when resized but with the stretch still working please help i'm so confused for future reference i recommend that you also specify which visual basic version you are using or net because they can be very different i am going to assume you mean net when you select a control on your form in its properties you will find a property called anchor which will allow you to essentially lock the control in place relational to the form's edge so for instance if i put a button on my form and i set the button's anchor property to anchor to the right by clicking the little right outline in the little screen that pops up i am telling the button to stay at its location relative to the right edge so when the width of the form grows the button will follow along keeping the same padding between it and the forms right edge by default a control is usually anchored to the top and left edges you can anchor to one or more edges at the same time by anchoring to three or more edges you will force the button to grow and shrink along with the form but for your viewer you are probably going to link most controls to two edges except for the viewing area which you may want to link to all for edges so it will grow and shrink with the size of the form you usually find articles talking about anchoring at the same time they talk about docking docking however puts the control tied to the edge rather than floating away from it like anchoring does the link below will show you a bit of what i am talking about and how to use it enjoy Metalanguage
