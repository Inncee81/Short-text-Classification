how do you make story banners for fanfiction i've seen a lot of banners people make for stories like for example on this site http forums quizilla com showthread php t page i want to make one but i don't know what you need to have in order to create it do i need to get photoshop is there a free way of doing it instead most computers come with a paint program just use that find a picture you like and save it to your computer sadly because it's paint you can't add those cool things that other people do like put two people together with the blurred affect but this works none the less then crop the picture to the size that you want paint allows you to add text if you want to choose a color that you like and add text such as your story name and username it won't look as nice as those because you do have to have a specific program for that then save the picture to your computer use html to put the picture somewhere it usually won't work for fanfiction net though if you have trouble with html the best place to send you would be a simple not bash your head against the wall tutorial http neopets com help html phtml you can also upload the picture using some type of uploading system like what ffn does for their story documents QuickTime ITunes Windows Media Video Macromedia Flash PlayStation Portable Streaming media IPod Warez MP3 Video codec MPlayer Ogg Windows Media Audio Online music store High-definition television AVI DivX Theora WAV Xbox Windows Vista Windows Mobile Kazaa Mozilla Firefox FLAC Windows XP DVD Mac OS X v10.4 Creative Zen H.264/MPEG-4 AVC BitTorrent AmigaOS MPEG-4 Moving Picture Experts Group Computer virus Advanced Audio Coding Comparison of media players Podcasting Blu-ray Disc VirtualDub Web page ITunes Music Store Voice over IP Dolby Digital World Wide Web Xbox 360 Digital audio workstation DV Trillian (instant messenger) XviD Windows Media Player Microsoft Commodore 64 Audio data compression 8 mm video format Gmail Public domain Laserdisc Portable Document Format Opera (web browser) Floppy disk Internet pornography StarCraft OGM Common Unix Printing System Lossless data compression Digital photography Non-linear editing system Peer-to-peer MiniDisc Web crawler Dirac Open access RealNetworks Copy protection Bluetooth Sound card Mozilla Application Suite FFmpeg America Online Enterprise content management Mach kernel OpenBSD MDAC Cowon Pretty Good Privacy Sega Dreamcast Unix Linux Ebook Skype Camcorder TTA
