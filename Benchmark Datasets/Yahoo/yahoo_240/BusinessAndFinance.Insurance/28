how would i go about seeing if my mother who is deseased had any life insurance policies on herself i remember her paying premiums to some company but i dont know which i dont live around where she lived so i could not go search her files it seems like some family members all the sudden have too much money i know if she did have she would have wanted it to be equally divided between her children how could i find out this information i cant ask my sister or her husband who is not my father he is my sisters father i do think there is some family secrets and because i live so far away they did not let me in on it please help only serious answers to this very importatant question please thank you ok well there is no central database so you can't just pop her name in somewhere and see if it comes up insurance departments don't track it either and one person can't cash in a policy the insurance company makes the payments directly to whomever she listed to get payments so there isn't any equally divided it's all done however she set it up the insurance company takes care of that and it's a private transaction so unless you do go down there and get legal authority to get access to her banking transactions from her old bank not likely as she left a surviving spouse and go through her files you're not going to know no one is going to tell you unless you're a beneficiary and if you were you'd have a check around the same time all the other beneficiaries got one sure there might be some family secrets but they can't withhold a life insurance payout to you so don't let it keep you up at night Life insurance Insurance Annuity Bank Health insurance Medicare (United States) Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Child support Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money Medical malpractice Divorce Trust (Law) USA Contract Canada Health Act Term life insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Password Citigroup American International Group Personal finance Ponzi scheme Trust (Law) non-USA Medicare (Canada) Bond Publicly funded medicine Derivative (finance) Security (finance) Payroll Mergers and acquisitions Credit card FairTax Open access Same-sex marriage Auto insurance Domain Name System Internet fraud Unemployment benefit United Kingdom corporation tax Bank fraud Slot machine Pension Microeconomics Lloyd's of London Octopus card Advance fee fraud Intellectual property United States Postal Service Gold standard Inheritance tax Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Tax Title insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Money supply SCO-Linux controversies Universal life insurance Cheque Legal tender Financial markets Primerica Financial Services Microsoft 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Oil-for-Food Programme Euro Bank of China (Hong Kong) Financial services Family British Royal Family Mortgage Health care in the United States Economy of India Infantilism Article One of the United States Constitution Blackjack Social Security debate (United States) Bad faith Automated Clearing House Firefighter Economy of Russia Finance Actuary Currency Probate Freeters Plame affair Paternalism Paid Family Leave EastEnders Federal Reserve
