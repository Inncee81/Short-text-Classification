how likely is it that my car insurance will go up due to this haven't had a claim in over ten years haven't gotten a ticket in probably years but the neighbor kid did k worth of damage to my car with his bike in three separate incidents basically half of it will have to be repainted i'd really really rather not go to court his insurance is not an option in this case he doesn't have laying around if i go the much easier route of getting him to pay at least my deductible how likely is state farm to raise my rates with a after deductible claim of about or so any relevant advice comment is appreciated killing the kid did cross my mind for just the briefest of moments but then i realized that might be overreacting just a tad lol forgot to mention that i did file a police report and the stepdad admitted his kid years old most likely did it again just wondering if my rates will go up if i go the easy way and file a claim insurance doesn't apply due to it being on rental property interesting question the company i work for has been discussing what a chargeable accident is for the past months the jury is still out if you file a claim with no accompanying police report showing the accident is not your fault they will consider it a chargeable accident if it wasn't why did they pay a claim i'm going to guess state farm in you state has accident forgiveness most preferred companies will not raise your rates if you have chargeable incident in say a three year period if you have then they'll raise your rates so if you'd like to file a claim and not have it count against you i'd contact the police to file a accident report against the kid turn this in with your claim and get the repair done your insurer may go after the parents for money but i'm guessing for they won't bother good luck United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Insurance Flat tax Microeconomics Annuity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Speed limit The Amazing Race Slander and libel Capital gains tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sharon Tate EastEnders Blackjack Theory of conduct Social Security (United States) Warren Buffett Evan Mecham Child support Drug test Katelyn Faber Roswell UFO incident Road traffic accident United Airlines Tax Medical malpractice Health insurance Public domain Progressive tax Wal-Mart Attorney at Law Income tax SCO-Linux controversies Law of value Inflation Schapelle Corby FairTax Unemployment benefit Accident Estoppel Downing Street memo 401(k) Contract Milton H.
