did my new dentist shorten my appt because i am an hmo patient i have a dental hmo plan and had to pick a new dentist in the network i picked a new practice in my town i went in for my first appt today for a checkup and cleaning i was in and out of that seat in less than minutes that is crazy he zipped through the scraping and the cleaning and left the room and the hygenist took the xrays and i was dismissed no one asked me anything about my teeth like do i floss how do i brush how often etc etc no one told me wether my xrays were good or not i am so upset now because i do know that hmo patients are sometimes discriminated against but i never thought it would happen to me i am still in complete shock about this experience what should i do i think i have already made up my mind about chaning dentists but i am furious should i call and ask the receptionist how long an exam and cleaning takes and what happens during one should i write a letter and tell them how i feel over the past years or so i've seen a lot of different dentists trying to find one i like what i've discovered is that most dentists especially on the first appointment take for freakin ever they want to talk about your dental history take x rays etc i'm not exaggerating when i say i've been in the office more than an hour on more than one occasion and no it's not like i have bad teeth the dentists are just very thorough especially when they have not treated you before i do believe this guy rushed you through but i won't say it was definitely because you are in an hmo maybe he's just a shoddy dentist anyway call the office act like you're a new patient and want to schedule an appointment tell them you'd like to come on your lunch hour so how long does a first appointment typically take after you get an answer if you're still not satisfied i'd contact your hmo i'd also write a letter to the dentist and copy the hmo nothing will come of it most likely but you'll feel better in doing so Dentistry The Dentist Oral hygiene Tooth Health maintenance organization Dental brace Social rule Dental floss Dental caries My Family (television) Medical prescription Health insurance Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Gingivitis Sydney Riot of 1879 Boom Town (Doctor Who) Kurt Angle American and British English differences Dental hygienist Crown (dentistry) Triage The Shining (film) Dentures Vernon Schillinger Pitaten Stomach cancer Surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 2) God Emperor of Dune Orthodontics Doctorate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) General practitioner Kodocha Le Malade imaginaire Pok__mon Live!
