hey mbcratz about the insurance the uaw for ford said that if the insurance doesnt pay me than theyll have thier lawyer handle it so i am covered it sounds like your union rep is just trying to make you feel good the insurance contract you had at the time you went to the doctor will dictate if you are covered if the insurance company denies you and says you are not covered then the uaw is saying they will take this to court who knows who will win given the current state of the negotiation i'd bet ford might want to take this to court but there's not enough information in your question to know for sure United Auto Workers Insurance Democratic Party (United States) Life insurance Contract Medical malpractice Social Security (United States) Henry Ford Congress of Industrial Organizations Unemployment benefit Publicly funded medicine Gambling Canadian and American health care systems compared Health care in the United States Blackjack Attorney at Law Risk management Betting (poker) SCO-Linux controversies Supreme Court of the United States Poker jargon Estoppel Atomic Kitten US health reform under FDR HIPAA Federal Marriage Amendment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pharmaceutical company Schapelle Corby Medicare (United States) President of the United States Adverse selection Workers' compensation Lawyer Value added tax Derivative (finance) Studebaker Tort reform Commodity markets Lloyd's of London Auto insurance Arbitration Sampling (music) National Football League Players' Association Alberto Gonzales Trade union Health savings account Predatory lending Dearborn, Michigan ACORN Home insurance Henry Lee Lucas Ford Motor Company Title insurance Unemployment Bob Rae V8 Supercar On Her Majesty's Secret Service George Galloway John Ford (politician) Health maintenance organization Oakland Athletics United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America Colt's Manufacturing Company Notary public No Child Left Behind Act Firefighter Copyright Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Legal aspects of transsexualism Case citation Calvin Coolidge American International Group Warranty Republican Party (United States) Variable universal life insurance Liability insurance Michael D.
