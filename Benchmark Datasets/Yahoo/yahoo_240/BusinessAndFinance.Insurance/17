what are the risks of getting advanced pay for the entire year i recently accepted an insurance job position so far i have paid around for all the insurance classes the license training etc it is a commission based outside sales position just this week i was told that pretty much i have to get advanced pay which means as soon as i make a sale i get paid the commission based on an entire year's premium the client will pay in the following months so that means if i quit in months then i'd be in debt because i'd owe the company money i see other insurance agents who are very very successful because if you stay for a long time you do get paid great but that's not my case because i'm going to leave in months should i just quit and find another job asap what the advance pay means is that as soon as you close a sale and submit the paperwork you get paid a percentage of the client's first year premiums for example if the premium for the first year is you may get depending on your commission scale you get this paid up front typically it doesn't matter if you leave the company but if your clients don't keep their policies for a minimum of months the company will come back after you to repay the commissions you have been paid they still have this ability even after you've left the company this is really not a good business to be in unless you already have a good list of insurance prospects or friends and family that will buy from you i've been in that business and i would never recommend it to anyone the insurance companies are only out for themselves the managers only job is to recruit they expect that their new hires will not make it but you'll come on board make a few sales then they could really care less what happens after that i was an agent for new york life for almost a year and i would never recommend it to anyone a couple of my clients dropped their insurance coverage after i left the company as i wasn't there to foster the relationship and my clients became orphaned clients and the company hired a collection agency to come after me for the commissions i had been paid being an insurance agent under this type of contract is a lose lose situation for the agent Insurance Health insurance Life insurance Wal-Mart Mutual fund Annuity Bond Lloyd's of London Variable universal life insurance Debt Citigroup Unemployment Primerica Financial Services Real estate broker Short selling Mortgage Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Publicly funded medicine Investment bank Auto insurance Social Security (United States) Bank Warren Buffett Internet fraud Tax Oakland Athletics Monetary policy Title insurance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks American International Group Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Unemployment benefit Financial analyst Outsourcing Hyperinflation Institutional fund management Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Corporate governance Education in the People's Republic of China Medicare (Canada) Stock Estoppel Commodity markets Predatory lending Government debt Student loan Plame affair Pharmaceutical company Graduate school Auction Management Microsoft Health care in the United States Barrister Prudential plc United States Postal Service National Football League Professor Cable television Finance Option Economy of the United States Poker jargon Blackjack Economic inequality Term life insurance Capitalism Value added tax Customer relationship management Eliot Spitzer Universal life insurance Baseball Actuary Derivative (finance) Bulk vending Great Teacher Onizuka Karl Rove Corporate finance E-mail spam Advance fee fraud Divorce FairTax PE ratio MapleStory Child support Drug test EastEnders Berkshire Hathaway Emergency Medical Services Freeters Call centre Adverse selection
