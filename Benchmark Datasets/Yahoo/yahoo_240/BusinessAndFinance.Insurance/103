i had a car accident had a total loss on my car i was hit by another driver who was at fault i incurred a back injury and visited the chiropractic doctor times i had a mri massages and exercises done i feel better now the visit to the doctor cost me and the mri cost me another i had a coverage for pip for and the guy who hit me had a full coverage on his car my attorney is filing a case against each of these companies my lawyer is telling me that i dont have a valid case because i didnt sustained a permanent injury my attorney had asked with my doctor for my medical release i was also paid for my car by allstate the insurance company of the guy at fault i am a full time student and trying to complete my school on loan so i haven't worked from the day of my accident to this date so my attorney is filing for a settlement with both of the insurance companies so i am going to get any money from this i had a doctors bills for mri cost of and a for my car so how much is my case worth now i am in florida it's been a long time since i dealt with florida so adj attnys from that area may can tell you more but here goes florida is a no fault state which means they have personal injury protection coverage each driver files under their pip coverage for their medical bills up to you may also have medical payment's coverage that can help too this is regardless of whose fault the accident is hence the nick name no fault in order to collect for pain and suffering you have to break threshold having a permanent injury breaks threshold and would allow you collect from the other person's liability since your bills are less than and you do not have a permanent injury then you can not recover more but look at it this way since you were such an honest person and did not run up a bunch of un needed medical treatment nor fake a permanent injury maybe karma will be kind to you and if you ever have a wreck that is your fault you will be fortunate enough to hit someone who is honest and not some greedy bas d who is out to just rip off an insurance company and make everyones premiums go up Insurance Life insurance Medical malpractice Health insurance Terri Schiavo Medicare (Canada) Negligence Tort reform Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health care in the United States Liability insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Traumatic brain injury Publicly funded medicine Tax Contract Road traffic accident Microeconomics Non-economic damages caps Slander and libel Lawyer American Medical Association Risk management Variable universal life insurance Divorce Asbestos and the law Asbestos Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Driver's license Chiropractic Childbirth Taxation in the United States Attorney at Law John Edwards Law firm Appeal Bond Dave Reichert 2003 California recall 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child support Repetitive strain injury Unemployment benefit Medical prescription Medicine John F.
