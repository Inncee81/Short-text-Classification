i own a office condo i was told that i didnt need property insurance because the condominium association does that since condo owners only own whats inside not the structure itself but i have the bank calling me about property insurance what kind of insurance theyre talkin about the bank wants their interest shown on the policy insuring whatever you spent the money on if you used the money to purchase the unit then their interest should be shown on the condo policy most likely scenario if you used it to purchase your equipment then you will need to purchase an office package policy and have their interest shown on that policy for the items you purchased even if it's the first scenario you still need to purchase an office package policy to protect your contents but also the liability exposure from your business operations not covered by condo's policy as well as coverage for the improvements you do to your unit Insurance Home insurance Mortgage Condominium Life insurance Health insurance Auto insurance Title insurance Financial services Donald Trump Citigroup Trademark United States Postal Service Liability insurance Paintball Intellectual property Commodity markets Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Security (finance) Money supply Risk management Toronto-Dominion Bank North York, Ontario New Deal Wal-Mart Trade Bank Government debt Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Lloyd's of London Bulk vending Surveillance Corporate finance Economy of India Tax Annuity Tort reform Capital accumulation Corporation Derivative (finance) Medicare (United States) HSBC Publicly funded medicine Creative accounting Inflation Finance Digital rights management Economy of Russia Deflation (economics) Actuary Mergers and acquisitions Liability Economy of the United States Microeconomics Warranty Contract Monetary policy Personal finance History of the United States (1918-1945) Public policy Taxation in the United States FairTax Unemployment Saskatchewan Government Insurance Berkshire Hathaway Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Money Great Depression Unconscionability US health reform 1912-1920 American individualist anarchism Bank fraud US health reform under Clinton Variable universal life insurance Publishing Ethical consumerism Copyright Health care in the United States Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Capitalism Independent agencies of the United States government Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus US health reform under FDR Federal National Mortgage Association Leasing Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economy of Pakistan Islamic banking Economy of Greece National Health Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Minor league baseball Certificate of deposit Nuclear power Stock Gross domestic product Credit card Predatory lending Business ethics
