should i consider selling insurance instead of furniture i sell furniture now but am not satisfied i was considering sellling for bankers life i already am working on comission but it is not enough money is this a wise move it really depends on you i would avoid becoming a captive agent meaning that you can only sell insurance for company i am an independent broker in oh best move i have ever made however i am built for outside sales selling furniture is retail the difference being that people come into your store looking for furniture rarely does anyone come to me looking for insurance i have to find them do not expect people to come to you to become an independent you will need to decide if you want to work for someone else an agency or yourself working for an agency is the best way to start if you want some initial financial support along with some back room support the downside of this is that the agency will keep some of our commissions working for yourself can mean more money but you will need to have some money in the bank to support yourself until you get enough commissions Insurance Citigroup Bank Mutual fund Berkshire Hathaway Real estate broker Financial services NASDAQ Investment bank Annuity Finance Bond Stock broker Short selling Stock Microcredit Inventory Life insurance Tesco American International Group Security (finance) Construction Health insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Sears Holdings Corporation Animal Crossing Economy of India HSBC Stock market Minor league baseball Bank of China (Hong Kong) Primerica Financial Services Contract Wells Fargo Federal Reserve Mortgage Temasek Holdings Variable universal life insurance Independent agencies of the United States government Money Gold as an investment Day trading Bulk vending Euro Mergers and acquisitions New Deal Predatory lending Wal-Mart Charles Ponzi Monetary policy Central bank Commodity markets Strap-on dildo J Sainsbury Financial markets Capitalism Lloyd's of London Habbo Hotel Tax UK Singles Chart Upholstery Toronto-Dominion Bank Publishing Principal Financial Group Social Security (United States) Economy of the United States Prudential plc Amazon.com United Artists Great Depression Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Internet fraud Blackjack Cooperative Debt Target Corporation President's Choice Financial Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Credit union Google Microeconomics Ko__ Holding Pyramid scheme Privatization Business Credit card ITV Edward Gibbon Wakefield Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company Inflation Shoppers Drug Mart Campaign finance reform National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States Taxation in the United States Derivative (finance) Irish Life and Permanent American individualist anarchism Government agencies in Sweden Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
