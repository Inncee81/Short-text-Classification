what are some good ideas for a hannah montana episode i like to write scripts just for fun some day hoping it pays off and was wondering if you guys have any good idea for me write about no miley hannah kills herself and stuff like that miley rox i always think about that i think that miley should have sung at the kareoke night and everyone would suspect her of being hannah or she would fall at one of her concerts like beyonce and she would get hurt and obviously miley would too so miley would go back to school and then she realized that she can't do her hannah concert because everyone would realize that hannah and miley have the same cast or something then she would end up doing something crazy as usual haha like have lilly be hannah and her lip syncing but only she would get caught lip syncing and they would realize that it wasnt hannah then in school lilly would become all popular because she was hannah montana for that night and miley would get all jealous but eventually lilly would say something sweet to miley and it would all be better Charmed Everwood The Ashlee Simpson Show Knots Landing Neil Young The Shining (film) 28 Days Later 'N Sync Destiny's Child Buddy Guy Aerial (dance move) Ashlee Simpson Crazy in Love Once More, With Feeling (Buffy episode) Cliff Richard George Abbott Aladdin (1992 film) Family Guy Swingout Source engine Full Metal Panic?
