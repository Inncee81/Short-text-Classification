bf help ive never had a bf and im lol young i know but kids have bfs at anyway it never works out the last guy i liked liked me and another girl which was his true love so it didnt work out i like this guy brandon now and ive liked him in the past a lot of times he talks to me and all but in may before school ended when i was over him he thought i still liked him i think he got the hint from all my friends at the time he was dating another girl on my yearbook he signed its lindsey's bf brandon and he gave me a fake aim sn and all he never had one but then sometimes he acted like he liked me and he sorta acts like it now how do i really know i wish i could ask him but hes the football player jock type that probably wouldnt give me the time of day and would probably tell all his friends also in order to get a bf should i just tell them how i feel i never do that ever im not shy but i just don't im too scared of rejection hi hon from your description he sounds like a jerk if he's the type that gives you a fake aim sn and would tell his friends about you liking him to get a laugh then he's a jerk don't bother since he seems to be giving mixed signals or changing his mind midstream who's to say he wouldn't do the same thing to you if you did end up bf gf then you'd really feel hurt don't worry about not having a bf yet it'll happen as far as telling them how you feel why not feel them out first with a general question like if they are on the school's soccer team ask if they think the team is good enough to be champions this year or if they can beat some other school if the guy is a good guy and maybe likes you he will start a conversation about it if he just gives a one word answer or a weird look or is mean just say sorry i asked and you'll know right then and there without having revealed too much btw try to catch them alone boys in a group will be rude to you because they're afraid of their friends teasing and rejecting them good luck and don't rush Social rule Time Out of Mind About a Boy Avenue Q Friends Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye The Fairly OddParents The Ashlee Simpson Show Cliff Richard Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an She Loves You Pitaten Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Singlish Knots Landing I Want to Hold Your Hand Ranma __ characters Pok__mon Live!
