parents of teens what do you think about myspace com teenage girls are posting some of the most alarming stuff and i hear alot of cries for help has anyone here had problems with what your teens are up too thanks for any advise and personal stories i'm years old not a parent i think that myspace is actually quite helpful for parents some kids are dumb enough to post pictures of themselves drinking or doing drugs at parties or something like that it just makes it easy for parents to catch them i think that parents should all be thanking myspace for helping them monitor their children as for kids that get stalked by some internet predator well it's their fault they put personal information on a public site they're stupid also myspace is an excellent way to express yourself when i meet somebody new i seem to always ask them if they would add me on myspace usually they say yes if they are cool and i go to their profile to see what they're all about it really helps you get to know people it also allows you to communicate and keep up with your friends and everybody's fast paced lives MySpace Daria Limp Bizkit Alcoholics Anonymous LiveJournal KaBlam!
