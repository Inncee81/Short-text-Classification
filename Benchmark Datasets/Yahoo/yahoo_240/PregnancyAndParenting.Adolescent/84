what alternatives to treating yr olds the same sincere help puleeze i have a yr old daughter and a yr old grandaughter who has been here months the grandaughter has mild learning disabilites the daughter is in honor classes the grandaughter has had problems with drinkng and drugs in the past and was sexually active the daughter has not had those same problems and has a boyfriend of months the grandaughter has anger control issues and a potty mouth when she is angry i am stricter on the grandaughter and she has to have boyfriends to the house and inspected before she goes off we did spebd over for her to go the prom but naturally we are accused of favoritism all the time but they are different at when they ask for an explanation it seems proper to answer them of course that is a difficult situation and everybody may not be satisfied with everything you do the granddaughter sounds like she has more than earned her restrictions to her private life by disrespecting you and your rules it sounds like you have taken her in out of the kindness of your heart so there is no reason you need to apologize for how you do things your daughter may also feel sometimes like she gets less attention but she needs to appreciate that your granddaughter has special problems she does not have to deal with it fyi to state the obvious you need to get your granddaughter on birth control so you don't have a great granddaughter's mouth to feed too best and god bless david Domestic violence Caligula Phaedo The O.C.
