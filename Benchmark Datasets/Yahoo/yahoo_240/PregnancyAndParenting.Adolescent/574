goodie bags or no goodie bag that is the question for year old girl's birthday party i've been looking online for pre made goodie bags but they all seem like they're either too remedial for year olds or they're way too expensive for a bag of plastic toys that will likely break or get thrown away maybe by this age goodie bags should no longer apply i'm not sure does anyone have any goodie bag ideas for this age group or perhaps any ideas on one gift item in lieu of an entire bag of crap there's no party theme we are going roller skating there will be about children mostly girls i would forget the goodie bags for year olds and instead take a lot of photographs candid as well as some posed you can then create a collage or scrapbook for your daughter and send the guests a picture or two of them with your daughter enclosed within the thank you cards it could be either plain photos or digitally enhanced with borders etc i think that would be more appreciated by this age range than a goodie bag Child pornography National Day Parade Driver's license Shoe Traditional animation John Cleese EastEnders Credit card Customs and etiquette of Japan The Prisoner Japanese tea ceremony Plastic Genericized trademark Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stereoscopy Lewis Carroll Copy protection Digital photography 7th Heaven Dice Photography Live 8 Bong Collage Loch Ness Monster Sgt.
