i have a few questions about references for a my job apilcation i am currently filling out my first job application and i have a few questions about the people i use can i use my fist cousin's mom who is married to my third cousin and does everyone have to be over eighteen most employers want references who are at least years old but over is better most employers also don't mind relatives so much as long as they don't live in the same household the problem with relatives is that they always say glowing wonderful things about their daughter cousin granddaughter niece and the employer wants an unbiased honest answer good sources for references are youth pastors or adults who are involved with your youth group at church people whom you've babysat for or house sat or something like that shows that even though you haven't had a traditional job before you can handle responsibility neighbors who know you pretty well employers don't want to hear how great you are from your best friend also you should always get permission from the people you use as references not all employers call every reference especially if your job is say a minimum wage job at a store in the mall but you don't want the employer calling up your reference and they have no idea that you put them down so ask them first or at the very least let them know you are using them Unemployment Family House of Bourbon Religious Society of Friends Joke Married... with Children Milton H.
