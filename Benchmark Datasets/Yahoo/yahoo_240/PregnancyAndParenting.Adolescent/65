is it possible that one of my boy cousins got a girl cousin pregnant i have like a million cousins and one just got pregnant at that year i had visited all of them and on of my boy cousins locked himself in a closet with the other cousin they were there for like a few minutes he also talks about sex all the time these cousins are the only ones that aren't christians in the entire family now a few more are turning atheist and getting pregnant because of his big mouth and retarded ideas like oral sex is the only way to keep your virginity ughh lol we aren't rednecks not even close you made me laugh of course it's possible but that baby will most likely have problems if its parents are cousins i would be careful to suggest that people who become atheist just start getting pregnant right away like their morals go down the tubes or something what people in your extended family want to believe in is their own thing not yours if you really think your cousin got your cousin pregnant you need to seriously think about what to do with this information tell the whole family maybe just discuss it with your parents basically it could have happened but it sounds like you don't know everything about the situation so i'd just let sleeping dogs lie Friends EastEnders Abortion debate Sex and the City Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Mary, the mother of Jesus George Costanza Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Something Positive About a Boy Oral sex Marriage Ron and Fez Child sexuality Code: Lyoko Hearing impairment My Family (television) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eric Cartman The Virgin Suicides Prenatal diagnosis Drawn Together Sexual intercourse Great Teacher Onizuka Atheism Family Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Vernon Schillinger The Young Ones (TV series) Sharon Tate Theodicy Care Bears Recurring South Park characters 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Boston Public Urinary incontinence Mojave people Infantilism Human sexual behavior Adoption Mario The nature of God in Western theology Trainspotting (novel) Teenage pregnancy AFI 100 Years series Mental retardation The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Avenue Q Shawn Michaels Madonna (entertainer) American Psycho The Inside Sex education The Catcher in the Rye The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Birth control Sexual orientation Milton H.
