can taurus be as passionate and lustful as scorpio yes but it's a very different passion from my experience taurus is more traditionally lustful likes things more solid and romantic whereas the lust of a scorpio is more out there and daring if you find a scorpio that's very into trying new things in the bedroom he's right on target but finding a bull who does the same is a little bit more difficult with taurus it's more about showing love and concern Astrological sign Love Scorpius General Hospital Enneagram Solar system in astrology Aphrodite Mithraism Zodiac British Rail Janus Taurus (manufacturer) Ruling planet Victor Hugo Zoophilia Homosexuality and Hinduism W.I.T.C.H.
