what zodiac sign that is more likely to cheat for men and women believe it or not it's not scorpio scorpios do like sex but only if they're in a relationship with someone they truly care for they're not in it for sex like people think and only cheat if there is some serious sexually problems in the relationship however some people would say pisces cheats because they can drift into another relationship without realizing it just because of their caring compassionate nature people who want complete devotion 'n whatnot would say pisces cheats often but i personally think it would be leo or virgo just because leo especially males even though people say is loyal will only remain that way if his or her partner is perfect like he or she likes to think of him or herself plus virgos especially females love sex even more than scorpio does if they get taught self confidence then a virgo can feel more comfortable with the opposite sex or same sex and in turn when older will love sex 'n sexual experiences bit completed to explain why but in all reality i would have to say sagittarius is the most likely to cheat for both genders 'cause they're flirtatious fun loving adventure loving 'n since they can be invalid in a lot of trivial they can get 'lonely' 'n in turn have night stands with people when they're away from their partner mainly because of their flirtatious attitude sagittarius people are not looking for long term relationships 'n will sometimes move on to the next relationship and or person without leaving or ending their current Astrological sign Gender role Transgender Human sexual behavior Virgo Scorpius Solar system in astrology Homosexuality and transgender Birthday Age of consent Homophobia Sex and the City Polyamory Sagittarius Bondage (BDSM) Sex Transsexuality House (astrology) Anal sex Bisexuality Same-sex marriage Western astrology Pisces Homosexuality and Christianity Infantilism Gender identity The Twelve Labours Saint Seiya Incest Sister Princess Heteronormativity Gay Sexual intercourse Medical astrology Ruling planet Homosexuality Maury Solar Element Saga Leo God and gender Group sex Gender Pedophilia BDSM Sexism Sex education Ex-gay Gay slang Queer as Folk (U.S.) EastEnders Androgen insensitivity syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Gender-neutral language Rape Zoophilia Sexually-transmitted infection Leo Wyatt Sexual addiction Social rule Lesbian Love A Course In Miracles Sexual dysfunction About a Boy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gender identity disorder Sadism and masochism Asexuality Interpersonal relationship Knots Landing Boston Public John Money Bi-curious Domination & submission (BDSM) Narcissism Homosexuality in Japan Heterosexuality Sexual attraction Cross-dressing Sexual abstinence Inhibited sexual desire Fruits Basket Feminism Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Domestic violence Nancy Witcher Astor Luke and Laura Spencer Incarnations of Immortality Sexual revolution Human sexuality Transvestism Novel Religion and sexuality History of intersex surgery Homosexuality and Hinduism Church of Christ, Scientist
