i'm a capricorn so how come i'm not attracted to cancers or scorpio's i love them as friend but nothing more i also feel this way about virgo's i am extremely attacted to the taurus though i'm a capricorn too and i'm not really attracted to scorpio or cancer either but do have great frienship with them i find taurus men attractive but haven't met any i would want to be with cause all the ones i've met are players for me my virgo man is the best match cause i am very attracted to him and i love his personality also one thing i wanted to say in defense of capricorn is that i am far from being materialistic most of my possesions have sentimental value also my man said i could get any engagement ring i want but i did not choose a diamond ring that costs thousands of dollars i chose a blue topaz only cost about cause it reminded me of my mans blue eyes capricorns like financial security not owning the most expensive whatever Birthday Astrological sign Taurus (constellation) Capricornus Solar system in astrology Zodiac Ruling planet W.I.T.C.H.
