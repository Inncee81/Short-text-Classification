my xbox is dead overseas i bought my xbox the first day it came out i have never had any problems what so ever day's ago i went on vacation it was fine the day i left the day i get back i turn it on to play and i get the ring of death red lights i guess the problem is that i bought it when i was back in the states but now i'm over here in this big 'ol sand box known as kuwait i cant just call th people at ms up and ask for help any ideas i would really love thank you the only suggestion i would have is to send it to a relative in the us if you have one then have them call up microsoft and get it repaired that sucks that they will not repair it because you are currently outside of the us but that is the only way i can think of to beat the system sorry best of luck Xbox Xbox 360 Conker's Bad Fur Day Computer and video games Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Oh My Goddess!
