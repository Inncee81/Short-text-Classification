xbox elite what the heck is hdmi what difference does it make is it really good or just same hdmi stands for high definition multimedia interface and its main advantage is combining your video and audio signal into one cord instead of the usual three i e the red yellow white or red green blue cords high definition signals are digital you xbox will output a digital signal and if you have component or composite cables it will be converted to an analog signal and then when your hdtv recieves it it will convert it back to digital all this converting can cause a drop in visual and or audio quality hdmi on the other hand transfers a digital signal so there's no converting back and forth between digital and audio and therefore no drop in quality and the ability to transfer a full p signal a sidenote hdmi does allow digital surround sound output but the xbox elite was made with a a hdmi port which doesn't support just if you have an hdtv that can do full p it'll make a noticeable difference if you have an p hdtv and a slightly trained eye it'll make some difference if you don't have an hdtv you can't use hdmi so don't bother unless you want the bigger hard drive DVD Xbox Laserdisc Television High-definition television High-Definition Multimedia Interface SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital Visual Interface Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Sound Blaster RGB color model Nintendo GameCube Compact disc Digital television Analog-to-digital converter Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo Revolution YUV Digital video recorder Audiophile Digital-to-analog converter High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Atari 8-bit family Electronic amplifier PlayStation Portable Sound recording Musical Instrument Digital Interface Synthesizer RCA connector Home cinema Dolby Digital 8 mm video format Enterprise content management Electronic filter Sound card Digital cinematography NTSC ITU-T MP3 Digital signal processing Oscilloscope ATI Technologies Video Sega Dreamcast ATSC Digital cable Digital video Digital cinema FireWire IPod Windows Vista Audio data compression Electrophysiology Original Amiga chipset Gramophone record Amstrad CPC Speech synthesis TiVo MPEG-2 Video codec Betacam VHS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Game controller Composite video Game programmer Decibel DVB Satellite television Modem Voice over IP Video game music 1080p S__CAM MOS Technology SID Transistor Vacuum tube Stereoscopy Gamut Warez Digital audio workstation MiniDisc Nintendo Entertainment System DV Digital recording SoundStorm Widescreen Trusted computing Bluetooth DVD recorder
