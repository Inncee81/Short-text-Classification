psp problem the internet on my psp runs really slow like ot takes mins to get from one page to the next so how do i get it to run faster and i dont want to have to buy anything really expensive i dont know if its possible to hook up a router to a dial up modem but im going to assume no so then what you can do change the channel of the routers broadcast you may be getting interference with other networks in your area to change the channel click the start menu on your computer hooked to the router in the search box type 'cmd' without the ' a black dos window will open with a c type in 'ipconfig all' without the ' and a space between fig and this will show you the ip address of your router of the time it will tell you the ip address is start the internet browser on the pc type that address in the addy bar this will take you to your routers set up page find 'channel' or something similar and then change it if this doesnt solve the problem turn off 'ping blocking' if your router has that option if that doesnt work change the settings in the psp more then likely you set up the network connection automatically you want to set it up manually go back to the dos window ipconfig all and enter all the info that is there on the psp primary dns default router subnet etc however the ipconfig will give you an ip address of of the time and of consumer based routers have an ip range from through so you need to assign the psp an ip address outside of that range so will be fine my connection looks like this ip address primary secondary dns subnet default router proxy server do not use if that doesnt work do you have problems with your pc being slow it may be possible that the router and isp connections arent set the same so the router is using a dynamic setting and the isp requires a static setting but this is going to be pretty unusual for todays isps Denial-of-service attack Domain Name System Network address translation IP address AppleTalk Internet Group Management Protocol Wi-Fi Federal Standard 1037C Stopping e-mail abuse Spyware Windows XP ITunes E-mail spam Modem Uniform Resource Locator Windows 2000 Broadband Internet access Web crawler Voice over IP AmigaOS Router Mozilla Firefox Internet service provider MAC address Email authentication PlayStation Portable Telegraphy Internet Relay Chat IPv6 Digital Subscriber Line MIPS architecture Proxy server Differentiated services Border Gateway Protocol Visual Basic Ethernet MDAC Novell NetWare Mozilla Application Suite Mouse (computing) Whois Netfilter/iptables Spam (electronic) Gmail IPv4 Microsoft Windows Embedded system Emacs Java programming language X Window System America Online Atari 8-bit family Opera (web browser) IBM PC compatible System 7 (Macintosh) Virtual memory World Wide Web Session Initiation Protocol Routing Windows Server 2003 Common Unix Printing System Internet privacy History of Microsoft Windows History of the Internet Streaming media Password Server Message Block Hello world program Lag Internet protocol suite HTTP cookie Asynchronous Transfer Mode PHP Open mail relay Open Shortest Path First DESQview Distributed computing Ping Zeroconf Universal Plug and Play Commodore 64 Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X Transmission Control Protocol Nintendo DS Wireless LAN PowerPC Mach kernel Internet security BitTorrent
