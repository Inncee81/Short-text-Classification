question for vegans esp females if consuming milk is wrong why are those glands on your chest design flaw most mammals have them second guessing the creator haha hahaha hahahaha are you seriously trying to make a point i hope not first i'd never say consuming milk is wrong human breast milk fed to a human baby is fine cows milk fed to a human adult isn't right most vegan mothers try to breast feed their children why because that is what the human milk is designed for baby humans just like cows milk is designed for baby cows not adult humans the reason i don't consume cows milk is because first it is not meant for us to drink it's not natural for us to be drinking the milk of another species it isn't even natural to drink breast milk past infancy human babies were meant to drink human milk who is second guessing the creator now second i don't agree with the way dairy cows are treated i'd rather have nothing to do with it i'm not going to cause another creature suffering just cause i want a glass of milk third i don't drink cows milk because i really can't stand it i can't even swallow it without gagging fourth i'd rather drink antifreeze than drink cows milk it'd probably be better for my body in the longrun anyways Milk Dairy Veganism Breastfeeding Vegetarianism Elephant Breast Kosher foods Breast milk Infant Cattle Soy milk Dairy cattle Kashrut Mammary gland Livestock Cytomegalovirus Whale Chocolate Taboo food and drink Dairy farming Animal rights Wraith (Stargate) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hathor Raw milk Cheese Joke Mastitis Teat Growth hormone treatment Platypus Conker's Bad Fur Day Dairy product Factory farming Dog Perchlorate Infant formula Ayyavazhi mythology Tooth Nipple Pasteurization Peter Singer Phoebe Buffay's songs Theory of conduct Acne Rickets Yoghurt Soybean Mosquito Gray Wolf Bovine somatotropin Breast pump Horus Horse Abortion debate Guinea pig Philosophical skepticism Chicken Blue Whale Orca Insulin Hypoglycemia Lactose intolerance Dieting Intersexuality Tofu Tocopherol Burping Orgasm Shark Brain Samudra manthan Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cat Vegetarianism and religion Omega-3 fatty acid RuneScape quests Human Friends Hera Brian Griffin Food Fecal incontinence Infantilism Goat Puberty Nestl__ Hematophagy Soft drink House Mouse Androgen insensitivity syndrome Russian joke Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nestl__ boycott Koala Baby bottle Discordianism
