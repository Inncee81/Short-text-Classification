how much protein do i need i have recently started a vegetarian diet and want to make sure i'm getting enough but not too much since i would like to loose weight as well about lbs no i am not becoming a vegetarian to loose weight the first answerer gave you false information you do not need that much protein here is what you need women to yrs g women to yrs g women to yrs g women yrs g pregnant women g breast feeding women to g being vegetarian does not mean your diet will be lacking in protein most plant foods contain protein and in fact it would be very difficult to design a vegetarian diet that is short on protein excess dietary protein may lead to health problems it it now thought that one of the benefits of a vegetarian diet is that it contains adequate but not excessive protein proteins are made up of smaller units called amino acids there are about different amino acids eight of which must be present in the diet these are the essential amino acids unlike animal proteins plant proteins may not contain all the essential amino acids in the necessary proportions however a varied vegetarian diet means a mixture of proteins are consumed the amino acids in one protein compensating for the deficiencies of another most foods contain at least some protein good sources of protein for vegetarians include nuts and seeds pulses soya products tofu soya milk and textured soya protein such as soya mince cereals wheat oats and rice free range eggs and some dairy products milk cheese and yoghurt different foods contain different proteins each with their own unique amino acid composition the proportions of essential amino acids in foods may differ from the proportions needed by the body to make proteins the proportion of each of the essential amino acids in foods containing protein determines the quality of that protein dietary proteins with all the essential amino acids in the proportions required by the body are said to be a high quality protein if the protein is low in one or more of the essential amino acids the protein is of a lower quality the amino acid that is in shortest supply is called the limiting amino acid protein quality is usually defined according to the amino acid pattern of egg protein which is regarded as the ideal as such it is not surprising that animal proteins such as meat milk and cheese tend to be of a higher protein quality than plant proteins this is why plant proteins are sometimes referred to as low quality proteins many plant proteins are low in one of the essential amino acids for instance grains tend to be short of lysine whilst pulses are short of methionine this does not mean that vegetarians or vegans go short on essential amino acids combining plant proteins such as a grain with a pulse leads to a high quality protein which is just as good and in some cases better than protein from animal foods soya is a high quality protein on its own which can be regarded as equal to meat protein the limiting amino acid tends to be different in different proteins this means when two different foods are combined the amino acids in one protein can compensate for the one lacking in the other this is known as protein complementing vegetarians and vegans eating a well balanced diet based on grains pulses seeds nuts and vegetables will be consuming a mixture of proteins that complement one another naturally without requiring any planning beans on toast cheese or peanut butter sandwich muesli with milk soya or cow's and rice with peas or beans are all common examples of protein complementing previously it has been thought that protein complementing needed to occur within a single meal however it is now known that this is not necessary as the body keeps a short term store of the essential amino acids a well balanced vegetarian or vegan will easily supply all the protein and essential amino acids needed by the body Nutrient Kosher foods Guinea pig Kashrut Agriculture Soy protein Amino acid Hamburger Meat analogue Tocopherol PDCAAS Breastfeeding Biochemistry Food preservation Bengali cuisine Egg (food) Dietary fiber Peanut butter Low-carbohydrate diet Zinc Growth hormone treatment Vitamin Peanut Protein-energy malnutrition Peruvian cuisine Vitamin C Yoghurt Vegetarianism and religion Environmental vegetarianism Rice Coronary heart disease Cuisine of Brazil Enzyme Food guide pyramid Sausage Taboo food and drink Cat Chili con carne Crohn's disease Iron Cuisine of Singapore Muesli Livestock Cancer Carnivorous plant Weight training Microeconomics Genetically modified food Ecology Porridge Anemia Common bean Vitasoy Food allergy Protein structure Pancake Protein sequencing Healthy eating Human skin color Niacin Hamster Coffee Prostate cancer Domestication German cuisine
