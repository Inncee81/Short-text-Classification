what made you a vegan instead of a vegetarian so i am hearing a lot of animal rights things i hear the same things about chickens and cows for that i want to become a vegan but we also have our own cow and chickens and they are all not even caged up and treated well like friends i want to eat their eggs and drink the milk but i want to be called a vegan still because i dunno it feels like people think they care about animals more should i call myself one or no shoudl i even care what people think should i just make a new name up i was vegetarian beforehand and then i asked one of my friends the same question you just asked us actually i asked him and debated his answers many times in the meantime i kept finding vegan versions of things milk butter yogurt ice cream etc that were just as good or sometimes better than the dairy it took me nearly a year of seeing how easily he lived his life listening to his responses and counter arguments though he was never pushy and building up a collection of vegan recipes for me to change my mind from thinking veganism was something extreme and difficult since i had seen dozens of 'examples' of vegans on tv movies etc but he was the first one i'd met in real life to thinking it was something i could easily do especially because i had made the change so gradually Veganism Animal rights Vegetarianism Vegetarian cuisine Dairy Meat analogue Factory farming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Livestock Cheese Egg (food) Tofu Cake Kashrut Chocolate Dairy product Joke Pizza Theory of conduct Ice cream Kosher foods Dieting Buddhist cuisine Raw food diet Cuisine of Brazil Chicken Person Yoghurt Food Milk Dairy cattle Hard-line Soybean Soy milk Butter Taboo food and drink About a Boy Oreo Peter Singer Soup Punk ideology Curry Vegetarian nutrition French cuisine Fecal incontinence Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Animal Liberation Front Porridge John Cage Japanese cuisine Tom Regan Bengali cuisine Straight edge Pitaten Vegetarianism and religion Microeconomics Environmental vegetarianism Extreme Programming McDonald's Socrates Cuisine of the Philippines Hindu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cattle Chili con carne Dairy farming Cuisine of Denmark Little Britain Phoebe Buffay's songs Billboard (advertising) Care Bears Boom Town (Doctor Who) Hiberno-English Omega-3 fatty acid Breastfeeding Milkshake Cha chaan teng Rice pudding Cuisine of Malaysia Drink Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Lisa the Vegetarian Breakfast The chicken or the egg Sacred cow Andy Kaufman Brahmanism Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show Margarine Cream (food) Leonardo da Vinci Shark Goodness and value theory Soft drink Domestication
