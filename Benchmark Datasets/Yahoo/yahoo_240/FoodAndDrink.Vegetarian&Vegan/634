question about vegan preferences i was listening to dr dean edell this afternoon and he was talking about a survey taken regarding vegans' sexual preferences according to the survey many vegans will not date or sleep with meat eaters as they consider it disgusting and distasteful to even kiss a non vegan some even refuse to associate with non vegans i find this an extreme point of view i was curious to know how vegans here feel about this and why i am sincerely interested in your opinions thanks everyone for your input i guess i can understand why a vegan would feel this way it's much easier to have a relationship with someone who shares your values i appreciate your honesty thanks connie for sending me to that article it sounds like the exact study that dr dean was talking about very enlightening first you might want to read the research greenghost did and received best answer for on that same article http answers yahoo com question index ylt ajua joyheqyjdvizz cyltty ix qid aaeltti show profile info bvrvyhtaa it goes into the bias and flaws of the article that being said as i vegan i can only say that for me to be with someone on a regular basis not just omni friends or relatives but specifically someone you want to have a relationship with i would not be able to since i believe eating meat is wrong how do i look at my partner everyday and act like it is fine to me what they do i would be thinking of all the animals they killed and it could never work i know it does work for some people so perhaps it is because i am older and more set in my ways Veganism Sexual orientation Child sexuality Animal rights Vegetarianism Plame affair Zoophilia Hard-line Homophobia Human sexual behavior Infantilism Parapsychology Raw food diet Theory of conduct Peter Singer Cultural relativism Judaism EastEnders Asperger syndrome Second language acquisition 613 mitzvot Psychology Socrates Ethics Franz Boas Theodicy Dieting Philosophy Age of the Earth Goodness and value theory Sigmund Freud A Course In Miracles Autism Domestic violence Animal Liberation Front English grammar Borderline personality disorder Bisexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Child sexual abuse Economics Philosophy of language Punk ideology Extreme Programming Human Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Polyamory Koan Hey Jude Internet troll Ecology One Tree Hill (TV series) Abstraction (computer science) Mojave people Scientific method Egg (food) Labor theory of value Avenue Q Whaling Social psychology Meaning of life Law of value Friends Biology and sexual orientation Kurt Cobain Prices of production Kashrut Social rule HTTP cookie Expert system Taoism Negima George Lakoff Carl Jung Database Divorce Statistical survey Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cult Buddhist cuisine Consensus decision-making GED Bernard Williams Cindy Sheehan Journalism ethics and standards Object-oriented programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Buddhism Creation-evolution controversy Mathematics People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Yusuf al-Qaradawi Zen The writing of Principia Mathematica The relationship between religion and science Food guide pyramid Transsexuality Deconstruction Ginny Weasley Normal distribution
