a different way of easing yourself into vegetarianism a lot of people who come here want to know how to slowly become vegetarian one of the more followed methods is to drop one type of animal at a time from your diet starting with cow then moving toward pigs etc and ending after sea animals anyway i was reading something the other day that said it may be even better to start with the chickens and fish and end with cow because each plate of fish a dead fish but it takes many plates of steak to equal the death of a cow any thoughts people just ask here frequently and i was wondering if this method made sense to people who want to go veg i forgot how huge tuna fish are but many fish are small chickens are certainly quite small and feed far fewer people with their deaths than a cow then take into account all the very small animals like shrimp one dinner the death of a whole lot of shrimp lol the lillyian method you crack me up hi lillyian thats am interesting way of looking at it i guess morally it would be right if you equate each life as eqaul for some reason many do not but your suggestion has the added benefit of cutting out the animals that are not so obvious first every one knows you are not veggie if you eat beef but some people get confused about fish so if they cut out beef pig sheep first they might not bother with the fish and therefore miss the full benefit so yes your ideas sounds great and it would be interesting to see if it works for some shall we call it the lillyian method and just refer to your question link in the future sounds like a plan to me personally i advocate a clean break becasue i feel a gradual move is a constant reminder to some people that they are giving something up whereas in reality it much more postive than that Vegetarianism Livestock Animal rights Hamburger Kashrut Japanese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Peter Singer Meat Cattle Cuisine of Malaysia Cantonese cuisine Barbecue MRE British cuisine Poker jargon Environmental vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Cajun cuisine Chicken Kosher foods People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Vegetarianism and religion Korean cuisine Bovine spongiform encephalopathy About a Boy Theory of conduct Lisa the Vegetarian Slaughterhouse Dim sum Whaling Animal Dairy Ramen God Emperor of Dune Garfield Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tlingit Cuisine of Denmark Evil German cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Chili con carne Beef Dieting Hiberno-English Prostate cancer Fishery CPU cache Shrimp farm Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Vietnam Burger Rei Ayanami Domesticated turkey Fish and chips Extreme Programming Roman eating and drinking Vegetarian cuisine Pig Password cracking Taiwanese cuisine Agriculture in Australia Objectivist philosophy Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Jewish cuisine Orca Soul food Sandwich Cat The Apprentice 2 RuneScape quests Dairy cattle Cheese Halaal Breastfeeding Agriculture RISC Have I Got News For You Factory farming Jackass: The Movie Tofu Hinduism Egg (food) Vegetarian nutrition Buddhism Guinea pig Scientific method Douglas Adams Sushi Hypnosis Henry Cow
