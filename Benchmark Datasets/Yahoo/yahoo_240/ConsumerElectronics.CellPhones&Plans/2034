cingular verizon or sprint which company is the best for way family plan cheap texting best signal most reliable fewest drop calls best overall p s dont say t moble i already have it and its sucks i've had verizon since before they were verizon back in the gte mobilenet days about years i don't have any complaints i have the family plan with lines i've never experienced dropped calls like with any plan some service works in some areas while others do not for instance i went to clear lake and my service was intermittant my friend who had at t at the time before they were cingular and then went back to at t big identity crisis going on there lol got service pretty good then we both went to mendocino and fort bragg and my service was great and her's was nonexistant it depends on cell towers back when it was gte mobilenet i was in by the water light houses in fort bragg and was the only one out of the entire photo shoot crew who had service models were paying me money to use my phone so they could call their agents it really depends on if there are towers in the area and who owns them etc now verizon has a texting plan of which gets you text messages in out and pix messages in out to anyone then they have a plan which gets you text messages in out and pix messages in out to anyone plus it is all unlimited to other verizon customers and they do have a plan for totally unlimited to anyone regardless of what service they have but i don't know the cost as i've had no need to have it verizon at t have simliar family plans with similiar amounts of peak minutes and similar costs the one thing that at t has that i really wish verizon had is the rollover minutes as that is a big plus if you utilize let's say out of your minutes they will roll your minutes over to the next month and it just keeps rolling and rolling but they do expire after year but the nice thing is if you have several minutes that have rolled over and then one month your teenager decides to yack on the phone for hours on end it takes from the rollover and hopefully you won't use up all the minutes verizon like at t has a year contract you can also purchase a year contract look on their site http www verizonwireless com and check out their phones as they list costs for any of their phones for no contract for a year contract and for a year contract the longer the contract the cheaper the phone they also have v cast which is a month and you can use the internet for unlimited amounts of time now my friend has cingular at t and i see the bill as i pay the bills he has the family plan with lines like i said standard plans are simliar but once you've changed let's say you up'd your plan and realize that you don't need that many minutes etc your stuck with verizon if you change your plan from the minute plan to the minute plan and you realize you don't really need that plan you can revert back as long as it's within the first days that you've changed i did this and there was no problems or hassles at t has similiar texting plans but they they also have a multi media plan which allows you to go on the internet v cast is definately better in my opinion my friend has experience quite a lot of difficulty with at t as he experiences quite a lot of dropped calls tower outages so he can't use his cell phone etc i've known several people who have experience at t and they've either switched or would like to switch but that's just what i've seen me i happen to like verizon wireless like i said i've had them since they were gte mobilenet it's been about years and that's a pretty long time to have service with someone if they are supposedly a bad cell phone company don't you think you should really check out their sites to see the various plans costs etc like i said verizon at t formerly cingular have very similar plans costs etc i can't tell you anything about sprint other than i have one friend who has them and he wasn't that thrilled with them unfortunately he didn't go into details so i can't help you there i can say don't use metro pcs as they do not have a lot over coverage but if they do in your area they might be good as they do have a month to month plan what i really like about verizon beside pretty good customer service and great cell service is that there are no roaming fees no charges for calling other verizon cell phones free long distance i call my friend who also has verizon in or and i'm in ca and i don't pay a dime they have unlimited nights weekends at t has similar plans as well the last few answers have said that verizon has too many hidden fees contracts sorry to say they are not hidden and at t also has various fees and also has contracts how else do you think these companies stay in business they all have fees contracts it really is a matter of personal choice and what works best for you in your area another neat thing about verizon is they have a back up assistant which enables you to back your phone book contacts to the verizon website at no cost and then have it keep updating from your phone to the website at a predetermined time as long as your phone is turned on it states that it cost a month but it also states that it doesn't cost anything as long as you log onto your verizon wireless account on their website which i do all the time so if you have a problem with your phone or get a new phone you can download from their website your phonebook and you don't have to enter them all by hand or go through the tedious thing of taking the phone to the store and having them hook it up to their machine you can do it yourself in a matter of seconds it works great at t does not have that as far as i can recall and of course they have the cool ringback tones love those good luck in your quest for the right
