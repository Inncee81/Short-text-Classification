my lg chocolate phone won't work i've only had it for a month i clicked on video to take a video then it videtaped for a second and freezed i can't turn it off or do anything at all its just frozen i've been taking care of this phone like it was a baby and the only reason i can think of would be that my cousins or my friends secretly looked at my phone and did something to it but didn't tell me which i highly doubt because alot of people seem to have this problem i've only had it for a month and my dad will kill me 'cause they're expensive but i didnt do anything bad to it i left it alone and now its working but i am so pissed off my dad didn't pay for a phone that only works when it wants to should i contact verizon and blah blah at those idiots and why should i not have a phone i would have no way of communicating with my father try taking out the battery and putting it back in that usually restarts it if that doesnt work take it back to verizon but call them before you go and tell them what happend they'll fix it for ya im thinking about getting the new chocolate phone too did you get the new one the one where the phone comes in blue mint try asking them if you can trade yours for the new one Verizon Wireless Iggy Pop Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Surveillance Little Britain Mobile phone Friends Verizon Communications Knots Landing Blood on the Tracks Poker jargon The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy BlackBerry About a Boy Forrest Gump Characters from Arrested Development Broadband Internet access Kyle Broflovski Bob and George Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Neighbours Procrastination Tag Digital photography Marilyn Monroe Federal Communications Commission Conker's Bad Fur Day EastEnders Tekken characters Beavis and Butt-head History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Pitaten Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Magical objects in Harry Potter Hey Arnold!
