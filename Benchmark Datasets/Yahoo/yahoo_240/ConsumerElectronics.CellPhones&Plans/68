my motorola razr v t charger isn't working can it be fixed when i plug it into the phone nothing happens why can anything be done about it if the charger is not working i would try a new one to see if it is in deed the charger or the phone its self motorola's phones are really bad about the charging ports going bad due to corrosion a few other things you could try first is to take the battery out and put it back in to reset it this fixes most small things because a cell phone will freeze up just like a computer you can also check to see if your charging port appears dirty or looks like it has corrosion on it corrosion is mint greenish in color sometimes this can be cleaned with a q tip and a small amount of alcohol just enough to clean the corrosion out but not to saturated hope this helps Motorola 68000 Modem Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Skype Dodge Charger Embedded system Nickel metal hydride Motorola Corrosion Cruising (maritime) M16 (rifle) IPod Game Boy Advance SP Atari ST Battery (electricity) Color Universal Serial Bus Lithium ion battery Nintendo Entertainment System MOS Technology Knife Danger Hiptop GSM services Toyota Prius San Diego Chargers Thermal power station Turbocharger Poker jargon New York Giants Fire extinguisher Technetium Atari 8-bit family E85 Motor oil Mobile computing Nickel-cadmium battery Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apple Newton Mobile phone Laptop Digital photography Lead-acid battery Telephone Battery electric vehicle Social rule Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ford Ranger EV Volt Opera (web browser) Handheld game console Symbian OS Filling station Disinfection Liquid crystal display Apple Macintosh Handspring National Football League Lore PlayStation Portable TRS-80 Color Computer Pet skunk Telephone exchange Mercury (element) The End of the World (Doctor Who) N-Gage Lithium ion polymer battery Wind turbine Drowning Roomba Jack plug Bong Bob and George Soldering Gasification Cleveland Browns Hybrid vehicle Lionel Corporation Mobile phone radiation and health Tag RISC Nintendo GameCube USS S-38 (SS-143) Commodore PET IPAQ The Sims 2 Lithium Oxyacetylene Telephone tapping Geomagnetic storm Atari 2600 Nintendo DS Betting (poker) Cathode ray tube Camera phone Radio controlled car Voice over IP Buffalo Bills Linux kernel Nintendo
