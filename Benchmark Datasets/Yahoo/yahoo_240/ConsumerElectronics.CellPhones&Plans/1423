go phones i was wondering if you put a cingular or at t simcard into a go phone whould it work i have heard two aspects one that they only work for like a month and stop working and then i have heard that if you activate the phone it will work properly can somebody plz tell me frm experience i would also like to add that i already have a service plan many ppl say that when customer service finds out then they cancel your account has anyone actually used a go phone more than a month i would assume that you want to put a sim card from your current probably damaged cingular now att phone into a go phone so that you don't have to spend mega bucks just to replace the phone yes this will work as long as the phone you are using the sim card in is locked to cingular you shouldn't have any problems with your basic phone text services keep in mind that many of the cheap pre paid phones may lack some of the features of your current phone and so those services may not be available when you use the new phone internet im etc and there won't be anything you can do about that Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Global System for Mobile Communications Verizon Wireless Vodafone The Sims Virgin Mobile BlackBerry Cingular Wireless T-Mobile Bluetooth Telephone numbering plan AT&T The Sims 2 Sprint Nextel Corporation Gmail Spam (electronic) GSM services Speech recognition Mobile phone MSN Messenger Emergency telephone number Customer relationship management Broadband Internet access Major League Baseball television contracts Electronic commerce Cognitive science The Amazing Race The Inside Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Social rule Wireless Application Protocol United Airlines Flight 93 Phone sex International Mobile Subscriber Identity Public transport N-Gage Tesco Telephone tapping Modem Network Switching Subsystem W-CDMA Voice over IP Password Wheel of Fortune $ale of the Century North American Numbering Plan Private branch exchange Surveillance Teletext Extreme Programming Wi-Fi Amateur radio Advanced Mobile Phone System Octopus card ITunes Music Store Q-Telecom Short message service Monopoly (game) George Galloway 9-1-1 XML Integrated Services Digital Network E-mail spam Game programming Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
