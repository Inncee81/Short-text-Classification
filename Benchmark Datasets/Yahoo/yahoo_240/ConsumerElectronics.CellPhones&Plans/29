are incoming messages charged on an unlimited messaging plan im asking this because i was reading on verizons site and it says that there is unlimited text pix and flix to anyone on any network does this mean that they charge you for incoming messages i have a family share plan and im tired of having dollar bills at the end of each month and since i txt alot i wanted to know if the unlimited really means unlimited or if they are just trying to get you to buy a new plan and charge you for things that they dont come out and say that you will be charged for any help on this would be wonderful its unlimited incoming and outgoing don't worry and by the way if one month you go over your minutes or txt you can always call verizon and change your plan to accomadate your currently used minutes then change back next month just a thought it takes care of those bills you get Verizon Wireless Short message service Virgin Mobile GSM services America Online Search engine optimization Request for Comments Public transport Brainfuck Internet slang Voice over IP Jon Secada Enron Corporation General Packet Radio Service E-mail spam BlackBerry Live 8 Apollo 8 The Amazing Race Trojan horse (computing) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Asterisk United Airlines Flight 93 Final Fantasy: Unlimited Short selling Vodafone Tennessee State Constitution Sprint Nextel Corporation Social rule Broadband Internet access Newsgroup Morse Code ITunes Music Store James T.
