samsung t how do i make my mp files into ringtones what i did was first use a program windows movie maker in my case to cut the portion of the mp that i wanted as my ringtone because normal songs are too long to be set as a ringtone i then saved the cut part and uploaded it to my memory card i saved it in the 'sounds' file to differentiate it from my music from there it's easy to set as your ringtone just make sure that the part of the mp you cut is about or less than secs long and that the bit rate is kbps or less those were my problems ITunes Musical Instrument Digital Interface Flash memory Ring tone Vorbis IBM PC compatible Screenshot CPU cache Computer virus MP3 Verizon Wireless BitTorrent Digital audio player Beatmania IIDX Prank flash PlayStation Portable Commodore 64 IPod Microsoft Windows Windows 3.x TRS-80 Spring operating system USB flash drive 64-bit AmigaOS CPU design Digital circuit Virgin Mobile 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Single (music) Speed of Sound (single) Virtual memory NX bit Modem EMule Teletext Atari 8-bit family Gravis Ultrasound File Transfer Protocol Crazy Frog File sharing Hard disk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Gmail Windows Vista Linux Windows 2000 Computer forensics Central processing unit Windows Server 2003 Dance Dance Revolution Floppy disk Rambus Web page Atari ST Perl Wireless Application Protocol Xbox Apple Computer PaX RISC Creative Nomad Apple II family Java programming language Advanced Technology Attachment Computer and video games ZX Spectrum Windows Me History of Microsoft Windows Macintosh Finder Billboard magazine Palm OS Debugging Uploading and downloading Linked list Macromedia Flash Mind transfer Pump It Up Spyware Sound Blaster Thread (computer science) IPod shuffle TeX Drill bit Forth programming language Notable phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ITunes Music Store System/36 Internet Dave Matthews Band Register window Analog-to-digital converter Girls Aloud Mach kernel We Belong Together Morse Code Btrieve Yamaha Corporation Bulletin board system Creative Zen
