lg chocolate phone problems help i have a lg chocolate cherry phone and off and on since i've gotten this phone it freezes then i turn it off then turn it back on it becomes a white screen it just doesn't turn back on i've taken the battery out a few times and it is still not working feedback is great the other person is correct in telling you to contact verizon if the phone is still under warranty or insured however my daughter experience problems with her lg cherry chocolate and it was only months old when you slide it up the phone would dial numbers on its own it would scroll through all the get it now functions over and over etc it was possessed i contacted verizon several times and all i got as they would replace the phone with a refurbished phone i kept telling them that that was b s at it was almost and i would be not accept a refurbished phone for a phone that was only months old but all they said was it was their policy i had insurance on it as well but it's kind of stupid to pay the deductible for a new phone that was malfunctioning and the insurance company does not guarantee that they will give you a new phone you could still get a refurb what i did was contact lg directly and they had me send the phone into them they offered to send me a loaner but i still had my daughter's old razr so we used that they sent the phone back all fixed or so i thought as i called them and they said they replaced the keypad that was defective however once i activated it through verizon i found out that lg did not fix it but they sent a brand new replacement phone and it as not a refurb it was brand spankin' new so my advise to you is to contact lg directly if your phone is still under the one year warranty period you can contact them at tell them what is wrong with your phone they will tell you to ship it to them and make sure you request a return signature on the shipment to them and they will provide you with an rma number return material authorization number also known as an ra return authorization number keep the phone number and rma ra number handy so you can call once they've received the package and had it for a day or two to find out what is wrong with it as they will not call you what they do is send you an email with a tracking number showing it shipped back to you and there is no paperwork inside the box so you won't know what was fixed etc unless you call them i hope my information and personal experience with verizon and lg is of help to you best of luck Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act BlackBerry GSM services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus IPod Voice over IP Life insurance Warranty UK telephone numbering plan Gmail Verizon Wireless Internet fraud Telephone booth Annuity Verizon Communications Surveillance Customer relationship management Insurance Mobile phone Social rule Plame affair Telephone tapping The Amazing Race Telephone exchange Bluetooth Telephone Directory assistance Modem Pretty Good Privacy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Emergency telephone number Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Whois Virgin Mobile Mouse (computing) Data retention Digital photography Toll-free telephone number United States Postal Service E-mail Embedded system E-mail spam Ashton-Tate Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Mattress Auto insurance Computer virus Cellular network FidoNet Vertical service code Ocean's Twelve Phone sex Vodafone Variable universal life insurance Good Times Appeal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Winning Streak Network Switching Subsystem Call centre Day of the Daleks Phreaking The Five Doctors Mortgage Citigroup Heinkel He 112 Warren Buffett Cornelia Rau Photography Global Positioning System Treo Caller ID Mail fraud Killian documents Nintendo Blue box Universal Serial Bus Short message service Apple Computer Time Out of Mind Dial M for Murder Windows XP Payphone Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Something Awful John Sheridan (Babylon 5) North American Numbering Plan United Airlines Flight 93 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Software testing
