brita health risks is it true that brita water purification can pose health hazards from these tiny carbon particles is it otherwise ok to use it thanks there's no health risk from the activated carbon unless you accidently inhale them any small particles when inhaled can cause inflammatory pneumonia the activated carbon is in the brita filter to soak up any organic solvents that might be in your water if you digest the carbon you release those organic solvents again but you're in no worse shape than if you drank that polluted water in the first place the biggest problem with the brita water purification system is that it's a water purification system it can remove stuff from the water you drink and make it less unpalatable however most municipal water is surface water water from reservoirs lakes and rivers it comes from the sky where air pollution makes it unhealthy and then runoff from parking lots and discharge from factory and residential sewers can taint it not to mention what fish do in water water that comes from springs and wells is mineral water the minerals make the water tastier and the water does a better job of quenching your thirst it's possible to add minerals to purified surface water to accomplish the same ends coke dasani and pepsi aquafina both try to do that however they add a limited number of minerals compared to the much longer list of minerals in most spring water and there is always the problem of manufacturing error coke has repeatedly had recalls of dasani water because it was unsafe to drink while brita isn't a health risk it still is a way of treating municipal surface water it doesn't give you the benefits of drinking spring well or mineral water in the first place Sewage treatment Water Water purification Carbon dioxide Pollution Eutrophication Water pollution Water resources Air pollution Environmental engineering Particulate Coal Bong Nuclear power Hydrogen sulfide Environmental concerns with electricity generation Carbon dioxide sink Coffee Bottled water Dry cleaning Asbestos Dairy Haloalkane Solvent Cocaine Acetic acid Iron Soft drink Lake Hamster Industrial wastewater treatment Ammonia Mesothelioma Drowning Nuclear fallout Desert Groundwater Grand Calumet River The Coca-Cola Company Energy development Essentuki Steel Mineral Sulfuric acid Fish farming Fountain Town gas Explosive material Sewer Gasoline Water (molecule) Helium Omega-3 fatty acid Motor oil Dioxin Sodium hypochlorite Nutrient Nuclear fission Beryllium Plutonium Motorcycle Waste management Hard water Health insurance Liquid breathing Alkane Rebreather Brewery Water supply Elis Prefecture Effects of global warming Fire extinguisher Wastewater Geyser Depleted uranium Fossil fuel power plant Pepsi-Cola Nuclear reactor Tobacco smoking Cholesterol Industrial process Medicine Knife Folic acid Storm water Ecology of Hong Kong Silicon Biodiesel Ultraviolet Alcohol Alternative biochemistry Natural gas
