hey i've been drinking water only for about month what else can i do to kick it up a notch it's like boring now not even the ice is exciting and i hate the lemon in it do you drink water with meals if not that would help if you do also try spicing up your meals with pepper garlic italian spices etc to make you drink more water per meal the other suggestions you got of kool aid crystal light etc are also good but don't drink a lot of tea since it's a diuretic adding a little fresh fruit juice is always a nice change of pace from the regular boring plain water but if you're dieting stay away from fruits that need sugar if you been told by your doctor to drink more water or if you're doing it because you realize how important it is to your overall health you may want to try my last resort i've been drinking water all my life i average gallons per day but sometimes even i can't stand the thought of another glass of water my remedy to this is eating salt i'll pour just a little in the palm of my hand lick a small amount and i'm ready for the water eating saltines with or without peanut butter is also very effective in the summertime especially when we sweat a lot we lose quite a bit of salt so replenishing it this way is so much better than adding it to foods of course if you are restricting your salt intake you may not want to try the last one too much if at all i hope i was able to help Breakfast Tea Cuisine of the Philippines Coffee Rum Wine Cuisine of Brazil Soft drink Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Peruvian cuisine Jewish cuisine Tofu Rice pudding Bread Chocolate Cuisine of Denmark Russian cuisine Milk Food Fasting Gatorade Chili con carne Cuisine of the Southern United States Alcoholic beverage French fries German cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of Africa Fecal incontinence Roman eating and drinking Yoghurt Tooth Cha chaan teng Nutrition Water Vegetarianism Tea (meal) Potassium Vitamin C Cantonese cuisine Healthy eating Dim sum French cuisine Hamster Folic acid Vinegar Lemon Japanese tea ceremony Garlic Cheese Curry Peanut butter Hiccup MRE Hypoglycemia Veganism Cuisine of Singapore Beer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kosher foods Cider Korean cuisine Citric acid Cuisine of Thailand Maple syrup Mosquito Cuisine of Argentina Chile pepper Idli Soup Little Britain Cake Soul food Dumpling Cuisine of Laos Meal Stomach cancer Pizza Hangover Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Drowning Hot sauce Binge eating disorder Pancake Omega-3 fatty acid Mango Lemonade Peanut Hong Kong-style milk tea Sauerkraut Diarrhea Serbian cuisine Sodium chloride
