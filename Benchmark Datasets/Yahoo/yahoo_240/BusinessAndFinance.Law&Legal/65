what if you accidentaly sign something that was supposed to be notarized can you still get it notarized i got a legal form and i was supposed to have it notarized but my lawyer mailed it to me and said just sign where i put the tabbies and send it back in the envelope well after i signed everywhere i started reading i figured if i saw something i didn't agree with i could refuse to send it back but this was our final revised version well i then noticed that it said that i had to have it signed in front of a notary the last ones didn't say this so i am worried ok so i signed it and then read it since it has to be mailed back kinda worried cause i already signed it but there is a notary who works next to me and i am hoping he will just let me sign the book and get away with it since you have to sign the notary's book that you did sign off in front of them don t worry Notary public Mail Palanca Awards Plame affair United States Postal Service Attorney at Law Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lawyer Karl Rove E-mail Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Extreme Championship Wrestling Weaving Knots Landing Surveillance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Wheel of Fortune The Contender (television series) Rent (musical) Polish September Campaign The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Paul Is Dead Appeal Dante Alighieri Mail art Le Malade imaginaire Newcastle United F.C.
