is my boss obligated to pay me the entire two weeks if he lets me go early after i had resigned week before i gave my current boss my two weeks notice resignation about two weeks ago he decided that on wednesday of the last week i was supposed to be there that he was going to let me go i am salary so not only did he not pay me for thursday and friday but on wednesday since i got let go at am he only paid me for four hours of the day does anybody know if any of these two situations were handled incorrectly or maybe even illegaly by my boss should i waste my time with hiring an attorney i feel i am owed money at least for the day since i was salary there is no obligation for a company to pay an employee through a notice period the notice period is a professional courtesy only most employers these days are at will which means that the employment relationship can ben ended by either the employerr or the emploeyr at any time for any reason with or without notice as a salaried exempt employee you are paid for full days that you work and are exempt from overtime your boss was correct to pay you only through wednesday however he failed to pay you for the entire day he is not obligated to pay you past your termination date so i disagree with the other poster who indicated that you must be paid the remainder of the week or pay period you cannot be salaried and also be paid by the hour it's all day or it's wrong if you hire an attorney they won't be able to get you very much except the loss that you sustained hours' pay and they will take of that most attorneys won't waste their time you could file a complaint with the dol www dol gov but those take a long time to get resolved or you could simply write a letter to your boss indicating that you know you were paid improperly for your last day of work because you are paid on a salary basis and asking for the additional four hours of pay what's the worst he can do say no good luck Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wal-Mart Salary cap Contract Fasting Working time Salary Tax National Football League Killian documents Video game developer Unemployment Great Depression Daylight saving time Hebrew calendar Saturday Night Live 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression George W.
