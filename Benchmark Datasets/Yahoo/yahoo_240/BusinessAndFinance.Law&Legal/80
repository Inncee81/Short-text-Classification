have you ever been fired and made it back in the same industry i wanna know if there is a chance for me i was fired from my last job sometime back for dishonesty lying on employment form abt a past job i was in that job for only months it was a stupid mistake i wanted to know things should i just omit this job from my resume and move on i have good experience prior to this as well and good references from there i am in the info tech industry i don't know how it works but if i do tell my next interviewer abt this have there been instances where employers actually condone such mistakes please answer both the questions and share your views have you ever been fired and re accepted in the same industry how did you handle it your opinions will be greatly appreciated if you are very technology smart i would say you can get hired employers are willing to overlook mistakes if you indicate that you were wrong don't make the same mistake and lie again you already know where that gets you however you don't need to put a month job on a resume unless it is your only experience in the area do include it on any application form you need to fill out when asked indicate the issue and that you didn't feel that it was experience worthy of admission on your resume' the purpose of the resume is to let people know what experience knowledge you have the interview is for you to discuss things with them an employer will not likely condone the mistake but they will understand that you made a mistake and wish to correct it accepting responsibility is a sign of growth keep in mind that if you do lie and you do get found out then you could have lost two jobs for the same thing you just lost a job for Social rule Plame affair The Apprentice 2 A Course In Miracles Condon Committee Scientology beliefs and practices Time Out of Mind Epistemology Socrates One Tree Hill (TV series) Philosophy of language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Intelligent design Software engineering Graduate school Scientific method Shit Unemployment Milton H.
