i was convicted of a misdemeanor of battery in florida can an employer not hire me because of that i live in illinois and cannot find a job because of a domestic violence charge in florida over years ago i know i have to state that on my application but i've applied for over jobs and have not even had a bite if i don't put this down and they do a background check then i'm going to look like a liar what can i do the answer to this question is unfortunately yes an employer can make the existence of a prior misdemeanor conviction a grounds for refusing you an offer of employment unless your state has a statute that prohibits such refusal on such grounds furthermore knowingly falsifying any information on an employment application is always grounds for termination when such falsehood is discovered what you have to do is find an employer who does not ask this question or who does not care that you were convicted of domestic violence you may also seek executive clemency from the governor of florida and have your conviction expunged but you have to deserve that clemency and each state governor has his own rules about to whom to grant such clemency pardon amnesty etc and why to grant it Pardon Plame affair Capital punishment in the United States Appeal Article Two of the United States Constitution Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Same-sex marriage in the United States Alberto Gonzales Judicial review Lawrence v.
