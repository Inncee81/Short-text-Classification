lawyers especially i'm thinking of entering the law field as a career i'm going to be a junior in high school this year so it's time to seriously consider colleges and careers i would really like to be a lawyer it seems so exciting and i'm really interested in law but there's some things that worry me a lot about that my friend's dad is a lawyer and he has to work serious overtime and go on tons of business trips and i would want time for my family in the future i also kind of a tv vision of the job in my head and i know that's not completely accurate so my question is what's the job really like if you are a lawyer do you like your job what do you like and dislike about it what do you do on an average day thanks in advance i am a lawyer and have my own employment law firm in the suburbs of chicago www lawyer employees com i wanted to be a lawyer since th grade but because of family finances i did not go to law school until i already had a career i love my job my business and especially my profession because i own the firm i make my own hours yes there have been hour weeks but there have been hour weeks also that is one good thing about being a lawyer you can find a firm or go to a corporation that has limited ot once you get that license and experience you can find that perfect fit as a lawyer who represents employees i do what is commonly called transactional work that means a short time with the client i appear at hearings in administrative agencies like the eeoc obtaining unemployment benefits and before federal courts representing government employees each day is different which is something that i enjoy sometimes it is like what you see on tv with all the rushing around and going in front of strict judges but most time it is not as a lawyer you are on the job even in social events your profession makes a difference you get asked legal questions by friends and family and are expected to come up with a quick answer negatives are that the salary is no where near what you see on tv latest aba research says average salary for lawyers is if that sounds like alot it isn't that is what my law school charges per year the other negaitve is that your profession is always being made fun of and ridiculed because the profession like all professions has a few bad apples in it it becomes very frustrating when you know that your practice is ethical to have your profession run down especially by family i agree with the other poster about finding a job in a law firm to test the waters remember there are places other that law firms that employ lawyers most coporations have lawyers in their human resources department to keep hiring and firing legal corporations may have general counsels in house counsels compliance counsels for companies that must comply with certain laws like insurance companies do and senior or executive managment who are attorneys but do not practice law many business consider a law degree as a great asset look at www abanet org that is the american bar assoc website they have a section for those thinking about becoming a lawyer if you are blessed with the calling to become a lawyer then go for it if at all possible go into law school right after college good luck Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Juris Doctor Attorney at Law Barrister Law firm Law school Microeconomics Corporate governance Harriet Miers Karl Rove Graduate school Wal-Mart Education in the United States Unemployment Michael D.
