when to start a family after law school i'm thinking about going to law school after i graduate i will gradutate from college in may i'll be barely then would go directly to law school graduate from there when i'm around i'm conflicted about when i would start a family if i did this i plan on getting married after college and would likely not start a family until after law school i know that the first few years after law school are tough however i'm not planning on being a big time lawyer or even a trial lawyer i'm interested in the behind the scenes research area would likely work at a business or small firm near where i live so even though it would still be tough it won't be quite as cut throat as what i've been hearing major firms in nyc are like lol do you think it is possible to have a family a few years after law school my question is mainly for lawyers or people with direct experience not second hand info about someone who did something and it was hard there are many people who have families while their in law school and soon thereafter some people are professionals who decide to go back and get their degree but already have a husband and kids others are like you and want to get married young so yes of course you could have a family i don't see you having a family after law school any different than you having a family as an accountant at a major firm or as any businessperson trying to make it it will require lots of work and if your spouse works too it will require a nanny or daycare but it can work you just have to make sure not to neglect your child ren because they are living extensions of yourself and while your job can be replaced they can't good luck Lawyer Law firm Juris Doctor Law school Divorce Attorney at Law Paralegal EastEnders No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus John Edwards Law & Order Hillary Rodham Clinton Architect Bernard Williams W.
