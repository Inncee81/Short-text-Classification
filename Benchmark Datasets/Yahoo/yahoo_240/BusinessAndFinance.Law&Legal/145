what do i do if a company in another state cheats me out of my wages i answered an employment ad for a company that provides workers to companies that have labor unions that are on strike scabs i live in arizona the scab company is in massachusetts the job site is in painted post n y they hired me over the phone for per hr and flew me to a hotel in ny when i got there i had to do some paperwork one of the papers was a vaguely written agreement that if the job should end for any reason prior to the end of my day committment that i would be liable for the airfare to ny as well as the bus trip ticket home they said that was to recoup transportation costs in case i quit or got fired for cause i agreed to it days into the job the supervisor at the jobsite told my boss at the scab company that he did not like my work for an unspecified reason and that i was not to return to the jobsite my scab company supervisor told me that i was terminated and i was given a bus ticket home several days later i recieved my final paycheck in the mail for they had taken all my money and used it to cover transportation costs i did not break any rules and was not even told why they let me go they just did not like me i feel that contract would not be enforceable under those conditions and i dont know who i should file a complaint to someone please help thanx in advance for your thorough answers i would contact the labor board in mass to see if this was legal these conditions should have been disclosed before they spent all that money flying you in i hope you learned your lesson that working as a scab is not smart the company knew it would probably settle the contract before the time was up and they got a bunch of labor really cheap Trade union Wal-Mart Airline Public transport Transport Workers Union of America Microeconomics Eight hour day Octopus card International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Arbitration Graduate school Public domain Capitalism Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Minimum wage Northwest Airlines Outsourcing Termination of employment Railway Labor Act Free trade Karl Rove Surplus value Taft-Hartley Act Insurance Tom DeLay Unemployment Industrial Workers of the World Offshoring Construction Exploitation The Amazing Race Employment Vivian Solon Anarchism and capitalism Space Shuttle program Harry Bridges Elections in the United States Article One of the United States Constitution Apprenticeship Call centre Labor-power Teamsters Smallpox Immigration to the United States 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike Social Security (United States) FairTax History of the United States (1865-1918) Spam (electronic) United States labor law Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Workers' compensation New Deal 2004-05 NHL lockout Wage slavery Rosa Parks Principal-agent problem Health insurance Jeopardy!
