law students and lawyers what did you major in im applying to a pre law program but i dont know what to major in what is a common major for lawyers im interested in business and marketing no disrespect to your pre law program but law schools look for people with a variety of majors and not necessarily those that attend a pre law program look at www abanet org that is the american bar assoc website it has an entire section for those interested in becoming attorneys and does discuss pre law curriculum i have dual undergrad degrees one in computer science and on in business admin in my law school graduating class the top three people had degrees in english history and business law schools must teach certain courses in order to prepare their students for the bar so there is little use for an undergrad major until you are licensed because lawyers are required in all aspects of life there is no one major which will make a person a better lawyer i knew someone who majored in music she is now an attorney for the local symphony and their music schools several of my law school class went on to represent sports teams and members actually i represented a pro wrestler for a couple of years the bottom line is that you should major in what you are interested in as for your interest in business and marketing go for it law is a business and if you open your own firm like i did you will need to have solid business and marketing skills go to the aba website good luck Lawyer Juris Doctor Law school Paralegal Attorney at Law Master of Laws Education in the United States Master's degree Medical school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Hong Kong Software engineering Education in Australia York University Georgetown University Graduate school American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Education in Portugal University of Central Florida __cole Polytechnique Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Michigan Homeschooling Northeastern University, Boston Education in Taiwan Law firm University of Pennsylvania Law School Barrister University of Notre Dame Bar association Education in France Babson College Regent University Florida State University University of Maryland Baltimore County University of San Francisco Education American University Seneca College Associate's degree Stevens Institute of Technology Columbia University Community college Professor University of Chicago College Duke University Education in the People's Republic of China Patent attorney University of Connecticut University of Coimbra Grove City College Education in Germany University of Pennsylvania Physician Christian Brothers University Pennsylvania State University Attorney General Far Eastern University Education in Japan Trademark MIT Sloan School of Management University of Alabama Georgia Institute of Technology Johns Hopkins University Harriet Miers Clements High School Nurse Advanced Placement Program University of Houston High school Florida International University College of Law Massachusetts Institute of Technology United States Naval Academy Otterbein College Cornell University Franklin W.
