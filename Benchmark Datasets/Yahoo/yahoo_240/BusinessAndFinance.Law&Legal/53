does it really matter if i get my paralegal certificate from an aba approved school or is it all the same if i get it online i know a person doesn't have to have a certificate but i know it helps therefore i am wondering if it is worth the extra bucks and commute time to go through an aba approved paralegal program or if getting the certificate is just as good if it was done online at some random school i work for one of the biggest law firms in the detroit area and i can tell you unequivocally that a certification from an aba approved program carries much more weight than a certification from a non aba approved program btw online degrees are at the bottom of the list they're literally not worth the paper they're printed on aba accreditation means the program has been reviewed by a panel of lawyers and the program has met with their approval as to the skill set a paralegal specialist requires in order to be a useful part of a law office so if an applicant comes in and has an aba approved paralegal program on their education record they know there is a basic set of skills this person already has that will not have to be taught or re taught and that saves the firm time and money by contrast a person who comes in with any other type of paralegal certification may have those basic skills but then again he she may not law firms don't like to take chances on people like that so the person from the aba approved program wins every time Paralegal Juris Doctor Lawyer Certification Education in Portugal No Child Left Behind Act City and Guilds of London Institute Law firm College admissions Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nurse Education in Australia A-level Software engineering Graduate school Librarian Education in Malaysia Barrister Information Technology Infrastructure Library School counselor San Antonio Spurs UCAS Boy Scouts of America Education in Hong Kong GED Homeschooling Harriet Miers Law School Admissions Test Type certificate Apprenticeship Copyright law of the United Kingdom Education in the People's Republic of China Notary public Motion picture rating system Architect Law of the People's Republic of China Linked list Church of Christ Education in the United States Attorney at Law Physician James Hahn John Edwards Appeal OpenDocument Kaplan Wheel of Fortune Poker jargon AmigaOS Economic inequality Teacher Education University of Houston Ethical challenges to autism treatment Constitution of Ireland Winning Streak Associate's degree Community college Literacy Pilot certification in the United States IB Diploma Programme High school Grade (education) Japanese tea ceremony Accountancy Censorship in Australia Profession Tai Chi Chuan Tripartite System Sheepshead Trusted computing Supreme Court of the United States School accreditation ISO 9000 Organic certification Money Patent H-1B visa Athletic trainer Classified information Hacker Indiana Pacers Bailiff Legal aspects of transsexualism Trademark Bumiputra Identity theft Public domain Pinball Dublin City University University of Hawaii at Manoa Caldwell College Legal system of Hong Kong New Hampshire Supreme Court Act of Parliament Coalition Provisional Authority
