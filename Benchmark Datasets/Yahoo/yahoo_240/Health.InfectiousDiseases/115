is this herpes how did he get it please i never had any symptoms of herpes cold sores in my life my boyfriend and i kissed he is also my first kiss when he kissed he seemed like he had nothing on his lips or that showed any cold sore days later he got blisters on his lower lip he went to the doctor and told him he has a virus infection is it possibile that my boyfriend could have had a small blister on him and we both didn't recognize it so while kissing it must have spread we also kissed in the mean time he had it did i give it to him if i never had sex or kissed no one else but him and how is it possibile that i got nothing on me still please i need some serious answers cold sores oral herpes is most often caught as a baby or child from other children relatives kissing you by adulthood of the population have it but most people have no symptoms in fact of those with oral herpes have no symptoms if you have nothing on you and you kissed so close to him having an outrbeak on his lip a couple of days before if he had already had the virus then he would probably have been infectious at that point and since you didn't catch it off him and show no symptoms it is entirely possible that you gave it to him two days is around the minimum incubation period for the virus before he would get symptoms if you passed it on to him if you kissed while he had it and showed no symptoms yourself that means you kissed him when he was at his most infectious and didn't catch it which would indicate to me that you already had it yourself or you would have caught it when he was that infectious if you already have it even without symptoms you cannot catch it again it sounds most likely that you gave it to him by leaving high school of the population have oral herpes most catch it from other children or relatives kissing them when they are babies or small children and have no symptoms as adults so you don't have to have had sex or kissed anyone but him to have it my boyfriend actually remembers catching it as a year old by his auntie giving him a quick kiss on the lips a couple of days before but he is unusual to remember if it was your boyfriends first outbreak ever after you kissed him he might have had quite a few blisters or he might have experienced tingling on his lips in the weeks following or several outbreaks of blisters over a few months when the very first blisters appeared he might have felt like he had the flu or very tired and a bit unwell and had swollen and painful lymph nodes in his neck if he had these symptoms it is even more likely he had just caught the virus from you Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Group A streptococcal infection Herpes zoster Chronic fatigue syndrome Sexually-transmitted infection Influenza Ebola Mouth ulcer Oral sex Pharyngitis Spanish flu Cytomegalovirus Transmission (medicine) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Common cold Pneumonia AIDS Virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Smallpox Poliomyelitis Chickenpox Bubonic plague Prostate cancer Measles Chancroid Breastfeeding Cancer Marburg virus Psoriasis Hepatitis C HIV test Foodborne illness H5N1 HIV Avian influenza Leukemia Rabies Breast cancer Lyme disease First aid Echovirus Diarrhea Tuberculosis Vitamin C Multiple sclerosis Colorectal cancer Hepatitis Gonorrhoea Hodgkin's lymphoma Monkeypox Jam (TV series) Radiation therapy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cephalic disorder Traumatic brain injury Neighbours Migraine Lymphatic system Black Death Kawasaki disease Infectious disease Coeliac disease Domestic rabbit Rotavirus Cancer of the larynx Pregnancy Malaria Equine conformation Cellulitis Child sexuality Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Gastroenteritis Body piercing Dengue fever Pandemic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Roseola Oral cancer 1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia Medicine Epilepsy
