removing a co signer from a property loan ok so my dad asked his friend to co sign for a duplex house and now he wont sign off of the loan we offered to pay him off first then he doesnt want to sign his name is not on the deed actually he signed a paper signing out of the dead however his name appears on the loan so if we wanted to sale or refinance like we are trying to do we wont be able to without his signature he says that if we stop paying the mortgage he doesnt care if it ruin his credit he wants the bank to repo the houses but he has never lived there so the ones that are being hurt are us see we have lived in that house for yrs and owned it for anywhere that we turn to seems that no one wants to help everyone says there is nothing we can do but we dont loose hope there has to be something we can do what can we do in this case is there a way to do something without him hes never paid a dime towards the houses all he did was sign please help you are incorrect and so is your cosigner you can refinance this loan without his agreement if you are qualified to do so without a cosigner if he has no ownership interest in the house his legal status is merely that of a guarantor to your father's loan your father does not need the guarantor's signature or permission to refinance this loan without this guy Mortgage Donald Trump Student loan Atomic Kitten Bank fraud Islamic banking Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debt consolidation Bank Mortgage-backed security Savings and loan association Schabir Shaik Trial Notary public Money Primerica Financial Services Plame affair Citigroup Refinancing Concurrent estate Repurchase agreement Real estate bubble Government National Mortgage Association Debt Life insurance SCO-Linux controversies Allodial title Copyright Cyprus dispute Predatory lending Babylonian law Intellectual property Title insurance Corporation Unconscionability Economy of Russia Temasek Holdings Marshall Plan Gold standard Monetary policy Bretton Woods system ACORN Estoppel Israeli settlement Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bond Taxation in the United States Deed Interest Edith Nourse Rogers Short selling Easement Bank of England Education in the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Deflation (economics) Monopoly (game) Benjamin Franklin Capitalism Divorce Urban renewal Credit card Insurance Contract Capital accumulation United Overseas Bank Great Depression Microcredit Credit union Knots Landing Economy of India Mobile home International Criminal Court Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Digital signature Economy of the United States Leasing FairTax Federal Reserve LiveJournal Small business Trust (Law) USA Public domain Mensal__o scandal Privatization Stamp duty History of the United States (1918-1945) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs German spelling reform of 1996 Autograph Stock Kyoto Protocol Consumer finance Real estate developer HSBC Probate Housing cooperative Payday loan Fred Phelps
