bad credit home loans my wife and i want to get out of our apartment in febuary but we did a debt relief program that we are still in and will be in in feb we both have terrible credit now under is it possible to get a home loan we are going to hope fully buy in the k range any advice would help with the current state of the market it will be almost impossible to predict what will be available to you in february i will however give you some advice and a little inside info the amount of money you can stash away for a down payment should be your top priority in your case you will need one the more you put away the better your chances of getting a loan your lender will require that you have some down payment usually down and you will probably need a little help there are lenders out there that will lend up to to of the purchase price of a home at a very high interest rate if you are lucky you might even get up to but that depends if those lenders are still around in february you will also have to ask the seller to carry a note for the amount you can't cover with the loan and the down payment we'll take the worst case scenario other than being flat out turned down you get a loan for of the purchase price that would be about in your case you have down hopefully which is you would ask the seller to do a seller carried second mortgage this means that the seller would be willing to take payments on the remaining balance at a certain interest rate over a certain term in the form of a second mortgage usually or years best case probably is you get financing that would mean that your seller would only have to do a seller carried second mortgage everything else stays the same so every month you would have mortgage payments one to the institutional lender on your first mortgage and the second to the seller on your second mortgage impossible you would be surprised it happens all the time and most of the nation is looking at a tremendous buyers market so sellers are willing to get very creative you could also do whats called a lease to own they are usually heavily in the sellers favor but can be used to puchase a home there is also what are called wrap around mortgages that allow you to pay an actual mortgage payment every month without having to get a institutional loan in many states they actually allow you to be on title when the transaction is complete many counties cities and non profit organizations have what are called down payment assistance programs they will loan you funds to purchase a home and in some cases the loans do not have to be repaid if those are not viable then there is always acorn housing i attached the link be sure to check with your attorney or a good mortgage broker in your area since laws very from state to state hope this helps Student loan Short selling Security (finance) Government National Mortgage Association Financial markets Debt Deflation (economics) Gold standard Stock Monetary policy Money Credit card Federal National Mortgage Association Title insurance FairTax Bretton Woods system Economy of the United States Savings and loan association Citigroup Derivative (finance) Government debt Mutual fund Great Depression Real estate bubble Annuity Money supply Economy of Russia Life insurance Mortgage-backed security Economy of Pakistan Credit derivative Tax Capitalism History of the United States (1918-1945) Supply and demand Microeconomics Usury Leasing Annual percentage rate Internet fraud Primerica Financial Services Microcredit Central bank Unconscionability Arbitrage Islamic economics Hyperinflation ACORN Intellectual property Subsidy Housing cooperative 401(k) Stock market Financial services Municipal bond Gross domestic product Marshall Plan Price discrimination Call option Donald Trump Rational pricing Collateralized mortgage obligation Conveyancing United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Free trade Bank fraud Interest rate Mergers and acquisitions History of post-Soviet Russia Surplus value Real estate Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Economic relations of Japan Collateralized debt obligation Inflation Personal finance Wells Fargo Credit score Social Security (United States) Payday loan Babylonian law Temasek Holdings Privatization
