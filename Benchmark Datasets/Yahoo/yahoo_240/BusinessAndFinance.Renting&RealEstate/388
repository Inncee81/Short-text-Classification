my mom says that flipping is over is this true i have answered this so many times i am just going to copy and paste my answer member since december total points level points earned this week best answer frankie b s best answer chosen by asker for some reason people seem to think you cant flip in a slow or down market i completely disagree it is all about purchase price fix up cost and resale price it doesnt matter if the market is increasing or not the way you make money on a flip is not with the market increasing but with the value you add to it yes the days of buying a dirty home and slapping some paint and maybe a little cleaning with bleach and make k is gone if you want to be a true flipper you can still make great money see you buy a house that needs flooring kitchen baths roof heat etc then when you fix these items you are adding the value not the market when your finished you sell for a profit yes the sale time can take longer but it will sell if you are paying heafty carrying costs this will cut into your profits so becareful treat this like any other business and watch your numbers always be conservative on the resale price never let an agent tell an unrealistic resale value just to get the sale now always do your homework i will give you an example of my last deal in this down market where flipping is impossible lol purchase price remodel cost roughly carrying cost none i paid cash if you can great sale time months sale price profit k i do this several times a year who ever says it cant be done has no clue what they are doing its all about buying low low low never be afraid to insult the seller with your offer you may get some bad reactions and even piss off the realtor but in the end when one says ok to your offer you will have a good deal on your hands remember always stay in budget Microeconomics Supply and demand Deflation (economics) Price discrimination FairTax Monetary policy Sears Holdings Corporation Economics Illegal drug trade Arbitrage Airline Poker jargon Wal-Mart Economy of Russia Mortgage Day trading MMORPG $ale of the Century Real estate broker Tax Surplus value Insurance Privatization Mergers and acquisitions Islamic banking Bulk vending Ford Motor Company Capitalism Short selling Commodity Internet fraud Futures contract Citigroup Inflation Health insurance Bond Gross domestic product Technical analysis First-sale doctrine Textbook Keynesian economics Ra (board game) Tariff Auction Labor theory of value Social Security debate (United States) Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Commodore International The Apprentice 2 Inventory ITunes Music Store Investment bank Contract Final Fantasy XI Gold standard Hyperinflation Enron Corporation Loss leader Best Buy Credit card Tesco Rational pricing Law of value Monopoly Capital accumulation Ashton-Tate Value added tax Video game crash of 1983 Public good Retailer Amway Wheel of Fortune Neopets Euro Intellectual property Air New Zealand Derivative (finance) AMD Bretton Woods system Electronic commerce Prices of production Dairy Betting (poker) Call option Babylonian law Externality Gambling Free trade United Kingdom corporation tax The Amazing Race Lionel Corporation
