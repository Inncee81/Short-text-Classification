can i legally claim the parking space as my own the space is right outside our house i think that it is owned by the council noone else can really park there as they would block the door to the house so only the occupants of this house have ever used it i've heard that you can claim land if it is used over a period of time is this true i have lived here for years but previous owners have also solely used the space one of them also put slabs down on the space i live in wales thankyou its like a wide pavement outside the house but people dont walk on it as it looks like it belongs to the house i dont think so you might be able to ask the council to turn it into a 'badge holders only' area either that or put cut kerb stones people tend to not park in fron of these Squatting Easement Mobile home Urban sprawl Rathfarnham Prime Minister of the United Kingdom House of Lords Wiltshire Street Property (ownership right) Curb extension Suburbs of Johannesburg Sidewalk Judicial functions of the House of Lords Palestinian territories Shropshire National parks of England and Wales Dodge Charger Pavement (material) Fountain Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lake District Woodlands, Singapore Adverse possession Beverly Hills, California Council house British House of Commons O'Connell Street Scottish clan Bike lane debate The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Pavement (band) Capital punishment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Grand Forks, North Dakota Hereditary peer Amusement park Supreme court Turner, Australian Capital Territory London Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Dartmoor Moorgate LiveJournal United Kingdom corporation tax Glossary of American football Five Dock, New South Wales Archery Sento British monarchy Allodial title Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Sydney Atomic Kitten Ultima Online Monopoly (game) Appeal Toowoomba, Queensland Wilton House Robert Walpole Lechaina Style (manner of address) Dundas Square Politics of Hong Kong Aberdeen Park Northern Territory National park Neil Kinnock Elections in the United Kingdom Mountaineering Constitution of Ireland Traffic Door Housing cooperative Iraq War Israeli settlement Dennis Kucinich Time Out of Mind Wrexham Order of the Bath Atlanta metropolitan area Unreformed House of Commons Prince of Wales Traditional counties of England Seismic retrofit Montgomery Burns Stone Age Capitalism Summer Hill, New South Wales Cyprus dispute Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Crime prevention through environmental design The Shining (film) Extraterrestrial life Country house Air-raid shelter Head of state Coin collecting
