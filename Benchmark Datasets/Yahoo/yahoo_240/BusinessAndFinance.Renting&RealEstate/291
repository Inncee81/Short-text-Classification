va loans can we get one is it worth it to try ok so my husband is currently in iraq he is due home in october neither of us are sure of what our credit is like he has a couple things from a gym he never went to and i think a cell phone in the past i have a home phone debt in my history we are looking to buy our first home before or after he comes home which ever is best for our situation we would like to buy a house in the range of k k annually we're at about k a year right now neither of us really have a steady work history i have one for the city for almost years he has the army that's about it we're both young and not sure of our eligibility for anything we would like to find out how a va loan works how much interest will be on our budget for a house what's the max we can get on a loan can we get approved with our credit history do we need to take care of this now or after he comes home do the loans include the down payment we are looking for one in nixa missouri if that helps anyone the first think that you need to do is contact all credit repositories and look at your credit for both of you and see what you are dealing with you have plenty of time to get things straightened out before he comes home however on k per year to k will leave you very house poor you'll have precious little money leftover for maintenance and i can't imagine being able to put money away into savings no one can really tell you if you can be approved or not without looking at your credit history and knowing your exact score and seeing not only negative items but positive items on your credit va loans are at so you don't have to worry about anything but the closing costs and you might even be able to negotiate with the seller to pay those you don't need a va eligibility certificate until the time comes that you actually buy the house it would be so outdated by the time you buy the house they'll need another one the loan processor for your va loan will be able to pull your eligibility certificate from the va online portal or these are easily retrieved from the local va office in to days it's not anything you need to worry about now Credit card Mortgage Student loan Money Personal finance Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Surveillance Bond Interest Economy of the United States Derivative (finance) Internet fraud Money supply Security (finance) FairTax Debt Islamic banking Unemployment benefit Health insurance Gold standard Marshall Plan Predatory lending Food Stamp Program Social Credit Bank Monetary policy Primerica Financial Services History of the United States (1918-1945) Annuity Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Insurance Poker jargon Estoppel Microcredit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Government debt Gold as an investment Monopoly (game) Economy of Russia Asian financial crisis Mergers and acquisitions Donald Trump Capitalism Freeters Life insurance Economy of Pakistan 401(k) Social rule Real estate broker Education in the United States Credit score Savings and loan association Enron Corporation Taxation in the United States Japan-United States relations Babylonian law Gross domestic product Identity theft Finance Hyperinflation Social Security (United States) Billboard Hot 100 Usury Bretton Woods system Laura Ingalls Wilder Capital accumulation Stock Great Depression George W.
