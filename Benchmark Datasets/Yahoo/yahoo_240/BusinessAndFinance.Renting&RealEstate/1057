do apartment complexes have to hire licensed contractors to repair ac units recently our apartment's ac unit went dead the complex sent out a repair man who said the unit needed a new compresseor he installed it and it broke again now the repair man and complex said we broke it on purpose so they put in a new compressor and locked the ac then the ac broke again long story short the repair man is installing the th compressor tomorrow saying we broke all the others our apartment complex says they're billing us for the compressors each i asked the repair man for his license and he freaked out and the apartment complex says it's none of our business to know his license so clearly he doesn't have one i know the repair man can get in trouble but can the apartment complex get in trouble too unfortunately an apartment can use any one they want to fix their property including doing it themselves the fact that they are trying to blame you for a compressor failure is ridiculous but you might end up in court over this so hire your own licensed contractor to examine the unit and give you his opinion as to whats happening if you end up in court over it his opinion is going weigh much more with the judge than a simple handymans word if your man can pinpoint the fault that is causing the problem it could save you the and you can then damand that the apartment owner reimburse your fees for the licensed contractor either way you are covered it sound like the way to go to me better than being stuck with the big bill good luck Heinkel He 100 Jet engine Public domain Intellectual property Extreme Programming Teen Girl Squad Software engineering Space Shuttle program Maison Ikkoku GNU General Public License OpenDocument Trademark Patent 613 mitzvot Insurance Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Keynesian economics Humphrey Bogart Canon (fiction) 2000 Australian Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Pebble bed reactor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Roswell UFO incident Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bob and George Pinball Blenheim Palace Year 2000 problem Oh My Goddess!
