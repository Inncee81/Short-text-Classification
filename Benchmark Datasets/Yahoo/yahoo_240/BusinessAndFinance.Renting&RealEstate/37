what is the most lucrativde stategy you have ever used in buying and selling homes or property i'd like to flip some homes or buy one an add some square feet then sell it but i'm interested in what you've done that was very successful i think there are so many people trying to flip houses that the chance for profit has become next to nothing if you are going to succeed your mantra has to be the whole profit is made on the buying end if you can find some seller that is desperate and will sell you their house at an extremely low price then it will allow you to fix it up and sell at a profit if you buy at market rate you will never have a profit unless the market is rising quickly so that inflation of prices artificially makes you a profit i make a lot of money from real estate i buy and hold and rent for a positive cash flow it is not as exciting but it works much better Microeconomics Mortgage Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Inflation Arbitrage Surplus value Hyperinflation Rational pricing Gross domestic product Commodity PE ratio Real estate bubble Monopoly (game) Derivative (finance) Capital accumulation Mutual fund Supply and demand Gold standard Dot-com Call option Islamic banking Labor theory of value Insurance Anarchism and capitalism Bond Technical analysis Financial markets Warren Buffett FairTax Day trading Money Euro Exchange rate Keynesian economics Money supply Dividend Real estate broker Sears Holdings Corporation Capitalism Gold as an investment Profit Price discrimination Bretton Woods system Enron Corporation Real estate economics Tax Option Economy of Russia Finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Stock Illegal drug trade Say's law Conglomerate (company) Debt Privatization Mattress Margin (finance) Tesco Taxation in the United States Estoppel Stock market Property tax Jack Tramiel Asian financial crisis Ford Motor Company Central bank Housing cooperative Free trade Mortgage-backed security Internet fraud Law of value Foreign exchange market Monopoly The South Sea Company Predatory lending Leasing Universal Studios Arbitrage pricing theory Economics Babylonian law Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Poker jargon Corporate finance Donald Trump Bank Final Fantasy XI Insider trading Bulk vending Criticisms of socialism Real estate developer Betting (poker)
