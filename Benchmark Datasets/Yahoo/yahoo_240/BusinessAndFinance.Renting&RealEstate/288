quick short sale question we submitted an offer to the selling agent on a short sale property last week at full price my question is should the current owner sign the purchase contract accepting our offer prior to submitting it to their lender we have not yet received any word from the current owner regarding our offer and the selling agent said that she would be submitting it to the lender i thought that the current owner of the property would still need to acknowledge and accept our offer prior to it being submitted to the lender for final approval thanks in advance for everyones help no the seller has no say it's the lender that approves the contract that is the purpose of the short sale any offer to where what is being collected from the sale of the home that doesn't fully pay off all mortgages incurred by the seller is a short sale if by chance your offer was high enough then the seller can call the bank cancel the short sale which he is more than welcome to do and they will be happy to do so and then the seller is in control of accepting or rejecting the contract these shouldn't take anymore than a week or so to approve don't believe people on here that will say it takes weeks or a month walk away from those deals b c that means something is up that means that the bank is just waiting for more offers and as soon as it gets a higher one they'll decline yours however it appears that the lender has to approve this one if you offered full price then you will most likely get it approved Mortgage Short selling Real estate broker Insurance Contract Title insurance Bond Supply and demand Predatory lending Islamic banking Microeconomics Government National Mortgage Association Monetary policy Temasek Holdings Financial markets Life insurance Unconscionability Bank Citigroup Monopoly (game) Economics Debt Conveyancing FairTax Internet fraud Oakland Athletics Futures contract Security (finance) Auction Divorce Foreclosure Leasing Derivative (finance) American individualist anarchism Annuity Rational pricing Tax Intellectual property Usury Option Spice Girls Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Commodity Mutual fund Donald Trump Finance SCO-Linux controversies Surplus value Warranty Screenplay Trademark Gold standard Student loan Illegal drug trade $ale of the Century Final Fantasy XI Tennessee State Constitution Inflation Estoppel Pharmaceutical company Billboard Hot 100 American Broadcasting Company Price discrimination Enron Corporation Interest Privatization MMORPG First-sale doctrine Kyoto Protocol Anarchism and capitalism Capitalism Salary cap Philosophy of business Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Air New Zealand United Overseas Bank Irish Property Bubble Oil-for-Food Programme Great Depression Growth hormone treatment Live 8 Babylonian law Tesco Arbitrage 1994 baseball strike Cyprus dispute Deflation (economics) Short (finance) State Inventory Real estate bubble Hyperinflation Repurchase agreement Federal National Mortgage Association
