average price of a modular home in texas a modular home in texas cost about more than the same style in a manufactured home all the upgrade features you will choose will cost the same in a modular as in a manufactured home manufactured homes even built to wind zone standards still contain x 's in the interior structure modulars do not please consider upgrading to x walls when i was pricing different features for a manufactured home they wouldn't tell me if a plywood floor was better or worse than an osb floor the same with the exterior siding your choices are hardiboard cement or osb siding however when i started pricing modulars which are built to the same code as a site built using the irc automatically they cannot use an osb floor but only plywood also hardiboard siding was encouraged because at that point they said it would hold up better in the long run manufactured homes are built to the hud code which is not as strict as the irc so they can use different materials to accomplish the same thing like an osb floor but an osb floor would not meet the durability requirements of the irc code it is worth the money to get a modular if you can like i said it will be more than the same type model and features as a manufactured home i looked at different providers for a home just under sq feet i think you are looking at with decent upgrades in a modular however you will have to factor in the cost of a permanent foundation something required with a modular that can run an extra to as well keep in mind most financial institutions consider a modular home the same as a site built so you will qualify for conventional home loan mortgages manufactured homes do not most financial institutions also consider a modular home to qualify for home equity loans manufactured homes do not go modular if you can in all my research i found a chart that rated the modular home providers in quality oak creek homes was followed by palm harbor followed by patriot hope this is helpful i wish i had this type of guidance when i first started researching whatever you do the home centers like to keep the cost of the home separate from installation costs like a permanent foundation so even if you find a plan in a modular that you like do not sign a purchase agreement until you get an estimate in writing not verbal about the actual installation costs of a permanent foundation with utilities hooked up they will have to come do a site evaluation to do this if they refuse to come out and do a site evaluation without money down don't put down more than and have it in writing on the purchase agreement that the is fully refundable in full if the final price of improvements is more than what you want to spend the key is more than what you want to spend not what they will qualify you for if you go with their in house financing of course they will qualify you for improvements you want to stay in control of the final amount spent i won't wish you good luck i wish you good decisions don't leave your destiny up to luck i'm glad you are doing some research and making informed decisions Mobile home Mortgage Poker jargon FairTax Islamic banking Gross domestic product Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics IBM PC compatible Seismic retrofit Inflation Mattress Insurance Windows 2000 Publicly funded medicine Economy of Russia Free trade Life insurance Hyperinflation Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Real estate economics Microeconomics M16 (rifle) Nuclear power phase-out Galactic Civilizations Modem Windows Vista Capitalism No Child Left Behind Act Solar cell Bond Elevator Solar power Nuclear power Deflation (economics) Information Services Procurement Library Synthesizer Wal-Mart Baseball Stars De Lorean DMC-12 Straw-bale construction Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Nigeria Mac OS X Timber framing Credit card Unemployment Internet Relay Chat Hybrid vehicle Electrical wiring Labour economics High fidelity Ra (board game) Kyoto Protocol Floppy disk Airline Economy of India Construction Berkshire Hathaway Contract Strategic management Scientology beliefs and practices Open-source software Keynesian economics Wayne Corporation Corporate finance Tax Atari 8-bit family Intellectual property Capital accumulation Ford Mustang History of the United States (1918-1945) ATI Technologies PHP Wind turbine Hard disk Common Agricultural Policy Education in Germany Bank Extreme Programming Trust (Law) USA Gold standard Value added tax Hydrogen economy Pump It Up Plywood Public policy Housing cooperative 401(k) Federal National Mortgage Association RX-78 mobile suit series Space Shuttle program Monopoly (game) Washington Monument
