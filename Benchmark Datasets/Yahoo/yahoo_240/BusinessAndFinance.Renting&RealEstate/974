we want to leave how can i deal with my current landlord we signed a contract months ago and gave for deposit on a rent to own house we loved the house and the landlord said the neighbors were nice and had never had any problems with them before i realize that in the contract we signed the deposit is non refundable neighbors have stolen things from us someone spray painted the mailbox and the other neighbors are nosy they call the county for anything every month we get a warning from the county or animal control this is not the areas we want to raise our kids in and we want out we are in the process of buying a house for cash but we have to redo the interior before we can move in no cabinets bathrooms flooring etc it'll take a couple of weeks before we can move in and we don't want to pay the rent here we are no longer under a lease month to month right now and she wants to file an eviction notice rent was due sunday how can i stay here just long enough to fix my other house we have until this friday to pay her the rent money then monday she'll file the notice of eviction i know it would be cheaper to just rent a huge storage and pay a hotel for a couple of weeks we're just trying not to spend that extra money i forgot to put that a real estate agent friend of ours told us that that contract was not a fair contract and we probably won't get our money back because we signed the contract but we could get her in trouble with her georgia realtor's license my husband also just informed me that our landlord told him that we have to pay the whole month's rent and be out by the th first step of non payment of rent is that you must receive a written day notice to pay or quit have you gotten that yet if not she hasn't done anything yet this is usually issued at midnight on the night after rent was due so your ent was due this notice would be on your door at midnight next after the day notice is for her to go to the courthouse and start eviction proceedings this can take anywhere from days to months to get you out depending on what happens in court so you have plenty of time but here is another glitch when you leave even if she never files eviction you know she will take you to court for damages back rent etc etc and now that you own a home which is public knowledge she can place a lien on your property not good just a few things to think about good luck Leasehold estate Eviction Mortgage Leasing Rent (musical) Estoppel Babylonian law Rental agreement Insurance 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Microeconomics Knots Landing Big Brother (Australian TV series) Ocean's Twelve Oakland Athletics Money Taxation in the United States Big Brother UK series 6 Squatting Renting Bond Schabir Shaik Trial Real estate broker The Inside Annuity EastEnders CPU cache Property tax Public housing Gross domestic product Islamic banking Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Year 2000 problem Enron Corporation Anarchism and capitalism Dial M for Murder Rosa Parks United States Postal Service ABC No Rio Satchel Paige Concurrent estate Property (ownership right) Daylight saving time Trapped in the Closet Katelyn Faber Midnight Run Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Avenue Q Contract Secretar__a de Inteligencia Copyright Harlem Capital accumulation Otakon Poker jargon Saturday Night Live New York Jets SCO-Linux controversies Unreformed House of Commons Tax National Football League Collyer brothers Credit card Social rule The Life and Times of Juniper Lee World Championship Wrestling Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Tom DeLay Humphrey Bogart Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Charles Peace Major League Baseball television contracts Intellectual property GunZ The Duel Mutual fund Assignment (law) London Congestion Charge Meat Loaf Great Depression Security (finance) Public good Mensal__o scandal Housing cooperative Neighbours National Kidney Foundation Singapore Mary Jane Kelly Francis Bacon (painter) Patent Spice Girls
