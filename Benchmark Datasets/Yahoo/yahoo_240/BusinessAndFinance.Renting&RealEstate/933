landlord trying to keep most of my security deposit what can i do i didn't take any pictures regretfully most of the deductions were already existing in the home or normal wear and tear how am i supposed to prove this is hiring a lawyer going to cost me more than the refund if it is indeed normal wear tear as you say then the landlord may have trouble proving that first thing you need to do is do some research on tenant landlord law in your state most states have some specific timelines and requirements but it is up to you to find out know what those are to stand up for yourself speaking just for il rules the landlord is supposed to provide you within days what is being deducted and what for and must return any remaining portion within days you have the right to see copies of the actual bills for materials labor if it was a nornal wear tear item such as carpet then the landlord may need to show what it was you had done that you should be charged for replacing it as others have said in the end this is probably going to be an expensive lesson for you bottomline is no one is going to look out for and protect your rights as well as you can as one who has been a renter in the past and who is a landlord now i can tell you just as many renter horror stories as landlord horror stories bottomline is this a lease is a contract the time to protect yourself from harm is before you sign it i use a move in move out checklist which my tenant fills out at move in and notes pre existing conditions they sign it and it is part of the lease file i can also tell you that in the cases where i have not returned security deposit rarely does the forfeited security deposit cover the cost of bringing the unit back to rentable condition in conclusion many landlords don't follow the rules on days to notify and days to return so that is your most likely avenue of success after that unless you are willing to do the research represent yourself pay the upfront costs filing fees service fees etc and or you feel confident you have a winnable case you may wnat to chalk this up to an expensive lesson i suggest you read this article before you sign your next lease http realestate msn com rentals article aspx cp documentid Rental agreement Leasing Leasehold estate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States Public domain Plame affair United Kingdom corporation tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Renting Insurance Eviction FairTax Babylonian law Lawyer Intellectual property Waste (law) Tax Mortgage Contract Serfdom United States Postal Service First-sale doctrine Appeal Blockbuster Video Public housing Welding Housing cooperative Monopoly (game) Wal-Mart Credit card Copyright Islamic banking Mutual fund Concurrent estate Copyright law of the United Kingdom New Deal Boston and Lowell Railroad Social Security (United States) Apartment Legal research Spontaneous human combustion Fair use New York Jets Life insurance Roswell UFO incident Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) American individualist anarchism Mach kernel Solar cell Medical malpractice Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Student loan Karl Rove Tort reform British House of Commons Tennessee State Constitution Transformation problem President of Germany Treaty Spyware Romer v.
