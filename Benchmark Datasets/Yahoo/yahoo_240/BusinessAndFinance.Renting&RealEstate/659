question about apartment hunting i live in nyc and am trying to move in to manhattan but the rent in the best parts of the city such as upper west side soho etc are outrageously expensive so i was told that all apartment buildings are required to rent a certain percentage of their units for lower income tenants is this true and if so how can i find these apartments i doubt that they would freely list those apartments on their websites but i think you'll find some if you call their rental offices Apartment New York City Manhattan Housing cooperative Harlem Stuyvesant Town Public housing Avenue Q Leasing Leasehold estate Apartment building North York, Ontario Rent control Chinatown, Manhattan The Bronx The Dakota New York Central Railroad Upper West Side Renting Baxter Building Brooklyn Jersey City, New Jersey Property tax Williamsburg, Brooklyn ABC No Rio Eviction Chatsworth House Rental agreement Accounting methods Kitchen Rent (musical) Value added Lower Manhattan Intermediate consumption Gentrification The Inside Hoboken, New Jersey Section 8 (housing) Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Richard Morris Hunt Taxation in the United States General aviation West Side Highway Queensbridge Soho Estoppel Art Modell D (New York City Subway service) Alphabet City World's Fair Barrister Online DVD rental Chelsea, Manhattan World Trade Center Friends Melbourne Docklands Appeal Alcoholics Anonymous Concurrent estate Mark Guglielmo Battery Park City New York metropolitan area Operating surplus Squatting Anarchism and capitalism Insurance Citigroup Center New York City Police Department Campbell, California Unfaithful (film) Mass transit in New York City Chandler and Joey's apartment American individualist anarchism Real estate economics Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Herv__ Gaymard Economic rent The Annex Queen Street West Burlington House Progressive tax Palace of Westminster The Apprentice 2 Kibbutz Donald Trump Robert Moses Piccadilly Circus Irish Land Act 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Grand Central Terminal Quentin Crisp Manhattan Bridge Hartford, Connecticut Poverty line Freedom Tower New York Wal-Mart New York City Subway Q (New York City Subway service)
