buying a house after a short sale we had to do a short sale a months ago due to a new job overseas we owed more on our house than it was worth and could not afford to make up the difference fortunately we were never late on our payments and our lender approved our short sale to avoid potential late payments etc we will be overseas for three years and once we return to the usa we will be settling down and want to purchase a home again my question is is it difficult to purchase a home after having to do a short sale will lenders be worried about that we will have money to put down on a house and have no plans to move after that we already sold the house in april and our credit is fine we were told before that this would be reported to the irs as income i e the forgiven part of the mortgage we are already in germany i just want to know when the time comes in years to purchase another home will the short sale in any way hinder us from getting a loan from a lender our fico score is great right now if your short sale was based on having pmi then your debt was forgiven though you will have to claim the forgiven amount as income forgiven debt should not affect your credit it is a done deal check with a quality lending institution not some fly by night company i believe that you should be fine Mortgage Bond Bank Debt Predatory lending Student loan FairTax Monetary policy Finance Credit score Great Depression Insurance Credit card Deflation (economics) Temasek Holdings Government National Mortgage Association Citigroup Government debt Federal National Mortgage Association Interest Short selling Personal finance Islamic banking Security (finance) Taxation in the United States Donald Trump Credit history Inflation Financial markets Mutual fund Delta Air Lines History of the United States (1918-1945) Bretton Woods system Corporation Money supply Primerica Financial Services Mergers and acquisitions Life insurance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Derivative (finance) Debt consolidation Money Annuity Annual percentage rate 401(k) Estoppel Real estate broker Developing countries' debt Hyperinflation Oil-for-Food Programme Islamic economics Gold standard Internet fraud Economy of Russia Enron Corporation Municipal bond Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Tax Privatization U.S. public debt Savings and loan association United Overseas Bank Futures contract Capital accumulation Mensal__o scandal Variable universal life insurance Subsidy Schabir Shaik Trial Arbitrage Wells Fargo Gross domestic product Microeconomics Wal-Mart Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Economy of the United States Foreclosure Child support Tesco Real estate bubble Babylonian law Title insurance Financial services Consumer finance Japan-United States relations Bank fraud EastEnders Real estate developer Article One of the United States Constitution Flat tax Irish Life and Permanent SCO-Linux controversies Social Credit Ford Motor Company Cheque Publishing Tennessee State Constitution Timeline of the Enron scandal
