moving in a roommate who is not on the lease my boyfriend is in need of a place to stay and i've offered up my place but would i get in trouble with my apartment since he's not on the lease or could i add him as just an occupant without having to have my cosigner sign it my cosigner is my dad and i'd prefer him not to know most landlords would require the basic screening to be done on anyone that would live in their building he should be able to be added to the lease as an occupant only but not a lease holding resident this means that the occupant would not be financially responsible for any of the rent amount if you add anyone as an occupant there is no reason the cosigner would be informed of this the cosigner is only contacted if you default on payments so your dad would not find out hope this helps Leasehold estate Student loan Housing cooperative Leasing NorthBridge Apartment Complex Chatham Square Vista Way Apartment Rental agreement Life insurance The Commons Mortgage Eviction Donald Trump Prostitution in Germany Estoppel 401(k) Rent (musical) Annuity Avenue Q Anarchism and capitalism Credit card Domain Name System Gross domestic product Insurance Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Legal system of Hong Kong United Kingdom corporation tax Airline Free trade Squatting Income trust Islamic banking Money Contract Octopus card Hani Hanjour Gender-neutral language Child support Terri Schiavo Gentrification Oplan Bojinka 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social Security (United States) Accounting methods Bratislava Castle Nawaf al-Hazmi Babylonian law Public housing Friends Social rule Hong Kong Family name Economic inequality Ponzi scheme Education in Japan Derivative (finance) Rest area Renting Boston and Lowell Railroad Mary Jane Kelly GunBound Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Father American individualist anarchism Public transport Lend-Lease Irish Land Act American Dad!
