i live in upstate ny where the house prices have been falling for the last yr do u think they will continue to fall my question is should i buy now or wait more yr and save more money i don't want to wait if the prices are expected to go back up again i would wait and save more money considering that lenders will not want to finance your home on an exotic loan i e sub prime because that's basically why the housing market is collapsing you may well need a larger down payment than you would have needed last year realistically home prices won't be going up in any significant amount in the next year the reasons why the real estate market is in trouble will still be around those reasons are the sub prime lending market collapsing with a record high foreclosure rate and the war in iraq hurting the us economy i would plan on saving more money and be on the prowl for a good deal in some places home prices are ridiculously low because of economic problems in the region if you are employed in some way that's immune to what happens to be effecting everyone else then you could find yourself a lot more house than you may be able to get right now Mortgage Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Inflation Monetary policy Insurance Great Depression Bond Gross domestic product Gold standard Money Economy of Russia Bank Microeconomics Debt Money supply Tariff Economy of the United States Say's law Hyperinflation FairTax Predatory lending Asian financial crisis Interest Free trade Capital accumulation Finance Bretton Woods system Health insurance Euro Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Capitalism Arthur Laffer Surplus value Economy of Haiti Microcredit International Monetary Fund Life insurance Government National Mortgage Association Privatization Interest rate Economy of India History of the United States (1918-1945) Publicly funded medicine Mergers and acquisitions Supply and demand Economy of Africa Economy of Pakistan Tax Reaganomics Financial markets Central bank Economy of Romania Real estate bubble Islamic banking History of post-Soviet Russia Minimum wage Productive and unproductive labour Real estate broker Enron Corporation Government debt Federal Reserve Labor theory of value Law of value Annuity Marshall Plan 401(k) Derivative (finance) Supply-side economics Real estate Political economy Donald Trump Social Security debate (United States) Student loan Anarchism and capitalism U.S. public debt Personal finance Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Balassa-Samuelson effect Real estate economics ACORN Federal National Mortgage Association Usury Business cycle Progressive tax Monetarism Argentine Currency Board Annual percentage rate Islamic economics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Temasek Holdings Technocratic movement Economy of Nigeria Economy of El Salvador
