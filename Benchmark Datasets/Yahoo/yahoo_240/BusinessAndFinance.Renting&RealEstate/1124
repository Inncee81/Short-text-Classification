legal question water damage rental apartment month ago i noticed that the hot water faucet tub of the shower of my rented apartment is leaking a little i didn't pay attention to it for months then i tried to fasten the faucet tighter but the leaking gradually got worse about days ago i called my landlord and said ' the hot water faucet of the shower is leaking steam is spreading throughout the apartment and it might do damage ' he said he will do something but after that i hadn't heard anything for days steam penetrates the whole apartment and is doing damage to the washroom the apartment and my belongings so i called him yesterday again he agreed to come by thinking he could fix it himself with his tools when he came he got a shock turns out he tought it was the faucet of the sink not the shower tub he accuses me of not telling how bad it was and that i should have notified him months ago when the leaking began and i am to blame because i used the word 'faucet' instead of 'tub' who is right you both are for the reasons you've mentioned he should have asked you to be more detailed concerning what the problem was and came to look at it sooner and you should have tried to convey the urgency of the problem and reported it when you first became aware of it why did you tell him it was dripping for months anyway Plame affair Sauna Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tap (valve) Plame affair timeline Washroom Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Leasehold estate Plumbing fixture Avenue Q Lodge Committee Chernobyl accident U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 USS Liberty incident Futurama (TV series - season 5) Downing Street memo Karl Rove Airport (film) Joseph C.
