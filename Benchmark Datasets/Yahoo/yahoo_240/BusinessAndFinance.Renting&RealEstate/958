do i have to give a down payment my husband and i are looking to buy a house we're currently living in an apartment complex paying a month we don't want to stay here too long because we could be using those towards paying our own home we've found a house in dallas and my mother in law said that when they bought their home they didn't have to give a down payment since they were first time buyers she said they only had to pay the closing cost which was about we don't have any money to give towards a down payment but we want to get out of the apartment as soon as possible is this true can we buy a house without a down payment if we're first time buyers considering today's market yes you need a down payment the mortgage industry is heading downhill due to financing interest only financing and soft home sales i understand that you want to move out of the apartment but it is best to wait a bit and save up for a down payment you can do this by reducing other extra expenses such as eating out going to the movies shopping etc by having a down payment you are more likely to qualify for financing also you are protecting yourself from the market if you get financing and the appraised value of your home decreases then you will owe more money than what the house is worth this is a situation the bank wants to avoid thus requiring a down payment if you don't think you can save for a down payment then you should not be buying a house yet the problem with the mortgage crisis is that people who could not really afford the house they bought due to be financially stretched thin are now in foreclosure Insurance Great Depression Life insurance Real estate broker Personal finance FairTax Bond Money Health insurance Microeconomics Islamic banking Debt Predatory lending Mutual fund Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Real estate bubble Primerica Financial Services Government National Mortgage Association Credit card Tax Annuity History of the United States (1918-1945) Futures contract Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Financial markets Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Government debt Student loan Capitalism Housing cooperative Publicly funded medicine U.S. public debt Security (finance) Internet fraud Price discrimination Capital accumulation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Federal National Mortgage Association 401(k) Freeters Wal-Mart Economy of the United States Divorce Privatization Campaign finance reform Inflation Economy of India Savings and loan association Monetary policy Delta Air Lines Finance United Kingdom corporation tax Arbitrage Interest Unemployment Gold standard Surveillance Mortgage-backed security ACORN Free trade Illegal drug trade Child support Keynesian economics Stock Leasing Rational pricing UK Singles Chart Treasury security Social Security (United States) PE ratio Enron Corporation Salary cap Mensal__o scandal Short selling Municipal bond Inventory Economics History of post-Soviet Russia Annual percentage rate Surplus value Dividend Toyota Prius Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Euro Option Federal Reserve Allodial title
