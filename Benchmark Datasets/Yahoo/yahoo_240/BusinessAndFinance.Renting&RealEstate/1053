recover lost rent from tenant that ran off i had this terrible tenant in my house i trusted her but things went sour about years in and she stopped paying my rent on time she came up with feeble excuses i had to take her to court but the process took months just before the bailiffs were going to remove her she left i don't know where she has gone she has trashed the place up she owes grand of rent i don't have her security deposit because she came up with some sob story about her daughter being abused and how she needed money franly i feel very ripped off and want some sort of retribution she was on housing benefits any ideas i had a tenant head off the texas once miles away this was according to the neighbors but they were reliable rather than be mad about it i had a little party that night yeah he trashed the place too and it took alot of money to get him out but at least with him gone i could fix the palce up and move on not trying to sugarcoat your experience just saying that if you are going to be a landlord this is going to happen to you pretty often in answer to your question if you can find out where the person is and they are relatively near you then you can take them to court for the money owed and damages still you may get a judgement that hurts their credit but not much chance you will get any money out of this since they seem to have no money if you can't get an address just forget about suing them and move on note that you clearly did several things wrong why did it take you months it should've taken alot less i suspect either you didn't get a proper lease or you waited on evicting them or something anyhow in the future do everything by the book and evict them immediately also you gave them their deposit back never never do this unless the person is out of the place i've actually paid someone and given them their deposit to leave talk about annoying but it was alot cheaper than an eviction was going to be and i didn't give them anything until they were completely out of the place look you got ripped off but your not the first one there doesn't seem to be much you can do about it expect learn from your mistakes and move on best luck Leasehold estate EastEnders Estoppel Eviction Rental agreement Big Brother (USA TV series) Plame affair Rent (musical) Social rule Leasing CPU cache 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Maison Ikkoku Babylonian law Pitaten The Star Wars Holiday Special Theory of conduct Mortgage Monopoly (game) Little Britain Homer Simpson The Young Ones (TV series) Karl Rove She Loves You Irish Land Act Ashton-Tate Piccolo Junior Saga Concurrent estate Renting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.
