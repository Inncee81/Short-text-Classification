wanting to move to north carolina what are some of the pros and cons if we do move i'll be transfering from my job in nevada to somewhere in nc housing looks affordable and the area looks beautiful but what's the weather like as far as hurricanes and tornadoes i can get used to the humidty but does it rain constantly and is it a good rain or a pain in the ass rain how's the crime rate schools and locals we don't want to move into a big city either we currently live in a town with about people in it and like the small town feel and we don't mind having to travel a couple miles to get to the big city any suggestions i grew up there and go back to see family but haven't lived there for a long time so my answer may be a bit dated still i loved it yes it is humid but not that humid its pretty hot in the summer and nice in the winter it can get cold but rarely snows maybe times per year you have the mountains on the west and beaches on the east kinda hilly in the middle hurricanes hit every so often but this only affects the beach areas and its easy to get out before the hurricane hits there are lots of smaller towns and a few big ones crime rate is ok to low schools are not great but also ok locals are very friendly overal i'd highly reccommend it but then again i did grow up there so i may be a bit biased best luck Severe weather terminology (United States) Pensacola, Florida 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Florida Tropical cyclone Long Island Hurricane Ivan Atlanta metropolitan area Climate of Salt Lake City Dallas, Texas Miami, Florida Elis Prefecture 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Spring (season) Catastrophic Florida Hurricanes: 1900-1960 Huntington Beach, California Geography of Japan Salt Lake City, Utah Disaster Sugar Land, Texas Cyclone Climate of India Geography of Spain 1985 Atlantic hurricane season 1998 Atlantic hurricane season Houston, Texas Cody, Wyoming Hurricane Katrina effects by region Weather front Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sacramento, California Cliff Richard University of Minnesota Beaumont, Texas Tina Turner 1959 Atlantic hurricane season History of Florida Las Vegas metropolitan area Hurricane Rita Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Florida Keys Geography of Albania Curitiba Hurricane Isabel California hurricanes 1996 Atlantic hurricane season Galveston Hurricane of 1900 2005 Pacific hurricane season Weather lore California Natural disaster Asturias Fast bowling 2005 Pacific typhoon season 1950 Atlantic hurricane season Season Jon Secada Las Vegas, Nevada Spice Girls Lake Tahoe Theory of conduct Bird migration Wind 1995 Atlantic hurricane season Rich Mullins 1980 Atlantic hurricane season Tornado 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Grande Prairie, Alberta Geography of Africa Hurricane Wilma Blood on the Tracks Palmdale, California Professional wrestling attacks Gangtok National Weather Service Asheville, North Carolina Blue Ridge Parkway Frankie Laine Friends 1990 Atlantic hurricane season Time Out of Mind Monsoon The Beach Boys K__ppen climate classification Hurricane Jeanne Extreme weather Skiing Cloud 1971 Atlantic hurricane season Ithaca, New York Utah New York City EastEnders Baltimore, Maryland
