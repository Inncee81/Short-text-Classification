here's a crazy question i recieved a notice in the mail today stating that my house is going into forclosure it's not that we can'y pay but we got behind due to the way my fiancee' get's paid and i had surgery now currently looking for a new job here's the question can i sell my house to a family member or good friend and still live here have no where else to go hi most mortgage holders are finally facing the reality that they are going to end up with waaaaay too many houses contact your mortgage company and ask to speak to the loss mitigation department explain the situation and ask if they can do a work out package with you they will ask you to write a hardship letter explain about the surgery being out of work that you are looking for work and be as pitiful as possible but also let them know that you are getting back on your feet with a time table and will be able to meet future payments keep this in mind they probably don t want the house back unless they are one of the few lenders that is looking for a loss suntrust and chase are two they will probably deal you can also sell the house to a family member or friend and still live there the back payments will be included in the payoff and probably some legal fees you may be able to negotiate these fees down too what you can t do is have a friend or family member buy the house on a short sale and have you benefit from it try the workout package first also if it gets down to the wire filing bankruptcy will temporarily stop the foreclosure proceedings and buy you some time best of luck to you barbara www therealestatebirddog com Mortgage Bond Debt Deflation (economics) Foreclosure Predatory lending Insurance Government National Mortgage Association Copyright Life insurance FairTax Advance fee fraud Great Depression Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Enron Corporation Mutual fund Sin City United States Postal Service Allodial title Unemployment Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Northwest Airlines Health insurance Public domain United Airlines Wal-Mart Poker jargon Citigroup Annuity Security (finance) Debt consolidation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Leasing Islamic banking Bankruptcy Annual percentage rate Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Knots Landing Advertising Game show Intellectual property Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bankruptcy in the United States Article One of the United States Constitution Timeline of the Enron scandal Schabir Shaik Trial Copyleft Prisoner's dilemma SCO-Linux controversies Housing cooperative Personal finance Subsidy The Ashlee Simpson Show U.S. public debt Futures contract ITV Cable television ACORN Credit card Oil-for-Food Programme Wachovia Financial markets Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Trademark Student loan Plame affair Monopoly (game) Infantilism Unreformed House of Commons Karl Rove Commodore International Brian Mulroney Jack Abramoff Katelyn Faber Social Security (United States) Walt Disney Estoppel Electronic Arts Credit card fraud Rent (musical) Contract Xerox TLC Best Buy Tax Theodore Kaczynski Fee tail
