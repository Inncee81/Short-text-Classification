a question about rent i have found a new apartment but the management company stated that it is available on half way through the month my question is will i have to pay for the full month of september even though i will only be living there for two weeks of that month i'm concerned because i will still be paying the months rent for my current apartment thank you in advance for your help you should not rent from someone if you don't feel comfortable asking them questions this is something we would all talk to the landlord about and ask them how they propose to handle it the two most common ways have been suggested prorating the rent so that a full month is due on oct st or a full months due on the th every month some landlords want their rent due on the st of each month but feel uneasy about letting you move in with only one half months rent so they might suggest a full months rent on and a half months rent on them adjust to full month on the first of each month thereafter again talk with the person you will rent from and don't rent from them if you don't fell comfortable with talking Leasehold estate Anarchism and capitalism Avenue Q Rent (musical) Estoppel Renting Friends Monopoly (game) Parasite singles Leasing Cyprus dispute Rent control Warren Buffett Rental agreement Unemployment Prostate cancer Mohamed Atta al-Sayed U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Stuyvesant Town Podcasting NorthBridge Apartment Complex Member of the European Parliament Mortgage Stomach cancer Anderson Cooper Little Britain The Commons Public housing Blockbuster Video Judiciary of Hong Kong Harlem Infantilism Lunar phase Apartment Babylonian law Green Party of Canada Social rule Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Accounting methods Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostitution Fasting New York City Spice Girls Plame affair Centrelink Eviction Annuity FairTax Day care Taxation in the United States Irish Land Act American Psycho The Inside Housing cooperative Westheimer Street Festival Chatham Square Melanie Wilkes Alignment (role-playing games) Economic rent Hani Hanjour Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Freedom Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election La boh__me United Kingdom corporation tax Vista Way Johann Heinrich von Th__nen 2003 California recall Speaker of the British House of Commons Public Eye Damn Yankees Breastfeeding Economic inequality Plame affair timeline Sant Thakar Singh Wal-Mart Sandy Koufax Chu-Han contention The Amber Spyglass Autism Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Gender-neutral language Three's Company Movie studio Philip J.
