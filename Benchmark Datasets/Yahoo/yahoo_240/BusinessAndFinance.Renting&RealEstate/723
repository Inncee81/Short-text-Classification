where can i find a decent priced time share i want to look into purchasing a time share but i don't want to get taken i want it to be a decent price where do i look how do i know its the real deal and how do i know its a good price i own a time share and am very happy with it mostly because i have an interval international ii membership in which i get fantastic last minute travel deals to stay at resorts so my advice is this go on ebay first get educated about all the fees points seasons red weeks trade programs like interval etc then unless you are planning on going to that one place over and over again that's why disney makes sense to so many buy the one with the lowest cost and annual maintenance fees you can pay the fees forever it doesn't matter where it is because if you can trade with interval or another you've gotten the best deal i also own just an efficiency and i've never stayed in an efficiency you can always upgrade to a bedroom and sometimes it doesn't even cost anything interval has a standard for it's resort partners they probably all do and i've never been disappointed with my trades if ebay doesn't work for you try timeshare com or timesharesonly com there are a few of them out there shop with the criteria above in mind and go go go Timeshare Microeconomics Mutual fund Capitalism Supply and demand Gross domestic product Publicly funded medicine Trade union Economics Agricultural policy Skype Disney's California Adventure Stock Walt Disney World Resort Common Agricultural Policy Arbitrage UK Singles Chart Wal-Mart Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Home Box Office Citigroup MMORPG Blockbuster Video Insurance Galactic Civilizations Public domain Law of value SCO-Linux controversies Political economy Auction Public good Futures contract Gold standard Ra (board game) Internet fraud Intellectual property Donald Trump Inflation Deflation (economics) Amazon.com Privatization Unemployment Trade Ethical consumerism Corporate governance Warren Buffett Advance fee fraud Best Buy Monopoly Liberal Democrats (UK) Labor theory of value Free trade Network effect Economy of Russia Short selling Neopets Monopoly (game) Great Depression Bulk vending Prisoner's dilemma Tariff Air New Zealand FairTax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus New Deal Fathers' rights The Apprentice 2 The Amazing Race Tax PE ratio Black-Scholes Externality Option Alex Ferguson Board of Cooperative Educational Services Fantastic Four Live 8 Asian financial crisis Contract Business process reengineering Price discrimination Lawyer The Walt Disney Company Productive and unproductive labour Airport Economy of Nigeria Welfare economics Corporation Derivative (finance) Mortgage Los Angeles Clippers Health insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Belgium MTR Management information system Public policy Saved by the Bell Canadian and American economies compared
