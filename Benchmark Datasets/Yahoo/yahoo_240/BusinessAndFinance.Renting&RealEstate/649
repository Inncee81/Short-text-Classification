who here bought a condo iam starting to notice that a lot of people are buying a condo now days instead of a single family home this is b c peopleare foreclosing on their properties or they just can't afford it i bought a condo but that wasn't the reason i bought it because i wanted a condo i lived in a single family home for seven years and had to mow the lawn every week shovel the snow and keep up with external maintenance it was a pain in the i could have hired someone but then i would have to screen vendors make sure they do a good job and i'd have to pay them another pain in the so i moved out of my house and bought a condo in a different state i have more square footage better schools my payments are lower even with the association fee and i cashed out a lot of money i love it a lot of my friends were like you don't want a condo maybe they like all that gardening but i don't the only caveat is that if you have a condo association that is a pain in the it could be trouble however my association is pretty laid back i leave them alone and they leave me alone once in awhile they paint replace siding or powerwash my deck adam Donald Trump Lawn mower McMansion Microeconomics Rental agreement Wal-Mart Universal Studios Sears Holdings Corporation The O.C.
