signed a purchase agreement do i have to buy i signed a purchase agreement back in january before the house was even built and i have been renting since then rent to own but now i decided that i do not want to purchase this house the agreement states that my earnest money will be non refundable so does this mean that i can back out do i have to go through court or anything any advice would be helpful thank you the house was being built last november and that is when i signed the papers thought i was only signing a lease and papers that stated i would get rent credits but turns out it was the purchase agreement the house was completed in january and we moved in here and have been renting since almost always you can back out but you lose your deposit if the contract is flawed you may get the deposit back but only after a fight unless you deposited a large sum the attorney's fees will be more than the deposit Renting Housing cooperative Rental agreement Leasing Islamic banking Intellectual property Estoppel Hire purchase Octopus card Mortgage Taxation in the United States Annuity Money supply Babylonian law Blackburn Rovers F.C.
