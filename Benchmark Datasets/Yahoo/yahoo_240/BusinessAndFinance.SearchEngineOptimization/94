which one is better google adsense or ypn reply only if you have experience i have been running adsense since when it started and ypn since when it started what i did was to do a test between ypn and adsense on a new site i have giving both equal impressions and same look and feel i served the two alternately using a banner ad server my months test showed that income from adsense was times higher than yahoo publisher network ypn targeting was poor and even now they can't seem to make it work properly i then junked ypn and went full blast with adsense i suggest you do your own a b test to see what will work best for your site your mileage may vary than mine however i will not argue with x more in income so i am with adsense AdSense Network effect Google Search engine optimization Google search Web traffic Homeschooling Ping AdWords X Window System Daniel Brandt Google platform Gmail Web 2.0 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory E-mail spam Mach kernel Game programming Stopping e-mail abuse Web crawler Simple Mail Transfer Protocol M16 (rifle) HTTP cookie E85 Turing test Explosive material Economic inequality Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ajax (programming) Doomsday argument Labour economics PHP Apple Computer Fuel efficiency Domain Name System Poker jargon Website Terminal ballistics Intelligence quotient Data mining Conscription Answers.com Server Progressive tax Linux MMORPG E-mail Microsoft USS Whale (SS-239) Natural Selection (computer game) Arianne RuneScape skills Carburetor Google bomb City of Heroes Instant messaging Windows 2000 USS Thompson (DD-627) Vickers Valiant Internet troll Independent Media Center High-speed rail Robot Master MSN Messenger History of Test cricket (to 1883) Gift economy GameFAQs Direct Client-to-Client PlanetSide USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Driver's license Usenet Marathon (sport) 2005 United States Grand Prix V-1 flying bomb MythBusters Ben Johnson (athlete) Philadelphia Experiment Freedom of speech Public policy Connectionism IBM PC compatible ELO rating system Three-phase electric power Internet fraud Labor theory of value Redundant array of independent disks Alternative medicine Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Spring operating system Hypoglycemia Newgrounds Rulemaking Freeway Animal testing Opera (web browser) Breastfeeding Proxy server
