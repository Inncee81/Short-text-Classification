i am trying to find ways of increasing traffic for my website i recently started my own internet business i have tried seo and was wondering if there are any other ways to increase traffic to my website seo has been slow and i am not getting the results i had hoped for in the beginning i think what i may need is a more targeted approach however i am unsure of exactly how to achieve that you can use google adword but its still similiar to spam i think you should try a firm that offers actual marketing there are companies out there that will hire people for you to start talking about your product on social netowrks forums and blogs i know the big one is hypedrive but there are probaly others you can check into i have just seemed adwords seo as just part of the plan you need someone that will genrate conversation foryou not just a way to show up during keywords just look around and be careful with whom you deal with Search engine optimization Google search Google Spamdexing Google bomb Web traffic Online marketing Spam (electronic) Link spam E-mail spam Internet fraud Blog AdSense AdWords Network effect Spyware Advertising Internet forum Web design The Cluetrain Manifesto Stopping e-mail abuse Privatization Gmail Direct marketing Computer virus Wal-Mart Software engineering Management Amazon.com LiveJournal Viral marketing Call centre Affiliate marketing Mergers and acquisitions Prostate cancer BitTorrent Mozilla Application Suite Advance fee fraud Instant messaging Labour economics Corporate governance Mozilla Firefox PageRank Monopsony IBM Java programming language Bank Intelligence quotient Meta tag Unemployment Open Directory Project Information Services Procurement Library The Standard High-speed rail Externality Phishing Investment bank Rational Unified Process Corporate finance Electronic Arts CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Web 2.0 Software testing Surveillance Urban planning Tesco Wall Street Anonymous remailer Coercion Usenet Incentive Marketing Customer relationship management Broadband Internet access Nigritude ultramarine Gay Nigger Association of America Identity theft Ethical consumerism Air traffic control Financial services Economy of the People's Republic of China Mach kernel Illegal drug trade Scholarship Toyota Prius Compiler optimization Price discrimination FairTax Economy of the United States Strategic planning Enterprise content management Publishing Venture capital Search engine New Deal Monetary policy Airline Supply and demand Emacs
