please answer the following cristin madsen has recently been transferred to the appliances division of solequin corporation shortly after taking over her new position as divisional controller she was asked to develop the division s predetermined overhead rate for the upcoming year the accuracy of the rate is of some importance since it is used throughout the year and any overapplied or underapplied overhead is closed out to cost of goods sold only at the end of the year solequin corporation uses direct labor hours in all of its divisions as the allocation base for manufacturing overhead to compute the predetermined overhead rate cristin divided her estimate of the total manufacturing overhead for the coming year by the production manager s estimate of the total direct labor hours for the coming year she took her computations to the division s general manager for approval but was quite surprised when he suggested a modification in the base her conversation with the general manager of the appliances division lance jusic went like this madsen here are my calculations for next year s predetermined overhead rate if you approve we can enter the rate into the computer on january and be up and running in the job order costing system right away this year jusic thanks for coming up with the calculations so quickly and they look just fine there is however one slight modification i would like to see your estimate of the total direct labor hours for the year is hours how about cutting that to about hours madsen i don t know if i can do that the production manager says she will need about direct labor hours to meet the sales projections for next year besides there are going to be over direct labor hours during the current year and sales are projected to be higher next year jusic cristin i know all of that i would still like to reduce the direct labor hours in the base to something like hours you probably don t know that i had an agreement with your predecessor as divisional controller to shave or so off the estimated direct labor hours every year that way we kept a reserve that usually resulted in a big boost to net income at the end of the fiscal year in december we called it our christmas bonus corporate headquarters always seemed as pleased as punch that we could pull off such a miracle at the end of the year this system has worked well for many years and i don t want to change it now required explain how shaving off the estimated direct labor hours in the base for the predetermined overhead rate usually results in a big boost in net income at the end of the fiscal year should cristin madsen go along with the general manager s request to reduce the direct labor hours in the predetermined overhead rate computation to direct labor hours you need to do your own homework it's cheating Tax Labour economics Labor theory of value Surplus value Microsoft Inflation Redundant array of independent disks Taxation in the United States Airline Economic inequality Economy of Russia Space Shuttle program Economy of India Corporate finance Social Security debate (United States) Kyoto Protocol Ford Motor Company Microeconomics Galactic Civilizations Computer Gross domestic product FairTax Economy of the United States Law of value Economics Inventory Life insurance Citigroup Extreme Programming Compiler optimization Mach kernel Capital accumulation Bretton Woods system CPU cache Outsourcing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction CPU design Air traffic control Tariff Intellectual property Economy of Nigeria ELO rating system Economy of Pakistan Anarchism and capitalism Manitoba Hydro Sears Holdings Corporation Economy of Venezuela Baseball Airbus A320 Software engineering Free trade Productive and unproductive labour Welding Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Expert system Deflation (economics) Unemployment benefit Canadian and American economies compared Turbocharger Keynesian economics E85 Insurance X Window System Alcohol fuel Hyperinflation Progressive tax Defense Logistics Agency Economy of Colombia Monetary policy Air traffic controller Salary cap Airbus Central processing unit Domain Name System Supply and demand Digital circuit Throughput accounting Global Positioning System Indian Railways Explosive material PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 Hanscom Air Force Base Economy of Suriname MMORPG
