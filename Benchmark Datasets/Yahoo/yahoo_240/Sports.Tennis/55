wat do you think when maria sharapova won the acura classic the wta tour put up this question which player possesses the best hardcourt game on the sony ericsson wta tour henin sharapova jankovic kuznetsova ivanovic chakvetadze serena williams venus williams other the results came up with sharapova winning now i like sharapova's hard court game but i dont think she has the best hard court game one reason is that she never really played against someone of her caliber at the acura classic another reason is that she got thoroughly beat at the austrailian open and when she won the us open mauresmo and henin were going through issuses and jankovic didnt get a chance to play her this is my list of the best hard court players serena williams jelena jankovic maria sharapova venus williams justine henin so what do you think as far as the best har courts game is the question u can hardly make a guess coz women's tennis is so competitive you don't know who might turn around whose game i personally think that maria has not only a great game but that reall attitude needed to win on hardcourts i mean she plays fast she can cool down herself at times she can play smart against players who are known to be notorious for their talent look at shara pova's victories over my favourite sania mirza and anna chakvetadze sania has been through a really hot form but chakvetadze was leading the us open series before the semis of acura classic and anna even beat venus williams after saving a match point in q f other contenders could be both the williams sisters if venus is one of the best grass court players we've ever had the same can be sid for serena on hard courts another biggie would be justine henin she has everything to become a champion an immmense pool of strokes lies in her raquet but i seriously doubt jelena jankovic's game on hard courts i have noticed some weaknesses of hers recently i think her forehand is not actually hit as an attack shot it is simply hit it coz it has come to you also her serve has nothing great on it it's not too fast anyone gets millions of milliseconds to think about the return before even the ball lands Lindsay Davenport Women's Tennis Association Anastasia Myskina Venus Williams Monica Seles Roger Federer Table tennis Martina Hingis Pete Sampras Steffi Graf Andre Agassi Squash (sport) 2005 US Open The Championships, Wimbledon Volleyball Svetlana Kuznetsova Golf Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Badminton June 2004 in sports Am__lie Mauresmo June 2005 in sports Conchita Mart__nez Bj__rn Borg Mary Pierce Virginia Ruano Pascual Australian cricket team Meghann Shaughnessy July 2004 in sports Tennis strategy Nicole Vaidi__ov__ Billie Jean King Tennis court The Ashes Serve (tennis) Snooker June 2005 in Britain and Ireland Anna Kournikova Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rugby union 2005 English cricket season West Indian cricket team History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Chris Evert Ai Sugiyama ESPN25 Norway national football team Suzanne Lenglen Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mats Wilander Pete Sampras Tennis Ravi Shastri International cricket in 2005 Australian Open Game show New York Knicks History of Test cricket (to 1883) John McEnroe Ultimate (sport) Gustavo Kuerten Racquetball Seishun Academy Middle School Real tennis Gordon Banks World Series Sports timeline Football (soccer) Thomas Muster May 2005 in sports 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand ELO rating system Michelle Wie The Notorious B.I.G.
