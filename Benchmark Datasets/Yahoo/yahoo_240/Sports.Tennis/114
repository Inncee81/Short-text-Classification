who wants to see roger vs rafa for the us open final this year if not what would be you ideal final on the mens side active players only hello gohabs well i would love to watch a roger vs a healthy rafa us open final but after seeing him struggle against paul henrie mathieu going sets although he played better after the st and then in doubles just barely getting by bester duclos i am concerned that his injury or injuries may still be bothering him yes you can say that lleyton was off as well just barely getting by hrbaty in a real nail biter but for them to withdraw against erlich ram a team that most tennis fanatics would predict a nadal hewitt victory over is puzzling unless they are both fatigued and injured they may just want the extra rest for their next singles mathes so who would i like to see roger play in the us open how about a real potential fan favourite who may have a shot at upsetting him not that i want to see that happen but someone like a john isner go dawgs georgia bulldog tennis if not then novak djokovic although he is not showing his brilliant self at the rogers cup either oh and if you are a montreal canadians fan don't worry i won't hold that against you go leafs Tennis Andre Agassi Table tennis Roger Federer Georgia Institute of Technology Gustavo Kuerten Norway national football team Association of Tennis Professionals Quizbowl John McEnroe Playoff format Ivan Lendl Volleyball Bj__rn Borg Paintball American football Playoff Golf Badminton Marat Safin Steffi Graf Serena Williams Pittsburgh Steelers Elena Dementieva The Championships, Wimbledon Single-elimination tournament VS System Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering) Quake III Arena Syracuse University Orange Football (soccer) Basketball Magic: The Gathering Luther Head Michael Campbell Virginia Ruano Pascual Hunter College High School Squash (sport) New York Giants Jerry Lucas Jimmy Connors West Virginia University Go ranks and ratings John Calipari Bill Tilden Reach for the Top Real tennis University of Maryland, College Park Mark Philippoussis Andy Roddick National Football League Martina Hingis Bryan Robson Justine Henin-Hardenne GunBound University of San Francisco Lleyton Hewitt Jack Charlton Anastasia Myskina Lottie Dod Pete Sampras Tennis Racquetball Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Four square Contract bridge National Basketball Association One-day cricket Monica Seles Rod Laver Football World Cup 1990 World Championship Wrestling Texas Longhorn Athletics Tennis Masters Cup Weight training Jennifer Capriati Leon White Troms__ I.L.
