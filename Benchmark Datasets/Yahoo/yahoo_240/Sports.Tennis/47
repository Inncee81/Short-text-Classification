is there a mathematical chance of rafel nadal ever being the world number one barring any injuries to roger there appears a little chance that rafa will ever surpass federer who leads him now with over points nadal is playing so much better than many previous world number ones did at the time they enjoyed that status yet number one continues to elude him why because he is so unfortunate to have federer on the scene the tragedy is that nadal appears even likely in time to burn out and perhaps retire b federer who plays a less physical tennis mathematically speaking anyone have as good a chance of being as federer one year from now don't forget that he must defend his points because only the last weeks count even though federer has amazing points now and an overwhelming points lead over nadal if he say gets injured and doesn't play at all for an entire year his points then would be exactly zero in fact if you look at the points from jan rafa is leading slightly at the moment so if rafa betters or even equals federer from now to year's end dec rafa would now i don't really doubt federer would successfully defend most of his points and fend off rafa from but if you're asking mathematical chance sure there is federer will be on top most of the time but it's very hard to sustain excellence so i can see a year where federer slips just a notch and nadal can grab the for a brief moment but nadal's grinding game is not good for a long career exceptions apply agassi so by the time federer retires nadal himself may not have as much left in the tank rafa is unlucky to be in an era where the greatest player of all time is playing and will be labeled even though he's probably better than some other s marcelo rios for instance Andre Agassi Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Pete Sampras Association of Tennis Professionals Gustavo Kuerten Tennis Tennis Open Era Norway national football team Volleyball 1957 World Series ELO rating system Babe Ruth Boxing Tennis Masters Cup Bj__rn Borg Andy Roddick NBA Finals Cleveland Browns Marcelo R__os San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Miami Dolphins Table tennis Toronto Blue Jays Team Fortress Classic Steffi Graf Ultimate (sport) New York Knicks Tennis strategy 2005 US Open Tag English cricket team World Chess Championship Indianapolis 500 Ivan Ljubi__i__ Robin Ventura Alex Ferguson Barry Bonds Indiana Pacers Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Wroc__aw Billboard Hot 100 Andrew Murray (tennis player) Los Angeles Kings Contract bridge Football (soccer) The Price Is Right Luck Newcastle United F.C.
