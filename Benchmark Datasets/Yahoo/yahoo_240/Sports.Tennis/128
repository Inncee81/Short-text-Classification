question about tennis racquets i just got a new tennis racquet yesterday prince ozone seven d and today i was practicing with it i scratched the head a few times i was really really mad knowing the fact that i got it yesterday and already got the head scratched up a bit is there anyway i can keep the head protected like head tape or something is there anyway to keep it from getting scratched on hard courts additional details is there any special kind of head tape i can put on for the o design racquets because of the o ports on the head and stuff is there a special or certain kind of head tape for the o 's i see sorry it really does not matter at all actually if this makes u feel any better the first day after i got a new racket i went up for an overhead and accidentally chucked it into the ground and cracked the whole frame i did that twice actually so dont worry about it its part of the game and head tape will only dampen your strings and detract from the proportionality of the racket Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Andre Agassi Guillermo Coria Wonder Boy Miss Congeniality Association of Tennis Professionals Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous William Shatner French Open Andy Roddick Amy Dumas James Blake Magnus Carlsen Benjamin Bratt Seattle Mariners Dream Team Tennis Masters Cup West Ham United F.C.
