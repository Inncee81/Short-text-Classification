ghosts i live next to a grave yard its not creepy or anything we live in the suburbs of long island in the hamptons and its perfectly normal but there is an old civil war era grave next to our house its not scary or anything but how would you tell if its haunted as a little kid i used tog o in there when my mom wasn't looking cause i found it really really cool i still think its fascinating but how can i tell if its haunted besides like holding a seance or something or an ouija board my motoher has had bad expiriences as a child i can't hold a seance because everyone i know is too chicken and its kinda creepy being in a grave yard all by yourself if i take pictures will they show up one time i was a dead bride for halloween and my mom thought it wouldbe cool to get a bicture of us in the grave yard cause it was like themed and in all the pictures there is a little orb of light thats always next to this one grave in every single picture was that one sorry it was long also i have heard cats and dogs can see them is there anyway to tell if my cat or dog is seeing one sometimes they start smeeling and swatting things that aren't there i thought maybe a tiny bug or something i can't see but nothing k thanks i have hobbies i play lacrosse fieldhockey on the track team got published take karate and pilates and am in all honors excluding math classes i am doing just fine thank you i am just curious which is probably more than you can say for yourself urrrp you generally see spirits in places that the person was attached to in life homes or even favorite pieces of furniture which is why you need to be careful buying antiques you may get more than you thought or certain geographical areas rather than the grave they were buried in which is why you hear more about haunted houses than haunted graveyards those who died violently are more likely to haunt the place of their death because it creates an energetic imprint typically this is experienced as ghosts that repeat the same action at the same time of day everyday it's like reliving their last moments on earth i wouldn't suggest using a ouija board anywhere as they tend to attract lower energy forms that can be disruptive and attach themselves to you are you sure the orbs are attached to the grave and not to you it's not uncommon for loved ones who have crossed over to show up as orbs in photos near us have you taken a photo of the grave without anyone standing there RuneScape quests Soap opera Dead Like Me The Phantom Manor Goosebumps The Haunted Mansion (film) Ouija Charmed The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cat Horror film Phoebe Buffay's songs Scenes from a Memory Garfield Animism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban KaBlam!
