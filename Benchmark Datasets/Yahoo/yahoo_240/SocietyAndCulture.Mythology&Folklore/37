can someone who is intuitive help me at all i am in love with a man that i felt still feel may very well be my soulmate i thought that he and i were on the path to a wonderful romantic relationship but that came to a screeching halt i can't forget about him i see him every day and i often still sense that certain indescribable something between us i am absolutely heartbroken but i still feel as though maybe one day we will be together because we are meant to be wishful thinking maybe i don't know but i have never felt so connected to another person it was as if he completed me though i have tried i cannot accept what has happened also he and i were at the same place at the same time some years ago and as far as i know we never met even though we knew a lot of the same people fast forward more than a decade and we meet it was almost like a second chance can anyone help if you are truly soul mates then where is he in this equation why is he willing to let you go perhaps it is only one sided also you should not be depending on another person to complete you in order to have a full and meaningful relationship you need to be a complete person already you do not mention what it was that happened and came between you two if you truly were soul mates could this have split you up as it did probably not if it was meant to be it will be you cannot force it to be because that is what you think you want what we want is often not what is best for us Soulmate Scenes from a Memory Interpersonal relationship Love Social rule Friedrich Schleiermacher Current teachings of Prem Rawat Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind Phaedo Sant Mat Human Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Epistemology Objectivist philosophy God Emperor of Dune General relativity Philosophical skepticism My Sassy Girl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.
