do things really happen for a reason ok i keep thinking about how things happen mostly how i have lived my life so far when i was small my parents moved from the small town we lived in to the city where i live now there i signed up for music classes which made me get into a good music middle school where i met my best friend that is still my best friend after all these years which made me apply for a good music high school so if my parents hadn't of moved i wouldn't or maybe i would of signed up and gone everywhere i have been so far and maybe the person i am today so what do u think do things lead up to other or is life just this spontaneous big blob i think so because if it didn't i too wouldn't have been where i am today something happened and still happen that have affected my life and continue to do so somethings happened that i have not thought about that have pushed me hopefully in the right direction if you believe in god you will truly believe it all happens with a purpose from him and for a good reason if you don't believe in him then i don't know maybe that's how the life cycle goes maybe it's all karma or fate written in the stars i however think there is a place for everything and everything and everyone in it's rightful place otherwise if it all didn't matter we wouldn't get where we're at right now it would all be chaos and insanity nothing would make sense my advice is to go with the flow believe in god and or the higher being and hopefully everything will fall into place but also believe in yourself because you have to be the difference in this world either written out or spontaneous Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Predestination Karma Theodicy Friedrich Schleiermacher Free will Humphrey Bogart Karma in Hinduism Aristotle Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Determinism Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Atomism Supernatural Entropy Moral objectivism Tide Piccolo Junior Saga Luck Confucius Sri Aurobindo Soul Culture of Lithuania The nature of God in Western theology God Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye Life insurance Origin belief Appeal Royal Assent Socrates Storytelling Reincarnation One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan God Emperor of Dune Leviathan (book) On the Road Professor X Ethics Phoebe Halliwell Montreal Screwjob Vacuum 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Intelligent design Tai Chi Chuan Sant Mat Japanese particles Duties of the Heart Summa Theologiae Characters of Lost Abortion debate Garth Brooks Friends The Pet Sounds Sessions Jon Secada Origin of life Opus Dei Milton H.
