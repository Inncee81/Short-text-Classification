amazed but it took a long time to get an answer what question should i follow up next o and i am doing this by myself it may explain why its slow hit me up with some pointers spirit boards ouija boards on another group there was a post about the ouija board i would like to clear up some misconceptions and superstitions what is true is that the ouija boards are not toys they were originally made to communicate and converse with someone who is dead is it any wonder that the spirit board is shrouded in superstition and mystery it is not bad or evil horror movies and society have made it bad some of the superstitions surrounding the ouija would be considered an urban legion people say that the board is a means of bringing the devil satan into the world some say that evil demons trick people into becoming spiritually possessed creating harassment and oppression by using the board none of these superstitions are true oh and by the way the ouija board does not scream when you burn it the ouija board became popular during the spiritualist movement in the united states during the mid th century methods of divination during this time used various ways to spell out the messages sometimes using a pendulum which swung over a plate that had letters painted around the edge most often used was a wooden tablet with caster attached the tablet called a planchette was affixed with a pencil that wrote out the messages much like automatic writing the methods mentioned above may predate modern spiritualism it was used for the purpose of bring spirit through to receive messages spirit boards were used to channel a spirit while using the board the medium is also many times aware of what the spirit is thinking and instinctively knows what the next word is because when you are willing to allow the spirit to use your eyes to see the board you also allow it to use your consciousness as well the spirit has the ability of influencing your mind and brain to form the words it needs to communicate the ouija or spirit board as i prefer to call it is another tool used to open to your mediumship abilities the board itself has no special powers neither does the planchette the board acts as an indicator for your subconscious linking your physical body in with the world of spirit it is simply one of the tools used by a medium to communicate with the spirit world when you use the board you open up to your intuitive abilities some of you will open to your own mediumship abilities when this happens there is no turning back so do not use the board if you are high or if you have been mood altered in any way the ouija board may not be safe for some personality types the ouija board may be dangerous if you believe that what you experience is bad or evil if you believe the board is not going to work or if you are afraid of what your experience will be it is probably best if you do not seek out the experience addictive personalities probably should never use the spirit board as it can be almost as addictive as alcohol it probably is not be wise for you to use it every day if you are sick do not play with the board you do not want a lonely spirit to attach itself to you never invite a spirit to come home or to stay with you i don t think it would be very wise to ask the spirit to move something in the room or to ask for a physical sign how will you remove it later don t ask the board if you or someone you know is going to die you just might get an answer you do not want to hear and will worry the rest of your life about it as with anything the energy vibration of the spirit or entity that comes through will usually be at the same or a higher level as yours by all means before you begin ask for and feel protected this may be in the form or a prayer if you choose tell the board that you want only the highest and best energy to come through to visit when as is sometimes the case things become negative tell it to leave or terminate the communication it is wise to remember that the spirit that comes through is potentially dangerous remember the board is your tool to open up intuitively to the spirit world respect it at the end of your session say good bye it breaks the connection between you and the spirit world looking on the internet for documentation i found that some famous people have used the ouija board alice cooper
