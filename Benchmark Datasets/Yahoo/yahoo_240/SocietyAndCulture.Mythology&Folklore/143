is there poltergiest activities in my room if so how can i find out for some reason there has ben a lot of poltergiest activites in my romm but not in the rest of my house so i went to my room and wrote down is there a ghost here yes no as set the paper down with the pen i walkedto the door turned off the lights and felt some thing push me really hard out of my room this scarred me much i ran upstairs with so much fear similar post from a similar question poltergeist are chaos wights because they are usually attached to the family individual moving would probably not directly solve the problem i would suggest promoting positive energy within the house room open the windows on a nice day keep things tidy place some plants in the room in short get rid of negative energy and create positive energy even play calming music throughout the day when if the problems are seen immediately command the spirit to leave my house at once be gone i know it's hard to not be afraid but the theory is that some wights are able to feed off fear you should meditate and picture yourself and your room being encased in a protective bubble if possible you should also contact you guardian this will make you feel stronger and less fearful this in itself will help to rid the house of the poltergeist also poltergeists are often associated with teens because of their high energy at that time of their lives if you are a teen you could be the cause of your poltergeist go out and do something sports running walking bicycling etc something to use up some physical energy not only is it healthy physically but it will help mentally as well and will help you deal with the poltergeist if not get rid of it too many kids sit and play games all day cooped up energy has to go somewhere good luck to you Force (Star Wars) Ghost Tai Chi Chuan Chaos Emerald Piccolo Junior Saga RuneScape quests Isle of Wight Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Infantilism Legacy of Kain Out-of-body experience Transactional analysis Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hollyoaks Dragon Booster Dualism (philosophy of mind) Determinism A Course In Miracles Stoicism Simone Weil Psychoanalysis The Shining (film) Poker jargon The nature of God in Western theology Babe Ruth Baroque chess Spontaneous human combustion Protoss The Sims 2 Abortion debate Undead Fire fighting Numerology Boom Town (Doctor Who) One Tree Hill (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Religion B-47 Stratojet Domestic violence Social rule Meditation The Death Gate Cycle Quatermass and the Pit Fable (video game) Consciousness Bicycle helmet Jumpstart 3rd Grade Cell (biology) Bicycle Aikido Charmed Kasparov versus The World Clinical depression Ionizing radiation Martial art Pitaten Psychokinesis Ouija Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Keynesian economics Green Lantern Corps G-Man (Half-Life) Mahjong Silent Night, Deadly Night Pyramids of Mars Black hole Ten Commandments Sant Thakar Singh Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Insomnia Diablo II: Lord of Destruction W.I.T.C.H.
