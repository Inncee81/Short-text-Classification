what is the most spiritaual paranormal or pyschic experience youve everr had hm well there was this 'ghost' or whatever that was a man wearing a tan hat 'n trench coat kinda like something you'd see in an old ' s mystery movie ya know i haven't seen him in a while though he always left when someone came near like was about to spot him i never saw his face either i guess he didn't like me enough to stick around plus when i was a tiny little tot i used to sleep over at my grandmother's place i was very small 'n could sleep in a recliner chair she had in her living room and every time i slept there i would always wake up in the middle of the night 'n see the figure of a man standing in the doorway usually when that happened i would just close my eyes 'n go back to sleep but night i decided to keep my eyes open to see who and or what it was oddly enough the figure started walking closer to me stepped in the light 'n the figure looked like wolverine from the original x men i'm not making that up it really happened 'n it was really weird and something else is in a question i once asked but i don't feel like typing it up again sorry but those things are probably the most spiritual and paranormal things that have happened to me Milton H.
