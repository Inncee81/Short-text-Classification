do you ever see things like flashes of light or movement out of the corner of your eye or hear movements like shuffling or a creak next to you but when you look nothing is there it happens to me all the time its very creepy did i spell creak correctly or is it creek i don't smoke weed last night while at mothers i continued to see flashes of light in the hallway her cat sat at the entrance to the hallway and began growling she stayed there all night it was very creepy now again tonight i have begun hearing and seeing it but i am at home it keeps me awake at night the first commenter thought i was smoking weed lol its just sometimes it is more than a creak or flash one night i heard a loud bang then my front door flew open the door had been locked it sounded like someone kicked it another time it was storming out side and the latches on our storm doors are broken so we have to tie them shut this night we didn't tie them and i woke up to them slamming in the wind my daughter was awake and scared she said it had been going on for hours but she didn't want to wake us up i told her it was the wind then went to the kitchen to get a drink before i proceeded to tie them it was about in the morning while pouring a glass of juice i heard a knock on the back door everyone i know uses my front door like we instruct them to because we keep our screen door tied in the back most of the time my daughter and i ran upstairs and i got my husband up no one was there he tied the door and went back to bed a few minutes later we heard the screen door slam i looked and it was still tied sorry you think i over did it these things really happened don't be startled you're not going insane think of it this way your brain is only processing a tiny bit of information from your senses so what you are probably seeing and hearing are extra things the brain has decided to process there are so many things that our eyes alone cannot see so what you probably saw and heard are spirits or even angels although you probably do not believe in such i've heard someone speak asked if my hubby said something and he'll say no The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Columbine High School massacre Grandview, U.S.A.
