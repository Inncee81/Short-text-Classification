who has been the boxers of each decade since the s in my opinion the best fighter in the world during the s and s is no doubt sugar ray robinson the best fighter and the face of boxing during the s and s was muhammed ali best of the s now this is a tough one but i would have to say it was sugar ray leonard but i wouldn't have a problem if someone chose hagler duran or hearns the best during the s i think it would probably be roy jones jr and the best of the s i would go with either hopkins or mayweather jr anyways thats just my opinion what do you guys think you are absolutely right with sugar ray robinson during the s and s he was the greatest pfp fighter ever during the s it was most definitely muhammad ali but i dont know about the s though i mean i know ali beat joe frazier george foreman ken norton and others but he just wasnt as skilled as he was before he was unfairly suspended he was the smartest fighter ill give him that but im leaning towards roberto duran on this one most people talk about him during the s but he lost most of his big fights in the s and after his win over sugar ray leonard he got embarassed in the rematch during the s he was pretty much unstoppable s i say its between leonard hearns hagler tyson and julio cesar chavez im gonna have to go with hagler though since he knocked out hearns beat duran and should have gotten the decision against leonard tyson was absolutely dominant though but hagler fought and beat more challenging fighters chavez was more late s early s i agree with you on roy jones jr in the s he was simply untouchable s ill give mayweather an edge over hopkins and pacquaio since he has made world class fighters look silly he may be boring and annoying but no one can get a clean shot on him Marvin Hagler George Foreman Roberto Duran Sugar Ray Robinson Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time Ring Magazine fighters of the year Mike Tyson World Boxing Council Joe Frazier Ring Magazine Evander Holyfield Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns Roy Jones Jr. Julio C__sar Ch__vez H__ctor Camacho Bernard Hopkins 1980s HBO Boxing Angelo Dundee Juan Martin Coggi Leon Spinks John Mugabi V__ctor Gal__ndez Don King Joe Louis Carlos De Leon Erik Morales The Contender (television series) Laila Ali The Rumble in the Jungle No M__s Fight Caesars Palace Richard Steele (boxing referee) Wilfred Benitez Middleweight Azumah Nelson Jos__ Napoles Floyd Mayweather Jr. Juan Roldan Kostya Tszyu Edwin Rosario Michael Spinks Archie Moore Michael Watson Ken Buchanan Jersey Joe Walcott Antonio Cervantes Alan Minter Wilfredo G__mez Michael Moorer Marco Antonio Barrera Bob Foster Arturo Gatti New York Giants John Ruiz Bob Arum Winky Wright Jesse James Leija Kid Gavilan Sonny Liston Rafael Limon Michael Carbajal Antonio Tarver Jorge Castro (boxer) Carmen Basilio Eder Jofre Pernell Whitaker Genaro Hernandez Johnny Tapia ESPN25 Ken Norton Henry Armstrong Jorge Paez Carlos Zarate Irichelle Duran Jeff Fenech Alex Ramos Oscar de la Hoya Yori Boy Campas Andrzej Go__ota Humphrey Bogart Terry Norris Jack Johnson (boxer) Lennox Lewis George Chuvalo Andrea DeShong Larry Holmes Lightweight Rub__n Olivares Esteban De Jesus Shane Mosley Heavyweight
