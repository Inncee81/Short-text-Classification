who do you think will win between jermaine taylor vs kelly pavlick on september i have to agree with stonewall if taylor doesn't follow the instructions of stewart then it could be a long night for the current champ in the past stewart has given taylor good instructions especially in the wright fight but taylor didn't follow any of it making the fight more difficult than it should have been i can still see taylor winning but only if he listens to stewart or his striking with his overhand right has gotten more accurate that's not really saying that i think taylor will win but it wouldn't surprise me if he comes out still the champion one thing is for sure taylor should not take this fight lightly or he'll be looking at the lights from the canvas Clash of Champions Jermain Taylor StarrCade Bernard Hopkins Aston Villa F.C.
