what's with all the perceived boxing racism a k a marciano i'm honestly surprised about how many people are labeling others racist for their opinions on who's the best fighter has there been a boom of name calling in boxing lately or has this always happened i think people take their frustrations out on this forum instead of really looking at the boxers and relating to boxing questions i say recognize talent where talent exists marciano was a good champ ali was a good champ frazier was a good champ dempsey was a good champ etc etc etc its sad to define someone by their color instead of by what they have accomplished or by how they have accomplished it Boxing Heavyweight Rocky Marciano Muhammad Ali Joe Frazier Archie Moore Jersey Joe Walcott Charley Goldman Fighting Spirit George Foreman Joe Louis Sugar Ray Robinson Rocky Floyd Patterson Max Baer Larry Holmes Jack Dempsey Theory of conduct Max Schmeling Mike Tyson Lennox Lewis Internet troll The Rumble in the Jungle Laila Ali Jack Johnson (boxer) Leon Spinks Thrilla in Manila Champ Car Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time Agnosticism Black (people) Alexis Arg__ello Ring Magazine fighters of the year Women's boxing Henry Armstrong Jerry Quarry Ezzard Charles Wilfred Benitez The Contender (television series) White nationalism Ring Magazine Sugar Ray Leonard Fight of the Century Don King Irish people Evander Holyfield World Boxing Council Lou Duva Scientific racism Nationalism Michael Spinks South Carolina Race and intelligence (Public controversy) Bob Foster Racism HBO Boxing Te__filo Stevenson Bob Fitzsimmons Azumah Nelson Atheism Arab-Israeli conflict Marvin Hagler Validity of human races The Cure Tony Tubbs White trash Sexual orientation Skinhead Generation X Self-hatred Harry Greb Culture George Chuvalo Anti-Defamation League Anti-Zionism World Boxing Association Political status of Taiwan Willie Pep Nazism Boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics Joe Calzaghe Aesthetic Realism Polyamory Boxing training F__lix Trinidad Rub__n Olivares The Big Tall Wish Eugenics Jess Willard Middleweight Our Gang Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Wilfredo G__mez The nature of God in Western theology Homophobia Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bret Hart Generation Y Angelo Dundee Grunge music
