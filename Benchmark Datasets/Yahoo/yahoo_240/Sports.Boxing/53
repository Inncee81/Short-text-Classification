who will win this december ricky hitman hatton or pretty boy floyd mayweather these two are both great boxers not to mention that they both are undefeated with mayweathers knock outs and hattons knock outs it makes it a hard match to judge in my own opinion i think hatton has this one he has been calling out mayweather for a while now and finally gets the chance to proove himself ricky hatton is a strong toe toe boxer and if mayweather goes toe to toe with this guy there would be a assured knock out and plus mayweather leave his ribs open and thats whats gonna probably hatton's target but what do you think mayweather Floyd Mayweather Jr. Boxing Kostya Tszyu Manchester City F.C.
