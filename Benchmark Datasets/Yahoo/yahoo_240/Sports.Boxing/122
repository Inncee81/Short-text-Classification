prime joe frazier vs prime mike tyson who would win why lets look at the facts both in their primes both came to fight and both proved to go the distance and still maintain smoking joe up and down constant head movement with arms crossed defense he utilized a quick right hook that he would throw ever so often in between his up and down bobbing joe liked to smash on the body with body shots but they didn't have the spark needed to put a man down with just one he always needed multiple he also didn't have a snapping jab but what he lacked in general skill he made up for in heart and the will to proceed even if it looked over for him iron mike fast illusive side to side head movement all in all mike in his prime had the whole package he was definitely up their with the most powerful punchers of all time and because of his speed and accuracy also not to mention combinations never seen even in the 's fighters that would break a grown man into a child mike may have not had the heart of joe but what he did have in general skill joe was just a philly brawler who didn't take no for an answer just like any philly boxer who comes onto the scene notice how rapid joe bobs his head up and down now with an upper cut specialist like mike what do you think would happen rooney would notice it and tell mike to utilize joe's mistake with an upper cut damn i would have loved to seen a super fight between them both i don't see joe winning this fight but i also don't see mike taking joe out that easily it will either be a decision on the behalf of mike or he knocks joe out late i would want to know how joe would take a quick jab body shot upper cut from mike's book of unique combinations i know for a fact that joe has never in his whole career been hit with one of those naturally for two small heavyweights mike was the more complete boxer but like i mentioned before he lacked the heart and determination to have a steady long career like joe besides that with the way joe displays his hands when in defense he will for sure be eating a brutal body shot that will leave him peeing blood in the end mike had devastating power and his body shots even sounded like a bat being put to the body of a human joe had a flurry of body shots but where half the power of what mike delivered in his you have to think about this big e mike was a complete fighter but he lacked the will to survive because he had accomplished everything he wanted and was destined to become after the spinks knockout was when mike was totally done mentally and you can tell he wanted to retire according to rooney he wanted mike to have about more fights over seas and then come back to have a super fight against holyfield which he would then retire with an undefeated record and better than marciano's believe me that was the plan and he would have destroyed holyfield had he stayed with the program rooney knew what he was doing and he knew mike would beat holyfield mike's head wasn't in the game anymore after that if you are talking about a prime time before douglas still with rooney mike tyson then there is no way smoking joe could have beaten mike had mike fought with the 's fighters in his prime he would have done allot better than most give him credit for if you think about it how could you doubt a boxer like mike who displayed skill never seen before in that division how even ali gave the man respect because even ali had never seen such skill out of a small fighter until mike came along you think ali was worried about a frazier lol i don't think so frazier was bad ass don't get me wrong but he would have been beaten by mike hands down in their primes mike is the more complete fighter who had a solid chin and was more powerful than frazier and he had better combinations he was more accurate and he knew how to fight and bring the fight imagine two fighters like joe and mike who both like to come forward they would square off in the middle of the ring and start slugging and lol i just don't see joe winning that brawl basically what tools does frazier have that mike doesn't already have but better what can frazier beat mike with if frazier could withstand a brutal beating reminisce of the foreman frazier fight he could stand a chance but i just don't see it happening like that mike by late ko or decision don't think for one second that i hate smoking joe because he is one of my favs of all time still no matter mike is the more complete fighter Joe Louis The Rumble in the Jungle Michael Moorer Pittsburgh Steelers Tenshinhan Roy Jones Jr.
