mayorga vs vargas i know this fight will not be bought by a lot of people but i think it will be showed on showtime for free also but my question is that do you think that with both fighters hating each other with a passion will it be a slugfest or a yawner i personally think that all the drama that has happened is not pre fight build up i think this is real antamosity like frazier hating ali before the first fight in vargas hates mayorga and vice versa any thoughts this is going to be a tremendous fight the styles of these two men suggest that it can't be anything else even when vargas uses his boxing skills he still isn't a runner or someone who's fleet footed enough to stay on the outside and jab he likes to use his jab slip and counter and move you into position when he's boxing but vargas is to proud to box a fighter like mayorga he wants to put hurt on him and mayorga hate him or love him always comes to fight this will be a hagler hearns type fight as long as it lasts look for both men to land some early bombs in a wild slugfest before vargas stops mayorga in i think the hatred between these two is about as legit as they come and that's why it will be a great fight a lot of pride is on the line for both fighters F__lix Trinidad Ricardo Mayorga Sugar Ray Leonard Joe Frazier Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns YuYu Hakusho Joe Louis Carnival of Champions Caesars Palace John Mugabi Professional wrestling holds Winky Wright Michael Watson The Rumble in the Jungle Kylie Minogue Mike Tyson Mixed martial arts George Foreman F-16 Fighting Falcon EastEnders Ranma __ characters Hate speech Fight Club Jack Johnson (boxer) Mobile Fighter G Gundam Alcoholics Anonymous Kimi Finster Knots Landing Professional wrestling slang Martial art Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tenshinhan Antonio Inoki Nigel Benn Home Box Office HBO Boxing Battle of Britain The Contender (television series) Laila Ali Wilfred Benitez October 2004 in sports Chris Eubank Days of our Lives Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Fatal Fury Nation of Islam Nine Inch Nails Thrilla in Manila Have I Got News For You Fictional crossover Whose Line Is It Anyway?
