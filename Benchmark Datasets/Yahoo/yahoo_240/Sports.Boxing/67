boxer training what do boxers do to increase thier stamina to be able to fight for longer periods of time oh and i will choose best answer i am a boxer out of ny city and have found it takes a lot of time and tons of hard boring work lots of running and lots of rounds in the gym is really the basics your body basically needs to be able to recover after putting in hard work ali once said no one can fight full speed every round so you train your body to go hard for a few rounds and then let it rest a little more other rounds swimming is very good too another reason a lot of new fighters get tired quickly is because they do not control their heart rate and breathing if you dont control yourself and stay calm you breath harder therefore burning more energy sometimes believe it or not newer fighters forget to breath Boxing Swimming The Contender (television series) Muhammad Ali Unreal Weight training The Rumble in the Jungle Internal ballistics Sugar Ray Robinson Vegeta Roy Jones Jr. Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Fighting Spirit Drowning Mike Tyson Breaststroke Piccolo Junior Saga M16 (rifle) Boxing training Fast bowling Frogman Equine conformation Michael Watson Suicide methods Mobile Fighter G Gundam Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Tag Dog agility Jack Johnson (boxer) Joe Frazier Alexander Technique Heinkel He 112 Diving Front crawl Kitesurfing Beau Jack Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carbon dioxide Tenshinhan Backstroke Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Jack Dempsey Hard disk Floyd Patterson Fire fighting Butterfly stroke Qigong Zero (Mega Man) Little Britain Martial art Monster Rancher monsters Social rule Guilty Gear Rebreather Apollo 8 Steel Marathon (sport) Joe Louis Brewery Leon Spinks Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Car handling Emergency Medical Services Exercise Heart rate Bubble Bobble Archie Moore 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sonic the Hedgehog The Sims 2: University George Foreman Redundant array of independent disks Urinary incontinence Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Rocky IV Muay Thai EastEnders Aikido Firefighter Naseem Hamed Shen Gong Wu Pump It Up Dragons (Pern) RuneScape weapons Charizard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sonny Liston Diablo II V__ctor Gal__ndez Michael Moorer Gameplay of StarCraft Juan Martin Coggi Jet engine Professional wrestling throws Action potential Terminal ballistics MAME
