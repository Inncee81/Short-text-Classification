the ending of the remake of planet of the apes please explain after waisting precious hours of my life watching the remake of planet of the apes i am completely puzzled about the ending the original was absolutely brilliant with one of the best endings ever seen in a movie but this remake was just an action movie with great costumes and the worst ending one could possibly think up why is there a bunch of monkeys on earth when he gets back to earth if he is back on earth maybe he is on a different planet that looks like earth but why does this planet have the monument of george washington looking like an ape did he cause a distortion of the space time continuum and it warped earth hope that someone can clarify the ending and put me out of my bewilderment thanks o he didn't go to another planet he just went to an alternate future and then went to that planet's past so he went to an past with all of the things of earth except the human like abraham lincoln as show are apes dumb ending though what a ripoff of the old movie almost as bad as the sequels of the original Planet of the Apes (1968 film) Science fiction film Escape from the Planet of the Apes Time travel Planet of the Apes Planet of the Apes (2001 film) Beneath the Planet of the Apes Chrono Trigger Conquest of the Planet of the Apes Retcon Star Trek: The Motion Picture 3rd Rock from the Sun Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction Doctor (Doctor Who) 2001: A Space Odyssey Futurama (TV series - season 5) Lavos Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sequel Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Taylor (Planet of the Apes) Space Quest Supergirl Bob and George Ecco the Dolphin Incarnations of Immortality StarCraft Episode VI Planet of the Apes (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Ferengi Spaceballs Unicron Vegeta Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) The End of the World (Doctor Who) Shockwave (Transformers) MAD Magazine The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Invader Zim The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Earth (Noon Universe) Star Wars Solar eclipse The Star Wars Holiday Special Philip J.
