in bourne ultimatum did it bother anyone how much they shook the camera i really liked the bourne movies but it seemed like they really shook the camera a lot in the third one there were so many times i wished they would just hold the camera still so i could see what was going on i know they do it to make the scene feel more intense but it really bugged me in this movie other than that it was a great movie did the camera shaking bother anyone else i thought it was a great movie too but i agree that the camera work was shaky however a lot of filmmakers nowdays are using more hand held shots instead of mounting cameras on a dolly steadi or glidecam i had a little bit of a headache by the end of the movie but it was so good i thought it was definitely worth it Steadicam Filmmaking Cinematography The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Documentary film Matt Damon Binoculars Forced perspective Film director Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Film The Daleks' Master Plan IMAX James Wong Howe Martin Scorsese Tracking shot Das Boot Back to the Future Amateur astronomy Kill Bill Quentin Tarantino The Ashlee Simpson Show Independent film Dolly zoom The Truman Show About a Boy The Bourne Identity (film) Camera Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Bullet time Stanley Kubrick Death Race 2000 All Aussie Adventures Columbine High School massacre Grip (job) Avenue Q Computer animation The Great Train Robbery (1903 film) Reservoir Dogs Rent (musical) Innerspace 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
