disturbia or the hills have eyes disturbia that was the only scary suspenseful movie where the main character wasn't a stereotypically dumb person shia did fall a couple of times but he jumped back up he didn't yell like a maniac in every scene overall this movie was great in the other movies the main character usually falls and starts crawling they usually don't put up a fight lame Tag Jackass: The Movie Knots Landing Soap opera The Strangerhood Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Villain Yu-Gi-Oh!
