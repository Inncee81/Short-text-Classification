how to drain your garden my garden floods at the bottom having waited for a decent day i have dug a couple of feet down and all i am hitting is clay i have now hit a solid clay base and presume the water is not draining for this reason how can i drain my garden if you've dug that deep and the hole isn't full of water you don't need to but if your garden floods for a short time during rain then it's probably because the soil has become to compact over the years if so hire a rotavater and turn your soil Drainage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nile Hydroponics Soil pH Soil Dam Irrigation Opportunity rover The Fens Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Lateral thinking Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Deluge (mythology) Houseplant Desert Zuiderzee Works Oak Island Canal lock Hardpan Seismic retrofit Masonry Anchor Caving Naval mine Drill bit Bong Derbyshire lead mining history Lake A151 road USS Tunny (SS-282) Cannabis cultivation Biodynamic agriculture Grand Teton National Park Geography of India USS Tang (SS-306) Muhammad Ali Tillage Pavement (material) USS Trigger (SS-237) Road Thames Tunnel 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Water (molecule) Johnstown Flood Quicksand Erosion Rain Air-raid shelter Pottery Naruto jutsu Caliche Erie Canal Haarlemmermeer Stream Mississippi River Jars of Clay Glacier American Bottom 2005 Maharashtra floods Dry cleaning Combine (Half-Life 2) New Orleans, Louisiana Great Flood of 1993 Holes (book) GunBound Tennis Lake Nyos Nuclear fallout Hurricane Katrina effects by region Trench warfare Florida Keys Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Rathfarnham Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Golf Sleeping Murder Origin belief Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Ra (board game) Kibbutz Peat Lawn Thermal power station Mount Pinatubo Bonsai Tunnel Vampire Poker jargon Solar cell Winkler, Manitoba Comfrey Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Dairy Flood Climate of the United Kingdom Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans
