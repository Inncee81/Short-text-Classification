poison ivy vines as thick as my wrist i'm buying a home that has been vacant all summer the poison ivy has overtaken the trees as an example one medium sized tree has a vine of poison ivy as big as my wrist about feet off the ground branches reach out from the vine about feet each trying to reach sunshine the individual leaves are bigger than my hand the ivy provides much of the shade in the yard although i don't know for sure if i'm allergic i am certain that my teenage children are based on their summer camp experiences how do i kill the plants how do i remove the vines from the trees some quite high how do i dispose of it i know not to burn it i do know that the kids can't get exposed from my rash if i get one but only from direct contact with the oils on clothing on surfaces from the plants roots sap i'm pretty certain that i can remove and discard clothing and then use dish soap in the shower to remove the oil from myself other hints we visited a park that had the exact same thing i was amazed by the size of the vine and leaves cutting down the vines does not mean you killed the plant the plant will still grow again wait till winter if in a winter zone then take a hand saw and cut the vines close to the ground careful to avoid contact with the dust and shavings thus do not use a chainsaw unless thoroughly protected in either case go inside and shower afterwards to was off any stray oil and also wash your clothes the oil can last on clothes for days and rub off on anything and sill infect you let the vines sit for a half year or so till the vines dry out then you can either pull them down or leave them to rot because they will be harmless after they dry out for a long time do not cut live ivy in winter and pull it down thinking it cannot hurt you because it is dormant i have gotten poison ivy bad in the beginning of february from dormant ivy plants because the sap is as potent as the oil on the leaves in the spring use total brush killer to individually kill any new shoots that come up you will have to be persistent with the new shoots because the only way to kill the whole plant is to keep killing the new shoots eventually the underground root system will die i use a combination method of brush killing the new shoots individually then also spraying the whole area with a general weed killer double whammy that seems to work better persistence is the key to killing poison ivy no need to discard clothing but just throw into the wash after carfully removing it only brush killer will kill poison ivy if in doubt check the lable to see if poison ivy is in the list of weeds killed i still think brush killer works the best Weed control Textile manufacturing Toxicodendron Hemp Gypsy moth Mango Poison-ivy Fire fighting Poison Ivy (comics) Kudzu Tick Upholstery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wood Sewage treatment Bamboo Poker jargon Sugar beet Ivy Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Carnivorous plant Wildfire Thermal power station Glossary of wildland fire terms Car washing techniques Leaf Fruit tree propagation Trench warfare Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Olive Comfrey Bonsai Aloe Atlanta metropolitan area Pottery Nuclear fallout Tattoo RuneScape skills Flax Foodborne illness Professional wrestling throws Tobacco Renewable energy Ginkgo Internal ballistics The Amber Spyglass Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dairy Comanche Volleyball Archery Flowering plant Common cold One Tree Hill (TV series) Irrigation Coconut Deforestation Jute Maize Soap Mountain Gorilla Hay fever Solar power Casting Vine Blood (computer game) The Marshall Mathers LP Baseball Root Aerial (dance move) Glossary of American football Cruising (maritime) Halitosis Aphid Weed Customs and etiquette of Japan Swimming Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Joker (comics) Illegal drug trade Towel Menstrual cup Dinosaur Pruning fruit trees Social rule RuneScape quests Sento Black pepper Tillage
