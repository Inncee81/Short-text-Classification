my hostas didn't flower this year what can i do to insure flowers next year the leaves look perfectly healthy and the plants filled out beautifully but no flower spikes and all the others in my neighbors yards are flowering nicely they are planted on the south side of my house along a fence so they are mostly shaded but some dappled sunlight a few are in more sun but they didn't flower either hm my hosta in semi shade do just fine for flowers though they usually take a few years after planting to flower well if these are mature clumps my guess is that they might need some food try giving them a food that's got a higher middle number next spring like or any multiple of that etc you can find organic fertilizers with these numbers and in my experience these work better because many of them also have trace elements and they are less likely to burn the numbers stand for the amounts of nitrogen potassium phosphorus in the fertilizer the middle number the potassium is needed by the plant for flower formation the nitrogen first number gives you lots of leaf growth and the third is generally for roots Nutrient Carnivorous plant Plant Flowering plant Houseplant Fertilizer Comfrey Hosta Green Revolution Wisteria Gypsy moth Eutrophication Sorghum Ecology Bacteria Pansy Alfalfa Flower Orchidaceae Sewage treatment Cyanide Ammonia Solar power Potassium Hippeastrum Nitrogen Agriculture Auxin Phosphorus Earthworm Bamboo Black pepper Fruit Moon Cannabis cultivation European Beech Gooseberry Creeping Charlie Leaf Bonsai Space habitat Coffee Pinophyta Organic farming Sulfur Physiological plant disorders Carbon dioxide Acorn Amaranth Wheat Elm Garden Strawberry Nutrition Organic food Biogeochemical cycle Phosphate Venus Flytrap Species Banksia Peanut Environmental concerns with electricity generation Vermicompost Soybean Photosynthesis Action potential Japanese tea ceremony Fish farming Agronomy Sunflower Cycad Sage Pysanka Sustainable agriculture Dietary mineral Hemp Tobacco Autonomous building Vegetation Weed control Iron Alder Hydroponics Energy development Clover Alcohol fuel Soil life Prosopis cineraria Desertification Future energy development Cauliflower Hop (plant) Tea Brewery Coast Douglas-fir Acid
