crabgrass invading my vast lawn i live on a hill of acres of land and i've taken great care to my lawn b c i did all the landscaping and planted grass seeds and all years ago but on the left side of our lawn is still a wild grown lot with many wild flowers and grasses and we think that they're blowing over and growing on our land we've gotten our grass sprayed many times for weeds and fertilized too but thier is still tons of wild grasses over flowing in many places which have been previously flawless my husband thinks that you need to pull the rest by hand and i really need another solution please help for such a large area it must be fun to cultivate a healty lawn how high do you cut your lawn you can purchase a spray type of weed killer specific to kill crab grass this stuff is design to be sprayed on the leaves of the plant and will help kill it in a few days this is a decent short term solution as it will not prevent crab grass pulling them is better but maybe your area is too large the real long term solution is to make sure you cut the grass high inches allthough this seems kind of high it is the suggested cool season grass height this may be partly why the grass has not previously been able keep the crab grass out your lawn must be high enough to crowd out invaders and next year in spring before you are even thinking about crab grass use a preemergent killer spread that is specific to crab grass this is critical many weed killers do not work very well on crab grass the proper lawn height and a preemergent will vastly reduce your crab grass woes Weed Agriculture Digitaria Hemp Herbicide Illegal drug trade Irrigation Lawn mower Maize Sugar beet Apple Deforestation Creeping Charlie Sorghum Flax Alfalfa Cannabis (drug) Bamboo Wheat Palouse Shifting cultivation Flowering plant Wildfire Peanut Chatsworth House Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Pollination Invasive species Pansy Poaceae Pollinator decline Turnip (brassica rapa) Tobacco Vegetation Tillage Anchor Jute Cortaderia selloana Gardening Fire fighting The Championships, Wimbledon Hay Elis Prefecture Coconut crab Fruit tree propagation Agricultural machinery Naruto geography Cannabis Professional wrestling holds Potato Minor Harry Potter Beasts Rapeseed Island restoration Ragweed Gypsy moth Malus Textile manufacturing Pachypodium bicolor Zuiderzee Works Carnivorous plant Chair Flower Geography of Brazil Comfrey Knots Landing Kudzu Amazon River The Ashlee Simpson Show History of aerial topdressing in New Zealand Urban sprawl Fish farming Pachypodium ambongense Renewable energy Elephant Drill bit Leaf Desert Garden Organic farming Famine Garlic Xeriscaping Yosemite National Park Desertification Air conditioning Auxin Dandelion Jet engine Combine harvester
