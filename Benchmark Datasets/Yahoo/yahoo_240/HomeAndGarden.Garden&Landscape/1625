rose of sharon beeltes japanese beetles are eating the leaves and flowers i have tried the dish soap and water spray and sevin bug killer i just can't get rid of them any ideas your attempts to control the japanese beetles with a contact insecticide are not the best route to go here the exoskeleton of this pest is strong and impermeable you need to attack them from the inside out this means using a systemic insecticide one that will enter the foliage of the host plant and kill them from the inside go to walmart or home depot and purchase a product called orthene made by ortho it's one of the best systemic insecticides on the market and will take care of the beetles it is a stinky product however smells like sulfur or rotten eggs but will work well for you follow the application directions for spraying on the foliage it will be absorbed by the plant and stay readily available in the cell structure for to weeks hope this answers your question good luck http www epinions com hmgd lawn and garden pest control all ortho orthene systemic insect control http www epinions com hmgd review e e f d prod added info for the answerer below ortho still makes products with orthene besides fire ant killer infact the product you call systemic insect killer is in fact orthene orthene is the trade name and the common name is acephate the systemic you mention contains acephate which is the killing ingredient that destroys the nervous system of insects the same ingredient found in orthene ortho just changed the name to comply with epa labeling standards you still can buy orthene where i'm from however billy ray Insect Beetle Carnivorous plant Gypsy moth Pesticide toxicity to bees Diseases of the honeybee Insecticide Pesticide Ant Mosquito Agriculture Organic farming DDT Pollinator decline Gaucho (insecticide) Hop (plant) Houseplant Exoskeleton Sulfur Hydrochloric acid Herbicide Rapeseed Bedbug Hydrogen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Malaria Food Hedgehog Sulfuric acid Ladybird Egg (food) EastEnders Cochineal Tobacco Weed control Oplan Bojinka Mercury (element) Invasive species in Australia Spider Aphid Diazinon Wal-Mart Hamburger Sharon Tate Anopheles Solar power Coriander Regent (insecticide) Red imported fire ant Food irradiation Desert locust Kosher foods 9/11 conspiracy theories Customs and etiquette of Japan Biodiesel Xenomorph Japanese tea ceremony Air pollution Mantodea Leaf Doctor Eggman Rei Ayanami Flowering plant 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Organic food Nicotine Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Soap Pest control Poker jargon Taro Honeybee Flower Morrowind (province) Ammonia Coconut crab Animal Crossing Biology Volkswagen Beetle Roswell UFO incident Fire fighting Durian Veganism Autonomous building Illegal drug trade Asian tiger mosquito Spruce Budworm Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs
