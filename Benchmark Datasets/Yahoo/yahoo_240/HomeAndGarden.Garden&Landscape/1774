i need to know why my pumpkin leafs are getting all white on top of them what can ii do about it i also dont see any female flowers on my plant what will happen now and my leaves from the main plant are turning brown i never had so much trouble growing things before this i dont think these pumpkins like me this could be powdery mildew caused by a fungus looks like a white powdery growth on leaves and stems infected parts are stunted distorted and leaves may drop from the plant after turning yellow then brown powdery mildew may interfere with proper ripening yield the disease is prevelant in humid weather with frequent dew and temperatures between and degree here's a picture info http vegetablemdonline ppath cornell edu factsheets cucurbits pm htm mix part milk to parts water spray scientific anecdotal evidence http www gardenguides com pests tips powderymildew asp wagner bettiol a scientist from brazil found that weekly sprays of milk controlled powdery mildew in zucchini just as effectively as synthetic fungicides such as fenarimol or benomyl not only was milk found to be effective at controlling the disease it also acted as a foliar fertilizer boosting the plant's immune system in his experiments with zucchini plants bettiol found that a weekly spray of milk at a concentration of at least part milk to parts water significantly reduced the severity of powdery mildew infection on the plants by don't go overboard however once concentrations rose above an innoccuous fungus began to grow on the plants it seems that milk is a natural germicide in addition it contains several naturally occurring salts and amino acids that are taken up by the plant from previous experiments using sodium bicarbonate potassium phosphate and other salts researchers have found that the disease is sensitive to these salts it is possible then that milk boosts the plant's immune system to prevent the disease melon growers in new zealand are saving thousands of dollars every year by spraying their crops with milk instead of synthetic fungicides the melon growers in new zealand have been so successful that the wine industry is taking notice and beginning experiments using milk to control powdery mildew in grapes for the past years peter crisp of the university of adelaide australia has been spraying ordinary milk diluted with water to a percent solution on grape vines at two commercial vineyards he finds that in most cases milk performs as well as the leading nonorganic powdery mildew fighters sulfur and a synthetic chemical known as topas he also has achieved about the same success with diluted sprays of liquid whey a waste byproduct of cheese production though more expensive than sulfur milk and whey sprays cost less than synthetic fungicides they're part of a battery of new agents that may permit organic vintners to continue exporting their wines into european and u s markets paul james master gardener and host of gardening by the yard says he has successfully used milk to get rid of mildew just as his grandfather had done yrs ago he mixed cup of milk with cups of water take an infected leaf to your agricultural extension office for positive identification since you didn't say if it was a powdery white substance or a mold i assumed it was powdery mildew which doesn't kill the plants if you said your plants were dying had a white mold then it would be fusarium wilt get rid of infected leaves improve air circulation around the plants i elevate my plants so they dry faster by putting stones small rocks under them water early enough so there's not too much moisture around plants at night don't water overhead on the leaves the female flowers come when it gets cooler good luck hope this was helpful Apple Tomato Organic farming Nutrition Sewage treatment Organic food Ammonia Soil pH Gypsy moth Cheese Illegal drug trade Sugar Peanut Herbicide Garden Strawberry Hydrochloric acid Wine Plastic Carnivorous plant Psoriasis DDT Fish farming Cocaine Fire extinguisher Fertilizer Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Malaria Cannabis (drug) Agriculture in Australia Food Pesticide Pansy Plant breeding Explosive material Cannabis cultivation Tea Vitamin C Water (molecule) Photosynthesis Water purification Nuclear power Tobacco Hamster Jute Global warming and agriculture Coal Urinary incontinence Hemp Sugar beet Ozone depletion Comfrey Global warming Diseases of the honeybee Hydroponics Methamphetamine Insulin Sugarcane Biological pest control Irrigation Rice Growth hormone treatment Herpes simplex virus Veganism Livestock Breastfeeding Tofu Fire fighting Vermicompost Disinfection Weed control Monsanto Sorghum Solar power Bacteria Factory farming Ozone hole Battery (electricity) Myxobolus cerebralis Agricultural wastewater treatment Mosquito Hydrogen peroxide Acne Food preservation
