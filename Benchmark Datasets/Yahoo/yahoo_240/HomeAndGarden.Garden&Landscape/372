planting cistena plum i am starting with a clean slate in back of my house west side i purchased a cistena plum and am wondering how far to place it from the house also any ideas on what else to plant can i plant something besides flowers in back of the cistena plum that would not take too much maintenance any ideas would be appreciated oh yes i also purchased azalea plants thanks you should probably give it at least feet of clearance on all sides in anticipation of the tree when it is mature nice choice on the azaleas they only require partial sun so they should do alright on the west side of your house a little shade after high noon will not hurt them keep in mind that azaleas thrive in acidic soil Bonsai Rhododendron Prunus Carnivorous plant Peach Apple Honey Chatsworth House Plum Fruit tree propagation Simone Weil Bamboo Florida Keys Fruit Logging Tomato Flowering plant Plant Growing degree day Tree Black pepper Heath (habitat) Cannabis cultivation Solar power Professional wrestling holds Houseplant Wisteria Mango Pruning fruit trees Apricot Ume Rambutan Cherry plum Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bus models used in New York City Transit Dundas Square RuneScape Random Events Philipp Franz von Siebold Energy development Gypsy moth Peony Allegheny National Forest Acorn Hamster Upholstery W.
