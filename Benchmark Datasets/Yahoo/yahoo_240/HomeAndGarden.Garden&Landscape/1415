why are my squash alot lighter on the underside is this bad should i put newspaper under them to get em off the ground thanks squash or melons are always white or lighter on the side they are laying on you can try to fluff some hay under it to protect it keep in mind that when that light spot turns a yellowish hue that is an indicator of ripeness and it should be ready to pick there is also a lack of sunlight on the under side Coast Douglas-fir Tet Offensive Anchor Tank Mattress Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Cloud Light-emitting diode Mulch Skateboarding trick Human skin color Squash (sport) Tofu Professional wrestling slang Campfire Equine conformation Fanta Weather lore Diamond Bitter melon Hemp Pinophyta Dolphin Horse Lighting Extraterrestrial skies Anti-aircraft warfare Colonization of the Moon 1957 World Series Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 USS Yorktown (CV-5) Leaf The Legend of Zelda series enemies Professional wrestling attacks Aerial (dance move) Tiger Textile manufacturing Mango Color theory Skateboard USS Wasp (CV-18) Yellow Zippo Drag racing Tobacco Traffic light Moon Capercaillie Norway national football team Badminton Lewis Gun Combine (Half-Life 2) Chaos Emerald Paintball Automotive lighting Turquoise P-38 Lightning Tyranid STS-60 Melanin Beetle Star Destroyer HSV color space Sunglasses Solar power satellite Pumpkin Cryptanalysis of the Enigma Battlefield 2 Personal rapid transit Mark Calaway Ammunition Seismic retrofit F-14 Tomcat Garden Strawberry Troy Hurtubise Armoured warfare M16 (rifle) Jewish cuisine Incandescent light bulb Albedo Vampire USS Alaska (CB-1) Genesis (band) Cigar Conker's Bad Fur Day Atari 8-bit family Dominoes Apollo 8 Punt (boat) Battle of Waterloo Infantry Domesticated turkey Anti-tank Date Palm Farthing (coin) Cannabis cultivation Non-native pronunciations of English Wood Acorn Papaya
