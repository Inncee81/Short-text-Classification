is patch perfect best for lawn patches i have several thin and bare spots in my lawn probably from under fertilizing been in house years and haven't done yet i'm in jackson ms and have st augustine i was considering patch perfect but i wanted to know what was best to use or do thanks for your input i think it is expensive for what you get and considering you can get grass patch at the hardware for less than half the price expensive i have st augustine grass and the only way to patch it is with plugs of the same grass that you buy at the hardware store if you don't mind having different blades you can get a patch kit by scotts or vigoro at the hardware with the fertilizer built in and the protective matter included once you patch using this method you will notice that st augustine is largely self healing and will start to grow into the areas you patched over time Lawn Lawn mower Atari 8-bit family Hard disk Sears Holdings Corporation Poaceae Commodore 64 Autonomous building Xbox 360 IPod Copy protection Digital rights management Alcohol fuel MAME PlayStation 2 Guinea pig Microeconomics Renewable energy Patch (computing) Logging Organic food Sun Microsystems Dolly Parton Agriculture Advanced Squad Leader Windows 2000 Sprite (computer graphics) Tennis Sod Synthesizer Nintendo 64 Model aircraft Linux on zSeries Radio controlled airplane NX bit PlayStation 3 X Window System PaX TurboGrafx 16 Gravis Ultrasound Supply and demand Hydrogen economy Urban sprawl Protoss CPU design Tick Computer virus Punch card McMansion Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tobacco Irrigation Sega Dreamcast Computer hardware Grand Teton National Park Video game crash of 1983 Electrophysiology Diablo II: Lord of Destruction NeXT PC Engine Buffer overflow Hay Deforestation Weed Green Revolution Illegal drug trade Anchor Xbox Mach kernel Dhahran Weed control Elis Prefecture Fertility awareness History of Microsoft Windows Scale model Overclocking Gas metal arc welding Zerg NVIDIA Seed Bullet Clothing BASIC programming language Microprogram Carnivorous plant Theodicy Tire Hamster Jack plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows XP Welding History of Florida Charles Goodyear Nintendo DS Desertification Thar Desert Modchip Atari 2600
