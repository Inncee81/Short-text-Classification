how to keep raccoons away we're building a koi fish pond and we're worried that raccoons will come and eat them any advice on what to do to keep raccoons away from our house we have a pet doberman by the way when we first built our pond we had a lot of problems with raccoons we had built it using the traditionally recommended design of stepped sides for planting ledges etc well all that did was provide a place for the raccoons to stand while they helped themselves to what they apparently thought was a free all you can eat buffet that was years ago and we haven't had any raccoon problems since the second year because a we started trapping them and b we changed the configuration of our pond raccoons are not an indigenous species in my area and they displace many native species by out competing them plus they are one of the top carriers of rabies and they also carry other diseases that they are immune to but which in some instances can prove to be harmful or even fatal to humans so it is illegal in my area to keep them as pets or to let them go once you have trapped one we got a have a hart live trap and staked it down in the yard near the pond they are quite adept at flipping a trap over thus it is helpful to stake it down after we would catch one we would call our local animal control office and they would send someone over to euthanize the raccoon and dispose of it it is a free service in my area since the raccoons are considered to be a nuisance animal we caught six in one month and apparently word got out in the raccoon community because they stopped coming around if you decide to go this method do not use tinned catfood as bait this tends to attract skunks instead as we learned to our sorrow we had better luck using a piece of stale bread spread with peanut butter and molasses also do not try to handle the raccoon at all due to said disease carrying propensity and be sure to wash disinfect the trap with a bleach solution before using for anything else finally if you are fussy about your lawn do not put the trap on the grass because the trapped raccoon will tear up whatever is under the trap in its efforts to escape we staked ours in a rocky area near their established path and found that we had to reposition it often because they would get smart to it in one spot and start avoiding it the other thing we did is enlarge our pond from approximately gallons to over we made a big side that is about feet deep at it's deepest and made it with straight steep rather than stepped sides we then connected the new big part of the pond to the old small part of the pond so the fish have a deep space in the center of the big side that is away from the walls etc that they can escape to if they feel threatened it is too deep for herons etc to land in and too far away from the sides for a raccoon to be able to fish for them from the banks and there is no graduated slope that would allow anything to wade in we still put plants in the pond but instead of putting them on any planting ledges around the edge we put them on stands wherever we like i have used upside down milk crates upside down containers such as rubbermaid and even gallon nursery pots with holes drilled in them to allow the water to flow through as well as powder coated metal plant stands i like the containers the best as i can make them in any size i like the black nursery pots become almost invisible underwater and lily pads quickly grow to camouflage the edges etc as i said we have not had any fish losses due to predation in the last years knock on wood i hope
