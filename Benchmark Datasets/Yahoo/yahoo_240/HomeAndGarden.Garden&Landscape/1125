growing shrooms i have this big dome thing to grow mushrooms from spores now they give me some pint and pint sterile jars with stuff in them i just add some syringe and they grow but does anyone know how many dry grams of mushrooms one pint and one pint jar will produce if fully grown including additional flushes my cubies averaged about g per pint it will depend a lot on how much rice was used in the jars if a high percentage of rice was used like mine contamination is a problem a lot of these companies cut back on the rice so you aren't disappointed they're less concerned with your yield rscott Illegal drug trade Psychedelic mushroom Milk Psilocybe cubensis Psilocybin Mushroom Cooking weights and measures Champagne (beverage) Foodborne illness Mushroom hunting Cannabis cultivation Tampon Agriculture Rice Alcohol fuel Sterilization (microbiology) Sake Spore Agar plate Food preservation Tofu Fungus Shrimp farm U.S. customary units Nuclear power Bread Intravenous therapy Bacteria Genetically modified food Hamster Risotto Waste management Mario Party Advance Cuisine of Laos Nuclear explosion Economy of Japan Cuisine of Brazil Tattoo Equine conformation Miso Bacon Grade (education) Food W.
