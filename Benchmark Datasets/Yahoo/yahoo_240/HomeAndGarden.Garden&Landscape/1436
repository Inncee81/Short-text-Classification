opinion from a landscaper or garden extraordinaire i have an area 'x ' running along the side of my garage the previous homeowner did nothing but make the gravel in it look pretty i tried planting some shrubs and alberta dward spruces but then read online that it takes forever for them to grow and they are ' tall now so with that being said i wanted to know a reasonable amount to pay a landscaper to come out dig up the gravel put stone edging around and fill it with dirt i'll plant the shrubs myself when it gets cooler here any help would be nice i feel stupid calling around to our local landscaping companies that is a lot of work but i'll just bet if you live in the right neighborhood with kids there will be some teenage boys wanting to earn money only give a set price if it's a lot of stones set a price accordingly don't pay by the hour because they could take hrs a day for a week they are usually so slow pay what is fair according to the work Craps Poker jargon Swiss plateau Insurance Gambling Tag Desert Gravel Sports betting EastEnders PE ratio Autonomous building The Apprentice 2 Supply and demand Japanese garden Betting (poker) Microeconomics Grand Theft Auto (game) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sampling (music) Bungalow Monopoly (game) Blackjack Animal Crossing Theory of conduct Gardening Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina New Urbanism Bond The Amazing Race Beverly Hills, California Big Brother UK series 6 Bonsai McMansion MMORPG Internet fraud Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sydney Riot of 1879 King Khalid International Airport Lawn Zoning Shrub Illegal drug trade Hydroponics Tree Infidels Blood on the Tracks Boise, Idaho The Brady Bunch Wheel of Fortune Inflation History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Milwaukee, Wisconsin Vince McMahon Derivative (finance) Textile manufacturing Time Out of Mind Highway 61 Revisited South Park Unemployment benefit 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Wal-Mart Property tax The Catcher in the Rye Education in the United States Sento The Chemical Brothers Carlsbad, California Twin City Rapid Transit History of Test cricket (to 1883) Baccarat Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Paul Is Dead Broom (shrub) Bryce Canyon National Park Xeriscaping Kibbutz 613 mitzvot Tyrannosaurus rex Humphrey Bogart FairTax Warren Buffett U2 (band) Mid-levels Satchel Paige Arianne Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February $ale of the Century Grand Teton National Park Jon Secada Jeopardy!
