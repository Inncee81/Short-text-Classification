very low maintenance annuals i am looking for a low maint annual that doesn't require watering on a daily basis the flowers are going in cement urns at the graveyard where my boyfriend is buried his favorite color was purple and i found a lily but it is has to be watered everyday and i can't get up there everyday i have a three month old son and i am lucky if i get there twice a week i would like something pretty for him any ideas something like petunias or impatiens would probably work but your worst enemyis the fact that they will be growing in a cement container the container means more water will be needed to compensate for the wind and exposure for all sides to weather especially dry air this will require more water then since the cotnainer is made from cement it will take in water more tha plastic or other type of container if you can water it twice weekly then you may be able to provide just enough water to keep them going if all else fails you could use some artifical flowers which would ensure low maintenance nowadays there are some pretty realistic flowers out there good luck Carnivorous plant Fire extinguisher Irrigation Portland cement Nuclear power Plastic Flower Light-emitting diode Houseplant Energy development Concrete Hemp Art Stereoscopy Climate of the United Kingdom National Weather Service EastEnders Extreme Programming Gliding Horseshoe United States Air Force Upholstery Tokusatsu Scuba set Tofu Wind turbine Dam Carbon dioxide Panama Canal Desert Hay Jennifer Lopez Hydrogen economy Theory of conduct Leather Numerology Anchor Solar power Seismic retrofit Hippeastrum Cremation Diving regulator Radio controlled airplane Kylie Minogue E85 Xeriscaping Pebble bed reactor Atmospheric circulation Wood Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydroponics Cruising (maritime) Masonry Floristry San Jose, California GLOCK Burial at sea Pikmin Transformer Human skin color Asbestos Herpes simplex virus Cannabis cultivation Geodesic dome Wind power Sex and the City Rail tracks Mattress Textile manufacturing Sewage treatment Diving suit Solar cell 24 Hours of Le Mans Fixed-wing aircraft Drill bit Alena Tank Chernobyl accident Dundas Square Alcohol fuel Terri Schiavo Garlic Campfire Basil Psoriasis Funeral Jute Laserdisc Microeconomics Flood geology Barometer Poker jargon Avalanche Building material Strap-on dildo Opportunity rover Urusei Yatsura Yu-Gi-Oh!
