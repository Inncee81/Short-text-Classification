why is my indoor fern burnt on the ends it's an indoor plant it is in my bathroom and has a sky light above it so it gets a reasonable amount of light recently the ends have gone brown and crunchy i'm really upset about it because everyone used to think it was a fake plant because it looked so perfect the chances are good that your fern is in an area that is too dry despite being in a bathroom it may need another source of humidity i would suggest using a clear plant saucer full of pea gravel over the gravel pour enough water to come almost to the top of the gravel then set the plant on top of the gravel as the water evaporates it will create more humidity in the general vicinity of the fern good luck Houseplant Basement Humidity Carnivorous plant Flood geology Coffee Renewable energy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Air pollution Aquifer Cannabis cultivation Air conditioning Lake Relative humidity Bonsai Leaf Sugar Wildfire Hydroponics Thermal power station Hamster Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin 2003 UB313 Comet Sauna Fern Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Carbon dioxide Cleveland Browns Pachypodium habitats Geology of the Grand Canyon area Water vapor Water Hydroelectricity Xeriscaping Lighting Antarctic flora Tag Climate of the United Kingdom Concrete Persian Gardens Deforestation Textile manufacturing Roswell UFO incident Solar power Weather lore Luck Town gas Plant Tulkarm Desertification Pinball Bathroom Illegal drug trade Opportunity rover Dead Like Me Sukkot Perfume Environmental concerns with electricity generation Ocean thermal energy conversion Gravel Seed World Trade Center The Chemical Brothers Nuclear power Irrigation Climate of Salt Lake City Christmas tree 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anticyclone Glossary of wildland fire terms Pok__mon types Pok__mon Abilities Geography of Chile Fire extinguisher Campfire Jute Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Lava Beds National Monument Campsite Tilapia Hippeastrum Rain Pachypodium Light pollution Venus Flytrap Peanut Gal__pagos Islands Cuisine of Denmark Photosynthesis Water resources Cyatheales Flowering plant Chaos Emerald Autonomous building National Football League Lore Sugar beet Erosion Wasabi
