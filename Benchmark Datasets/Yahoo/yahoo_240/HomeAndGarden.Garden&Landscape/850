somebody gave me a piece of grape vine how do i make it grow or root don't really know if i put it in water or do i plant it in soil i do the damp paper towel wrap most often just wrapping it around the bottom of the plant where you need it to root sometimes even placing it into a small glass of water along with the paper towel put it in a shady place so the sun doesn't scorch it and don't move it if you don't have to be sure if the sun does reach your grape vine that the leaves are not showing their underside it will cause unneeded stress to the plant it should root for you within a few days or a week have a willow nearby take a piece of willow and grind cut it up and add to your water this is a wonderful rooting trick or get some rooting compound at the store dipping the stem into it and then wrapping with a paper towel or putting it into water or putting it into a 'rooting cube' you can buy at any plant store once you see some healthy roots plant it in soil don't be afraid to keep in water until yo have plenty of vigorous roots Houseplant Cannabis cultivation Wood Kudzu Hop (plant) Desert Upholstery Bonsai Poison-ivy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comfrey Hamster Weed control Bamboo Phylloxera Vine Campfire Willow Flax Jute Hemp Tobacco Textile manufacturing Grape Soil pH Gypsy moth Garden Strawberry Cigarette Root Irrigation Black pepper Potato Toxicodendron Coffee Bong Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Deforestation Flowering plant Cocaine Sorghum Brewery Pachypodium Water Photosynthesis Fecal incontinence Polygonum Plant stem Soil Hydrogen peroxide Olive Physiological plant disorders Wisteria Fire fighting Champagne (beverage) Seismic retrofit Tree Apple Japanese tea ceremony Customs and etiquette of Japan Creeping Charlie Menstrual cup Professional wrestling holds Hyperthermia Carnivorous plant Alfalfa Bread Amateur telescope making Pinot Noir Mattress Erosion Banana Pachypodium habitats Plant Chlorophyta Manicure Skateboarding trick Naruto jutsu Soil life Auxin Wetland Hippeastrum Gooseberry Seed Oregon-grape Aerial (dance move) Tomato Nutrient Ethylene Lawn Aerial root Wok Glass Hydroponics Creosote bush Pansy Climate of the Alps
