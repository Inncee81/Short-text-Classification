anyone know anything about bumble bees okay my cat was swatting at a bumblebee and now the bee can't fly very well i took a look at it to see if i should kill it and put it out of it's misery but it was doing something weird after it found out it couldn't fly it was digging a hole and going into it like a mole what is going on here should i kill it is it going underground to heal and come out later answer quickly please bumble bee hives are located underground so i suppose it would stand to reason that bumble bees do in fact dig i do not know why one single bee would dig a hole unless it was looking to establish a new hive in which case i believe you would see multiple bees i would just watch the hole carefully and if you see more than one bee you need to exterminate them quickly if the hole is located near a well traveled area i have had up to hives located near my house and wound up having to exterminate one that tried to become established inside the yard they get really thick when flowers are blooming but so far i have only been stung once even with thousands zipping around in my garden bumble bees do not bore holes in wood and they do not live in wood that is the wood borer bee carpenter bee Bumblebee Bee Carpenter bee Pollinator decline Africanized bee Pollination Pollinator Diseases of the honeybee Top-bar hive Langstroth hive Pollination management Flower Honeybee Dodge Charger Honey Happy Tree Friends Queen bee Animal Crossing Beehive (beekeeping) Fruit tree pollination Futurama (TV series - season 5) Red imported fire ant Apocrita Pesticide toxicity to bees Shaggy dog story Xenomorph Apple Opportunity rover Textile manufacturing Swarming (honeybee) Grigori Rasputin Violin Bee learning and communication The Amber Spyglass Natural Selection (computer game) Saw II The Inside Drill bit Orchidaceae Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an GunBound StarCraft Episode VI Beverly Hills, California Pollen Roswell UFO incident Banjo-Kazooie Piccolo Junior Saga Muhammad Ali Miyamoto Musashi StarCraft: Uprising Conker's Bad Fur Day Resident Evil (film) The X-Files (season 1) Western honeybee Bee Gees Volleyball The Time Machine Honeybee life cycle Glossary of nautical terms Drone (bee) Hamster Comfrey RuneScape quests Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Cryptic crossword Vegeta Sonic Heroes The Legend of Zelda series enemies Pheromone (honey bee) Aliens vs. Predator 2 Watermelon Zerg Wood Stonehenge Cucumber Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Gaucho (insecticide) River Out Of Eden Resident Evil: Apocalypse Ant Sexual dimorphism Chatsworth House Ophrys Sento The Parting of the Ways Naruto jutsu The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy RuneScape locations Cigarette Smoking Man Spider Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Black hole Shen Gong Wu Death's Domain Land mine William S.
