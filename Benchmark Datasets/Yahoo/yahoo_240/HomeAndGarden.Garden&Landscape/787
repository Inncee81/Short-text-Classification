how high should i cut my grass i heard that you should cut the grass very short on the last mow of the season is this true how high should it be in the summer also how much do i have to water my grass in the winter i do live in the desert in texas how high should you cut the grass when you mow in fall well there's a general rule of thumb for determining grass height and in fall it's generally easy to stick to that rule of thumb an optimal height for a cool season grass in fall is about inches and at each mowing you should only be removing about the top of the grass blade consequently a good time to mow lawns is when your grass is about inches high why is inches an optimal grass height well what you re striving for is a balance on the one hand mowing the grass is like pinching a garden plant to stimulate rugged growth so if you re letting the grass get tall you re not mowing very much which means you re passing up opportunities to make your lawn healthier and more attractive but if you cut grass too short you stress it and let me stress that it is the height the grass has attained that should determine when it's time to mow it would be arbitrary to establish a schedule for mowing based on length of time between mowing's for instance advising someone to mow every other week fails to take into account the growing conditions during that period of time for instance rainfall stimulates growth in lawns so the presence or absence of rain will have a great impact on mowing frequency while the inch height for a cool season grass is optimal for the fall it is hardly an absolute figure that must be adhered to throughout the mowing season if you have a crabgrass problem for instance you may wish to make an adjustment in spring and summer that s because it is during these seasons that crabgrass an annual weed competes for space with your lawn grass some experts recommend keeping lawn grass around inches tall during spring and summer why because the extra shading that results may inhibit crabgrass enough to keep it in check in fall you can go back to maintaining the inch height since by then frost will have killed the tender crabgrass you do not need to water when your grass is dormant that means not at all in most areas in the winter Lawn Weed control Tennis Equine conformation Carnivorous plant Carpal tunnel syndrome Golf Human height Wind turbine Maize Digitaria Wood Keynesian economics Bird migration Weed Climate of the United Kingdom Comfrey Desert Dundas Square Knife Bamboo Xeriscaping Atlanta metropolitan area Hay Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Inflation Extreme Programming Herbicide Carburetor Auxin Yosemite National Park Oat Growth hormone treatment Severe weather terminology (United States) Hemp Mattress Table saw Poker jargon Space elevator Cereal Dog agility Vegetation Coffee Weather lore Kudzu Motor oil Compost Floppy disk Pruning fruit trees Textile manufacturing Utah Renewable energy Climate of Salt Lake City Wetland The Championships, Wimbledon Hypoglycemia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lake District Irrigation Fancy rat Climate of India 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Internal ballistics Anchor Ultimate (sport) Compiler optimization Autonomous building Wind power Bicycle frame Sewage treatment Welding Puberty Chair Fruit tree propagation Computational complexity theory Bong Softball Mower Wheat Deforestation Sorghum Drill bit San Jose, California Cricket pitch Tick Fish farming Cricket Overclocking Leaf Narcissism
