why do my geraniums always thin out after i have them for a while i love all colors of geraniums but am getting fustrated because i can't seem to keep them full looking they will still bloom but the leaves turn yellow and die why is this i have a perfect porch for them just the right amount of sun shade please help the main problem i have witnessed in dealing with potted geraniums is that we tend to overwater them even in the heat geraniums need to dry out between waterings not to the point of wilting but dry through out the soil not just the surface if they get too much water larger leafs yellow and fall off newer leafs are smaller and if the plant does flower the flower size is also smaller certainly fertilizer is essential to overall good performance of the plant i'd recommend a water soluble fertilizer ferti lome is one brand that i like especially a product called rooting and blooming great product that you'll find at your local independent retail garden center or nursery if they don't have it ask them for a product for annuals never discount the amount of sun you say the right amount of sun shade that should be hot blazing hot sun hours worth of sun the more the better i hope that this helps Leaf Hippeastrum Carnivorous plant Houseplant Bonsai Essential oil Coffee Soil pH Orchidaceae Textile manufacturing Irrigation Fertilizer Peach Sugar beet Jute Japanese tea ceremony Cranesbill Flower Rose Tea Comfrey Renewable energy Desert Black pepper Eutrophication Pansy Illegal drug trade Wood Begonia Tillandsia Sun Sorghum Compost Hamster Solar power Solar system Tobacco Flowering plant Sage Prosopis cineraria Solar panel Banksia Absinth Wormwood Brewery Venus Flytrap Physiological plant disorders Lake Gooseberry Pachypodium ambongense Weed control Gypsy moth Iris (plant) Hemp Nuclear fallout Bougainvillea Uranium Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Monarda Poker jargon Tofu Yosemite National Park Wisteria Peanut Bladderwort Thermal power station Phosphorus Pachypodium Logging Wheat Flax Sulfuric acid Earthworm Sulfur Pysanka Cannabis cultivation Rooibos Dishwasher Banana Pinophyta Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Carbon dioxide Terraforming Wind power Rainforest Common bean Hydroponics Pikmin Betting (poker) Coca Desertification Sewage treatment Deforestation Sears Holdings Corporation Nutrient Ammonia Cannabis (drug) Pachypodium brevicaule Potato Erosion
