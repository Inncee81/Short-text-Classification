how do you get rid of ft high bamboo plants grow on a tap root and seem to be resistant to weedkiller these plants are overrunning the garden and we just can't seem to get rid of them i have these too and i've been trying to keep them isolated from the rest of the yard and under control here are a couple of suggestions when you trim them back trim them from the base of the stalk if you cut a stalk at the base it won't grow back cut new stalks as soon as they begin to grow cut the top off of any of the stalks that are getting too tall ok now if you want to get rid of them i know safe ways to do it dig up all of the root balls the roots on these things put off long runners and they spread you need to get as much of the roots as possible if you are going to eliminate the plants i also learned that some people will pay for those root balls so you might want to contact a local garden shop before you chop them to bits to see if they might want to buy them the plants may be resistent to weed killer but you can still use it to kill them here's how wait until it has been dry for a couple of weeks and the plants are parched for water get some concentrated weed killer cut the largest stalks close to the root ball pour the weed killer directly on the part of the stalk that you just cut if you're lucky the weed killer will be absorbed through the stalk into the root ball and down the underground root system i have seen this work to kill off a huge patch of plants you have to be careful with the weed killer use enough to soak the root ball and maybe reapply it the next day but don't pour it directly into the ground it's a toxic chemical and nothing will grow where you pour it i hope these ideas help good luck Weed control Bamboo Weed Illegal drug trade Textile manufacturing Herbicide Hemp Jute Sugar beet Comfrey Hydroponics Coffee Carnivorous plant Cannabis cultivation Bonsai Tobacco Poker jargon Hamster Biodynamic agriculture Baseball Organic farming Sewage treatment Maize Kudzu Tag Garden Strawberry Irrigation Carbon dioxide Auxin Gypsy moth Sugarcane Tofu 1957 World Series Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Creeping Charlie Agriculture Ant Organic food Fruit tree propagation Bong Sorghum Piccolo Junior Saga Lawn Campfire Animal Crossing Potato Alfalfa Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Transformer Snooker USS Thresher (SS-200) Mushroom hunting Knots Landing Carbon dioxide sink Diablo II: Lord of Destruction YuYu Hakusho Rice Cannabis (drug) Perfume Manicure Equine conformation Japanese tea ceremony Zuiderzee Works Stinging nettle GunBound Ginkgo Little Shop of Horrors Operation Market Garden Internal ballistics Garlic Compost Tree Burma Campaign Plant Deforestation Global warming and agriculture Black pepper American football Volleyball Lawn mower Houseplant Renewable energy Yarrow Bread Comanche RuneScape skills Days of our Lives Biological pest control Trichome Chatsworth House USS Vestal (AR-4) Polygonum Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Electrophysiology Pebble bed reactor
