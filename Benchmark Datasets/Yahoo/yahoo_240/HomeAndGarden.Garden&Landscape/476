what flowers can i put in a little garden that are easy to take care of two things would be good to know whether it is sunny or shady and if you'd like to go with annuals or perennials perennials are nice because they come back every year but downside is they don't flower as long as annuals and cost more initially if it is a very small garden you may be more willing to do the work of planting annuals every year to enjoy much more flowering for annuals in a sunny spot i think the very easiest are zinnias and marigolds that's all my non green thumbed mother ever grew i personally hate the little orange marigolds but there are some nice taller white ones could look nice with shorter multi colored zinnias in front of them petunias are good too a couple of wave petunias can cover a large area for annuals in the shade my old standby is impatiens i tried a new variety called wild thing this year and the color is spectacular for perennials you can plan to have types that flower at different times tulip and daffodil bulbs are planted in the fall for early spring flowers lilies and daylilies bloom during the summer mums for the fall my all time favorite perennial is blue clips campanula it blooms on and off all summer and is smaller can be used as edging it has slowing spread through my garden but is not invasive i love its cheery little blue flowers so i've learned to recognize it's little heart shaped leaves and i let it grow where ever it will there also is a white variety but i haven't had as much luck growing it Pansy Flower Rose Sage Flowering plant Tulip Zinnia Iris (plant) Liriodendron Daylily Stage lighting Perennial plant Anemone Crocus Leaf Lighting Daffodil Lilium Weed control Hippeastrum Tomato Light-emitting diode Hellebore Carnivorous plant Potato Garden Strawberry Pysanka Orchidaceae Floristry Blue Monofloral honey Strap-on dildo Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Frankie Laine Kudzu Plant Sunflower Alfalfa Flower class corvette Chatsworth House Biological pest control Peanut Internal ballistics Clover Titan arum Color Garden Hall & Oates Winx Club Bamboo Joni Mitchell Sakura Wars Pollen Cranesbill Coffea arabica Elderberry Japanese tea ceremony Canna lily New York Giants Camassia Aconitum Wood European Beech Black pepper Phalaenopsis Bon Jovi Gangtok Cauliflower Apple Dave Grohl Absinth Wormwood My Little Pony Hen and chicks Wisteria Snowdrop National emblem Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Jennifer Lopez Textile manufacturing Drag racing Atlanta metropolitan area Care Bears Violet (plant) The Beach Boys Pachypodium bicolor Morning glory Goldenrod Wind turbine Common bean Perfume New Zealand flax Amaranth Garlic Brooklyn Botanic Garden
