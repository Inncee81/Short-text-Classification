how do i choose the best in ground sprinkler system for my needs it depends what your needs are and where you would like to water such as a turf area or a flower beds and what water pressure you have and how many gallons per min your main line puts out and that will determine what heads can be used and where and how far you have to space them out it also depends the layout of your landscape some landscapes you can use rain birds others you have to use pop ups and my advice to you is you use crappy parts you will pay for it later so use good quality parts such as rain bird and even orbit is rather good but my preference is rain bird here is my list to stay away from all hunter clocks they will not work and so with some parts not all but some i have never had problems with any rainbird products all toro valves they will leak no matter what you do Irrigation Glossary of firefighting terms Fire Sprinkler Fire hydrant Brewery Glossary of firefighting equipment Fire extinguisher Space Shuttle external tank Golf Autonomous building Tier One Panama Canal Basement Vacuum Water Mattress STS-61 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fuel injection 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Space shuttle main engine Flush toilet Scuba set Dairy Apollo 8 Fast bowling Environmental concerns with electricity generation Three Mile Island Dynamical system Microeconomics Xeriscaping Rebreather Internal combustion engine Thermostat Karst topography Oxyacetylene Town gas Hydraulic machinery Sento Light pollution Siphon Archery Airport STS-62 Tire Fire fighting Trombone Space disaster Barton Springs Tax Soil pH Apollo 13 Opportunity rover History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) STS-60 Parallax STS-59 Aberration of light Planetary orbit STS-86 Aquifer Nuclear power Radar Garden Gravity Firefighter Lake District 2003 North America blackout USS S-44 (SS-155) Acorn Computers Thermal power station Graph theory Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Water purification Earth Gasoline Energy development Dialysis Diving suit Sewer Lawn Solar system Pok__mon Abilities Chatsworth House Cannabis cultivation Ethics Sewage treatment Aerial (dance move) Global Positioning System Drainage World line Atlanta metropolitan area STS-91 Chemistry Temperature Archaeological field survey Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Mud People Entropy Hemp
