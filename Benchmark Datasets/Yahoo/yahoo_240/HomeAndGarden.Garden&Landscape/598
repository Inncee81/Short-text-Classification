how do you grow peaches soil seeds fertilization etc i want to grow a peach tree outside my house i like peaches any idea how to go about this the best and fastest way is to go to a nursery and buy an established tree they vary in size and age but a good nursery will probably have healthy trees ask the arborist about how to plant it and what time of year to plant for your area some peach trees will be self pollinating and some varieties need another tree close by i plant trees in the fall here so the roots can dig in a little before they go dormant in the winter some people plant in the early spring ask your arborist i just planted a peach and a pear last fall and they both came up healthy and vigorous this spring i think they will do well i paid about dollars apeice for the trees i bought they werent that big though i believe peaches have to be about seven years old before they will produce much nice ripe peaches are awesome pears too Peach Apple Pruning fruit trees Flowering plant Tree Pollination Pear Weed control Fruit Bonsai Kiwifruit Plant Pine Luther Burbank Soil life Seed Cannabis cultivation Pinophyta Organic farming New York Agriculture Avocado Flower Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Orchidaceae Atlanta metropolitan area Hemp Comfrey Alder Alfalfa Tomato Gypsy moth Olive Hamster Almond Banksia Fruit tree pollination Date Palm Pumpkin Wood Weed Orchard Fireblight Sugar beet European Beech Plantation Sustainable agriculture Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Kudzu Bamboo Adjective Pachypodium Sequoia Grafting Deforestation Palmdale, California Cereal Red Alder Carnivorous plant Pollination management Illegal drug trade Vanilla Prunus Logging Watermelon Dutch elm disease Hop (plant) Coffea Durian Mango Wheat Ginkgo Cotton plant Biodiversity Acorn Coconut Houseplant Lawn Johnny Appleseed Citrus King Khalid International Airport Plum Compost Elis Prefecture Sorghum Giant Sequoia Chinese calendar Black pepper Chlorophyta Coast Douglas-fir Green Revolution Wisteria Old growth forest Caatinga Barley Pawpaw
