my pumpkin plants are not producing pumpkins my plants have long vines large leafs and many flowers but no pumpkins the flowers open up and after a few days fall off i have seen many bees in the flowers and i myself have put the pollen from one flower into another i know that some flowers are supposed to be male and others female based on what i observe they all seem to be male if your plants were pollinated they may have aborted because of stress factors such as too much heat poor pollination affects fruit set even too much nitrogen can delay the setting of fruit on the vine the most common is a mid summer heat wave high day and night time temperatures will cause plant stress the tiny pollinated fruit may abort as a result a heat wave can also deter bees from their job making hand pollination more important which is what you've done pollination will be more successful if several male flowers are used to pollinate one female flower pollination needs to be made to all segments of the female flower do this before a m because pollination carried out at the end of the morning during warm weather has very little chance of success because the pollen will have heated up and fermented and will no longer be viable at the bottom of the blossom of a female is a tiny vegetable or fruit ovary if the blossom is male there is nothing there here's a picture instructions http www pumpkinnook com howto pollen htm make sure you don't water overhead early in the morning so the male flowers can have a chance to pollinate the female flowers male flowers are short lived they will open up before dawn and will close completely by mid morning the male flowers possess both pollen and nectar the female flowers only nectar if the plants are watered from overhead early in the day that may prevent all further pollination for that day everything gets washed off of the short lived male flowers replacement flowers do not open then until the following morning too much shade or not enough light is another cause of poor fruit set most fruiting vegetables do best in full sun all day they need at least to hours of sunlight extreme temperatures during flowering below degrees or above degrees can reduce fruit set good luck hope this helps Pollination Rambutan Flower Fruit Pumpkin Flowering plant Apple Carnivorous plant Pollen Pollinator Ecology Squash (fruit) Orchidaceae Garden Strawberry Pollination management Vanilla Cucumber Bee Pollinator decline Solar power Blackberry Plant Pachypodium baronii Diseases of the honeybee Watermelon Fruit tree pollination Insect Malus Kiwifruit Kudzu Greenhouse Plant sexuality Global warming and agriculture Fruit tree propagation Carbon dioxide Pachypodium brevicaule Houseplant Top-bar hive Passion flower Energy development Gypsy moth Alder Peach Venus Honeybee Japanese tea ceremony Conifer cones Species Banana Almond Megabat Renewable energy Vitamin C Weather lore Alfalfa Customs and etiquette of Japan Asteraceae Avalanche Passive solar Sorghum Pysanka Rapeseed Carpenter bee Fig Fertilisation Sun Grafting Biological pest control Banksia Worker bee Prostate cancer Soil pH Gaucho (insecticide) Sarracenia Plum Maple Bladderwort Kigo Welding Explosive material Weed control Climate of the Alps Urban heat island Fusion power Hashish Environmental concerns with electricity generation Carburetor Compost
