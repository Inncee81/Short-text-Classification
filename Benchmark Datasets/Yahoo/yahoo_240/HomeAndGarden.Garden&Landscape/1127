my grass is turning yellow hi guys i have a young pup and i can't always walk him in the street as he is a large breed we have to retrict his walks while he is young so we let him onto the back lawn a couple of times a day his wee is turning the grass yellow is there anything i can do to get my grass back to lush green shall i just re seed many thanks in advance i wouldn't bother re seeding while the dog is still using the garden as a toilet hopefully before too long you'll be able to take it for walks and train it where to do its business then you'll probably have to keep the garden well watered for a time to to try and wash the urine away and add a bit of fertiliser before the grass will have a chance of growing properly again it might be worth spreading a bit of lime over the lawn to try and neutralise the acid but i doubt if anything will work until it stops doing it Lawn Hamster Gardening Autonomous building Toilet humour Lawn mower Moss Japanese toilet Flax Jackass: The Movie Composting toilet Compost Potato Pok__mon types Rice Sears Holdings Corporation Maize Chatsworth House Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Traffic light Hemp Changeroom Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Dog training Soil pH The Championships, Wimbledon Spot the Dog Seed Comfrey Bird migration Norman Borlaug Tennis Weed control Agar plate Fruit tree propagation Cat Dune Sugar beet Prostate cancer Agrostis Toilet Textile manufacturing Obedience training Fume hood Yellow Papillon (dog) Siphon Urinary incontinence __douard Manet First aid Cortaderia selloana Shark Robot Wars Mario series enemies Chocobo Equine conformation Cattle Taikyoku shogi Housebreaking Kolkata Xeriscaping Croquet Sulfuric acid Airport Longleaf Pine Wheat Shaggy dog story Surtsey The Time Machine Alcohol fuel Illegal drug trade Jute Carnivorous plant Mango Sugarcane Fen Luther Burbank Sento Golden Retriever Poaceae Bamboo Conifer cones Rose Tick Neolithic Revolution Unreal Agriculture Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fertility awareness Certified Nursing Assistant Ammonia Bowls Coyote American Pit Bull Terrier Urinal Hard water
