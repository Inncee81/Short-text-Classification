night blooming jasmine how to grow from clippings can you and are the clippings best off in water or soil to root any advise would be greatly appreciated also how long from clipping will it take before i can transplant into pot then outside hey night blooming jasmine aka night jessamine 'botanical name' cestrum nocturnum i have a shrub in a sized decorative container years ago when i lived in san francisco where they are 'rather common' and can grow into storey specimens that fill the late august air with their pungent sweet aroma i started several new plants from semi hard wood cuttings nd year growth which is partially woody and partially green in the soil near the 'mother plant' in the fall i took cuttings reduced the leaves by and left at least 'nodes' removed the lower leaves and merely stuck them into the ground about winters in sf are generally cool and wet by spring the cuttings had rooted and i was able to transplant them i moved to north to sonoma county where we often get freezing night temps in the winter although the plant froze to the soil surface in a container it has sprouted and the plant is about ' tall and now beginning to set bud i used a fert and am now switching to for abundant flowers i would say that any technique resembling the one mentioned above would do the trick you could if it is planted in the ground bend a branch down to soil level remove a section of leaves and bury a portion of it using something for weight like a rock in the soil roots will sprout from the old leaf scars after a few months maximum you can then dig up the new start after cutting it from the original stem as far as starting them in water i'd use the same technique as stated for starting semi hard wood being sure to reduce the leaves considerably how long by water i don't know fyi c nocturnum is in the solanaceae family aka the potato family they bear flowers that are nearly always star or saucer shaped and petaled fruits are berries or capsules plants are frequently rank smelling or even poisonous but many are important food crops eggplant pepper potato tomato others are garden annuals perennials shrubs or vines browallia cestrum nicotiania and petunia to name a few i hope this answers all your questions re night blooming jessamine it is 'very easy' to propagate happy gardening Wood Orchidaceae Black pepper Solanaceae Weed control Kudzu Potato Fruit tree propagation Bamboo Tomato Cannabis cultivation Bonsai Comfrey Apple Carnivorous plant Desert Hop (plant) Pruning fruit trees Tobacco Sweet potato Garden Strawberry Fruit Alfalfa Hydroponics Coast Douglas-fir Perfume Hemp Olive Hippeastrum Deforestation Gooseberry Jasmine Jute Peanut Gypsy moth Hamster Banksia Bladderwort Essential oil Eucalyptus Sugar beet Pinophyta Vegetative reproduction Japanese tea ceremony Irrigation Pachypodium Pachypodium baronii Onion Drainage Pachypodium bicolor Perennial plant Wisteria Iris (plant) Seismic retrofit Alder Houseplant Wildfire Mandrake (plant) Flower Ginkgo Maize Pomegranate Carbon dioxide Root Japanese cuisine Pine Soil pH Bud Solanum Weed Zion National Park Banana Toxicodendron Coca Date Palm Honey fungus Coffea arabica Opportunity rover Elis Prefecture Earthworm Cuscuta Elderberry Acorn Wood carving
