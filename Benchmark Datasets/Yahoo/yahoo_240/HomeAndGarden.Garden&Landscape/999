can i plant a second generation of corn in one season just incase second generation isn't understood we planted corn and i dried out an ear can i go ahead and plant these dried corns this year or do i have to wait until next year if they are to produce the reason why most farmers buy their seed is because they aren't growing heirloom varieties but hybrids super sweet for this white or yellow that buying their seed ensures they get what they planted if they re planted hybrid seeds big chances are they will not get the original variety until tehy cross them again who has time for that so make sure your variety is an heirloom and what the heck go for it the worse that can happen is a failure for the plant to produce fruit this season Maize Wheat Banana Tomato Cereal Agriculture Common bean Sorghum Loganberry Heirloom plant Green Revolution Flowering plant Watermelon Potato Organic farming Rose Fruit Peanut Transgenic maize Apple Genetically modified food Cannabis cultivation Sugar beet Fruit tree propagation Genetic engineering Species Grape Quinoa Citrus Famine Hybrid Plant breeding Coffea arabica Hamster Coriander Rice Pollination Tobacco Capsicum Plant Hemp Flax Peruvian cuisine Flower Squash (fruit) Jute Orange (fruit) Theory of conduct Durian Luther Burbank Black pepper Barbara McClintock Seed Frugivore Combine harvester Bread Barley Kiwifruit Illegal drug trade Organic food National Football League Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Pansy Basil Pachypodium bicolor Humphrey Bogart Peach Cucumber Vegetarianism German cuisine Vanilla Chicken Pea Dairy Apricot Inca Empire Neolithic Revolution Biological dispersal Wine Sugarcane F1 hybrid Sugar Date Palm Broom (shrub) Cuisine of Malaysia Deforestation Avocado Fancy rat Plant breeders' rights Renewable energy Clover Shaggy dog story Garden Strawberry Pumpkin Strawberry Beer Corn dolly Kryptonite Johnny Appleseed
