if i already have an older manual sprinkler system installed how do i change it to an automatic system wow these other answers suck any ways if it has all manual valves that you just turn off and on to water diffrent sections then you will need to dig all of them up and replace them all with electric solenoid valves then you will have to run wire from all the valves to where you want to put your timer then install your timer and there you go hope fully you have a shut off valve for the entire system where it connects to the house line or meter if not than i would personally leave the manual valves on and just install the solenoid valves ahead of each manual valve that way if you ever have aproblem you can turn off the mainline to whichever valve has the problem and not runup your water bill you may never find where the lines tapp into your house line to install a shut off valve so you would have to do that or just not have a shut off if all the valves are in one place then you can add a shut off valve and backflow preventer before the valves make sure when you plumb everything in that you have everything facing the correct way all valves and such have an arrow pointing to which way the flow is going also make sure all the pipes are clean and dry before glueing your wiring i would recommend some guage multistrand wire wire for common white then use all the other s for your lead wires each zone gets one and the common hooks to everything valves an easy to maintain brand is hunter reliable is rainbird high pressure areas use irritrol brand valves stay away from all other brands i work with this stuff and i know what is good to use and lasts timers use hunter or rainbird nothing else barron makes good wire too hope this helps john a Carburetor Irrigation Thermostat Glossary of firefighting equipment Hydraulic machinery Siphon Thermal power station Flush toilet Turbocharger Two-stroke cycle Diving regulator High-voltage direct current Circuit breaker Fire hydrant Spark plug Plumbing fixture Steam engine Programmable logic controller Rail terminology Apollo Command/Service Module Automatic transmission Welding Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Embedded system Dialysis Three Mile Island Traffic light Space shuttle main engine Glossary of firefighting terms Heart valve Ethernet Fire alarm control panel Urinal Displacement on Demand Hydraulic ram Aircraft flight control systems Vacuum tube Wire wrap Snorkel Furnace Fire Sprinkler Steam (content delivery) Drill bit Water supply Water hammer Elevator Heart Japanese toilet Oxyacetylene Jet engine Novelty (locomotive) Harp Burglar alarm Apollo 13 Overhead lines Solar power Brewery Residual-current device Modem Computer Team Fortress Classic Wind turbine Space disaster Stirling engine Four-stroke cycle Dairy Tire Nitrous Rapid transit Pneumatics M60 machine gun Electromagnet Transformer Diving suit Fountain pen Gas metal arc welding Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Chevrolet Corvair engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Electrical wiring 2000 Australian Grand Prix Railway signal Hall effect Tap (valve) Aortic valve Sleeve valve TGV
