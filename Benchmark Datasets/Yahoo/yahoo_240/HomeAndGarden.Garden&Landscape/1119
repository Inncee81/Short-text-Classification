i planted leylandi trees foot high in my garden months ago and they have not grown at all two of them are planted in a very narrow area and therefore do not have much soil but the others have plenty of soils and are still the same height they are also going slightly brown yellow on the edges of the leaves i have not given them any fertiliser since i planted them but all other plants in my garden seem to flourish they are planted in direct sunlight and lose the sun around pm i live on a hill so it is quite windy but the trees are sheltered by a small fence put cow manure on them and water it in they're probably rooting the manure should address the yellowing issue and it's not a chemical based fertilizer so should do no harm you don't want to pile the manure close to the trunk set it out a little so the plant sends out roots to get the nutrients you better read this http images google com imgres imgurl http news bbc co uk olmedia images leylandii trees jpg imgrefurl http news bbc co uk hi uk stm h w sz hl en start tbnid nk uqs xg rm tbnh tbnw prev images fq dleylandi btrees b gbv d svnum d hl den sa dg Fertilizer Manure Earthworm Bonsai Peach Compost Green manure Soil Comfrey Banksia Carnivorous plant Eucalyptus Houseplant Deforestation Soil life Gypsy moth Rainforest Physiological plant disorders Renewable energy Hydroponics Olive Sustainable agriculture Weed control Flowering plant Wood Pachypodium Permaculture Logging Chatsworth House Fruit tree propagation Gooseberry Tree Irrigation Acorn Agriculture Hemp Organic horticulture Pachypodium key to species Gardening Desert Soil pH HyperText Transfer Protocol European Beech Moss Biodynamic agriculture Pine Beetle Illegal drug trade Cannabis cultivation Bamboo Organic gardening Nutrient Elis Prefecture Ivy Biological pest control Coast Douglas-fir Jute Tobacco Tillandsia Alfalfa Sequoia Eutrophication Green Revolution Tasmanian Tree Fern Dune Sorghum Venus Flytrap Sarracenia Vermicompost Morphology of Pachypodium Prosopis cineraria Humus Global warming Lake Wisteria Manawatu-Wanganui Livestock Sugar beet Coffee Lawn San Pedro cactus Campfire Turnip (brassica rapa) Desertification Maize Simone Weil Palmdale, California Weed Water Pachypodium bicolor Natural gas Christmas tree Tillage Hamster Begonia
