help my herb is covered with thrips have tried tape and spray i even tried nematodes for the soil that are supposed to eat the thrips what am i doing wrong where do these things come from help me to understand why i have this infestation thankyou thrips can fly but they are not good fliers they typically arrive in a garden during wind storms and then build local populations control of thrips is difficult thrips feed in buds folded leaves and other unexposed areas of plants this makes them very difficult to treat with an insecticide while in pupal stages in the soil they are protected from insecticides directed at the crop use of biological control methods like nematodes requires proper handling of nematodes to insure survival and proper identification of the thrip infesting your herbs biological controls are specific to a host the nematode you applied to your soil may not affect the specific thrip infesting your herbs soil mites h miles can not tolerate the dry soils typical of a herb garden and neoseiulus cucumeris is used primarily indoors may not survive your outdoor conditions control suggestions from colorado state university extension service dislodge them by applying a strong stream of water to the affected plant larvae are wingless and will not find their way back to your plant this is one time you will want to use overhead watering as it kills many of the thrips placing aluminum foil mulches under the plants has been found in some instances to disorient the thrips remove and discard affected blossoms and plant parts thrips prefer tender new growth avoid excess pruning which may stimulate new growth or applying high nitrogen fertilizers avoid planting near dry weed or grassy areas thrips migrate from these areas into the garden the location of the insects makes it difficult to reach them with insecticides products that have been somewhat successful are horticultural oils insecticidal soaps neem pyrethroids acephate non food crops only two biological controls have shown promise in colorado they are beauvaria bassiana naruralis o botanigard and spinosad the msu dept of horticulture also has identified spinosad as a low toxic effective biological control of thrips the product name is conserve sc conserve sc has a moderate spectrum of activity it is most effective on chewing insects including beetles particularly chrysomelidae caterpillars and sawfly larvae leafmining flies fungus gnat and shore fly larvae are also potential target pests it appears to have good activity on thrips and sporadic activity against mite species be careful with soap based home remedies especially mixed with oil these mixes can be phytotoxic to your plants especially when applied during hot sunny weather always test a soap mixture on a couple of leaves before general use insecticidal soaps are tested for plant phytotoxicity and are less likely to burn your plant foliage also some soaps have no effect on soft bodied insects it matters what soap you use not all soaps are effective remember that soaps insecticidal soaps pyrthrins are all contact pesticides they have little to no residual effect they work when they contact the target insect its hards to get these insecticides on all of the thrips in a plant for total knockdown Agriculture Pollinator decline Herbicide Soil pH Tobacco Weed Bonsai Ant DDT Green Revolution Apple Fruit tree propagation Banana Global warming and agriculture Cannabis (drug) Anopheles Sorghum Malaria Gaucho (insecticide) Kosher foods Bedbug Hemp Cycad Rapeseed Illegal drug trade Carbon dioxide Houseplant Earthworm Peanut Chicken Neem Pesticide toxicity to bees Garden Strawberry Essential oil Cannabis cultivation Botany Compost Comfrey Gooseberry Tick Plant Gas metal arc welding Honeybee Wheat Tea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insecticide Organic food Pine Deforestation Fancy rat Caterpillar Ladybird Fish farming Tsetse fly Rocky Mountain spotted fever Soil life Species Coffee Hamster Shrimp farm Hop (plant) Cancer Genetically modified food Bagworm moth Vegetation Mushroom hunting Spruce Budworm Vermicompost Red imported fire ant Livestock Insulin Renewable energy Organic gardening Explosive material Common cold Roundworm Genetic engineering Wood Fertilizer Biodiesel Thermal power station Cotton plant
