why doesn't my wife understand about gardening and why is she so upset my wife and i decided to make a vegetable garden and i specifically told her not to plant tomatoes because i saw on the news ddt is found often on them i had to go out of town the next day and when i came back i found out that she had planted tomatoes so i went out to the garden with a hoe dug everything up and demolished it she burst into tears and called me an inconsiderate and said she wouldn't make a graden with me again i said fine and that it would be better anyway because she is too stupid to graden anyway in all honesty what is her problem i said she was too stupid to garden not graden sorry for the typo animalover i may have made a mistake typing but nobody specifically told me to not write graden i was a typo i specifically told my wife to not plant tomatoes there is a difference it's interesting how so many answerers criticize you for calling her stupid and then they call you everything under the sun and one even asks you to go play on the freeway talk about hypocrites i guess if they are upset it's ok to insult and call names it's typical on here you should never call your wife an hole you hole the point here is that you are concerned about ddt and whether some people think it's a valid concern or not is not important it does not seem to matter to the sky is falling greenies that a lot of people don't believe in man made global warming you don't need permission to be concerned you told your wife not to plant tomatoes instead of discussing it with you she did it anyway behind your back by acting this way she should have known what reaction you would have if there is a disagreement between you and your wife it needs to be talked about she did not excercise that option instead she was a sneak your reaction was justified you should not be expected to go out of town and then return to see what your wife has done behind your back if she wants to pout and say she won't garden anymore that's up to her Theory of conduct Plame affair Social rule Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Bill O'Reilly (commentator) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Kodocha Tomato Noam Chomsky Black hole The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Inside Jumpstart 3rd Grade Philosophy of language Tenali Ramakrishna Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 The nature of God in Western theology Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Big Brother UK series 6 Friends The Skeptical Environmentalist Joke Global warming Gamma ray burst Pip (South Park episode) Futurama (TV series - season 3) God Emperor of Dune Contract She Loves You The Amber Spyglass 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hey Jude Ocean's Twelve Chess strategy and tactics Ozone depletion Transactional analysis Intellectual property Broken News Sydney Riot of 1879 National Kidney Foundation Singapore Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses South Park Johnny 5 Futurama (TV series - season 5) Bogdanov Affair Atheism Plame affair timeline Anne Rice Opportunity rover Vegetation "Weird Al" Yankovic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Prostate cancer Fahrenheit 9/11 Ontological argument Condom Fiddler on the Roof Ozone hole Babe Ruth John Kerr Criticism of Mormonism The Hobbit Piccolo Junior Saga Ethics Gravity Zhao Yun Mediation Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Romulus and Remus Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Visual Basic Le Malade imaginaire The Lovely Bones Petroleum The Subtle Knife Organic food Nuclear power phase-out Bloody Stupid Johnson Debugging Deconstruction Species Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Agnosticism Red Vs.
