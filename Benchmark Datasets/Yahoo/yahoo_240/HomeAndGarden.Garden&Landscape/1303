is it necessary to divide dahlia bulbs if so why dahlias produces many side tubers that eventually crowd each other diminishing the show by growing weak stems and smaller flowers so yes it should be done every few years to keep the plants performing their best wait til the first frost kills the foliage then wait one week before digging the tubers produce eyes during this time if you do not freeze to kill the plants dig them before mid november anyway cut the plant down then dig in one week it is ok to cut a tuber's end off they can even be stored that way just do not break or cut off the long thin necks set the clump on a bbq grill or a soil sieve and hose off the soil working in the shade so the tubers don't dry to much trim the roots all off look the clump over to locate the eyes this is the future growth site so each piece needs one to produce a plant eyes are only located near the crown of the clump remove the stalk and separate the pieces with eyes Potato Hemp Comfrey Leaf Carnivorous plant Orchidaceae Weed control Kudzu Wood Bladderwort Truffle Bonsai Root Flowering plant Sweet potato Jute Hamster Begonia Garden Strawberry Hop (plant) Sugar Giant Hogweed Pachypodium brevicaule Plant stem Cannabis cultivation Pruning fruit trees Venus Flytrap Gypsy moth Wood carving Deforestation Irrigation Jerusalem artichoke Black pepper Plant Christmas tree Prosopis cineraria Sugar beet Apple Cephalic disorder Eucalyptus Anemone Logging Daylily Textile manufacturing Collecting fossils Dahlia Garlic Peanut Chives Vegetation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sugarcane Equine conformation Brewery Wisteria Ragweed Sorghum Pachypodium New Zealand flax Mirabilis (plant) Pachypodium ambongense Auxin Iris (plant) Trichome Phytophthora infestans Tuberous sclerosis European Beech Dactylorhiza Happy Tree Friends Fruit tree propagation Coffea arabica Weathering Cell (biology) Tofu Pine Ginkgo Combine harvester Ant Drill bit Herbicide Maize Pachypodium habitats Zuiderzee Works Barbecue Olive Grafting Manroot Flower Honey fungus Banksia Perennial plant Comanche Root vegetable Vanilla
