i have potted plants on my deck and some of them have moss growing on the surface of the dirt i'm in ma hot and humid this week should i cut back my watering i'm watering when the dirt feels dry the plant care tag says to water when dry thank you rather than cutting back on your watering try watering in the morning so that the surface of the soil has time to dry and can't support moss the moss really won't harm the plants but it can be unsightly if you're already watering in the morning then you might consider using physan in the water however this should not be used on vegetables only ornamentals good luck Houseplant Lawn Moss Hippeastrum Hemp Bonsai Carnivorous plant Soil Gardening Comfrey Pea Desert Hydroponics Pachypodium Jute Tillandsia Spanish Moss Desertification Garden Strawberry Leaf Flax Upholstery Plant Caatinga Coffee Textile manufacturing Epiphyte Humidity Lichen Cannabis cultivation Tobacco Weed control Hamster Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Irrigation Deforestation Surtsey Lake Sugar beet Tofu Phytophthora cinnamomi Venus Flytrap Pachypodium habitats Giant Sequoia Coconut Bog Basil Ficus elastica Air conditioning Yosemite National Park Begonia Antarctic flora Temerin Soils retrogression and degradation Xeriscaping Sphagnum Carbon dioxide Tea Sorghum Agriculture Bromeliaceae Garlic Lighting National Weather Service Drainage Renewable energy Water garden Illegal drug trade Onion Sauna Larger context to habitats of Pachypodium Florida Keys Aral Sea Bamboo Chicken Lycopodiophyta Bladderwort Fruit tree propagation Cereal Car washing techniques STS-59 Rose Alfalfa Kudzu Hop (plant) Christmas tree Henry W.
