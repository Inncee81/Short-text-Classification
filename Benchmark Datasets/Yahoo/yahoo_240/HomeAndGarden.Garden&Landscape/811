can i plant a lavender in a room with air conditioner because as i know lavender plant grow in more cold place you are correct in placing lavender in drier conditions lavender does like low humidity however lavender is a family of some plants native to the mediterranean growing in dry rocky habitats so they like heat and survive in dry cold conditions these plants will not survive damp winter rains without excellent drainage nor summer humidity without good air circulation and lots of sun it can be done after all england is famous for their lavender it just needs warmth and shelter from harsh wet winters it is dampness more than cold that kills lavender plants in summer humidity ensuring they have lots of room for air to circulate or as you suggest a c will help them avoid getting a fungal disease and rot in damp air just be sure to give them lots of light and warmth they need root space so a really small pot will soon be out grown get one deep water sparingly and place aquarium gravel on top as mulch it takes about three years for lavender to reach full size plants should be pruned every year immediately after bloom to keep a compact shape and encourage repeat flowering the wood ceases to produce buds so when pruning cut back til you can still see just two pair of little grey buds on the stem for the plant to sprout back from harvest flowers after only the first couple of buds on the flower head have opened they are grey until the buds open once you see color they can be cut if you wait til all the buds have opened you lose a lot of their scent and the buds will fall of the calyx more readily the plant will bloom for about weeks cooking with lavender is common in europe and the mediterranean in france it is used in herb provence it is a member of the mint family and is close to rosemary sage and thyme it is best used with fennel oregano rosemary thyme sage and savory http whatscookingamerica net lavender htm Carnivorous plant Essential oil Lavender Bonsai Comfrey Olive Hemp Orchidaceae Pruning fruit trees Desert Leaf Houseplant Cannabis cultivation Air conditioning Fruit tree propagation Apple Hippeastrum Potato Flowering plant Coffee Stratification (botany) Hamster Sunflower Gypsy moth Climate of the United Kingdom Tea Renewable energy Perfume Textile manufacturing Pachypodium ambongense Sage Pachypodium brevicaule Plum Sauna Physiological plant disorders Coconut Honey Flower Solar power Tofu Pachypodium Pachypodium baronii Coriander Morphology of Pachypodium Basement Wood Black pepper Diving suit Upholstery Peach Rosemary Lake Oregano Bladderwort European Beech Pachypodium bicolor Capercaillie Aquarium Giant Sequoia Monarda Yarrow Shrub Lake District Sea-lavender Pansy Broom (shrub) Rocky Mountains Tobacco Pachypodium habitats Rambutan Kudzu Grafting Geography of Spain Cuisine of Denmark Plant Campfire Dune Hydroponics Diseases of the honeybee Hop (plant) Herbal tea Japanese tea ceremony Alfalfa Vanilla Comanche Phalaenopsis Biology of the Sierra Nevada Sugar beet Tillandsia Lawn
