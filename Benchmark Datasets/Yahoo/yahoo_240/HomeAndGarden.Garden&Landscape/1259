what can i do to save my lawn we bought a house a few years ago and they had a beautiful lawn and garden i've paid a professional to chemcially treat my lawn until this year my plants and roses are still doing fine but the lawn is browning lately there's been a lot of rain here in the kansas city area lately but since that stopped last month my problem started i've been watering every two or three days but there hasn't been much of an effect i cut the grass taller to keep from chopping it to death what else should i be doing and when should i be expecting results you have to make sure you are getting an inch of water on the lawn each time you water or else you aren't doing it much good a good way to check this is to put out some empty bowls cans etc on the lawn while it is being watered and check to see how long it takes before they are filled up one inch high then that is how long you should be watering the lawn twice a week is okay usually all it needs another problem you may have is that the chemicals may have built up and with no rain is helping to burn the grass instead of wasting money with chemicals that are harmful try some of jerry baker's homemade concoctions for the lawn they work great are cheap and aren't harmful stuff like dish soap and beer i'm not kidding that you put in a sprayer container on your hose and spray on your lawn he is online Lawn Weed control Bong Fire fighting Autonomous building Hamster Irrigation Siphon Fire extinguisher Coffee The Championships, Wimbledon Bread Ice cream Cruising (maritime) Sewage treatment Energy development Empire Burlesque Cannabis cultivation Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Make money fast Waste management Hard water McMansion Marine aquarium Illegal drug trade Urinary incontinence Water purification Water Chatsworth House Maize Soap Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Menstrual cup Solar power Herbicide Motor oil Year of the Spider Desert AFI 100 Years series Sod Hydrogen economy Bhopal disaster San Jose, California Marilyn Monroe Indianapolis 500 Tennis Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tire Jute Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Theory of conduct Professional wrestling slang Concrete Paint Therion (band) Genuine Progress Indicator Atlanta metropolitan area Airport Brewery Car washing techniques Grandview, U.S.A.
