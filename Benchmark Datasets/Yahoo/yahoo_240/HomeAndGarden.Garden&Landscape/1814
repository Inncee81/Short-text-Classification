venus flytrap i just bought a venus flytrap is it okie if i feed them with flies regular and some of the trap has a little red in inside of it is it normal healthy traps are red inside as if blushing plants only need bug a year to survive the hair triggers on the inner surface of the leaf cause the trap to close not the ones on the rim of the leaf triggers usually need to be stimulated times to get the trap to close the plant needs to be sure it's a bug not a fallen tree leaf leaves have the capacity to close around times then it's done once a healthy trap has a bug caught in it it releases enzymes to help break down the bug into nutrients that the plant can use because the natural habitat of the plant is nutrient poor the roots do not tolerate fertilizer well so never fertilize the plant feeding it meat will cause rot most bugs are good not just flys they like wet feet constant water like a bog but they like the water line low terrariums encourage rot because there isn't enough air circulation for this species Venus Flytrap Bladderwort Wetland Hamster Gypsy moth Mosquito Comfrey Sarracenia Houseplant Soil Deforestation Plant Organic farming Soil life Leaf Fish farming Moss Eutrophication Tillandsia Soil pH Wheat Compost Rainforest Pok__mon types Apple Salmon Mountain Gorilla Orchidaceae Sugar beet Root Permian-Triassic extinction event Nutrient Peach DNA repair Rice Nutrition Chicken Humus Hippeastrum Puberty Banksia Pachypodium Chlorophyta European Beech Spider Environmental concerns with electricity generation Physiological plant disorders Vitamin C Lake Koala Biological pest control Hunting Naruto jutsu Wraith (Stargate) Pachypodium key to species Gray Wolf Breastfeeding Darlingtonia (Sarraceniaceae) Hydroponics Irrigation Guinea pig Fruit tree propagation Pine Fertilizer Ecology Logging Vermicompost Kangaroo Cycad Tarantula Agriculture Sewage treatment Oak Pinophyta Seabird Fern Butterfly Flowering plant Shrimp farm Fast bowling Aquarium Desert Dairy Alfalfa Cat Organic horticulture Diving regulator Old growth forest Acorn Thermoregulation Cochineal Heath (habitat) Vegetarianism Hemp
