is vinegar baking soda as a weed killer safe i sprinkled baking soda then poured vinegar ontop of dandelions they reacated and formed a fuzzy foam ball the next day i looked at the spot where my experiment took place there was nothing there but barren land no grass and no dandelions should i continue using vinegar baking soda as a weed killer question is it safe for the enviorment are there any hazards for humans houesehold vinegar with baking soda makes water co the bubbles and a salt sodium acetate all safe it is the acid in vinegar that injures the plants probably in two ways the acid injures the plant's membranes causing rapid water loss leading to eventual plant death then although it will acidify the surrounding soil somewhat vinegar is a weak acid so the soil is expected to return to its normal ph after a few weeks or after a good rain however while still present the low ph of the vinegar will disturb the ability of the plant roots to draw up nutrients and the minor minerals needed to survive provided it doesn't actually prefer acid soil vinegar is good for some types of plants and bad for others vinegar should be applied on warm hot dry days with no chance of rain natural vinegar contains only acetic acid so many people add clove oil or a citrus oil to aid in killing the older weeds there are even commercial mixes based on vinegar now but some use concentrated vinegar at vinegar as an organic weed killer http www moscowfood coop archive vinegarkillsweeds html you can find more info about vinegar as an herbicide at usda gov and search for vinegar the researchers found that and percent concentrations killed the weeds during their first two weeks of life older plants required higher concentrations of vinegar to kill them at the higher concentrations vinegar had an to percent kill rate at all growth stages a bottle of household vinegar is about a percent concentration nutrient availability in relation to soil ph n readily available from ph to p availability reduced at a lower ph as it binds with al and fe most available at ph k most available at ph fe zn cu b mn solubility increases with lower ph while insoluble at higher ph acid soils can lead to deficiencies of phosphorus calcium magnesium and molybdenum as well as toxic levels of manganese and aluminium Sulfuric acid Vinegar Weed control Fertilizer Herbicide Carnivorous plant Organic food Water purification Hydrogen peroxide Eutrophication Soil Hydroponics Fire extinguisher Weed Titanium Aluminium Tocopherol Acid rain Water (molecule) Vitamin C Citric acid Milk Acid Salt Nutrition Organic farming Sulfur Auxin Agriculture Hydrochloric acid Cocaine Ecology Biodiesel Bacteria Folic acid Soybean Coffee Explosive material Compost Bread Uranium Glass Cell (biology) Tofu Casting Genetically modified food Alum Cannabis cultivation Deforestation Alcohol fuel Tooth Hydrogen economy Protein-energy malnutrition E85 Chlorophyta Phosphorus Veganism Helium Green Revolution Hard water Food preservation Hamster Sugar beet Sodium hydroxide Omega-3 fatty acid Soils retrogression and degradation Portland cement Global warming and agriculture Perfume Gypsy moth Vegetarianism Energy development Osteoporosis Houseplant Cheese Garlic Hydrogen chloride Lake Steel Dishwasher Poison Soap Protein Future energy development Carbon dioxide sink Decompression sickness Alkane Unemployment Carboxylic acid
