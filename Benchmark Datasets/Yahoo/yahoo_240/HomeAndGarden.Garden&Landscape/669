how do i get my passionflower passiflora incarnata a k a maypop to set fruit i bought some passion flower plants passiflora incarnata a k a maypop and am hoping they will eventually set fruit the seller told me they are self fruiting yet i'm not so sure i would hate to wait until they bloom just to find out they won't self fertilize does anybody know for sure if they are or are not self fruiting is there a way i can find out without waiting until it's too late if they aren't self fruiting do i need to get the same type of plant for fertilization or a different species of passion flower which one or does it not matter i'm not worried about pollination plenty of bees and butterflies around thanks thanks glenn i know they grow wild in many areas but definitely nowhere near me nyc so i just wonder whether you might actually have several plants growing near you and it is being pollinated by them i have a pink passiflora that sounds a little obscene now i look at it and it has fruited ever since it started flowering and i haven't seen a single other one anywhere in my quadrant of the city it fruits quite prolifically Passion flower Fruit Flower Pollinator decline Apple Flowering plant Malus Insect Pollination management Pollen Cucumber Fruit tree pollination Rose Garden Strawberry Honey Alfalfa Carnivorous plant Pollinator Orchidaceae Plant Bee Agriculture Kiwifruit Pumpkin Sunflower Disa (orchid) Morning glory Alder Prunus Olive Plant sexuality Vanilla Almond Fruit tree propagation Houseplant Species Strawberry Fig Peanut Sex Asteraceae Banana Date Palm Loganberry Pollen source Feijoa Monoculture Fertilisation Bumblebee Biological pest control Gooseberry Banksia Monarda Durian Peach Pawpaw Tomato Carpel Delphinium Tooth Honeybee Pachypodium brevicaule Blueberry Butterfly Gladiolus Clover Bramble Copihue Dodecatheon Dactylorhiza Iris (plant) Breadfruit Pysanka Pinophyta Apricot Sustainable agriculture Shaggy dog story Plum Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Ivy Orange (fruit) Ume Darwin from Orchids to Variation Illegal drug trade Pineapple Peter Sellers Kudzu Grafting Cherry Citrus Ragweed Magnolia The Time Machine Smilax Perfume
