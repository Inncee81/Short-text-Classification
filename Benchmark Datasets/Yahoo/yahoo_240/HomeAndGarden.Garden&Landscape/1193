has anyone tryed using flagstone molds to make a faux fake flagstone patio and if you did were you happy with the results what type of cement material did you use and how what color did you use to make it look more natural i just priced some flagstone sandstone and it's very expensive in my area thanks for replies i have been looking at stone molds on ebay and some seem like they would be easy to make is there a trick to get the tops of the stones smooth so when you walk on them the stones will not hurt your feet i ll tell you how i made my flagstone patio doing it this way doesn t require a lot of skills first kill all the grass or weedeat down to the dirt add dirt if you have to but level the dirt as if you had just poured a slab of concrete tamp the dirt until it is well packed starting at an inside corner free form draw a flagstone shape about inches deep and fill it with concrete leave a gap about or inch filled with dirt then do another and another etc you can take several days to do this if you wish when you are done you will have a concrete patio of a flagstone pattern of your choosing let it set up good several days clean out the dirt between the flagstones and concrete mortar in between take oil base stain of slightly varying colors and stain the concrete flagstones varying shades between stones use one color only for the mortar when finished it looks like natural rock keep your stain light at first until you get the effect you want age and sunlight will naturally mellow the effect i have had mine years now and the last couple of years i have been thinking of restaining a little that s all good luck p s as you pour the flagstones the dirt is the mold level the top with a trowel to the smoothness you want Casting Concrete Upholstery Masonry Mattress Drill bit Glass Violin Strap-on dildo Architecture of the California missions Reinforced concrete Seismic retrofit Plastic Roman road Bong Plaster Tofu Fast bowling Stained glass Rail tracks Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Drawing Portland cement Molding (decorative) Stucco Building material Knife Diamond Stereoscopy Radio controlled car Solar cell Dam Carburetor Billiards Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Textile manufacturing Diamond cut Airport Pavement (material) Sundial Turquoise Vault Ammolite Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Boat building Softball Leather Gamma ray Soap Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Diving Chair Shell (projectile) Autostereogram Terrazzo Eifel Aqueduct Pachypodium baronii Lechaina Energy development Woodworking Suspension bridge Light-frame construction Shotgun Sling (weapon) Lemmings 2: The Tribes Hat Piccolo Junior Saga RuneScape quests Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gravel Baseball EastEnders Dog agility Ammunition Snooker Headlight Thermal power station Microscopy Lighting Perfume The Human Stain Kitchen Hamster Screw Tile Arch bridge Tuff Passive solar
