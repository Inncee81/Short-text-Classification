planting trees i want to plant a few trees in my yard what is the proper procedure for planting trees i want to grow them by planting seeds directly into the ground and let nature take its course should i use compost and how long will it be before the tree starts to grow thanks if you want to plant trees from seeds start them in pots instead of in the ground that way you can mnitor the growth nurture them along when the seedling is about feet tall plant them into the gound preferably in the fall or early spring this will give the tree time for it's roots to get established in the native soil trees should always be planted in native soil amending the hole will cause the roots not to spread out into the native soil will inhibit the tree's growth also be careful not to mulch too much volcano mounds of mulch also inhibit water from getting to the tree roots and can inhibit growth or even kill the tree ditto for flower beds around trees raising the soil level around tree roots will damage the tree tree roots will ultimately spread out to the edge of the canopy of the tree the entire area should receive adequate water Weed control Comfrey Old growth forest Mulch Houseplant Gypsy moth Irrigation Bonsai Hemp Coast Douglas-fir Fruit tree propagation Weed Tree Herbicide Pine Apricot Flowering plant Compost Plant Pachypodium Seed Bamboo Garden Strawberry Flax Carnivorous plant Black pepper Pinophyta Soil pH Coconut Stratification (botany) Christmas tree Logging Vermicompost Soil Auxin Organic farming European Beech Ethylene Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Sewage treatment Physiological plant disorders Plantation Fertilizer Apple Banksia Vegetation Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Peach Pruning fruit trees Red Alder Peanut Florida Keys Tree of heaven Acorn Reforestation Wood Deforestation Sorghum Eucalyptus Liriodendron Organic gardening Rainforest Drooping Brome Permaculture Drainage Earthworm Soil life Desertification Avocado Seismic retrofit Organic horticulture Sequoia Wisteria Yosemite National Park Sugar beet Hippeastrum Alfalfa Cottonwood Agriculture Pansy Tobacco Honey fungus Date Palm Carbon dioxide sink Invasive plants Leaf Orchidaceae Longleaf Pine Prosopis cineraria
