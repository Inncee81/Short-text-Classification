here's an easy cryptography question assume a cryptographic algorithm in which the performance for the good guys the ones that know the key grows linearly with the length of the key and for which the only way to break it is a brute force attack of trying all possible keys suppose the performance for the good guys is adequate e g it can encrypt and decrypt as fast as the bits can be transmitted over the wire at a certain size key then suppose advances in computer technology make computers twice as fast given that both the good guys and the bad guys get faster computers does this advance in computer speed work to the advantage of the good guys the bad guys or does it not make any difference it works in advantage of bad guys if you know history key length started with bit to bit to and now which today is considered reasonable secure this size increase because computing power to crack keys needed by bad guys has increased so if you keep key size fixed becuase it is adequate for good guys bad guys has increased changes of cracking it with increase in their computing power Cryptanalysis Key size Data Encryption Standard Cryptography Brute force attack Public-key cryptography Password cracking Key (cryptography) Pretty Good Privacy RSA Advanced Encryption Standard Password One-time pad Symmetric key algorithm RISC Quantum computer Encryption Block cipher History of cryptography Enigma machine Elliptic curve cryptography Computer virus Cryptographic hash function Block cipher modes of operation 40-bit encryption XSL attack Stream cipher Hash table Topics in cryptography Snake oil (cryptography) Hardware random number generator Hash function MD5 Quicksort Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator Ultra Modem Windows XP Computer chess Initialization vector Rotor machine Wired Equivalent Privacy Code (cryptography) RC4 Quantum cryptography Blowfish (cipher) Computer security Caesar cipher EFF DES cracker Substitution cipher Central processing unit CPU cache IBM PC compatible Diffie-Hellman key exchange Rabin cryptosystem National Security Agency CPU design Ethernet Transmission Control Protocol MP3 Passphrase Tiny Encryption Algorithm Fast bowling Khufu and Khafre Clipper chip Secret sharing Mac OS X SAFER Drill bit A5/1 Pirate decryption MacGuffin (cipher) Modular exponentiation PaX Integer factorization Orders of magnitude (data) Pseudorandom number generator CRYPTREC Digital signature RC5 Computer Error correction and detection Advanced Encryption Standard process Next-Generation Secure Computing Base Sorting algorithm Buffer overflow Pseudorandomness Bombe Telegraphy ElGamal encryption Gas metal arc welding
