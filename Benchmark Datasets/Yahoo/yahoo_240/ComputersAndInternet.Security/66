any reason why my laptop password changed overnight it's worked away from school all summer but now suddenly it won't let me log on using my username and password on that network domain i can log on as the administrator to that network domain and also to various other accounts on my local machine only the password to my school account on the school domain isn't working i should mention that this account was logged on but locked overnight it was not in a public place where someone could physically alter the security settings i'm not connected to the school network from home so any changes that they might have done there will not affect my laptop account for instance they changed my network username when i got married earlier this summer and it didn't affect the username and password i use to log on my personal laptop at home i am one of network administrators my school sometimes does maintenence on the system and it changes my password you have to call the school and they will help you out Password User (computing) Windows XP Password cracking E-mail Oracle database GameFAQs Surveillance Files-11 Rootkit System/34 Google Talk Novell NetWare Database 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Caulfield Grammar School Laptop Stopping e-mail abuse Cross site scripting Virtual Network Computing Windows 2000 HIPAA E-mail spam Computer security System/36 Danger Hiptop Gmail Apple Open Collaboration Environment Buffer overflow Btrieve Wi-Fi Phishing LiveJournal USB flash drive Computer insecurity Domain Name System MMORPG IBM PC compatible Computer bus Two-factor authentication Home directory Database management system Cryptography Computer Remote administration MDAC Online shop Kerberos (protocol) X display manager Internet protocol spoofing Master Control Program Bluetooth Internet Relay Chat Secure Shell Independent Media Center Wheel of Fortune Hercules emulator Netfilter/iptables Spyware Gaia Online Concurrent Versions System OpenVPN Control-Alt-Delete Malware Intrusion-detection system Atari ST Virtual private network Japanese copyright law Active Directory Game show Octopus card Dictionary attack Anonymity Jumpstart 3rd Grade Closed-circuit television Wireless LAN Aspect-oriented programming Telephone tapping File system Rlogin Internet forum Perfect Dark Cheating in Counter-Strike Slashdot Unix security Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Key (lock) Control Panel (Windows) IBook Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista PowerPC Wardriving Hard disk Mach kernel IP Multimedia Subsystem Private branch exchange Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
