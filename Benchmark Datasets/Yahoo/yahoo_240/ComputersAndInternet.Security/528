how can i keep my new pc running optimally i just purchased a new dell laptop and received it yesterday i have been taking precautions to keep it running smoothly i installed mcaffee anti virus software i have strictly limited my internet access and web surfing i have no file sharing or instant messaging software and i plan on purchasing and installing webroot spy sweeper in the next few days here are my questions should i continue to limit my web surfing until i install spy sweeper if so which sites can i trust are yahoo google and related big name sites safer will simply using up storage space on my pc have a significant effect on its speed and efficiency that is can i upload music from commercial audio cds a safe source and not worry too much about slowed performance what can i do to keep my machine running fast what should i avoid what other precautions should i start or continue to take in order to keep my computer running optimally firefox or internet explorer for security anti virus by itself is not enough install the full mcafee security suite to get a firewall spyware protection etc the full suites work better best if you mix and match the different pieces doesn't recognize or trust each other and gives you confusing messages the software in the suites from mcafee or norton prevent bad things from getting into your computer some 'spy sweeper' just looks for spyware after it has infected your computer then removes them it's better to block bad things from ever getting in by storage space i take it you mean disk space as long as you still have of free disk space you get that by looking at properties on your disk drive icon in my computer window you don't need to worry when you have less than that amount it takes longer to defragment your disk drive run defragmentation and scan disk on your c disk at least once a month uninstall programs that you won't use for another months avoid free programs from the internet except for well recommended ones like firefox browser and zone alarm firewall which gives away the personal use version so people will gladly pay for the more useful business version once they are hooked they are free because you are offering free program debug service by using them i own two year old dell consumer laptops and i'm having problems with overheating turns out it was already a known problem with the model when i bought them so my advice is to subscribe to the dell users' forums free service and keep up dell experts monitors them and sometimes chimes in with their advice i would use both firefox is easier to use but you need internet explorer to access microsoft and get their free security updates a very important thing to do i would recommended accepting their recommended update policy of installation their update program which downloads the security updates you need unique to your computer and the programs you installed and install them at the time you pick like during dinner IBM PC compatible Trusted computing Skype Windows Vista AmigaOS Digital rights management Gmail Hard disk E-mail spam Malware Virtual memory Computer security Opera (web browser) Copy protection Internet Windows Server 2003 AOL Instant Messenger Computer Trojan horse (computing) History of Microsoft Windows File system Amiga IPod Microsoft Mac OS X Apple Macintosh MSN Messenger ITunes Embedded system Enterprise content management America Online OpenBSD Mandriva Linux Mozilla Application Suite Internet security Steam (content delivery) Timeline of computing 1990-forward Commodore 64 Computer forensics Web crawler DragonFly BSD Comparison of web browsers Redundant array of independent disks Common criticisms of Microsoft Warez Web hosting System 7 (Macintosh) Phishing Mach kernel Forth programming language Domain Name System Spam (electronic) CPU cache Password Online music store Blue screen of death Browser wars Knoppix Object Desktop Java programming language Computer insecurity Compiler optimization Streaming media Laptop Fritz-chip Proxy server Digital photography Mainframe computer Perl BitTorrent MMORPG Apple Computer HTTP cookie Linspire Mouse (computing) MP3 NPAPI XML Prodigy (ISP) Google OpenOffice.org
