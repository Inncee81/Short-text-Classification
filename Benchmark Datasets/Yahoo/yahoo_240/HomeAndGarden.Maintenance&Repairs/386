how do you adjust the govner on a briggs stratton hp motor i wouldnt mess with the governer if its a power issue well best result would be to get a larger motor power can also be attained from adjusting the carb only if it has the fuel mix screw in the bottom of the float bowl when its cold adjust the fuel mix screw all the way in gently as not to damage the tip then adjust out turns start the motor and adjust out till motor stumbles then back in till it smooths out if that doesnt work try cleaning the carb and resetting it messing with a governer could cause the motor to explode by overrevving the max rpm is only going over that could cause the flywheel to shatter and explosive results kidd Carburetor Drill bit Bong Toyota Prius Anchor Diesel engine E85 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Propeller Rotary engine Internal combustion engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Electric vehicle Flywheel energy storage Radio controlled airplane Automobile self starter Two-stroke cycle Gasoline Briggs & Stratton Toyota Corolla Ford Windsor engine VTEC Hybrid vehicle Lathe Four-stroke cycle Thermal power station Naval mine Phonograph Combine harvester Freewheel Battery electric vehicle Timpani Radio controlled car Engine tuning Spark plug Motor oil Electric motor Punt (boat) USS Tunny (SS-282) Fossil fuel power plant Jet engine Super Metroid Glacier Model aircraft USS S-32 (SS-137) Fuel injection Drill Chevrolet Small-Block engine Kart racing Alcohol fuel Screw Aircraft engine controls Variable Frequency Drive Drag racing Energy development Items in the Metroid series USS West Virginia (BB-48) Ford FE engine Electrical generator Nuclear fusion Helicopter Mazda RX-7 St. Nazaire Raid Oldsmobile V8 engine Screwdriver M16 (rifle) Toyota Land Cruiser Inertial confinement fusion Gas compressor Flywheel Nuclear power Stirling engine Honda Civic Hybrid Motorcycle Space shuttle main engine Railgun Hard disk Dodge Neon Uninterruptible power supply USS Tautog (SS-199) De Lorean DMC-12 Chevrolet Corvair engine Zero-emissions vehicle Honda Prelude BMW M5 Gas turbine Turbocharger Submarine Torpedo Violin Lawn mower Apollo 13 Transmission (mechanics) Rocket fuel Nitroglycerin Locomotive Model rocket Chevrolet Corvette Continuously variable transmission Wankel engine
