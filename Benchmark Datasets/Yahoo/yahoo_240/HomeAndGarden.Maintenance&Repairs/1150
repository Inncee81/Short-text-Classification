does anyone know which swimming pool pump has the best value for the money for both pool and spa i had a pool built just years ago my spa is not generating any bubbles or jets as it was the first year it has a hayward pump to filter both pool and spa this was highly recommended by the builder but now my pool cleaner guy cleans the filter every week so the spa can get some pressure he says that he wouldn't have bought a hayward pump also said he would have another pump for the spa i don't know anything about pools and want to learn so i don't have to second guess everyone in the pool business i don't have money to burn like some friends of mine that just keeps paying a pool guy to fix everything for them i would like to do it myself and save my money any comments or suggestions are welcomed thank you in advance the pump is probably not the problem i would guess the filter is getting plugged up how often do you backwash it and if it is a sand filter how old is the sand in it sand is only good for about two years and if it has a paper type filter cartridge these can be cleaned and or replaced as well and that will make a huge difference in the pressure as you know filters do not last very long a paper filter if used four months a year should be replaced every two years for max operating pressure it does not seem like this would help that much but you would be surprised as far as the pump swim quip makes a good pump Carburetor Swimming pool Motor oil Diving E85 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Heinkel He 100 Solar power Diesel engine Fountain Water supply Dialysis Energy development Mutual fund Thermal power station Sewage treatment Loudspeaker Brewery Inkjet printer Turbocharger Rifle Welding Hydraulic machinery Two-stroke cycle Siphon Dairy Tire Make money fast Deflation (economics) Sauna Vacuum cleaner Phase-locked loop Vacuum Bong Space shuttle main engine Publication of Darwin's theory Jet engine Electronic organ Cranford, New Jersey Bretton Woods system Hydrogen economy Carbon dioxide Dry cleaning Ocean's Twelve Autonomous building South Bank Parklands, Brisbane Nintendo 64 Insurance Gross domestic product Portable stove Locomotive Mortgage Breastfeeding Automobile emissions control Piccolo Junior Saga Ocean thermal energy conversion Carnivorous plant Hot tub Habbo Hotel Hard disk BS 1363 Little Britain Diving suit Pump It Up Windows XP Droitwich Spa Infusion pump Marine aquarium Peer review Carl G.
