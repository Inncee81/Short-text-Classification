yardman mower starts but quits when throttle is advanced mower worked okay five days ago new gas put in spark plug looks fairly clean filter not very dirty will run at at a low to moderate speed but dies when throttle is moved all the way forward as if it is being chocked down the choke is activated by pushing in on a little rubber bulb which springs back out after each push how would i check the choke for proper action i'm thinking it might be stuck in the choke position can anyone help after some answers i put carburetor cleaner liquid on the carburetor cleaned the area on top of the carburetor wiggled the control wires mashed all along the length of the rubber tube from the gas tank to the carburetor and left the gas cap loose the mower started okay and kept running even when i advanced the throttle then stopped twice while i was mowing but then kept on working until i was able to mow the whole front yard and both side yards thanks everybody i don't know what made it start working but i am very appreciative of all the suggestions the fuel filter may not look dirty but change it only a couple of dollars it may be dirty enough that when more throttle is needed it cant supply the fuel also check clean your air filter that will cause it also Fuel injection Lawn mower E85 Aircraft engine controls Motorcycle Motor oil Diesel engine Toyota Prius Two-stroke cycle Strap-on dildo Shotgun Spark plug Bong Tank Chevrolet Corvair engine Internal combustion engine Jet engine Thermal power station Radio controlled airplane Tractor Space shuttle main engine Internal ballistics Professional wrestling holds Four-stroke cycle Hybrid vehicle Honda Prelude Turbocharger Fire fighting Dry cleaning Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Radio controlled car M16 (rifle) Ford Crown Victoria STS-51-L Automobile emissions control Mooney M20 Chevrolet Corvair Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Helicopter Fossil fuel power plant Air filter Siphon Steam engine Diode Rocket fuel Gnome Monosoupape Flamethrower Energy development Manual transmission Aerial (dance move) Transmission (mechanics) Drag racing Tire Swimming pool Rotary engine Explosive material Engine Control Unit Vacuum cleaner Turbojet Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Equine conformation Automobile Welding Incandescent light bulb Dialysis Bernoulli's principle P-61 Black Widow Lift (force) Combine harvester Spacecraft propulsion Alcohol fuel Vacuum tube Novelty (locomotive) Hydraulic machinery Hydrogen economy Solar power Ford Ranger EV B-47 Stratojet Professional wrestling throws Tunisia Campaign Rebreather Nuclear power Universal Serial Bus Apollo 8
