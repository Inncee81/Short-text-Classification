what is the difference between lumber drier and a torrefaction a machine for making thermo lumber i am working in a lumber company and we want to buy a drier to produce thermo lumber we were adviced to use the torrefaction i dont know the exact difference between a drier and a torrefaction i guess the drier works at a lower temperature so that we decrease the moisture or humidity and then we use the torrefaction to make the moisture humidity reaches i hope anyone can help me to know more info about this i will be thankful if someone can tell me about companies which sells driers and torrefactions i really appreciate your help and thank u torrefaction involves heating wood at relatively high temperatures to improve the properties of the wood without the addition of chemicals or toxic substances the process is different from heat treatment in that it is done in an oxygen deprived environment to prevent the wood from igniting which means it is possible to heat the wood to temperatures of between c and c at these temperatures the molecular structure of the wood is altered enhancing some of the wood s physical properties specifically its colour dimensional stability and resistance to fungal decay more efficient than drying torrefaction eliminates the water and sap present in the wood along with the adsorbed water contained in the wood cells reducing the moisture content of wood to practically Wood Air conditioning Carbon dioxide Lumber Corrosion Hydrogen Pottery Hydrogen peroxide Solar power Alcohol fuel Fiberglass Thermodynamics Gasoline Water Water (molecule) Global warming and agriculture Plastic Ammonia Nutrition Temperature Deforestation Polyethylene terephthalate Sewage treatment Aluminium Transformer Alkane Humidity E85 Carbon Solar cell Renewable energy Plutonium Phase (matter) Epoxy Alcohol Helium Sterilization (microbiology) Ecology Sulfur Motor oil Acetic acid Haloalkane Energy development Chemistry Polychlorinated biphenyl Ceramics Hydrogen economy Rocket fuel Nuclear power Food preservation Psoriasis Portland cement Hyperthermia Chemical reaction Breathing gas Fire fighting Methanol Desert Technetium Manganese Biochemistry Carnivorous plant DNA repair Coffee Cancer Uranium Fire extinguisher Straw-bale construction Nuclear magnetic resonance Brewery Ozone depletion Iron Dehumidifier Autonomous building Water vapor Radiometric dating Enzyme Diseases of the honeybee Stainless steel Moisturizer Hydrochloric acid Entropy Spectroscopy Exergy Spark plug Diamond Water purification Wood pulp Decomposition Oxygen sensor Heat index
