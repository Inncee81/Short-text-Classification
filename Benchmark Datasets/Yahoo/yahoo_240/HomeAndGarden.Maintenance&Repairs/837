water coming out between the wall and floor i have been trying to solve this problem for months initially i thought it was the heater water coming out from the temperature outlet drain after the heater technican checked we found out that the water is actually coming out between the floor and wall i have never experience water coming out from such spot shouldn't the water goes down to my downstair neighbour instead if there is any pipe leaking inside the wall i suspect the water might have come from the shower area floor meaning the water go in through some crack and travel about cm and come out to between the floor wall joint is it possible have anybody experience it before behind where the tub water outlet shower head pipe and water handles penetrate the shower you have your pipes hot cold or drain lines could be the culprit it would be easy enough to verify that the shower head pipe is tight just get a pair of adjustable pliers and a towel keeps the pliers from marring the pipe and give a little twist clockwise if it's tight it's not the problem you might be able to remove the handles from the hot and cold valves and then remove the cover plates to see if there is moisture in this area just use a flashlight or stick a twisted up paper towel inside the gap and see if it comes back wet if this doesn't find the leak you will probably end up tearing into the wall i wouldn't wait too long to find it the damage could be traveling inside the wall to places you haven't found yet good luck to ya Thermal power station Sento Fecal incontinence Sauna Domestic water system Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Furnace Spark plug Vacuum tube Brewery Menstrual cup Plumbing fixture Japanese toilet Cruising (maritime) Tire Customs and etiquette of Japan HVAC Casting Apollo 13 Glossary of firefighting terms Welding Urinary incontinence Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Poker jargon Diving suit Solar power Soldering Reading spark plugs for racing Dialysis Siphon Thermostat Volleyball Home repair Combine (Half-Life 2) Hyperthermia Upholstery Chevrolet Corvair engine Hydraulic machinery The Inside Drill bit Pliers Fossil fuel power plant Swimming pool Nuclear power E85 Bathroom Carburetor Dodge Neon Towel Equine conformation Rail terminology Chevrolet Corvair Pottery Bong Anal sex Passive solar Fire hydrant Bathing Cannabis cultivation Traumatic brain injury Opportunity rover Climate of the United Kingdom Toilet paper Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Dishwasher Wrench Oxyacetylene Plastic Electrical wiring Glossary of partner dance terms Internal ballistics Autonomous building Massage Sleeve valve Diseases of the honeybee RuneScape quests Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Glacier Hydrogen economy Gay bathhouse Rope Heat Water Happy Tree Friends Escape from New York Hard disk Fan (implement) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lake District Water heater
