do air purifiers make your walls and carpets black i have been told by different people that air purifiers made their walls carpets and window hangings black air purifiers that work by ionizing the air will tend to leave a black residue on surfaces that is the dust that it pulled out of the air the way these purifiers work is that they change the 'charge' on the air dust as it passes thru the machine then those charged ions will be attracted to surfaces with the opposite charge thus the residue on surfaces these particular types of machines wreak havoc with some computers too by the way if you need an air purifier i first recommend starting with your central air filter start off by using a better quality of filter there and change that filter regularly it also helps if you use a vacuum cleaner with a hepa filter to prevent blowing the really fine dust right thru the machine and out into the air again now you're ready to look at air cleaners if you don't mind the residue on the surfaces then you may prefer a machine that ionizes the air they tend to be quiter than a traditional 'filter' type air cleaner i wouldnt put it in the same room as my computer tho personally i prefer filter products all the dirt dust is trapped in the filter right where i want it good luck Vacuum cleaner Dry cleaning Air purifier Vacuum Water purification Nuclear fallout Drill bit Diode Dairy Vacuum tube Mass spectrometry Electrostatic precipitator Carburetor Carpet Bong Hard disk Welding Basement Corona discharge Ion Air filter Solar power Catalytic converter Glass Sun Particulate Radiation hardening Lighting Liquid crystal display House dust mite Roomba Syphon Filter Mattress Coffee Printed circuit board Laundry detergent Air conditioning Soap E85 Electrophysiology Magnet Helium Cathode ray tube Air pollution Water (molecule) Nuclear weapon design Internal ballistics Casting Sugarcane Polarization Silicon Motor oil Water Tenshinhan Window Textile manufacturing Screw Brazing G-Man (Half-Life) Tattoo Dust Typewriter Nuclear explosion Loudspeaker Spark plug HVAC Radio controlled car Radon Cannabis cultivation Cassini-Huygens Sake Fan (implement) Bulk vending Ice core Contact lens Sulfuric acid Electronic amplifier GunBound Aluminium Leo Frank Knife Ionizing radiation Dialysis Firewall (networking) Filtration Ammonia Kirby Corporation Lionel Corporation Haloalkane Colonization of the Moon Zinc Directed-energy weapon Fusion power Tank Diving suit
