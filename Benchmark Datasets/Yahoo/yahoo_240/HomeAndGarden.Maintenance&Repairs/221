sagging ceiling reinforcing with steel beam i am looking at buying a house while during the orginal inspection i noticed a that the ceiling was saggin in the loungeroom it is an old style colonial house built i imagine around i had a building inspector come in today that said that is could be fixed by running a steel beam along the roof from the front of the house to the back at a degree angle to the rafters and tyeing them up to it has anyone done this before or has advice on this situation do you think it will solve the issue without creating more problems how much do you think this will set me back i would appreciate any and all insights i'm sorry but a building inspector is not qualified or licensed to do structural design although his suggestion might work there are other solutions that may be better also you don't know what size beam to use where to place it and how to tie in the other building members but first you need to determine why the ceiling is sagging is there termite damage was the original design inadequate has the house been abused my recommendation is to hire a licensed structural engineer to examine the house and to make a recommendation he can give you an estimate of the cost to make the repair ultimately if you do decide to buy the house he can prepare a set of drawings for submittal to your local building authority for the necessary permits Seismic retrofit San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Roof Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Air-raid shelter Software engineering Mattress Autogyro Motion picture rating system Lighting Freedom Tower Basement Electrical wiring Timber framing Light-frame construction Elevator Francis Petre Microeconomics Reinforced concrete Extreme Programming Beam (structure) Buckingham Palace St Albans Cathedral Space Shuttle program Iraq disarmament crisis Termite Public domain Project Orion Architect Limit state design Pretty Good Privacy Slide rule Straw-bale construction Welding Structural engineering Hyatt Regency walkway collapse Wilton House Toronto-Dominion Centre Kitchen Emissions trading Wood Scottish Parliament Building Trademark Copyright Automobile Sydney Opera House Lawyer Retaining wall Screw Bicycle lighting Grand Central Terminal Expert system Alexander Technique Fabrication (metal) Construction Solar power satellite Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airbus A380 Appeal Copyright law of the United Kingdom Sears Tower Hubble Space Telescope Truss Vickers Valiant Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Parliament of Canada Cascading Style Sheets De Lorean DMC-12 Glossary of firefighting terms John Hancock Tower Product Lifecycle Management Overhead lines Colony in Space Heinkel He 100 Peer review Scientology beliefs and practices Wayne Corporation ISO 9000 Tire M16 (rifle) Space elevator Oscilloscope Helicopter Pilot certification in the United States Sudoku Boat building RX-78 mobile suit series Tudorbethan architecture Bus models used in New York City Transit Fusion power Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Piano Common Fisheries Policy Capitalism Education in England Speed limit Wood carving Santos-Dumont 14-bis Equine conformation
