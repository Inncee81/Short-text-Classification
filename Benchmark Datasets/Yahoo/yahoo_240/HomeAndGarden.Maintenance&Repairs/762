any advice on damage to a roomate's coffee table i accidently spilled like four drops off acetone on the wood of her wood and glass coffee table four drops spots you can't even see unless you're looking originally she told me it was okay and i told her id pay for the materials to fix it now she's getting quotes on getting it fixed and she said it will be between dollars i think that price is absolutely ridiculous she said it will cost that much because they cant just fix the spot they have to revarnish the entire table or whatever i dont have the money to pay for it right now due to moving and school and just being poor and i dont really know if its reasonable to expect me to pay to have her whole table to be revarnished any advice acetone is an extremely fast drying solvent there is no way it could have damaged more then a minimal microscopic outer layer of any wood finish and a polishing spray like pledge should be more then enough to polish away the temporary dull spot the acetone might have made sounds like you and the room mate have more issues to deal with besides a coffee table problem and just for the record in the future dont offer to pay for anything till you are sure what the cost might be too many somewhat friends will be quick to take advantage when they can Acetone Solvent Bretton Woods system Illegal drug trade Inkjet printer Fire fighting Upholstery Mortgage Nuclear power Microeconomics Life insurance Coffee Perfume Arbitrage Alcohol fuel Insurance Haloalkane Soldering Organic peroxide Lacquer Poker jargon Blackjack Annuity Glass Public policy Gold standard Knife Dairy Solar cell Make money fast Acetone peroxide Craps Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Supersonic transport Software patent debate Gambling Betting (poker) FairTax Petroleum Flat tax Pottery Fusion power San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Health insurance MMORPG Tariff Laser engraving Wood Bond Economy of Russia Table saw Diamond simulant Supply and demand Monetary policy Economics Yerba mate Seismic retrofit PE ratio Rational pricing Lathe Manicure Student loan Inhalant MDAC Gramophone record 2005 trial of Michael Jackson View camera Stereoscopy Contract Enron Corporation History of Alaska GunZ The Duel CPU cache Water (molecule) Cable television Printed circuit board Dry cleaning Natural Selection (computer game) Advertising Friction Ozone depletion Diabetes mellitus Capital accumulation Casting Cosmo Kramer Laserdisc The Dalek Invasion of Earth Battery (electricity) Capitalism 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The Time Machine Chess opening Chess strategy and tactics Space elevator Rigging Chloroform
