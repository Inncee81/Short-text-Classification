why did my clothes dryer vent catch fire the strange thing is that the dryer was not even running nor had it been running recently when the fire happened the washer was running at the time the washer and dryer plug into seperate wall outlets as well we also make it a point to clean the lint remover after every dryer cycle thanks for your responses thanks for all the responses my landlord checked it and the power cord was touching the dryer vent and somehow got hot enough to ignite it he is replacing the dryer thank goodness it almost has to be an old dryer with a standing pilot the new dryers don't have those so are safer the only other explanation would be that this is not the first lint fire in the dryer and that the insulation on the wires got burnt off and they can now touch and cause sparks which would ignite a fire sounds like its time for a new dryer either way Spark plug Reading spark plugs for racing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Thermal power station Dry cleaning Residual-current device Internal combustion engine Washing machine Campfire High-voltage hazards Upholstery Motor oil Cruising (maritime) Electrical wiring Firearm Violin Japanese toilet Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis National Electrical Code (US) Diving suit Transformer Two-stroke cycle Thermostat Spontaneous human combustion Fire fighting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Hydrogen peroxide Ignition system Four-stroke cycle Engine knocking BS 1363 Rocket fuel Apollo 8 Fuse (electrical) Space disaster Carburetor Furnace STS-61 Cartridge (firearms) Carbon dioxide Automobile emissions control Hindenburg disaster M60 machine gun Dualism (philosophy of mind) Glossary of firefighting terms Steam engine Laundry Toilet Fire Tier One Mains electricity Diesel engine Spark gap Apollo 1 Space shuttle main engine IPod Seismic retrofit Solar power Menstrual cup Tinder Volcano E85 Syphon Filter Model rocket Lithium ion battery Cheating in Counter-Strike Briggs & Stratton Incandescent light bulb Top Fuel Oxyacetylene Casting Samovar Blasting cap Air conditioning White phosphorus incendiary Basement Bullet Model aircraft Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Volleyball Tesla coil Space Shuttle program Textile manufacturing Knife Electrical breakdown Biodiesel Soap Machine gun Wild ARMs 2 Jack plug The Ark in Space Diaper Social rule Stirling engine Dishwasher Wood fuel Aircraft engine Wood Glossary of firefighting equipment Distributor
