do i need a voltage reducer i have an ez go v battery setup i want to hook up some v accesories and i was told that i would only need a reducer if i had a v setup and i dont need one for my v golf cart thanks if all the batteries are connected in series all you need to do is connect your power wires to the terminal of the first batteries positive terminal and the negative terminal of the second battery otherwise you will need a voltage reducer you can test the two battery setup with a voltage tester recommended or simply get a volt automotive taillamp bulb if the bulb is too dim or it immediately burns out you've done something incorrectly the accessories you are installing if rated for a maximum volt usage will burn out prematurely if the voltage is too high if you don't understand electricity why don't you talk to an electrician or have a professional installer work with you Volt Battery (electricity) RS-232 Oscilloscope Headlight Three-phase electric power Diode Circuit design Resistor Tesla coil Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Capacitor Electricity distribution Vacuum tube Welding Bicycle lighting Battery electric vehicle Lineman (occupation) Solar cell Electrical element Nickel-cadmium battery George Westinghouse Split phase Electricity Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Circuit breaker Digital circuit Antenna (radio) Spark plug High-voltage hazards High-voltage direct current Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Universal Serial Bus Fuse (electrical) Series and parallel circuits Voltage source SCSI Hybrid vehicle Transformer P-n junction Automotive lighting Impedance matching Alternating current Thermostat Switch Operational amplifier Spark gap Dimmer Electrician Electrophysiology Decibel Electrodeless lamp Lead-acid battery Uninterruptible power supply Electric power transmission X10 (industry standard) Electricity meter Phantom power Third rail Mercury arc valve Electrical resistance Electric motor Electromotive force Voltmeter Telephone exchange Lithium ion battery Action potential Voltage regulator Fluorescent lamp Electricity pylon Oxygen sensor Wind turbine Electrical wiring Power line communication Variable Frequency Drive CMOS Electrical wiring (UK) Hybrid Synergy Drive Stage lighting MOSFET Direct current Wind power Current source Gas metal arc welding Thermal power station Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Power (physics) Lighting Light switch Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
