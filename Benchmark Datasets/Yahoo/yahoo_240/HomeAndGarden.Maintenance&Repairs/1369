electricians please help basement lights and plugs stopped working on same line for no apparent reason a few days ago all the basement lights and plugs stopped working we hadn't done any eletrical work the basement is unfinished and damp the breaker is not tripped and is tight and seems to be working properly i checked plugs and switches for any power and there's no power any suggestions of what i could check there is not a reset outlet in the basement first homeowner installed electrical in basement help there is an open circuit somewhere you or an electrician will need to trace it back and repair it if it is just one circuit everything is in parallel so one open connection in the hot wire or neutral kills all of the downstream devices turn off the breaker and start checking the backs of the receptacles for a bad connection make sure you always test the wires for voltage before touching anything you might find that the previous owner made a bad wire nut connection inside a box or used the push in connectors on a receptacle without stripping enough insulation once you find the mistake check for the same error in all of the connections a pro will pigtail the devices onto the daisy chained wire segments to minimize this kind of problem be safe Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device National Electrical Code (US) BS 1363 Circuit breaker Universal Serial Bus Three-phase electric power Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Distribution board Switch Fuse (electrical) Electrician Electrical wiring (UK) Spark plug Alternating current Oscilloscope STS-61 Relay Transformer Ground and neutral Circuit design Ring circuit Thermal power station Electrical wiring Vacuum tube Overhead lines Computer bus Fluorescent lamp RS-232 Embedded system Digital circuit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster X10 (industry standard) Lineman (occupation) High-voltage direct current Capacitor Action potential Incandescent light bulb Spark gap Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electric motor Resistor Extension Cord Commodore 64 Jack plug Seismic retrofit Thermostat D-subminiature Semiconductor device PDP-11 Carburetor Screw Electrophysiology IPod Electrical generator Solar power Tire Gender of connectors and fasteners 2003 North America blackout Tesla coil Short circuit Enigma machine Poker jargon TIA-568A/B Mains electricity Telephone exchange TGV Printed circuit board Solar cell Reading spark plugs for racing MOSFET Ground (electricity) Radiation hardening Electrical breakdown Electricity meter Capacitor plague Transistor Rail terminology Dimmer Seismometer Cruising (maritime) Volt Power line communication Programmable logic controller Welding Glossary of climbing terms Diode Central processing unit Hall effect Ignition system Atari 8-bit family Light switch Digital Subscriber Line Battery electric vehicle
