death of our vacuum my eureka vacuum seems to have lost it's will to live or it's possesed i was in the middle of vacuuming our house when the circuit's popped i reset the breaker's and tried to plug the vacuum back in it was turned off and the connection started sparking before it was fully plugged in does anyone know where i can start troubleshooting can it be that the cord just needs to be replaced if someone can help i would truly appreciate it for i cannot afford to replace it right now thank you i have the same exact problem with my electric leaf blower but i've yet to fix it anyway since it was turned off and it still sparked i suspect the problem is with the portion of the wire that's before the switch or the switch itself if that's the case then it would not cost too much money to fix or replace if you know how to open the vacuum then check the connections to the switch and make sure no black wire is touching a white wire if none of the wires are touching then the problem could be with the switch just get a new one from eureka if your vacuum isn't too old it should be covered under the warranty but even if it isn't a switch should not cost that much finally if none of that solves the problem then it could be the motor clean it out and make sure nothing is stuck in the fan or motor you'll have to unscrew a couple things to get to it but it's not that hard to do it Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Switch Electric motor Residual-current device BS 1363 Thermostat Relay Fan (implement) Enigma machine Vacuum tube Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Computer IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Distribution board Oscilloscope Spark gap Violin Central processing unit STS-61 Three-phase electric power Ignition system Embedded system Rail terminology Digital circuit Transistor USB flash drive Electrical wiring (UK) Welding Mouse (computing) Overhead lines Jack plug Toyota Prius X10 (industry standard) Dairy Ford Ranger EV Solar power Ground and neutral Circuit design Distributor Light switch Incandescent light bulb History of computing hardware Secure Digital card Poker jargon Universal Serial Bus Tesla coil Telephone exchange Cray-1 Alternating current Modem Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Electronic amplifier Computer forensics Electrical generator National Electrical Code (US) Fluorescent lamp Wire Lightning rod Ethernet Mattress Vacuum cleaner Aluminium Motor oil Maxwell's equations Power strip Exact solutions in general relativity Hearing aid Firearm Aircraft engine controls Logic gate Transmitter Professional wrestling slang Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Integrated circuit Model aircraft Gauge theory High-voltage direct current Windows XP Motorcycle Debugging Reading spark plugs for racing Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Xbox Kerr metric Telephone Printed circuit board Modchip Floppy disk Brain Hall effect Battery electric vehicle Pinball Coaxial cable
