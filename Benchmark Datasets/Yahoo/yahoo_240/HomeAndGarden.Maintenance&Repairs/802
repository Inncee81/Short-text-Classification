house a c unit is not cooling properly i'm at my girl friend's loft and one of her a c units is not cooling it keeps running and running but the room is at or above she had service done to it months ago and they supposedly added freon it had been bone dry they said the was probably a leak but did not find it or look for it what are the signs that the freon is out again how does one find a leak one of the insulated copper pipes that run into or out of the unit was frozen block of ice i turned the unit off and in about hrs it has all melted it would cool properly now until it froze again thanks it is low on freon again you can have it gassed up again but i would ask for them to find and fix the leak depending on where the leak is this could be a costly undertaking once they find the leak you still have to remove what freon is still in the unit to a holding tank pressurize the system with nitrogen fix the leak repressurize with nitrogen to make sure it doesnt leak anymore pull a vacumun on the system to hergs minumun if it will not do this you still have a leak then recharge the system with freon to do a job like this without replacing either the a coil or condensing unit will still cost dollars and up depending on where you live plus parts and extra freon to the make up the difference between what they saved from your system and what it needs to operate properly to repair a leak with out replacing anything i charge dollars plus parts nitrogen freon silver solder and liquid line filter dryer it is legal to just put more freon in the unit as long as it does not have to have more than percent of the total charge installed yearly by one service man in other words one service man can only recharge it once a year legally without fixing the leak Air conditioning Soldering Refrigerator Carbon dioxide Ammonia Water (molecule) Solar power Cray-1 Thermal power station Carburetor Brewery Printed circuit board Casting Nuclear power Space Shuttle external tank Nitrogen Ice cream Hydrogen economy Water purification Spark plug Fossil fuel power plant Internal combustion engine Sewage treatment Irrigation Autonomous building Dairy Town gas Fuel cell Solder Fire extinguisher Gas metal arc welding Explosive material Apollo 13 Thermostat Cryogenics Rocket fuel Superconductivity Glass Phase (matter) Air pollution Phase change heat pump Heat Cryonics Toyota Prius Helium Electrical wiring Ice Pebble bed reactor Bong Diving suit Mattress Overclocking Plastic Pound sterling Gasoline Euro Water vapor Brazing Battery (electricity) Vacuum Relay Tire Alcohol fuel Ceramics Solar cell Liquefied natural gas Hydrogen Oxy-fuel welding and cutting High-voltage direct current Motor oil Capacitor Plame affair Breathing gas Inflation Natural gas Nickel-cadmium battery Hybrid vehicle Hydraulic machinery Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Fluorescent lamp Hydrogen peroxide Liquid nitrogen economy Space disaster Menstrual cup United States dollar Seismic retrofit Energy development Engine cooling Items in the Metroid series
