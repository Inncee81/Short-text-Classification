why is the tap water in my house not cold its not hot just medium enough to need ice for watering my animals if it is real warm you probably live in the south where the frost line is not very deep if the frost line is only or feet below the surface you can bet you water line is only that deep in the summer the sun heats the upper layers of soil so the incoming water is warmer i live in the the north and my water line is ' below the surface and the water is still quite warm compared to what it is in february if you are on a well you can run your tap for a while to get the cold ground water into your house if you are on city water chances are the city lines are at the same depth as your line so it will not cool off no matter how long you keep it running Water Frost Lake Ocean thermal energy conversion Deep lake water cooling Water (molecule) Cloud Renewable energy Geography of Africa Thermoregulation Water vapor Glacier Urban heat island Little Ice Age Atlantic Ocean Sun Thunderstorm Permafrost Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Global climate model Severe weather terminology (United States) Manchuria Arctic Ocean Ice Opportunity rover Refrigerator Geography of Russia El Ni__o Desert Enceladus (moon) Geography of Bolivia Ice core Ozone depletion Hydropower Effects of global warming Climate of the Alps Dundas Square Volcano Heat Brewery Sea ice Global warming Hot spring Weathering Soil Ozone hole Air conditioning Solar power Hippeastrum Thermohaline circulation Ecology Geography of Ireland Seismic retrofit Carbon dioxide Geography of Japan Mars Polar Lander Solar variation Yosemite National Park Avalanche Europa (moon) Coffee Degree Fahrenheit Earth's atmosphere Greenhouse effect Drowning Carnivorous plant Swimming pool Water resources Flood geology Heat exchanger Anticyclone Star Trek planet classifications Mars Climate change Wind Stirling engine Tap (valve) Leaf Convection Precipitation (meteorology) Weather front Autonomous building Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Tofu Passive solar Antarctic krill Geodesic dome Environmental concerns with electricity generation Ecology of Hong Kong Drainage Campfire Winter Plasma (physics) K__ppen climate classification Robot Master Weather lore Satellite temperature measurements
