how to test outlet for power i have a cheap ohm meter or whatever it's called haven't used it in a long time i have an outlet that does not work i want to test the power supply to see if i have power do i just hold one piece of the tester to the hot and neutral wire does it matter which one i hold where no the outlet does not work i want to test the power supply to the outlet to determine whether there is power there or not if there is i'll know it's just the outlet and it needs replaced working with live electrical current can be hazardous do not attempt this measurement without the proper tools and safeguards always test your test equipment for proper operation before use turn on any wall switches that may control an outlet it is surprising the number of times an electrician will be called out for a non functioning outlet only to solve it by flipping a switch another thing to check is that the circuit breaker or fuse is intact and that no gfci outlet controlling the branch has tripped testing an outlet can be as simple as plugging in a light to see if it goes on of course always test your test equipment first if that light doesn't work and you test an outlet and assume there is no current because the light doesn't go on you may be in for a shock a more thorough way to test electrical outlets involves the use of an outlet tester this device will not only indicate if the outlet has power it will also indicate if the outlet is grounded and whether the hot and common wires are reversed the device could not be easier to use and costs only a few dollars generally you plug the device in and note the pattern of the lights the legend printed on the device describes what the lights indicate follow all of the instructions provided by the manufacturer if a outlet is identified as being miswired or does not have proper ground you should not use the outlet until the problem is resolved in the case of a miswired outlet or absent ground the problem may occur at the problem outlet or somewhere else in the branch circuit do some detective work to determine the extent of the problem before attempting any repairs National Electrical Code (US) Circuit breaker BS 1363 Digital circuit Transformer Oscilloscope Three-phase electric power Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Computer Spark plug Distribution board Telephone exchange Transistor Vacuum tube Earthing system Relay Alternating current Embedded system Switch Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Central processing unit Operational amplifier Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electricity STS-61 X10 (industry standard) Ethernet RS-232 Universal Serial Bus Power strip Ground and neutral Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Diode Lawn mower Resistor Audiophile Thermostat Fusion power Electrical wiring (UK) Electrophysiology Impedance Carburetor Solar power Musical Instrument Digital Interface Loudspeaker Ohm's law Enigma machine Magnetic core memory Electrical wiring Collision detection Extreme Programming USB flash drive Capacitor Overhead lines Electricity meter Electrician Printed circuit board Amateur telescope making Fluorescent lamp Voice over IP Lineman (occupation) High-voltage direct current Impedance matching Radar Current (electricity) Ground (electricity) Electrical generator Light switch Jack plug Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Airport Antenna (radio) Lightning Lighting Rail terminology Gas metal arc welding Hall effect Password Surveillance Solar cell Reliability engineering CPU cache Seismometer Hydraulic machinery Telephone Semiconductor device Information warfare Electrical network Integrated circuit Mains electricity Transmission line
