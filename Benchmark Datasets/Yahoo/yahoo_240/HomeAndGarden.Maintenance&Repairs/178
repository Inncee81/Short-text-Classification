my toilet keeps running after being flushed is there an easy fix the problem is that the stopper plug doesn't return directly in the hole immediately after a flush i tried shortening and lengthening the chain to no avail to fix the problem each time i have to reach into the tank and place the stopper plug directly into the hole why can't it do that on its own how can i fix it if you've tried adjusting the chain the next step would be replacing the flapper that's the part you're referring to as the stopper plug sometimes flappers just don't seal well when they get old the rubber can get stiff or brittle sometimes especially on cheap flappers the chain can snag on itself when you flush turn off the water to the toilet pull off the old flapper and chain and take it to the hardware store a new flapper won't cost more than the job shouldn't take more than an hour Flush toilet Carburetor Japanese toilet Glossary of climbing terms Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Menstrual cup Toilet paper Energy development Spark plug Motorcycle Thermostat IPod Tire Floppy disk CPU cache Strap-on dildo Hash table Drill bit Redundant array of independent disks Dairy Homer Simpson Toilet E85 Plastic Brewery Flapper Autonomous building M16 (rifle) Equine conformation Personal computer Condom Hydroponics Commodore 64 Bong Sailing Corrosion Knot Fecal incontinence Thermal power station Windows XP Siphon Poker jargon Cruising (maritime) Dr. Cossack Hydrogen economy Scrabble (game show) Undergarment Texas hold 'em Virtual memory AmigaOS Cray-1 IBM PC Clinker (boat building) Just In Time PLATO Windows 2000 Diving suit Washroom Computer forensics Modem Naval mine Slot machine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Locomotive Domestic water system Expert system USS Vestal (AR-4) Urinal Hard disk Solar power Sewage treatment Violin Atari ST Toilet humour Fountain pen Reading spark plugs for racing Nuclear power Computer Coupling (railway) Diving Nintendo Entertainment System Gramophone record Debugging Robot Master Rebreather Enigma machine Baroque chess Rigging Plumbing fixture Textile manufacturing Rail tracks Cribbage Glossary of American football Capacitor plague Married... with Children Embedded system Conker's Bad Fur Day BS 1363 RISC Heinkel He 112
