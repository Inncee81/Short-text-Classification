roommate and air conditioning issues so my roommate and i are arguing over the temperature in our apartment i think is more efficient to have the apartment set a one temp and never change it she insists that we have at when we are there pm am and then turn it up to when we aren't there am pm i need help and how to explain to here what is the best way to save some money oh i forgot to say that we live in georgia so the temp outside is not the coolest of the temperatures i have heard that old wives tale before that it will consume more energy if you keep the house at a higher temperature while you are gone the enegy required to keep a room at a certain temperature is related to the difference between the inside and outside temperatures and the amount of time the difference is forced to exist by heating or cooling so the most enegy efficient temperature at all times is to keep the house as close to the outdoortemperature as you can reasonably tolerate in my opinion you could get used to c while you are there and turn the air off while you are out if you don't have pets another option is to get a programmable thermostat with a timer so when you get home the house is already comfortable when i lived in miami most folks kept the air conditioner at c when at home depending on different costs for electricity at different hours your electric bill may not reflect the energy savings too clearly Temperature Energy development Thermostat Heat Turbocharger Autonomous building Welding Wind power Transformer Nuclear power Air conditioning Embedded system Internal combustion engine Energy Incandescent light bulb HVAC Renewable energy Jet engine Furnace Solar cell Refrigerator Water vapor Nuclear fusion Hydrogen economy Spacecraft propulsion Lighting Axial compressor Pebble bed reactor Hydropower Inflation Thermoregulation Alcohol fuel Carburetor Fuel injection Fire fighting Water (molecule) Resistor Superconductivity Peltier-Seebeck effect Sun Battery (electricity) Phase (matter) Fuel cell Urban heat island Deep lake water cooling Daylight saving time Optical fiber Nuclear weapon design Laser Solar sail Apollo 13 Hot air balloon Thermal power station Diesel engine Entropy MOSFET Climate change Future energy development Economy of Russia Phase change heat pump Circuit design Thermodynamics Ceramics Nuclear reactor Phase transition Environmental concerns with electricity generation Swamp cooler Fusion power E85 Global warming Internal ballistics Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum tube Turbofan Climate of the United Kingdom Diode Wind turbine Labor theory of value Sauna Water Spark plug Polyethylene terephthalate Motor oil Global climate model Gasification Nuclear power phase-out Toyota Prius Electrical wiring Ironing SR-71 Blackbird Dairy Turbojet Steam engine
