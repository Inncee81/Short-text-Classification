why does my water pipe leak again the pipe runs under the house alongside a few others a few months ago it developed a crack or something and started leaking i cut out the bad part of the pipe like or so and installed a new one with compression fittings now months later the same pipe is leaking like feet from the old crack and there are no joints or anything seems like cracks develop in the pipe for some reason i'm afraid that if i fix this one a new one might appear in some new spot could it be some defective pipe or is it touching something that makes it corrode or something please help the pipe is copper by the way the wall thickness of the copper makes a big difference most residential applications use type m copper there are types of copper pipe printed on the whole length of the pipe are some markings denoting manufacturer date made working pressure and type of pipe the color tells a plumber at a glance what type copper pipe it is yellow lettering is for drain waste vent red is for type m used in residential piping blue is for type l used in residential commercial piping green is for type k the thickest wall and the most expensive copper made if the pipe was installed without being reamed turbulence inside the pipe can cause premature breakdown all copper manufacturers require that the ends of the pipe be reamed to the full bore of the pipe if you replace anymore pipe save it you can contact the coppper institute and they can identify why your pipe is deteriorating good luck Domestic water system Spark plug Welding Rail terminology Diamond Soldering Solar power Seismic retrofit Flush toilet Casting Electrical wiring Hydrogen economy Glass Aluminium Light-emitting diode Thermal power station Solar cell Bong Air conditioning Novelty (locomotive) Tire Japanese toilet Equine conformation Motorcycle Geodesic dome Naval mine Kitchen Plastic Drill bit Coppersmith Lumber Paper size Carburetor Turbocharger Fluorescent lamp Carbon nanotube Gas metal arc welding Circuit design Mario Lighting Ethernet Autonomous building Hydraulic machinery Uilleann pipes Rebreather Internal ballistics Fire extinguisher Screw Glacier Wind turbine Bullet Volleyball Basement Siphon Nuclear power Printed circuit board Electronic organ Pipe organ Cubic zirconia Energy development Mattress Supercharger Ocean thermal energy conversion Broadband Internet access Transformer Cray-1 Plame affair Asbestos Dairy Hydraulic ram Wallpaper group Bus models used in New York City Transit Sewage treatment Handloading Bassoon Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Perl Reamer Gas turbine Rocket fuel Electric motor Material properties of diamond Eifel Aqueduct Glossary of partner dance terms Color Copper Incandescent light bulb Brewery Sulfuric acid Motor oil Combine (Half-Life 2) Snooker Billiards
