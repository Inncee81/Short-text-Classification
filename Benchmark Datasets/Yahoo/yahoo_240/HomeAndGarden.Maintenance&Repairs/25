how do you keep an older house cool without air conditioning does closing the window during the day and opening them at night work yes if you do it right and the night temperature is considerable lower than daytime tempeature we do not have a c evening open the windows when the outside air tenperature is cooler than the inside air temperature so you get a good cross draft open curtains drapes to allow good air flow close the windows before the outside air temperature rises above the inside air temperature close curtains drapes on east south and west facing windows sliding doors etc this will help prevent thermal heat gain from the sun highest is from the west next highest is from the south lowest is from the east this can vary if one or more sides have trees or is shadowed by another building or light is reflected from another building repeat as often as necessary if you get an unusually cool night and the forcast say there is another heat wave on it's way cool your house as much as possible do this even if you have to put on sweaters remember you can alway put more layers on but you can only take off so much we usually close all drapes and curtains you still get heat gain from shady windows when there is a high temperature difference we have been doing this scince most people ask us if we have a c we did have a water system two summers in the mid 's when the day temperatures were above and night temperatures were about with humidity for about weeks very unusual for this location it did not cool just reduced the humidity hope this helps good luck Solar power Air conditioning Climate of the United Kingdom Fire fighting HVAC Passive solar Urban heat island Temperature Autonomous building Insulation Welding Transformer Sun Swamp cooler Geography of Spain Wind Ocean thermal energy conversion Hot air balloon Stoma Heat index Heat Stirling engine Adiabatic lapse rate Wind power Water vapor Vacuum Atmospheric circulation TV-FM DX Renewable energy Relative humidity Jet engine Hyperthermia Thermal power station Humidity Explosive material Houseplant Fog Carburetor Sauna Deep lake water cooling Temperature inversion Pebble bed reactor Lake Nuclear power Trombe wall Turbocharger Turbofan Convection Geography of Albania Thermostat Dundas Square K__ppen climate classification MOSFET Water (molecule) Ozone depletion Fossil fuel power plant Mercury Atlas 6 Geography of Bolivia Gas metal arc welding Spark plug Gliding El Ni__o Geography of India Furnace Glass Milwaukee, Wisconsin Motor oil Climate of India Bong Refrigerator Power station Spacecraft propulsion Casting Optical fiber Venus Water Polyethylene terephthalate Brewery Albedo Firestorm Turbojet Ice Vacuum tube Entropy Ozone hole Geography of Japan Geyser Diode Grande Prairie, Alberta Tank Geography of Venezuela Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
