does my whirlpool washer have a belt on it the model number is lsr pq where can i get fast information online i have taken the washer apart but i don't see a belt if it doesn't have one how do you make it spin out the water better nope no belt on this one this uses the direct drive system however we'd better break this down even if the coupler located between the motor and transmission is bad broken the washer will still pump out the water that's because the pump is located on the front of the motor however if the water is pumping out but the basket is not spinning the coupler is probably bad no big deal easy job however if the water is not pumping out and the basket is not spinning the lid switch is probably bad but there's one last possibility if the washer is pumping out the water the basket is spinning but the basket just isn't spinning fast enough to get out all the water which is what your questions seems to imply there's a good possibility you may have an article of clothing stuck between the basket and the tub if this is the case again this is something easily fixable remove the plastic tub basket cover plastic tabs lock it down then shine a light between the basket and tub if there is something it can easily be fished out using a metal coat hanger wish a hook on the end just drag it out and put it back together Textile manufacturing Washing machine Floppy disk Casting Aerial (dance move) Cruising (maritime) Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant IPod Hydraulic machinery Manual transmission BMW M5 Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling throws Coupling (railway) Motorcycle Thermal power station Transmission (mechanics) Poker jargon Lionel Corporation Honda Prelude Internal ballistics Combine (Half-Life 2) Automatic transmission Airsoft All-terrain vehicle Brewery Table tennis Mouse (computing) Professional wrestling holds Dishwasher Top-bar hive Fast bowling Aerial refueling Porsche 993 Lathe Toronto Subway and RT Swingout Knife Sega Dreamcast Equine conformation Snooker Professional wrestling slang Fan (implement) Sewage treatment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toilet Shotgun Antarctic krill Electric motor The Inside Plastic Combine harvester Swimming pool Professional wrestling match types Kayak Tire Battlebots Firefighter Rugby union positions Drag racing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) George Westinghouse Hybrid vehicle 24 Hours of Le Mans Dustbin Fishing The Shining (film) Solar power Punisher Volleyball Mooney M20 Carburetor Laundry Theory of conduct Billiards Kyle Broflovski Locomotive Lawn mower Rose (Doctor Who) Pottery Dry cleaning Vacuum Pump Diesel engine Naval mine Bicycle lighting B-47 Stratojet Indianapolis 500 Mitsubishi Eclipse Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Semi-trailer Clinker (boat building) Vacuum cleaner
