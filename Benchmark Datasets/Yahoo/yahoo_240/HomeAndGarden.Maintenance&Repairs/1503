inside coil and outside compressor for ton central air how important is it to replace the inside coil so that it matches the new outside coil i know you are supposed to do it to ensure maximum efficiency but if you have a unit installed outside that closely matches up with the coil inside wouldn't it still work well i'd hate to have to drop big bucks to replace both units especially seeing as how the inside unit is fairly new can't i just replace the outside compressor i was thinking of replacing the compressor i'm not planning to live here the rest of my life so i'm not that interested in the long term in years i'll be gone i hate to be that way but i just can't drop on a full new system right now so i'm just trying to get some info before the guy gets here to give me an estimate i'll continue researching and awaiting more answers great answers so far i replaced my compressor three years before i replaced the evaporator coils inside the house it is not necessary to do both at the same time the only issue you might have is when the inside evaporator coil fails you will lose the freon charge when this happens you need to immediately shut off the ac unit so that you don't damage the compressor the good news is that the coils don't fail rapidly so you will see some under performance in the unit before the charge gets too low plus an annual check on your freon charge will tell you the status one other thing to remember ac repairman are only slightly more reputable than use car salesmen be sure to find a reputable ac guy to do your repair Air conditioning Heinkel He 100 Refrigerator Jet engine Thermal power station Axial compressor Carburetor Turbocharger Mars Exploration Rover Ocean thermal energy conversion Tesla coil Phase change heat pump Spark plug Toyota Prius SR-71 Blackbird Haloalkane Poker jargon Turbojet Pebble bed reactor Nuclear power Electric motor Mattress Turbofan Thermostat Diving cylinder Ozone depletion Cray-1 Equine conformation Directed-energy weapon Relay Ozone hole Incandescent light bulb Fire fighting Internal ballistics USS Trigger (SS-237) Transformer Mutual fund Dodge Neon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Married... with Children Boeing 787 Particle accelerator Computer numbering formats Black hole Hard disk Supercharger Bass guitar Windows 2000 Gas compressor USS Vestal (AR-4) Loudspeaker Annuity Extreme Programming Wind power Supersonic transport Solar power CPU cache Embedded system Explosive material Diode Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fuel injection Panama Canal Economy of Russia Wind turbine Vacuum USS Yorktown (CV-5) Tank Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 2005 United States Grand Prix Frank Whittle Terran (StarCraft) Kasparov versus The World Swamp cooler Killian documents Wardenclyffe Tower Metrovick F.2 Futurama (TV series - season 4) Social rule Bicycle lighting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Theory of conduct Centrifugal compressor Space Shuttle program Dog agility Opportunity rover Pretty Good Privacy DVD Diesel engine ELO rating system F-14 Tomcat Gas turbine Magnetic cartridge Alcohol fuel Columbine High School massacre Iowa class battleship Spacecraft propulsion Hydrogen economy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode)
