no water pressure i have no water pressure in my kitchen sink hot or cold my bath room sink and bathtub nd floor have normal pressure as dose my washing machine st floor what could be the issue i just took the aerator off and the water from the actual spout is no running up to power since the water pressure problem is isolated to just the kitchen sink the st thing i'd check would be the angle stops under the sink to be sure they are on all the way use the old righty tighty lefty loosey to turn'em on and off if the angle stops under the sink are on all the way the next place to check is the aerator that's the part of the faucet where the water actually comes out of on the spout there is a screen at that opening that could be clogged with debris it also comes off with the righty tighty lefty loosey with the help of a wrench and is likely to be the obvious suspect once it's off clean the screen and re install the aerator to the kitchen faucet that should get'cha going again good luck susan Sento Tap (valve) Plumbing fixture Kitchen Japanese toilet Bidet Changeroom Domestic water system Bathroom Dishwashing Siphon Sewage treatment Thermal power station Water Water (molecule) Carburetor Pan Am Flight 103 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fuzzy logic Vacuum cleaner Washroom Propeller Fire fighting Dishwasher Coffee Toilet Mnemonic Baby bottle USS Wahoo (SS-238) Oceanic trench Sauna USS Yorktown (CV-5) Carbon dioxide USS Tunny (SS-282) HVAC Hydroponics Dam Bathing Houseplant Sailing Drill bit 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Poker jargon Cannabis cultivation Steam engine Billiards Cheating in Counter-Strike Toilet paper Coriolis effect Furnace Bong Frankfurt kitchen Greywater Equine conformation Ocean thermal energy conversion Refrigerator Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Jala neti Spontaneous human combustion Obstetrics Debugging Blood (computer game) Wrench Cruising (maritime) Acute respiratory distress syndrome Dry cleaning Baptism Diving Wound Elevator Glossary of firefighting equipment The Star Wars Holiday Special Stove Ariel (Firefly episode) Mirror Foodborne illness Rail terminology Tattoo The Price Is Right 2003 North America blackout Dymaxion house Solar power Axial compressor Windows XP Jet engine Happy Tree Friends Japanese tea ceremony Fire alarm control panel Brewery Suicide methods Conspiracy (TNG episode) RMS Titanic 1957 World Series Tank Babe Ruth Will Eisner Electrophysiology Residual-current device
