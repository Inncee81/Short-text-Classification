my shower floods when i run the kitchen disposal i can't afford a plumber right now so i need to figure out how to stop my shower from flooding when i run the disposal in order for it to do this the shower must be pretty close to the disposal you have a clogged line after the point where the two drain pipes come together since the shower is the lowest point in the system for something to come out it does so there the clog is probably not bad enough to hold up the shower drain but if you turned on all your faucets at once you would see the shower drain slow then start filling to cure this get a drain opener that is good for grease since that is the most likely culprit comming from the kitchen Plumbing fixture Siphon Drain cleaner Septic tank Sewage treatment Domestic water system Garbage disposal Sento Thermal power station Drainage Cruising (maritime) Kitchen Hebden Bridge Autonomous building Home repair Dairy Carburetor Final Fantasy magic Tap (valve) Plastic Bong Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Inkjet printer Hard water Plastic bag Ship Water purification Urinary incontinence Sewer Meteor shower Canal lock 2005 Maharashtra floods Haloalkane Motor oil Geography of India Toilet paper Glossary of partner dance terms C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Ra (board game) Social rule Flush toilet Jam (TV series) Team Fortress Classic Washroom Basement Severe weather terminology (United States) Climate of the United Kingdom Poker jargon Central heating Japanese toilet Geography of Africa Australian rules football Dam Zuiderzee Works Mount Pinatubo Baby bottle Billiards Stream Protoss Prisons in the United States Tap water Charles Graner Flood geology Stove Heinkel He 100 Space shuttle main engine Dundas Square Panama Canal Locks Futurama (TV series - season 4) Refrigerator 2004 Atlantic hurricane season 2003 United States Grand Prix Minako Aino Kandersteg International Scout Centre Wario Trapped in the Closet RuneScape Mini-Games National Kidney Foundation Singapore The Caves of Androzani Muhammad Ahmad Sears Holdings Corporation Mach kernel Progressive tax Fast bowling Colony in Space Wood carving Pastry bag Circulatory system Kasparov versus The World Sauna Missouri River Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ammunition MOSFET 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Family from One End Street Otitis externa Stopping e-mail abuse Geography of Germany
