help plumbers i have a jacuzzi era model toilet and it there is a hissing noise coming from inside the tank at first i thought the flapper wasn't closing and that water was leaking a bit but that's not it the hissing actually seems to be coming from around the float cup i used to be able to stop the noise by tapping on the float cup a couple of times but this is no longer working it hisses constantly any ideas what i need to do hopefully not totally swap out the guts of the toilet it could be a very small amount of water is seeping past the shut off valve in the toilet this can cause a high pitched sound tapping on the float might have stopped the leak for a while but now the leak is getting worse while you might not want to swap out the guts that is the answer it's time for a new valve and float assembly Flush toilet Carburetor Three Mile Island Siphon Trombone Toilet humour Japanese toilet Tap (valve) Rebreather Frogman Motorcycle Diving regulator Urinary incontinence Flatulence Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Diving cylinder Thermal power station Oxyacetylene Menstrual cup Manifold vacuum Wind turbine Cat Naval mine Tire Containment building Trumpet Fire hydrant Transformer Ecco the Dolphin USS Tunny (SS-282) Atari 8-bit family Internal ballistics Four-stroke cycle Domestic water system Pulse jet engine USS Albacore (SS-218) Undergarment Space shuttle main engine Mute (music) USS S-44 (SS-155) Programmable logic controller Central processing unit Fire fighting Guitar Dither Combine (Half-Life 2) Vacuum tube Steam engine Toilet paper Sewage treatment Chevrolet Corvair engine Treehouse of Horror V Gasoline Hey Jude Shaggy dog story Water hammer Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Salad Fingers Diesel engine Turbocharger Modem Ionizing radiation PDP-11 Naruto jutsu PID controller Pump Authentic performance Cruising (maritime) Guilty Gear Newcomen steam engine Sea-Monkey Doom enemies Fecal incontinence Home repair Heart sounds Autonomous building Scuba set Big band Tampon Electronic amplifier Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Rail terminology Helium Fire balloon STS-61 Pok__mon Abilities Alger Hiss Casting Gramophone record International League Piccolo Junior Saga Augustan drama Mercury 4 Irrigation Digital Swimming pool FA Cup
