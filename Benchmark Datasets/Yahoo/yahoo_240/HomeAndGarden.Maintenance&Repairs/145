how long can i have the furnace fan on for is it ok for the fan motor to be on most of the day when the ac is off just to circulate the air you can run the fan indefinitely without causing any damage to it as it is designed to be run contuinously the only problem with this will be power consumption a ac blower motor in the to hp range will pull anywhere from to amps to figure power usage multiply the amps times the volts this will give you watts multiply this times hours and this gives you watt hours so a motor pulling amps at volts is watts per hour that would equal out to watt hours per day it would cost a lot to do this and even more if you have a bigger motor than a hp Transformer Vacuum cleaner Volt Solar power Power (physics) Fan (implement) Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Circuit design Operational amplifier Resistor Bicycle lighting Fossil fuel power plant Electronic amplifier Decibel Solar panel Wind power Battery (electricity) Three-phase electric power Horsepower Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Propeller Galileo spacecraft Hard disk Electrical generator Electricity meter Furnace Super Nintendo Entertainment System Torque BS 1363 Thermal power station Two-stroke cycle Fuel injection E85 Supercharger Battery electric vehicle CMOS VIA C3 Effective radiated power Electricity Ford Motor Company Jet engine Hybrid vehicle Sport utility vehicle Thermostat Ford Ranger EV Pok__mon Abilities Solar cell 24 Hours of Le Mans Toyota Prius Central processing unit X10 (industry standard) XERF Watts riots Digital circuit Large numbers Piezoelectricity Labour economics Headlight Athlon 64 Nuclear power Automobile Loudspeaker Motor oil Bass guitar Daylight saving time Ampere Lawn mower Microwave oven Diode Fluorescent lamp Apollo 13 Bussard ramjet USCGC Conifer (WLB-301) Aircraft Solar power satellite Muscle Welding power supply EastEnders Glider Kenwood Electronics Novelty (locomotive) Newcomen steam engine Control system MIM-23 Hawk Particle accelerator USS Zane (DD-337) Locomotive Energy development Air conditioning James Watt Microeconomics Radiation poisoning M16 (rifle) Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Engine Pentium M Brewery Steam engine High-voltage hazards
