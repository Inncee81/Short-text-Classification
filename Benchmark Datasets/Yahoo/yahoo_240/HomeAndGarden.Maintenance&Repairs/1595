pool cover problem my pool is always freezing but not i have a solar cover makes it warmer my question is that when i take it off it gets chachka junk like sticks leaves ect on it how do i prevent this without buying a roller p s no stupid answers there really isn't a way to stop the debris from falling onto the cover short of removing all the trees around however there is something known as a leaf net a coarse mesh type cover that can go over the solar cover and the pool to make the debris easier to remove here is a link to a website with some pictures and some pricing on various sizes they're normally sold for winter use but i've had customers use them for summer use as well http www poolcenter com leaf nets for solid pool covers htm another option i've heard of some people using is a leaf blower to blow the junk off the cover before removing it i have the same problem in my round what i use is one of the solar fish instead ot the cover since i get so many leaves in the pool almost every day oh and by the way the roller really wouldn't prevent it it'll make the cover easier to remove but all the junk would still fall into the pool Solar power Swimming pool Textile manufacturing Leaf Jumpstart 3rd Grade Floppy disk Debris Poker jargon Billiards Carnivorous plant Cruising (maritime) Mutual fund Solar system Fan (implement) Customs and etiquette of Japan Solar eclipse Solar cell Kodocha Fishing Roswell UFO incident Roller hockey Cross site scripting Escape from New York Thermoregulation Drill bit World Wide Web Atlanta metropolitan area Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carbon dioxide Diablo II Mattress High Rollers Wildfire Little Ice Age Common Fisheries Policy Solar sail Southeastern Anatolia Project Phishing Space elevator Spam (electronic) Kazaa Autumn Full Metal Panic?
