craftsman lawn mower wont restart my neighbor has a craftsman lawn mower with power driven front tires hp motor if i remember correctly aprox years old if it is cold starts great and runs great but if you stop and try to restart it then you can not get it to start any advise this sounds like a typical ignition module problem to me next time he mows have him run it until it gets hot min and then shut it off take out the spark plug and reconnect it to its wire and hold it against the engine block make sure you are not touching the plug itself or you may get a little zap then you'll know for sure if its working or not have him pull the motor over as if he was going to start it while you look at the plug to see if it sparks if it does not spark then it is a bad ignition module since it works cold you can be assured that it is not the ground wire write the model type and code of the motor down and look up the part on the internet or have a small engine shop look it up for you then replace the module which is located under all of the plastic and metal gaurds it is a u shaped piece next to the flywheel you will have to disconnect the ground wire from the old one and reconnect it to the new one you can set the gap between the ends of the module and the flywheel at with a feeler guage turn the flywheel by hand to make sure everything is ok and then put everything back together to test before putting it back together have a friend hold back the bail at the top of the handle to release the flywheel brake and lay the spark plug against the block as before spin the flywheel by hand as quick as you can and look for spark at the plug Lawn mower Spark plug Motor oil Reading spark plugs for racing Carburetor Automobile self starter Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Motorcycle Tire Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Auto racing Hybrid vehicle Embedded system Electric motor Toyota Prius Briggs & Stratton Internal combustion engine Horsepower Floppy disk Dodge Neon IPod Radio controlled airplane Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tractor Two-stroke cycle BS 1363 Combine harvester Model aircraft Universal Serial Bus Battery electric vehicle Torpedo Internal ballistics Ethernet Indianapolis 500 Ignition system Thermal power station Automobile Space disaster Roller coaster Commodore 64 Modem Jump start (vehicle) Aircraft engine controls Welding Rotary engine Lightning Steam engine Kart racing Electric vehicle Ford Ranger EV Top Fuel Spark gap Firearm Car handling Enigma machine Honda Prelude Elevator Dodge Charger Volleyball Ford Crown Victoria X10 (industry standard) Oscilloscope Stirling engine Violin Bicycle Laptop Apollo 13 Rail terminology Porsche 911 STS-61 TGV Flywheel energy storage Skateboarding trick Glossary of American football Thermostat Mattress Tesla coil Flywheel Harley-Davidson Drag racing BMW M5 Fuel injection E85 Continuously variable transmission Mower Residual-current device Fuse (electrical)
