another question on identifying if a outlet exists without seeing it i checked the circuit breaker and there are switches stuck together and two spaces labeled washer dryer so i assume its a outlet when i asked the resident manager he assumed it was a because most of the townhouses have a stacked unit which has a the previous owners had a new circuit breaker put in so i am assuming it is a so does that mean there is more than one outlet back there i am asking because i want to switch from a stacked small apartment washer dryer to a separate front loading washer and dryer which requires a outlet for the dryer and one not sure if it is a or for the washer the current one is stacked and is in a small closet so i can't just pull it out if you have breakers that are connected together they will be volts volts each if the wires from both of these connected breakers go to the same outlet along with a common wire and hopefully a ground wire you will have a volt outlet however as these are actually separate breakers they could be running to outlets with each being volts the best and safest thing for you to do is check the voltage requirement for the washer and dryer that you have either by looking for a label or asking a dealer maintenance person or you can pull them out and check the outlet or outlets with a volt meter your new washer and dryer will require volts and volts respectfully Circuit breaker Residual-current device Three-phase electric power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Distribution board Spark plug Switch Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Relay Oscilloscope Transformer Alternating current National Electrical Code (US) BS 1363 Thermostat Ring circuit RS-232 Circuit design Capacitor Thermal power station Volt Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Operational amplifier Toronto Subway and RT Digital circuit Electricity meter Ground and neutral Split phase High-voltage hazards High-voltage direct current Ethernet Lineman (occupation) Spark gap Impedance matching Hall effect Decibel Electrical network Solar cell Overhead lines CMOS Tesla coil Battery (electricity) Logic gate Resistor Fan (implement) Electrical generator Phantom power Flush toilet Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hydraulic machinery Analog-to-digital converter Electrophysiology Variable Frequency Drive Potentiometer IPod Electric power transmission Switched-mode power supply Power strip Electrical wiring (UK) Washing machine Ampere Transistor Lightning rod Seismic retrofit Central processing unit Loudspeaker Rail terminology Ignition system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis CPU design Floppy disk Lightning Antenna (radio) Electricity pylon Power (physics) Poker jargon USB flash drive Light switch Rapid transit X10 (industry standard) Earthing system George Westinghouse Cruising (maritime) 2003 North America blackout Galvanic cell Mains electricity Ground (electricity) Light-emitting diode Dimmer Microphone Oplan Bojinka Magnetic core memory
