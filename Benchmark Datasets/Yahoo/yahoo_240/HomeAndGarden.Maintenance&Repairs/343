what are the pros and cons of insulating my house i want to insulate under the floor there is a crawlspace and i'm wondering if this is a good idea or will it trap moisture against the wood floorboards also it gets really hot in the attic in summer and i wanted to insulate the roof the ceiling floor of the attic is already well insulated sure under the floor between the joists and then put a vapor barrier up against the insulation that way no moisture will enter the insulation from below as for the attic it is suppose to be hot up there and there are either soffit vents that allow air to circulate up into the attic or vents on the gable ends depends on roof type that does the same thing this circulation keeps the house cool in the summer and warmer in the winter insulating the roof will lead to quicker dry rot of the wood Basement Diving suit Solar power Air conditioning Electrical wiring Timber framing HVAC Roof Glossary of firefighting terms Straw-bale construction Passive solar Brewery Fire fighting Ice Thermal power station Ventilation Thermoregulation Water Fog Solar collector Langstroth hive Water vapor Transformer Heat Seismic retrofit Bungalow Sento Spark plug Autonomous building Mattress Wood Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Cannabis cultivation Plywood Humidity Upholstery Lighting Asbestos California Plumbing fixture Natural building Precipitation (meteorology) Fume hood El Ni__o The House of the Seven Gables Bath Relative humidity Internal combustion engine Platform framing Domestic water system Monsoon Plastic Space Shuttle external tank Campfire Swamp cooler Glossary of firefighting equipment Carbon dioxide Polyethylene terephthalate Xanadu House Air pollution Stairway Renewable energy Climate of the United Kingdom Anticyclone Home repair House Sugar beet Ocean thermal energy conversion Building material Refrigerator car California Bungalow Cruising (maritime) Sauna Thunderstorm Comanche Weather lore Jet engine Window Wood carving Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hamster Yosemite National Park Fan (implement) Urban heat island Water heater Water (molecule) Explosive material Dymaxion house MOSFET Volkswagen Golf Carnivorous plant Thermostat Volcano Shotgun house Noah's Ark K__ppen climate classification Casting
