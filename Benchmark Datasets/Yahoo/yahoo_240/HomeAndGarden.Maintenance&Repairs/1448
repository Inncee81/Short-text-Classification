why would a spp hand start be used on an air conditioning unit i purchased a brand new home in december in august the upstairs air conditioning unit stopped working the tech came out and said there was a small leak that he could not visually see where all the freon had leaked out he said the leak was so small that he would have to use dye in order to locate it he did not fix the problem that day instead he put two units of freon in and used a hand start we have learned since then that putting freon in a unit that is leaking is against the law we also feel our unit was defective the moment it was installed we do have a five year warranty on the unit and are prepared to go to court if necessary i would appreciate anyone who is knowledgeable in this area to give us some feedback are we crazy to think we got a lemon how is it possible that a unit that is only a year and a half old need two units of freon and a spp hand start whatever that is please help we cannot afford to keep repairing this unit thanks it definitely should not have a freon leak if it is new it is legal to put freon in a unit that still has a leak as long as it does not take more than percent of the total charge of the unit to make it work per year a spp hard start is to help the compressor start this would only be used if there was some kind of compressor starting problem the unit being under warranty doesn't necessarily mean they have to replace it unless it cannot be repaired they can do whatever is necessary to repair it at no cost to you considering this unit is fairly new the leak is probably in the connections where the line sets connect to the condenser or evaporator Cray-1 Haloalkane Thermal power station USS S-43 (SS-154) IPod Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Axial compressor Copyleft Tire Plame affair USS S-38 (SS-143) Extreme Programming Product liability Pebble bed reactor Dodge Neon USS S-36 (SS-141) R46 (New York City Subway car) Phase change heat pump Heinkel He 100 Refrigerator Gas compressor Toyota Prius Babylonian law STS-35 Mars Exploration Rover USS S-37 (SS-142) Trademark Carburetor Jet engine USS Wedderburn (DD-684) USS Trigger (SS-237) Mattress Public domain Microeconomics Windows XP Urinary incontinence Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Ocean thermal energy conversion Labor theory of value USS Tunny (SS-282) Thermostat Dairy USS S-30 (SS-135) Computer virus Welding Fecal incontinence Volleyball Mortgage Ammonia Frank Whittle STS-61 USS Yorktown (CV-10) Implied warranty 1957 World Series Refrigerant Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Turbocharger Water vapor Electrophysiology USS S-42 (SS-153) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Atari 8-bit family Wood Land Rover Delta Air Lines Current teachings of Prem Rawat USS Seal (SS-183) Contract Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 2000 Australian Grand Prix E85 Vacuum tube Loss leader USS Taylor (DD-468) USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Aylwin (DD-355) The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Unemployment USS S-40 (SS-145) Copyright infringement of software Education in the United States Insurance Kitchen USS S-45 (SS-156) Annuity Motorcycle AMD Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 USS S-44 (SS-155) Wind power Illegal drug trade USS Ajax (AR-6) Violin Chu-Han contention Knife Intellectual property
