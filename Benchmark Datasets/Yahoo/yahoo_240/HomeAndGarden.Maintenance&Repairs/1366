central air i have a year old ac unit and just had the motor replaced the thermostat is set for but during the day the temperature in the house just goes up usually to i have had it checked and was told that everything is fine and its just too hot for the ac to get to that temp should i call someone else and spend even more money i would like to have and idea what could be wrong when i do call someone else i don't want to keep spending money on this and the problem to continue some of the suggestion given are just fine and need to be checked during the annual clean and check you should be doing on your system however what you haven't said is how hot it is outside if you are in one of those areas of the country that is experiencing a hotter than average summer your air conditioner may in fact be doing all it can a common misconception a lot of people have is that no matter how hot it is your a c should always be able to bring your house down to the desired temp sorry but that just isn't so so the short of it is if the system hasn't had an annual clean and check inspection get one if they don't find anything wrong with the system and the temps outside are hitting the mid to high s then chances are the system is doing all it can Thermostat Temperature Climate of the United Kingdom Thermal power station Theory of conduct Carburetor Heat Thermoregulation HVAC Motor oil Craps Arizona CPU cache Billboard Hot 100 Paragliding Poker jargon Plame affair It's All Gone Pete Tong Solar power Diseases of the honeybee Inflation Red Hot Chili Peppers G__del's incompleteness theorem Jet engine Space Shuttle program Gross domestic product Fuzzy logic Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Daylight saving time Fuel cell Brewery Full Metal Panic?
