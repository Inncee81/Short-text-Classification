what boiler would be appropriate for a power shower that kicks out l of hot water a minute i have an old boiler the one you turn on and heats up all the water before you use it the one with a tank i'm looking for an upgrade that doesn't use a tank i'm concerned that it would have to be a good efficint boiler that can work really hard and kick out lots of hot water you don't use a combination boiler with a power shower use a thermostatic mixer valve combi compatible and there are a lot of combi's that will deliver litres plus i use worcester bosch boilers the cdi gives litres per minute if you insist on the power shower you will need a cylinder with the capability to deliver the amount of water you need this should be calculated taking into account the cold water supply from a storage tank this will equalise the pressure between hot and cold water the other thing to remember is that with the new energy efficiency regulations you cannot install a conventional with tanks boiler which exceeds your heat requirements Thermostat Furnace Steam engine Solar power Fossil fuel power plant Thermal power station Diesel engine Fuel injection Energy development Boiler Stirling engine Explosive material Internal combustion engine Autonomous building HVAC Diving cylinder Carburetor Renewable energy Scuba set Iowa class battleship Heat Gasoline Ocean thermal energy conversion Horsepower Water heater Sewage treatment Central heating Hydrogen economy Fire fighting Novelty (locomotive) Alcohol fuel Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Pebble bed reactor Dishwasher Fuel cell Nuclear power Spacecraft propulsion Incineration Spark plug Turbocharger Glossary of firefighting terms Wind power Tier One Apollo 13 Refrigerator Electrical generator Diode Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fusion power Welding Power station Tap (valve) Newcomen steam engine Hydropower Nuclear reactor Cold fusion Porsche 911 Carbon dioxide Alternative fuel Space shuttle main engine E85 Hard disk T-64 Air conditioning Siphon Torpedo Biodiesel Ironing Temperature Cogeneration Irrigation Toyota Prius Three Mile Island Petroleum Natural gas Hybrid vehicle Steam Tank Two-stroke cycle Steam locomotive nomenclature Energy Portable stove Dairy Rolls-Royce Merlin Jet engine Future energy development Manitoba Hydro Transformer Protoss Rebreather Circuit breaker Convair B-36
