how can we control the water dripping out of window unit ac we have a window unit air conditioner in our bedroom window in nyc we're on the third floor and water drips out onto the sidewalk i know that means that our unit is working great but our neighbors are angry about getting wet every time they step out our front door we can't begrudge them that how can we control the drip is there a tube or a tray we can purchase if we do need to control the water with a tube where can we get one and what is the best configuration since we are in a dense urban area and almost anywhere outside that we'd redirect the water we would be getting someone wet if moving the drip oe ft to the left or right would solve the problem i think that it would be easy to do it may also make it necessary to put the drain opening close to the building and would stain the outside over time and might have the landlord telling you not to do it i don't know if you can take the water back inside to a handy sink or bathtub drain but that would be a very good solution another is to put a pump and float on a reservoir and do it for a longer distance these combinations are sold for undercounter icemakers that do not have drains installed at the icemakers and i know that would work Hydroponics Irrigation Thermal power station Sento Cruising (maritime) Solar power Carburetor Refrigerator Fire fighting Water Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Plumbing fixture Glossary of firefighting equipment Autonomous building Siphon Domestic water system Scuba set Seismic retrofit Basement Infusion pump Passenger car Air conditioning Naval mine Rapid transit Motorcycle Cannabis cultivation Glossary of wildland fire terms Glossary of firefighting terms IBM PC compatible Bladderwort Fujian tea ceremony Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Heinkel He 100 Microsoft Windows Coriolis effect Japanese toilet Kitchen De Lorean DMC-12 Urinary incontinence Ocean thermal energy conversion Carnivorous plant Station wagon Bong Electrical wiring Escalator Internal ballistics Fountain HVAC Automobile Urinal The Time Machine Frogman Water purification Wind turbine Drainage Equine conformation Ford Ranger EV Reservoir Dogs Tire Linux Central processing unit Elevator Strap-on dildo Vacuum cleaner Ice West Side Highway Hydraulic machinery Tank Diving suit P-47 Thunderbolt Fire hydrant Terran (StarCraft) Liquid breathing Richard Chase Traveling salesman problem Transistor Deep lake water cooling Soldering Wave power Blood Simple Window Bicycle frame Customs and etiquette of Japan Diving regulator Operational amplifier Port Authority Trans-Hudson Dymaxion house Mercury 4 Genetic algorithm Dishwashing Carbon dioxide Bart Sells His Soul Windows XP Toilet paper Fire extinguisher Brewery
