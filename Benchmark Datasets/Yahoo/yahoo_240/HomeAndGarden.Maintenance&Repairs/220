home foundation cracks i am interested in buying a home with a few cracks in the foundation how big of an issue is this and how large of a crack is considered serious one particular crack is about a centimeter thick when is the foundation too far gone to be repaired that's a rather large crack and may indicate that the foundation doesn't have any reinforcing steel in the concrete or is built on unstable soil furthermore if the foundation has opened up by a centimeter there should be a corresponding crack in the house if the house is properly anchored to the foundation this is a structural concern that i wouldn't attempt to answer in this forum you should hire a licensed structural engineer to evaluate the situation a few dollars spent today could prevent a big headache in the future Seismic retrofit Masonry Software engineering Concrete Air-raid shelter Poker jargon Retaining wall Reinforced concrete Space elevator San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Nuclear power World Trade Center Suspension bridge Cryonics Road Straw-bale construction Violin Civil engineering Prestressed concrete Steam (content delivery) Pile Brazing Coalition Provisional Authority St Albans Cathedral Roof Opportunity rover Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Geodesic dome Simone Weil Glossary of climbing terms Welding Copyright infringement of software Terminal ballistics Software patent debate Explosive material Britpop Hoover Dam Katana Federal Communications Commission Password cracking Labor theory of value Millau Viaduct Copy protection Rebar Intellectual property Combine (Half-Life 2) Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Mobile phone radiation and health Blast shelter Microeconomics Software cracking National Kidney Foundation Singapore Containment building Drill bit Campfire Construction Stainless steel Government debt Foundation (architecture) Basement Rail tracks DVD Public domain Pavement (material) Brent Spar CRACKED Limit state design L.
