can't turn a c on or off help nothing like having a c problems in the dead of summer i have a samsung aw a air conditioner it's years old and has worked great up until yesterday although the a c came with a remote i never use it i only use the control panel on the a c the a c wouldn't turn on i plugged something else into the outlet to check that the outlet was working fine it was i plugged the a c back in and it beeped i pressed the power button a few times finally it did turn on this morning when i went to shut it off before going to work the power button wouldn't respond i couldn't shut it off i finally shut it off by just unplugging it probably not good for the a c i know when i got home from work today i plugged it back in heard the beep but i couldn't get it going i did find that the only buttons that work are the timer button the button that makes the thermostat go up so i can get the a c to turn on off by using the timer button but i can't get it cooler than degrees i can't believe the entire keypad other than those buttons wore out at the same time like that the air filter is completely clean so it's not that i did take out the remote and found corroded batteries i cleaned it out used some baking soda water put in brand new batteries but the a c didn't respond to the remote at all but that could just be a busted remote i just ordered a new one so any theories on this one couldn't find any troubleshooting guides which addressed this do i just need a new control panel or something or is there something obvious i'm missing here sounds like the control board touchpad is faulty having someone replace could be very expensive doing it yourself can still be expensive life expectancy for an in wall or in window a c unit is years you would be better off purchasing a fedders or ge unit if you choose not to replace the unit with a new one who is to say that the compressor wont give next and those are more expensive than the control board in many cases anyways good luck in what you do if you decide to purchase new home depot or lowes are a nice choice but i would steer closer to a home appliance store personallyl Embedded system IPod X10 (industry standard) Thermostat Poker jargon Atari 8-bit family Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Solar power Mouse (computing) Thermal power station Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Autonomous building Air conditioning Atari ST Windows XP Burglar alarm Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Kasparov versus The World Residual-current device Sears Holdings Corporation Modem Battery electric vehicle Windows 2000 Nintendo Entertainment System Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Treehouse of Horror IX E85 Xbox Laptop Diesel engine Virtual memory Personal computer Hearing aid Heinkel He 112 Mattress Japanese toilet Chernobyl accident John Sheridan (Babylon 5) BS 1363 USS S-37 (SS-142) Programmable logic controller 2000 Australian Grand Prix Three-phase electric power Roomba Galileo spacecraft Combine (Half-Life 2) Dance Dance Revolution Universal Serial Bus Remote control Oplan Bojinka 1957 World Series Steven Wright Radio controlled car Battery (electricity) Bicycle lighting Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Strap-on dildo Sega Dreamcast Cray-1 Good Times Apollo 13 Cruising (maritime) Ecco the Dolphin Compiler optimization FoxTrot Apple Computer Xbox 360 Colony in Space Nintendo 64 Full Metal Panic?
