why doesn't our cold water work our bathroom sink faucet used to drip constantly no matter how tightly we turned it off one day i noticed that it was no longer dripping and now the cold water doesn't work at all nothing comes out why would this be how can we fix it the valve underneath the sink is definitely on and the hot water still works fine please help why are people so rude obviously the outside water main is turned on since i said the hot water works fine and calling a plumber gee that's great advice obviously i want to avoid that or else i wouldn't be here it was leaking more than likely because of a rubber gasket that has worn that same gasket has possibly deteriorated and a piece of it has clog the line either in the faucet or in the line best thing first is turn off the valve under the sink then take the line loose from both ends if it is clear and the faucet is an expensive one then the rubber seals need to be replaced make sure any rubber seals that are present are not cut and worn if its a cheapy then replace the hole faucet Tap (valve) Coffee Plumbing fixture Tire Sento Thermostat Carburetor Bong Diving suit Home repair Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Sleeve valve Irrigation Diving regulator Rail tracks Shoe Chevrolet Corvair engine USS S-5 (SS-110) Baby bottle Flush toilet Hydraulic machinery E85 Spark plug Cruising (maritime) Samovar Mattress Japanese toilet Drill bit Borehole Motorcycle Electrophysiology Kitchen Menstrual cup Upholstery Toilet paper Bicycle brake systems Pump Carbon dioxide Fecal incontinence Scuba set Strap-on dildo Domestic water system Rebreather Customs and etiquette of Japan Hyperthermia Hydropower Polyurethane Blood Simple Naval mine Fountain pen Dinghy Drip irrigation Space shuttle main engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Royal Assent Sauna Mercury 4 Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Casting Atomism Battle of the Bulge Campfire Tales Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Screw Programmable logic controller Vacuum tube Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fujian tea ceremony Furnace Dodge Neon Poker jargon Bathroom Bidet Motor oil Tattoo Intravenous therapy Billboard Hot 100 Drag racing Mountaineering Leaf Asbestos Disneyland Welding USS Seal (SS-183) Brewery Reading spark plugs for racing Clothing Aqua Teen Hunger Force Submarine Wrench Drainage Trombone Rifle Trumpet Transformers: Cybertron Timing belt Katana
