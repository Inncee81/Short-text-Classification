shallow well jet pump question my pump has suddenly started kicking on about once a minute even when water is not being used i know there is no leak anywhere in the system why would the system lose pressure and need to kick on frankly i don't understand how the water stays under pressure in the pressure tank why doesn't the water go back into the well as soon as the pump turns off i suspect that the jet pump has some type of device built in that prevents the water from flowing back and that this is where my problem lies is there a simple seal that i can replace your help is greatly appreciated in advance i would guess the check valve or foot valve is leaking that is what keeps the water under pressure that you are wondering about sometimes they start to leak allowing the pressure to drop usually with a shallow well the check valve is near the pump look for a brass fitting in the pipe email if you need more help Carburetor Flush toilet Hydraulic machinery Siphon Pump Rebreather Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Jet engine Three Mile Island Two-stroke cycle Electrophysiology Thermostat Irrigation Steam engine Brewery Diving cylinder Newcomen steam engine Tire Aircraft flight control systems Water supply Vacuum E85 Flamethrower Borehole Turbocharger Containment building Naval mine Dialysis Glossary of firefighting terms Drowning Snorkel Dairy Tap (valve) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting B-47 Stratojet Solar power Manifold vacuum Sleeve valve Water hammer Air brake (rail) Fossil fuel power plant Stirling engine Scuba set Novelty (locomotive) Carbon dioxide Atrial septal defect Energy development Seismic retrofit Rail terminology Apollo Command/Service Module Pulse jet engine Bong Supercharger Steam locomotive nomenclature Diving regulator Water tower Ocean thermal energy conversion Turbojet Hydrogen economy Gas compressor Cardiac cycle Water purification Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Programmable logic controller Fire hydrant Space Shuttle external tank Mercury arc valve Domestic water system Tier One Water turbine Diving suit Cavitation Trombone Firefighter Apollo 13 Timeline of steam power Heat Vacuum tube USS Tunny (SS-282) Mitral regurgitation Floodgate Internal ballistics Fluid bearing Autonomous building Canal lock SR-71 Blackbird Sailing ballast Heart valve New York Giants Russian joke Automatic transmission STS-61 Aortic insufficiency
