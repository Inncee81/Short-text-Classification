just bought a yr old house looks like its settling hi my mom just bought a house that is yrs old when we looked at the house before we put an offer on it we didn't see any problems but when we moved in yesterday we saw some cracks in the basement and the doors wouldn't close properly the painter explained that the house has settled a bit on one side and thats what caused the cracks and the door problems should i be worried about this some people have said that in this city winnipeg canada the soil is rich in something and that settling of houses are very common is there a way to fix the cracks also i believe there's foundation warranty left on the house can i use the warranty to fix this is this going to be a problem when selling the house all construction settles to a point there are a lot of reasons for it you need to get someone to decide why its settling if its foundation use your warrantee you will probably have to go to court to enforce it getting developement companies to do something years later can be a chore the foundation itself might be settling in places or the earth below the foundation may be having issues houses that have been built near here on old dairyland are having issues with uric acid from cow urine actually eating the lime in the cement foundation an inspection prior to escrow should have been performed and would probably have caught the problems Poker jargon Knots Landing Illegal drug trade Dairy De Lorean DMC-12 Seismic retrofit Copyleft Ashton-Tate Penske Racing Equine conformation Software engineering Air-raid shelter Make money fast Vitamin C Hemp Ben Johnson (athlete) Trademark Dam Temasek Holdings Stanley Cup Plame affair Drug test Gout Characters in the Smurfs Insulin Steam (content delivery) Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson De Lorean Motor Company Wyatt Earp Mattress Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Straw-bale construction Software license Oakland Athletics Garfield AMD Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nuclear power Warez DVD Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Grey market Downing Street memo Theory of conduct Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dodge Charger Piccolo Junior Saga Dodge Neon Electronic Frontier Foundation Mortgage Prostitution Mozilla Firefox British Free Corps Public domain The Basement Tapes Concrete Abbey Gerrymandering STS-61 Heinkel He 100 Philosophical skepticism Green Revolution Uric acid E85 Pretty Good Privacy IBook Year 2000 problem World Trade Center Breastfeeding New Coke Land Rover Fast bowling Prostate cancer Bond Livestock Natural Selection (computer game) Ultima Online Trapping Laserdisc Grandview, U.S.A.
