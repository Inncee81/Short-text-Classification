how do i get my bathroom drains to unclog whatever i do it has to be septic friendly it's not the septic system we just had a brand new finger system put in so i'm positive it doesn't need pumped everything else is working perfectly we've had problems with the tub and sink for awhile now cleaning drains without chemical is simple i do it all the time sinks have traps at the bottom of the drain underneath the sink these traps have simple flange nuts that can be moved with a standard pair of adjustable pliers aka channel locks or a inch pipe wrench place a small bucket under the sink simply unscrew the top nut by turning it counter clockwise and unscrew the back nut by turning it counter clockwise note some trap changes may have a female connection which would make it clockwise clean out the trap with the bucket underneath to catch the water and get a coat hanger plastic or wire to push the gunk out of the trap rinse the trap out well with a hose outside or your slop sink now go back under the sink reach up behind the straight piece of pipe thats hanging down you will find a finger nut that connects the drain stopper to the pipe remove the nut and lift out the drain stopper and push out the rest of the gunk put the drain stopper back in snug up the nut and reinstall the trap do not over tighten the flange nuts or finger nut tubs are easy just unscrew the two phillips screws that hold the overflow cover on and you will find a chain connected to the back that you can pull that will lift out all the gunk simply clean off the gunk and put it all back together flush out your tub and away you go no chemicals required Bong Screw Professional wrestling holds Glossary of climbing terms Wrench Domestic water system Textile manufacturing Hydraulic machinery Plumbing fixture Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Naval mine Flush toilet Drill bit Violin Guitar Glossary of firefighting equipment Siphon Motor oil Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Kitchen Menstrual cup Electrophysiology Irrigation Dairy Tire Carburetor Skateboarding trick Mattress Double bass Timpani Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Poker jargon Hamster Autonomous building Dog agility Sewer Septic tank Dishwashing Drainage Harmonica Basement Trapping Knife Harp Brewery Dishwasher Japanese toilet Sail-plan Internal ballistics BS 1363 Top-bar hive Strap-on dildo Anchor Billiards Lock picking Sailing Rail terminology Suplex Guqin Professional wrestling attacks Rebreather Clockwise and counterclockwise Vacuum cleaner Vacuum Equine conformation The Dalek Invasion of Earth Canal lock Table saw Customs and etiquette of Japan Pliers Hydroponics Sento Glossary of nautical terms Fountain pen Wind turbine Breaststroke Pinball Lawn mower Wire wrap Fancy rat M16 (rifle) Motility Bass guitar Zippo Borehole
