central air vs window unit i recently moved into a new apartment that was supposed to have central air it is an attic apartment on the th floor of an old brownstone unfortunately the a c isn't working so the landlord has offered to buy us two window units instead one btus and the other for the bedroom i would like to know in terms of my electricity bill will i be paying less every month with the two window units than i would with a central air i am incredibly annoyed that the a c isn't working because it was promised to us when we signed the lease and i'd like to know what to do if we do have excessive electricity bills this month as a result of the two window units they are providing thanks in advance in an attic apartment of a brick building your electric bill may jump up a month probably more depending on where you live is my wildest guess you could go and buy the acs yourself and have the rent reduced by the amount of your power usage but this would be difficult to calculate the landlord has the obligation to make repairs as to the stipulations of the contract renting an air conditioned apartment to you perhaps the air ducts were just closed to the th floor to save electricity when it was vacant the advantage of your own window acs would be that you don't have to breathe the air that has been circulated through other people's living space already but it comes at a cost Apartment Leasing Housing cooperative HVAC Solar power Insurance Air conditioning Annuity Microeconomics Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting terms Passive solar Harlem Jet engine Life insurance Mortgage Health insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Central processing unit Furnace Chatsworth House Estoppel Fire fighting Money Quake III Arena Welding Apartment building Broadband Internet access Inflation Radio controlled airplane Babylonian law Vista Way Daylight saving time Kitchen Tax Bungalow Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Lighting Public transport Futurama (TV series - season 5) Armored Core Capitalism Energy development Chatham Square Wheel of Fortune Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation Renting Fuel injection Economic rent RISC Battery electric vehicle Diving Monopoly (game) Toyota Prius Contract Gross domestic product Anarchism and capitalism Nuclear power phase-out Gas metal arc welding Electrical wiring Passenger car Dairy Collyer brothers Boeing 747 FairTax Airbus A380 GunBound Surplus value Compiler optimization Public housing Explosive material Prostitution in Germany Bus models used in New York City Transit Air-raid shelter Environmental concerns with electricity generation Economy of Russia Space Shuttle program Androgen insensitivity syndrome Derivative (finance) Credit card Spam (electronic) Pebble bed reactor NorthBridge Apartment Complex Solar cell Anglo-Chinese School Propeller Hubble Space Telescope Urinary incontinence Supply and demand GunZ The Duel The Commons Axial compressor PaX Electricity meter
