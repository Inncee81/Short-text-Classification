this is a serious question busy as we are with our normal life have we ever though of the not so normal ones here i am specially referring to the border line cases of autistic children unlike the physically handicapped ones the severe cases of mentally handicapped ones these children look ablosuletly normal but are actually not normal at all their deceiving appearance actually adds to their problem as people fail to understand their problem these children do not need special institutions to train them they can be brought close to normal life in any mainstream school by allowing them to mingle with normal children but most schools in our country refuse to give entrance to such children the worst sufferers are the parents of these children who fight a lone battle receiving no support understanding from the society at present there seems to be no hope for them most people are ignorant regarding this problem please spare a thought for such children hey thanks really i was unaware of autism before most autistic children relate well to their parents and to their siblings and often to other adults too not all but most do but he will spend hours in solitude staring at a wall or making repetitive movements and sounds helping an autistic child can be frustrating because they need continuous intensive and multifaceted assistance autistic children in the to iq range tend to have a better outlook as do those who have spontaneous speech by age or pictures can help them to learn how to speak and communicate effectively for instance if a child wants a drink they will present a picture of a drink hen kids didn't know how to talk they were very frustrated that they could not communicate after a while they are able to construct simple sentences using pictures they are then taught to associate the pictures with words and many go on to speak interacting n playing with autistic children will help them tremendeously Asperger syndrome Controversies in autism Ethical challenges to autism treatment Autistic community Autistic spectrum Neurodiversity Dyslexia Hearing impairment Mental illness Facilitated communication Aphasia Gifted Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autistic culture Transactional analysis Pervasive developmental disorder Mental retardation Theory of mind Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Neurotypical Hypoglycemia Autism epidemic Milton H.
