i have itchy bumps scattered on my legs that look like pimples what's causing them they're red and itchy with a white head like a pimple only the red area is bigger i'm living in a house with a dog but nobody else is being bitten by bugs plus i don't get these bumps anywhere but my legs also i started getting these weird bumps around the same time i started wearing pantyhose so i thought i might be allergic to nylon or something however there are only a few and aren't grouped in any one area and do not cover my entire lower body like i would expect from an allergic reaction to the material it doesn't look like a rash what's the deal i agree with the above it does sound like in grown hairs it could be due to shaving or just irritation from the hose try to go a while without the hose and see if they go away the lotion route is a good idea as well if this does not work you can always let the hair grow out lol this will prevent it from happening as well j Pantyhose Shaving Stocking Pseudofolliculitis barbae Tarantula Scabies Eczema Conjunctivitis Mosquito Acne Equine conformation "Weird Al" Yankovic Strap-on dildo Allergy Depilation Baldness Waxing Coeliac disease Hair Happy Tree Friends Goose bumps Undergarment Hay fever Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Multiple chemical sensitivity Tights Fancy rat Goofy Itch Crab louse Piccolo Junior Saga Smallpox Aerial (dance move) Treehouse of Horror IX Old wives' tale Professional wrestling throws Skinhead Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Leather Urticaria The Itchy & Scratchy Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Herpes simplex virus God Emperor of Dune Battletoads Sunscreen Mast cell Cat Keratosis pilaris Ranma __ characters Land mine The Star Wars Holiday Special Lichen planus Social rule Theory of conduct Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Shaggy dog story Pok__mon Colosseum The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Diving suit Flea Glossary of wildland fire terms Texas Instruments TMS9918 Poker jargon Invader Zim Violin Reservoir Dogs Food allergy Dualism (philosophy of mind) Fencing Fire hydrant Haircut Aluminium Leggings Hal Trosky Shot of Love Smoke-screen Spontaneous human combustion Hose (clothing) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kender Stomach cancer Volleyball Three Stooges Airedale Terrier Beard Salad Fingers Luminiferous aether The Amazing Race MP3 Dog training Table tennis 10cc Methamphetamine
