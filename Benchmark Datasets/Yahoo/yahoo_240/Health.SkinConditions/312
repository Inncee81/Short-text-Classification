i know gross but i have a question on head lice last night i discovered that my daughter had head lice i went and bought the lice shampoo and the lice and nit comb and she patiently sat there for two hours while i combed out as many nits as i could today i cleaned the entire apartment and bagged what needed to be bagged i was checking her head all day for lice but only saw the nits then i decided to go through with the lice comb again and there were hatched lice in her head everyone told me that she should be fine after the shampoo and that i only needed to get rid of the nits afterward i can't give her another treatment this close so does anyone have any ideas i don't even know if i should let her sleep in the bed that i vacuumed and sprayed thanks for any advise you can give the lice meds only kill the hatched lice not the nits that is why you comb them out before they hatch unfortunately the ones you miss will hatch and thus another treatment is necessary my daughter had lice when she was and we got rid of them without the use of chemicals this is what i learned and did lice can hold their breath hours to loosen the nits spray a mixture of white vinegar and water on her hair mix it to a percentage that does not irritate her skin with us it was about parts water part vinegar treat yourself as well they are easily spread they prefer clean scalps so those that use lots of hair products tend to be safer my hubby and son shaved their heads they prefer it that way anyway and lice like to hide in hair so the guys were safe i am told that with a blacklight in a dark room you can see the critters heard about this after the fact so i cannot guarantee this killing the lice mayo spoils quickly so we used a really thick cheap conditioner saturate roots of wet hair with conditioner cover with a shower cap and pin in place leave on for hours we slept with it on wash and then nit comb for nits and dead lice then rewash do this every four days for days whew sounds exhausting doesn't it i am against chemicals as much as possible and my daughter has suuuuuuper sensitive skin that would have reacted to the pesticide this worked for us and i recommend it to everyone good luck Crab louse Head louse Diseases of the honeybee Fancy rat Shampoo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pediculosis Hair First aid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coffee Guinea pig Gypsy moth Embalming Pneumonia Textile manufacturing Depilation Sento Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drowning Dialysis Bedbug Baldness treatments Vinegar Louse Acne Ultraviolet Eczema Migraine Haircut Baldness Otitis externa Mattress Malaria Minor Harry Potter Beasts Common cold Herpes simplex virus Hyperthermia Multiple chemical sensitivity Social rule Avenue Q Rebreather Light-emitting diode Blood Simple Sin City Hamster Oh My Goddess!
