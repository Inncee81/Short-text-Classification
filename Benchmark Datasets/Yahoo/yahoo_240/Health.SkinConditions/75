i have flakes on nose and eyebrows how can i get rid of hard to remove white flakes from my nose and eyebrows i tried putting petroleum jelly but it keeps on coming out waah i think that condition is pretty common both my husband and i have had it for several years now and it falls under the name of seborrheic dermatitus and there is no cure for it and no concrete medicine but what works for both of us is hydro cortisone and it keeps the area moisturized and makes the redness go away that sometimes appears we also have it on each side of our mouths and sides of our noses and chin it's something that came out of the blue following a reaction to some avon shampoo coincidental probably but that's when it happened so maybe this was a reaction to shampoo getting on our foreheads and faces anyway we keep the problem under control with the cortesone that is one product i never run out of since it helps with things that won't heal with other ointments or itching products it saves alot of trips to the doctors that's for sure Psoriasis Eczema Shampoo Allergy Aloe Rosacea Head Blepharitis Japanese Chin Fecal incontinence Face Body piercing Acne Tattoo Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma T'Pol Characters of Naruto Nasal congestion Homeopathy Plastic Quackery Cross-country skiing Diving Baldness 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ketoconazole Seborrhoeic dermatitis Sonic the Hedgehog Skin Skateboarding trick Eye Griffon Bruxellois Shaggy dog story Mummy Otitis externa Final Fantasy magic Drowning Sento Ayyavazhi religious practices Ebola Tobacco Scabies Shaving Biotin Cosmetics Medicine Ranma __ characters Stem cell Prostate cancer The Doctor Dances History of medicine Vulcan (Star Trek) Energy development Salute Bomberman Noonan syndrome Resorcin Drag racing Cat Leon White AFI 100 Years series Robert B.
