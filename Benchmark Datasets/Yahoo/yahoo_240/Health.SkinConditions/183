do i have a disorder i have toenail fungus and every time my toe nails grow somewhat of a nail i tear it off and i end up bleeding a lot first of all stop tearing at your toenails if you do have a fungus under the nail you run the risk of infecting your hands by opening the area and having some bleeding you are opening yourself up to a much bigger infection as well when you think of the enviornment that your toes are in damp dark and dirty shoes you have to be careful i would not suggest seeing your doctor for lamasil as it is an oral drug for fungus and has to go thru your whole body to get to your toes and can damage your liver and kidneys it should be as a last resort what i suggest is trying footlogix nail tincture it is an awesome product that you spray at the end of your nail and it penetrates the nail bed to get to the problem you have to use it until the nail totally grows out sometimes that can take months depending on your normal rate of growth it is worth the wait it has clotrimazole which is an anti fungal i think that perhaps your tearing the nail is a nervous habit because of the fungus and if your nails were looking better perhaps you wouldn't do that anymore Nail (anatomy) Nail disease Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Callus Athlete's foot Urinary incontinence Malaria Ringworm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Chlorpromazine Traumatic brain injury Fungus Prostate cancer Aspergillosis Gout Medicine Eczema Tobacco smoking Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Cephalic disorder Coeliac disease Antiretroviral drug Folic acid First aid Crohn's disease AIDS Turner syndrome Stroke Diseases of the honeybee Childbirth Shock Herpes simplex virus Radiation poisoning Chronic fatigue syndrome Cirrhosis Glycogen storage disease type I Leukemia Bone fracture Rabies Chemotherapy Immunosuppressive drug Hepatitis C Multiple sclerosis Alcoholism Tocopherol Wound Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Insulin Fancy rat Diabetic neuropathy Antibiotic Breastfeeding Lichen Blood Chagas disease Dog Paget's disease of bone Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Clomipramine Obstetrics Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Group A streptococcal infection Cytomegalovirus Kidney Erythropoietin Mycotoxin Organ transplant HIV Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cerebral palsy Sexually-transmitted infection Anal sex Terbinafine hydrochloride Stopping power Vitamin C Medical analysis of circumcision Methamphetamine Hepatitis Dialysis Ulcer Addiction Manicure Intravenous therapy Hair Subdural hematoma Mycosis Lung cancer Kenny McCormick Oral contraceptive Crimson Chin Bleeding Prolactinoma Fire fighting Glucocorticoid
