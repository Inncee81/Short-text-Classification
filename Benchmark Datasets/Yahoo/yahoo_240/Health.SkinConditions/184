help with odd skin and pimples treatments make it worse i have a rather annoying problem i dont have really bad acne or anything just a few spots on chin and forehead but theyre often big red and painful and no matter what i put on them it seems to make it worse rather then better for example i got benzyl peroxide cream and use it on pimples but if i get even a little on skin that doesnt already have a pimple one pops up same with other acne creams or herbal remedies its really annoying cause i cant use face washes or anything to actually prevent them can only spot reduce when theyre all big and already ick im wondering if anyone can recommend what to do or why this happens any help would be oh so appreciated i think the problem is bacteria in your skin those pimples are a sign that you have constant problems with acne bacteria is inside and your body is dealing with it all the time that's why sometimes they are bigger sometimes smaller depends on how strong is your body's immune system at the time but the fact that it doesn't go away means you need to help your body to deal with it permanently also you said when you used certain treatments more pimples came out this could be that bacteria is already inside just you can't see the acne with your eyes and when you used products it all came out you should know that when i start treatments acne is always more severe in first few days when the skin is clearing then it gets better and better and eventually it's gone for good my treatment is natural and kinda special so i can't really talk about it over the internet because i need to see the skin with my own eyes and check many facts before i start no persons have the same skin so my treatment is always different from person to person but i always try to deal with the root of the problem not just with acne but what i can tell you is this acne is a sign that something inside the body isn't working as it should our skin is the first indicator of body's energy imbalance weak body's immune system lack of certain nutrition or unhealthy lifestyle it can also be genetics so i don't know the reason for you but there's much you can do to help your own body deal with acne and believe me no product is as good dealing with acne as your own body drink clear water no soda drinks no sugar added drinks clear water is what your body need for proper functionality if you were used to drink soda or other drinks try and drink just clear water effects on acne will be seen in months our body has a delay when we live unhealthy it takes time for problems to show on our skin same goes when we live healthy it takes time before positive effects are seen water can help if it was the root problem for acne daily workout routine this is essential because your body needs good blood flow in areas where acne is forming so more nutrition gets there more anti body cells to kill the bacteria and more toxins get flushed away when needed remember to clean your face with clear water no soap after the exercise because sweat can cause acne too effects are seen in weeks healthy lifestyle this is the most important healthy food reduce stress relaxing activities and your mental condition depressions and constant stress causes eventually causes acne breakouts it also causes hormonal inbalances and metabolism problems effects are seen in months but change of lifestyle is a permanent solution to many problems not just acne your body and you will always be grateful for any little effort you put into changing your lifestyle to be of better quality
