can anyone help me with my daughter's bubble in her vaginal area well few days ago my daughter told me that she felt her vagina area kind of itched so i checked it and it turned out that she had some kind of bubble formed i guess under the skin and it pops up a bit she said it itched and hurt would it be because it isnt clean or is it an infection should i consult a doctor it is probably either a blocked bartholins gland or cyst take your daughter to a good gynecologist it's not from being unclean it can simply happen it may be infected or not the doctor will know best plan to go along with her and stay with her explain about the exam before hand although at her age they will most likely not do an internal exam any more than is necessary in the meantime get her in all cotton udies and go commando at night don't try to pop it soak her tush in a nice hot bath a little baking soda will help with the itch and the warmth may encourage it to drain no matter what take her to a gyn don't worry it's not anything major and doesn't mean anything a mom would sweat over if you get my meaning just something that happens Prostate cancer Vagina Fecal incontinence Vulvovaginal health Psoriasis Menstrual cup Eczema Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medicine Vulva Theory of conduct Marilyn Monroe Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Itch Skin The Shining (film) Kim Possible Manicure Gynaecology Candidiasis Social rule Menstrual cycle Boom Town (Doctor Who) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Gland Haven (TNG episode) Rape AFI 100 Years series Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Shaggy dog story Fiddler on the Roof Kodocha Intravenous therapy Acne Jock itch Mosquito Earwax EastEnders Hyperthermia The Adventures of Pete & Pete Late Night with Conan O'Brien Negima Pitaten Angel One (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sex organ The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Strap-on dildo Cirrhosis Father's Day (Doctor Who) American and British English differences The Amber Spyglass Vaginal lubrication Pok__mon Live!
