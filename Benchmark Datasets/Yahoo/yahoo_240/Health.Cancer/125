my stepmother is dying from lung cancer what can i do to help and comfort my father sorry to hear about your step mom as for your father the best thing you can do is be there for him as often as you can and just follow his lead if he seems stressed by the day to day things like paying bills cleaning etc offer to help with that however if those things are keeping him busy he may not want the help in that case he may just value having someone there for support or to talk to if he wants to spend more time at the hospital perhaps you could offer to bring items food from home so he can spend more time with her bottom line just be supportive and available for him although nothing can truly ease the pain of a loved one's passing he'll appreciate your support Palliative care Cancer The Amber Spyglass Le Malade imaginaire Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fathers' rights Prostate cancer Mattress Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Lung cancer Quarantine Ten Commandments FairTax Dog training 39th Canadian federal election Ty Cobb Equine conformation Social rule Scenes from a Memory Haibane Renmei Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Publicly funded medicine U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Mickey Mantle Capital punishment American Red Cross 1957 World Series Limp Bizkit Terri Schiavo 10 Things I Hate About You About a Boy Swimming New Deal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Microsoft Jack Buck Yin Shun John the Baptist Pyramid (game show) 50 First Dates Days of our Lives Blankets (graphic novel) Asbestos Glossary of partner dance terms Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pneumonia Medical cannabis Kodocha Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit National Kidney Foundation Singapore Kurt Cobain May 2005 in Canada Babe Ruth Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case RuneScape economy Poliomyelitis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laura Schlessinger Ethical consumerism Theory of conduct 2004 Republican National Convention Women in Islam The Inside Grandview, U.S.A.
