could this be cancer my mom has lost weight like crazy within the last year she's basically skin and bones now and no matter how much she eats she can't gain any weight she is in constant pain and has trouble walking and moving she has these bumps on some of her bones that stick out and cause her pain and seem to keep appearing in new places she is constantly exhausted to the point where she can't even sit up for too long without having to lie down she also has this pain in her abdomen that comes and goes throughout the day that she says feels like stabbing pains no matter how hard i try i can't get her to agree to go and see a doctor and i'm not sure what to do could this be cancer btw she's been a smoker for at least years i really don't appreciate being called a cruel child you have no idea how hard i've been trying and what i've been doing for her i think it is cruel to call me cruel when i'm sitting here watching my mother go thru this and not being able to do anything to help her i truly hope you don't treat your patients and their families like that yes it most definitely could be cancer there's really no way you can make her see a doctor against her will what you can do is tell her that you are seriously concerned about her symptoms and sudden weight loss and that you are fearing the worst then tell her it would really mean a lot to you if she would see her doctor for a diagnosis to put your mind at ease beyond that there's nothing you can do if she still won't go as hard as it's going to be you'll just have to accept her decision and realize that it's her body her life her decision i am in no way discouraging you from trying to convince her to get to a doctor please try all you can to get her to go and find out what's going on but if she refuses then just respect her choice i wish you and your mom the best Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Milton H.
