is false hope worse than no hope have you encountered someone in an official capacity who has been all nice friendly said they would help you get a disability pension housing then have them turn around say i cant help you they drop you flat on your face after you got your hopes up this is so cruel imo false hope is worse than no hope you leave thanking god feeling so relieved someone is finally going to help you then they just slam you back down again not only have they gotten your hopes up you have stopped pursuing other avenues believing you have found the one person who is finally going to help you i want someone to give me the straight goods when i ask a question or for assistance i dont want to be given the easy answer for them i waste my energy filling out paperwork for them getting drs letters running around only to find out they knew they couldnt help all along i dont care if they had good intentions i want the truth to start with has this happened to you what makes these people think they have the right to waste your time your energy and your money for gas two trips hours both ways thats hours of driving and a week of hideous pain because of the driving when they knew all along they wouldnt help you given some of the answers here and i am not being argumentive or nasty can you name three things one thing that a disabled homeless person should feel positive about other than thank god it isnt raining today and i wasnt mugged last night why do people persist in telling the homeless disabled seniors that they have to think positive false hope is worse than no hope it's a shame there are those out there who offer false hope to people when they know they can't help them i think it's really cruel to treat a human being that way how betrayed those people must feel honesty is still the best policy in my eyes Social rule Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 EastEnders Shaggy dog story Justification (theology) Plame affair Goodness and value theory Contract 2005 trial of Michael Jackson John Howard Yoder Humphrey Bogart God Emperor of Dune 1957 World Series Avenue Q Muslim ibn Aqeel Religion One Tree Hill (TV series) Sant Thakar Singh Tenshinhan Phaedo Poker jargon Socrates Current teachings of Prem Rawat Charles Darwin's views on religion Cindy Sheehan The Amber Spyglass Health care in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Operation Market Garden Japanese mythology Lie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Evil The Death Gate Cycle God Boston Public Book of Isaiah Philosophical skepticism New York Giants Kain (Legacy of Kain) One Piece minor characters Pyramids of Mars Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Glen Jacobs Dualism (philosophy of mind) Scientology beliefs and practices Stomach cancer Fitz Hugh Ludlow Immanuel Kant Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Big Brother (USA TV series) Static Shock Autism rights movement Existence of God W.I.T.C.H.
