the bottom of my navel piercing is slightly swollen red and bleeds slightly is this normal for healing i've had my piercing for several months now originally i was removing it every time i took a shower and then replacing it i was told that i should keep it in as i was most likely hindering the healing process by doing that so now i've been keeping it in and just cleaning it with a q tip as i shower the top hole of the piercing is not red at all and looks normal however the bottom hole has been red for a long while now and after work i'm a waiter i always have a small amount of dried blood on the ring it does not hurt and the area isn't sensitive or abnormally warm it just looks like a shiny red bump should i be worried what steps should i take to get it to heal thanks for your help this is just irritation from your clothing wear hipster jeans whenever you can it will stop the piercing from getting irritated make sure you keep shirts and sweaters and what not off the piercing too these also rub and cause trouble i'd also recommend not touching your piercing except for cleaning playing with it can delay the healing keep aftercaring it until at least the month mark it should be pretty well healed up or on it's way by then the navel is an incredibly tedious and very frustrating piercing to heal good luck Body piercing Earring Tattoo Violin Navel piercing Tongue piercing Nipple piercing Poker jargon Bong Drill bit Traumatic brain injury Intravenous therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Prince Albert piercing Urinary incontinence Barbell (piercing) Professional wrestling slang Brewery Social rule Psoriasis Swimming 1957 World Series Eczema Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Umbilicus Menstrual cycle Acne Blood (computer game) Strap-on dildo Team Fortress Classic Motor oil Piercing migration Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Penis Lip piercing Carburetor Comanche Hamster Mosquito Ozone depletion First aid Condom Volleyball Ear piercing instrument Dry cleaning Breastfeeding Menstrual cup Cancer Wolverine (comics) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Salad Fingers Sento Ozone hole Clarinet Coeliac disease Scar Fencing Scarification Wisdom teeth Mattress Equine conformation Tenshinhan Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Female genital cutting GunBound Sacrifice (computer game) Bathing Dialysis Floppy disk Wound Bleeding Diving suit YuYu Hakusho Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Anemia Fast bowling Diabetes mellitus Clothing Fancy rat Pinball Leukemia Shroud of Turin Vampire Drowning Characters in the Smurfs Milton H.
