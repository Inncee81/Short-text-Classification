bee sting no swelling normal i had never been stung by a bee before but last saturday i got stung on my hand and it did not swell it was little itchy at first and after minutes or so i took out the stinger or whatever that thing is called and nothing happened is that normal i mean if a bee stings you and you don't swell is that normal everybody reacts to things differently it's actually a good thing your hand didn't react by swelling or anything because that could be an indication of an allergic reaction your totally normal not to have any swelling good luck Allergy Africanized bee Venom (poison) Honeybee Spider Anaphylaxis Tattoo Bee Hay fever Mast cell Carpenter bee 22 Short Films About Springfield Sting (wrestler) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Stingray Tarantula Wasp Mosquito Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Billboard Hot 100 Food allergy Eczema Chemical reaction Social rule Timon and Pumbaa Alkane Pipe organ The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show Antihistamine Minoxidil Predestination Bee Gees Scorpion Angioedema Kim Possible NWo Luck Formic acid Acid The Midnight Sun Insulin World Championship Wrestling The Contender (television series) Ghost in the Machine Apocrita Karma Fusion power Milton H.
