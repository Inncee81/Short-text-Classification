how do i prevent heat exhaustion i tried out for volleyball yesterday and about minutes into the practice i started feeling awful so when i got home i looked up my symptoms and it turned out that i had heat exhaustion i have tryouts again today and i don't want it to happen again today because i couldn't perform my best yesterday because of it i didn't say anything because i wanted to impress the coach but i couldn't seem to do my best these were my symptoms excessive thirst nausea dizzyness lightheadness i also didn't have any water except the water fountain water which made me feel worse because it was warm so what can i do i was also really sweaty and i have a sunburn which made it worse continue to hydrate yourself ahead of time drink plenty of water and also re hydrate using gatorade to replace those electrolites that water cannot replace remember when you feel thirsty that means you are already dehydrated but that doesn't mean that you won't feel thirsty while working out don't eat too much but have some carbs for energy if you drink too much water you can experience nausea also stay in the shade on breaks or when possible and when needed rest just because it is the first day of practice doesn't mean it is okay to push yourself to the point of heat exhaustion or even worse a heat stroke be honest with yourself and your coach when you need a break good luck Hyperthermia Dehydration First aid Shaggy dog story Dialysis Gatorade Carburetor Rehydration Theory of conduct Panic attack Solar power One Tree Hill (TV series) Bong Stomach cancer Amiga Power Low-carbohydrate diet New York Knicks Piccolo Junior Saga Kitchen Norway national football team Diarrhea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Poker jargon Fecal incontinence 1957 World Series The Contender (television series) Dundas Square Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Time Out of Mind Steam engine Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Evel Knievel Weight training Humphrey Bogart Diabetes insipidus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma StarCraft: Uprising 24 Hours of Le Mans Survival skills Singlish Social rule Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hiking 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Alcohol fuel Hypoglycemia New York Giants M__ni__re___s disease Autonomous building Ben Johnson (athlete) Alcohol Jon Secada Cholera Drowning The Doors Milton H.
