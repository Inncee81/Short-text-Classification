i have many little pieces of broken glass in my hands and feet help yesterday i dropped an old glass lampshade and it smashed i tried to pick up the pices and in doing so i got many little tiny peices in in the palms of my hands and fingers i apparently didn't sweep up all of the pieces because i keep feeling small sharp things in the soles of my feet i tried cutting open the skin to get them out but they are too deep i can feel them when i move my hands or when i walk can old glass poison you at least years would it be okay in reference to my health to just leave it alone and pretend they aren't there can they hurt me or will they jsut stay in place i can't even count how many pieces i can feel they will be painful and over the next few days will become reddened and maybe discharge you can buy very tiny needles from the chemist an insulin sryinge works well to get the glass out soak the hands in slimy soapy water you could add some glycerin to the solution or even baby oil this will help the glass to come out i dont know about glass being poisonous maybe lead crystal but i doubt glass if they are below the skins surface then the tape wont work unfortunately if you have more than a dozen you may have to take a visit to the dr to have them removed if they are painful your body will work them out in time as they are a foreign body that is part of the swelling redness discharge as well keep up the antibacterial washes for the next few days whilst the initial entry points are open to infection good luck jo Diving Glass Tattoo Aerial (dance move) Textile manufacturing Soap Knife Psoriasis RuneScape quests Massage Intravenous therapy Swimming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Callus Atomic Kitten Methamphetamine Gout The Amber Spyglass Reflexology First aid Skin Naruto jutsu Insulin Aloe Water (molecule) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling attacks Dialysis Gonorrhoea Opportunity rover Acne Babe Ruth Upholstery Cocaine Acupuncture Wound Bong Swingout Prostate cancer Drill bit Mattress Ultraviolet Tesla coil Glycerin The Shining (film) Manicure Paul Is Dead Boil Social rule Stereoscopy EastEnders Customs and etiquette of Japan Group A streptococcal infection Equine conformation Backstroke Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling holds Pneumonia Dead Sea Milton H.
