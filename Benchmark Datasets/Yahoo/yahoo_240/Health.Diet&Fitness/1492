am i gaining muscle befor losing weight so i have been eating right drinking lots of water no soda no juices stuff like that i dont get an intense workout i have no time but i go on walks a day with my son averaging a mile per walk i find myself going down a pound then up pounds and its very discouraging am i gaining muscle if so how long till i lose weight its making me so upset chances are that any fluctuation in weight is either food waste yet to be disposed of or water weight from retention due to the activity truth be told and i hate to give a slightly negative answer here is that with that routine you are not likely to see any significant weight loss any time soon your diet seems to be ok so long as you're not over doing it on sodium sodium can cause water retention in high doses as for the walking you should change to power walking and increase the distance by at least another mile if not two weight loss by cardio is almost as simple as balancing your checkbook in reverse you must have more calories being burned than the amount of calories you take in each day simple and easy i hope this helps in some fashion or another Dieting Bodybuilding Weight training Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Hydrogen economy Soft drink Hiking Obesity Clinical depression Super Size Me Weight loss Breastfeeding Nutrition Explosive material Protein-energy malnutrition Growth hormone treatment Aspartame Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Action potential Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dietary fiber Calorie Water purification Urinary incontinence Babe Ruth Risk management Diarrhea Tocopherol Energy Triathlon Insulin Sugar substitute Fecal incontinence Ton Sucralose Marathon (sport) Cirrhosis Internal ballistics Ramen Vitamin C Fugu Low-carbohydrate diet Milk Lithium salt Glucocorticoid Swimming Equine conformation Depleted uranium Hypoglycemia Binge eating disorder Veganism South Beach diet Tooth enamel Doxepin Potassium Bread Creatine Junk food Microeconomics Exercise Hypertension Calorie restriction Pound The Coca-Cola Company Life extension Uranium Kidney stone Handloading Welding Omega-3 fatty acid 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Famine Hyperglycemia Membrane potential Diabetes mellitus Paget's disease of bone Fasting Social rule Coeliac disease Diving Protein Body type (exercise) Ra (board game) Osteoarthritis Sodium carbonate Growth hormone Caffeine Muscle Ayurveda Coffee Haloperidol Weight Weight Watchers Nuclear fallout
