is weight lifting every day really that bad i love lifting weights and i like to lift every day because i notice better results from it when i take a brake i feel myself deflating and it isn't good my muscles don't get sore anymore because i think i have trained them for about a month i used to do two full workouts a day of an hour each i did it every day and now no matter what i do i don't get sore do you think i should just work out every day muscles need at least hrs to repair recover are you ramping up the weight if not then your not doing that much damage which i would assume since you aren't sore bump your weights by plates you should be sore after that Weight training Bodybuilding Andr__s Galarraga Urinary incontinence Tire Paragliding Semi-trailer Group A streptococcal infection Hal Trosky Mountain bike Mattress Exercise Marathon (sport) Shaggy dog story Disc brake WCW Power Plant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Muscle Elevator Professional wrestling throws Brassiere Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Bicycle Social rule Mouth ulcer Running Sandy Koufax Bruise Hour John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Traumatic brain injury Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mitsubishi 3000GT Horsepower Creatine Personal rapid transit Chronic fatigue syndrome Ron Weasley Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Wall Street Breastfeeding Mechanical advantage Bon Jovi Skateboarding trick Pitcher Gliding LSD Car handling Recumbent bicycle Sweatshop Heinkel He 100 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) First aid Overtraining Helicopter Clinical depression Massage Hot air balloon Weight HMS Electra (H27) Bedsore Dumbbell Golden Plates Childbirth Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Novelty (locomotive) Theory of conduct Inflation USS Wasp (CV-18) Triathlon Professional wrestling holds Carpenters Human adaptation to space Glucocorticoid Ontological argument Folic acid InuYasha (character) Bicycle frame Negima Kodocha Herpes simplex virus Qiyamah Johnny 5 Tiger I Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ben Johnson (athlete) Clean and jerk 24 Hours of Le Mans Station wagon Tocopherol Weightlifting Decompression sickness Space Shuttle program Radiation therapy
