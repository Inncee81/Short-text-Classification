is there any way to get curves i'm and i've already hit puberty when i was but when i look in the mirror i see the body of a year old i have no curves whatsoever my abdomen is straight like a board i'm pretty short so it makes me feel younger than i am is there any way to get more curves like a smaller waist and bigger boobs or any curves at all okay what i have observed from your question is that you are and want to have a bit more weight and curves along with it to look more mature as a fitness instructor i recommend a female your age to wait a little if you're are trying to gain weight because if you force yourself to gain weight now as i understand from your question i could be wrong but if you are trying you should wait because when you reach about the weight you'll be gaining could come back to haunt you when added to the weight you already had as for gaining curves they are plenty of exercises you can do but my recommended exercise is sit ups they are many kinds of sits up this will deal would curves around your abdomin area and for your butt area you can do squats this works a great deal and your should be right along with it if u dont know bout these exercises none actually require weights but squats is more effective with atleast a little and i recommend just a little weigh for a girl like you as for the part with your boobs you can't exercise to get that bigger i think you should just let it grow don't force it and i definitely don't recommend you thinking of boob job and your age because there's plenty of time for you and your body to grow okay take care and i wish you luck remember if u don't know these execercises just http www wikihow com do a squat http www wikihow com do sit ups you can get protein shakes like megamass for a cheap price if you do wanna try gaining weight and remember protein helps you grow fastes it doesnt make you fat so its okay Weight training Anorexia nervosa Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Puberty Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Human position Bodybuilding Obesity Theory of conduct Microeconomics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetes mellitus Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Normal distribution Abdomen Fecal incontinence Clinical depression The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Breast Jon Secada Brassiere Spider Internal ballistics Piccolo Junior Saga Keynesian economics Osteoarthritis Breastfeeding Exercise 24 Hours of Le Mans Professional wrestling throws Supply and demand Volleyball Tocopherol Tightlacing CPU cache Tarantula Tai Chi Chuan Wood Knife Skateboarding trick 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Emotions (album) Milk Transsexuality The Ashlee Simpson Show Dialysis Fast bowling Cancer Sport rowing Milton H.
