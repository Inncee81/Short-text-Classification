does anyone have any suggestions for a healthy diet on budget i really want to feed my children a healthier diet but it is killing my bank account i can buy frozen pizza for what it costs to buy a bag of oranges it's ridiculous i totally agree fruits and veggies are extremely hard on the budget i try all the time to make room for better cheaper alternatives homemade food is the way to go even the pre made stuff has a higher pricetag over the long run and packed with presevatives god knows what else i know it takes more time and effort but the returns are worth it leftovers are a great way to save money cooking yourself gives you more control over what you they eat i don't know what your kids like i imagine like most kids they are fussy and are generally used to eating frozen and pre packaged food the reason why the frozen pizza is so cheap is because it is made of cheap ingredients salt sugar oil flour and low quality meat oranges take time and a lot of effort to grow and ship we end up feeling this in our pockets things like rice beans pasta are cheap even in large quantities there are also some fresh veggies at least where i live that tend to be less expensive such as celery lettuce darker kinds are better carrots potatoes beets yellow green beans etc the frozen veggies are actually ideal they get frozen at the peak of freshness so things like broccoli cauliflower peas corn other mixes are great and not generally expensive for the amount you get fruits are tougher i'm thinking your like me and look for sales try looking at the fruit and veg markets in your neighborhood it's a misconception that grocery stores are cheaper also appreciate the canned fruit options in water not syrup cut up fruit and top with light coolwhip the kids will think it's a treat instead of boring fruit also look for free recipes online there's all kinds of stuff out there that you can make that is simple and not expensive lastly if you haven't been already invest in some multivitamins for your kids this can help fill the gaps so be creative read up on the subject you can likely expect some resistance from your kids so many kids today are addicted to junk food stick to your guns in the long run they will thank you i suppose it may be time to pull rank and start a revolution in your household lol good luck Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Food Hamburger Pizza Ice cream French cuisine Ramen Vegetarianism Bread Microeconomics Veganism Jewish cuisine Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Organic food Vegetarian cuisine Hamster Cuisine of the Southern United States Salad In-N-Out Burger Curry Coffee Domesticated turkey Soup Hot dog Potato MRE Peruvian cuisine Illegal drug trade Chili con carne Tomato Cheese Polish cuisine Cajun cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Plastic Cuisine of the Philippines Vitamin C Tea Russian cuisine Dietary fiber Rice pudding Snack food Peanut Folic acid Flour Commodity markets Kosher foods Cuisine of Singapore Healthy eating Cantonese cuisine Pasta Minestrone Maize Cuisine of Argentina Nutrition Inflation Roman eating and drinking D__ner kebab Common Agricultural Policy Maple syrup Street food Bulk vending Pancake Agriculture Milk Fancy rat Alcoholic beverage British cuisine Blood (computer game) RuneScape skills Tesco Bong Potassium Apple Mutual fund Korean cuisine Alcohol fuel Starch Sugar Dairy Apple pie Sauerkraut Common bean Sugar beet Guinea pig Soft drink Beet Dumpling Fish and chips
