how do i become a fitter girl okay it's the summer holidays i can shape up what kind of exercises would you recommend for someone of x medium strength x low medium flexibility x high speed a fast runner x medium stamina how could i increase my flexibility because i am a tall girl and i'm not really skinny a healthy average weight i also think it would be cool to be a cheerleader but that's not the most important thing because i'm a bit short for time as i am going to be busy with school the year ahead so some tips please much appreciated ten points for the best answer thank you to all those that answer x oh and i have some access to a trampoline but it's not huge im about the same as you with medium high stamina and im pretty fast and all that i do crunches and pushups all the time whenever youre watchin tv and theres a commercial just do crunches or pushups also you said you wanted to become more flexible i would do splits and stretches in front of the tv or if you have a laptop you could do splits and stretching while you check email or whatever be careful not to expect that the first tiem you stretch a muscle youre going to be able to push it all the way you could seriously injure yourself just take it bit by bit and before you know it youll be much more flexible also a good diet with the right amount of fruits and veggies and meats breads yadda yadda yadda always helps i also continuously throughout the year am playing sports soccer year round basketball in the spring winter volleyball and track for school i used to do gymnastics but i found that i personally was not good at it so i just stopped and advanced in my other sports if you are a fast runner i reccomend track and field do it with a friend its very fun and you can get much faster and fitter through that easily however i would not reccomend cheerleading it can really ruin self confidence in a girl and hurt her ability to suceed i youve never done it and everyone else is so much better than you or because youre trying to get a guy by being one of the flirty little cheerleaders plus it is a very dangerous sport and there are so many other sports that seem so much more fun and that will help you to get in shape too also just doing things around the house like jumprope or swimming if you have a pool can really help your endurance and your strength swimming especiallyy because it works all the muscles in your body all in all just do your best to stay active everyday all the time even just walking fast to wherever you are going in the mall or going somewhere can make a difference hope i helped Weight training Equine conformation Swimming Gymnastics Teen Girl Squad Exercise Dog Volleyball Water polo Cheerleading Sport Diving Human height Washington State University Dieting Menstrual cup One Tree Hill (TV series) Homestar Runner Anorexia nervosa Protein Baseball Aerial (dance move) Bicycle Tank Piccolo Junior Saga Tai Chi Chuan Boxing Texas Longhorn Athletics Modem Car handling Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Marching band Cranford, New Jersey Bodybuilding Backstroke Hamster Summer Olympic Games Drill bit Explosive material Marathon (sport) Welding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Poker jargon Glossary of climbing terms IBM PC compatible Team Fortress Classic Internal ballistics Paragliding Breaststroke Prostate cancer Physical education Sailing Triathlon Motorcycle University of Pretoria Olympic Games CPU design Ultimate (sport) Tank classification Running Sport rowing Pascack Valley High School Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Fecal incontinence Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Chinese martial arts Parachuting Parkour Azumanga Daioh Dog agility Vegeta Puberty Drag racing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dragon Booster Avalanche Sport in Ireland Babe Ruth David Beckham Table tennis Spice Girls Eventing Computer Social rule Physical attractiveness Taekwondo Tyrannosaurus rex Handloading
