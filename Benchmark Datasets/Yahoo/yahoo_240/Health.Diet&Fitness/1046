help how can i stop obsessing about food i seriously do live to eat not eat to live it's not that i am really fat or anything i'm pretty average sized but i look around at so many really overweight people and i can see this happening to me i know about eating right and working out and all that that's how i stay the size i am what i need help with is what's in my head every day i have to stop myself from getting an egg mcmuffin for breakfast and talk myself out of fries at lunch every day i think about what i am going to get to eat like it's the biggest thing in my day how can i change the way i think about food you're just like me i don't think i'll every gain weight i'm rather skinny but i do exactly what you do i think about it all the time it's annoying isn't it beginning of every day i'll automatically start planning what to eat and calorie counting it but i'm getting much better now what i do is just keep myself busy keep my mind as busy as i can so i can't think about it i'll exercise and i won't think about anything but that or i'll draw watch tv read a book anything and if you find yourself thinking about food again mentally slap yourself or if you want you can even wear a rubberband and pull it to snap you when you think about food i understand how unbelievably horrible it is and how it's like second nature and when you're about to it to stop thinking about what and how much you're going to eat well you know what unhealthy food is so you should stay away from that by instinct but then again it's ok to have those little yummies once in a while go eat pizza or fries or whatever a month ok are yo thinking about that egg mcmuffin go get one once a week and eat half in the morning with a piece of fruit and save the rest for later not putting on weight doesn't necessarily mean you can't eat what you want you can but if its something that you're scared can make you fat then eat it at small portions so you don't have to think that much when you eat you can eat whatever you want but all in small portions hope i helped Dieting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Super Size Me Obesity Anorexia nervosa Breakfast Binge eating disorder Kodocha Cuisine of Denmark Garfield Hamster McDonald's Hamburger Futurama (TV series - season 5) Atkins Nutritional Approach Sin City Survivor (novel) Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Patrick Star Milk Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.
