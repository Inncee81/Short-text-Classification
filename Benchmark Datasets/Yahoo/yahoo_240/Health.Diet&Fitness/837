best way to lose weight okay now no matter what i say i know im still gonna get these answers so im gonna capitalize it so maybe you might see it and not give me the wrong answer when i just told you i tired losing weight and nothing works the only thing i never tried was diet pills anyway i tired going on a diet i tired eating healthy and less i tired excersiseing while dieting and i cant lose weight i tried car dio workouts for a good months and i still cant lose weight now since i hopefully made that clear i want to know if there is any diet pills i can take that do work if i can take it while i work out and helps me lose weight thats fine i really want to loose at least pounds and im so sick of trying to exercisers tired of dieting and no results what so ever and for those who say it takes time im not gonna wait another months for nothing to happen so please if you know any pill that i can get at a local drug store or the gmc store please tell me the thing is i am over weight and losing pounds would make me much happier even if i lose pounds ill still be on the chubby side but w e i like being chubby its just i did not want to go over a certain weight and i did and now i really wanna go back to that point i was like a year ago its just for a girl to be at the right weight its like pound which ill never be the most you can lose with pills is pounds they are not fda regulated or approved the only variable you can really control is exercise find a method exercise that you enjoy and do it every day build muscle eat what you want when you are actually hungry and stop before you are stuffed full try to eat a balanced diet but don't limit yourself with a bunch or rules and diets diets don't work and are unhealthy in the long run only do things that are healthy and that you can do forever for the rest of your life like cutting fast food forever percent of dieters gain it all back in one year and percent do in two years dieting is associated with weight gain over a long period of time you need at least to calories every day just to perform basic bodily functions if women like you learned to love their bodies a billion dollar industry that cashes in on insecurities and making people feel like they are not good enough would collapse quite frankly being a little fat isn't as unhealthy as being thin anybody who thinks diets or restricting food types is a good idea is uneducated about the human body short cuts do not work most of the weight you lose is water weight for health eat a balanced diet and exercise for the health and endorphins and forget about an ideal shape the average age a girl starts dieting is women are on a diet at any given time us women are unsatisfied with their appearance your body has a set point weight that it wants to be if you starve yourself the body will fight back by lowering the metabolism to maintain it's ideal weight limit your tv viewing tv commercials send out a message about attractiveness in this brainwashed society that has been seeing images of beautiful skinny women and mocking chubby people it's worse for women look at the number of average or uglier guys on tv and in movies versus the number of women percent of women in a study rated their ideal shape and it turned out to be percent underweight julia roberts and cameron diaz meet the clinical requirements for anorexia and so do of playboy centerfolds if the flippin mannequins became real women they wouln't be able to menstruate women finally get some rights but we limit ourselves like this and our bodies are reduced to objects we inspect and criticise men decide to only value women for their looks and a thin attractive wife symbolizes social status for them girls call each other fat as the greatest insult they can muster when did fat become worse than cruel stupid dishonest lazy or cowardly when did chubby start to mean the last four of those things we are killing our daughters and wasting our lives trying to meet an ideal that blows i wish women would get together and fight it instead of letting others control us like this unless you are considered obese or have a bmi of over don't worry about it love your body and your confidence will light up the room and give other women permission to love themselves too Nutrition Physical attractiveness Bodybuilding Prostate cancer Super Size Me Low-carbohydrate diet
