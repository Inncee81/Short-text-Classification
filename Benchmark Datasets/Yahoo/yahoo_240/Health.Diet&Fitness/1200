fiber pills hey all i started taking fiber pills to control my ibs and also just to stay regular i am starting out slow only dose once a day my question is is it okay to take them at night with a glass of water before bed or should i be taking them during the day when i'm eating my daily foods wouldn't it work the same either way i wasn't sure so i just wanted some opinions also is there anyone else here that uses fiber to help with ibs if so is it working i take it for ibs d certain non soluble fibers will help with this and not just constipation how long do you think i should wait before i start taking the full dose i use it and it doesn't really matter when you take them night vs day but it's better to take them at the same time every day to help with regularity most people take them at night with water to help them have a bm in the morning the key to fiber pills is to make sure you're taking in plenty of water i've found that doubling what the bottle recommends ends up being about the right amount otherwise you will just bloat up and not find any relief Dietary fiber Fecal incontinence Irritable bowel syndrome Mattress Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Caffeine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Apollo 8 Urinary incontinence Textile manufacturing Cannabis (drug) Folic acid Tocopherol Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Sewage treatment Diazepam Vitamin D Jute Vitamin C Dioxin Laxative Gastroparesis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atkins Nutritional Approach Crohn's disease Diverticulosis Hangover Antidepressant Creatine Mid-Autumn Festival Medical cannabis Kurt Cobain Menstrual cycle Textile manufacturing terminology Social rule Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Time Out of Mind Psoriasis Dieting Clozapine Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Satchel Paige Jon Secada Akuma (Street Fighter) Migraine Emergency preparedness Nutrition Plastic Vitamin poisoning Topiramate Theory of conduct Hey Jude Fertility awareness Oxycodone Paget's disease of bone Milk Polyethylene terephthalate Tooth Kitchen Jeopardy!
