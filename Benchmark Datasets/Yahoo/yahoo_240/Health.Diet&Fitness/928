what should i put into my smoothie i am wondering what should i put into my smoothie to help build muscle mass any hints you want it to be as close to real food as possible so your body will absorb it quickly when your body is low on key nutrients it sacrifices the muscle mass you've built to get what it is lacking and you don't want that to happen most commercial smoothies are made with fresh fruit some nutrient powders and shave ice to keep them cold these are better than powdered mixes because they contain more micro nutrients but you can do better at home you can improve on this by freezing chunks of watermelon while they're in season and using those instead of the ice to get more trace nutrients if you freeze halved strawberries blueberries etc they'll give your muscles a better treat than frozen water freeze these things in freezer bags so they can be broken into chunks later sliced apples and pears work well as a fresh fruit base and some whole milk or a spoonful of ice cream adds flavor and necessary fat g of whey protein per serving will take care of your muscles one trick i found that helps with cleanup is to add a little liquid soy lecithin before blending and the whole thing pours out without coating everything if you're low on time a packet of instant breakfast a banana cold milk and enough whey powder to add g protein should give you a quick balanced meal your muscles will soak up yielding at least g protein and enough carbs and nutrients to keep your muscles from starving Ice cream Milk Tofu Coffee Tea Food preservation Milkshake Dairy Soy protein Fecal incontinence Bodybuilding Cuisine of Denmark Kit Kat Breakfast Chocolate Yoghurt Cuisine of the Philippines Dieting Dairy product Bread Peruvian cuisine Organic food Watermelon Soy milk Soybean Mayonnaise Food Pancake Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese cuisine Nutrition Hamster German cuisine Ramen Carbon dioxide Potassium Bong Cantonese cuisine Vegetarianism Jewish cuisine Tocopherol Cuisine of the Southern United States Soup Egg (food) Bagel Gatorade Monosodium glutamate Cuisine of Brazil Protein Cake McDonald's Breastfeeding Muesli Ham Fanta Russian cuisine Rum Korean cuisine Sewage treatment Chicken soup Cold Stone Creamery Atkins Nutritional Approach Water Avocado Chinese cuisine Apple Lake In-N-Out Burger Domesticated turkey Barbecue Fire extinguisher Hydroponics Sherbet Idli Butter Guinea pig Ketchup Cream (food) Beer Fancy rat Oreo Sea-Monkey Gelato French cuisine Dog Coeliac disease Espresso Prostate cancer Comfrey Fruit Explosive material Glucose Gelatin
