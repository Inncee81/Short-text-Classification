lifting weights every day i like lifting weights i currently do upper body one day and lower the next but my lower body has never been the problem my legs have always been big and muscular my upper body is what i need to work on i want to lift weights every day and have a hour rest period i take creatine so my muscles don't stay sore for long by the time i wake up my muscles feel fine i also take protein shakes and eat very well so i personally think it'd be fine to work out every day what do you think i want to work out the same upper body muscles every day and just do the legs occasionally muscle is not built while you lift it is built after you lift when you are lifting you are actually tearing your muscles after your done lifting is when your muscles begin to reform and also where sometimes more muscle is formed if you were to lift the same muscle groups every day the muscles would be torn to often they would not have enough time to reform this would mean that not only would you not gain muscle but you might even lose it i suggest that you have atleast one day of rest before working on the same muscle group again this does not mean you cant lift for a day it just means you cant work those muscles for a day you can lift every single day if you work your lower body while your upper body is healing and your upper body while your lower body is healing good luck Weight training Bodybuilding Equine conformation Muscle Dieting Creatine Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling throws Duchenne muscular dystrophy Triathlon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling holds Puberty Myocardial infarction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Becker's muscular dystrophy Exercise Marathon (sport) Post Polio syndrome Fecal incontinence Humerus Tyrannosaurus rex Tocopherol Tibia Suplex Deadlift Tetrapod Diabetes mellitus Scapula Backstroke Atkins Nutritional Approach Arm Abdomen Atherosclerosis Elephant Inclusion body myositis Obesity Aerial (dance move) Overtraining Stomach cancer Muscular dystrophy Human height Growth hormone deficiency Professional wrestling attacks Black widow spider Skeletal muscle Weightlessness Sport rowing Eye Paragliding Vegeta Radius (bone) The Amazing Race Traumatic brain injury Protein Reptile Heart Swimming Mr. Olympia Narcolepsy Brassiere Insulin Scar Insomnia Repetitive strain injury Action potential Sleep Weightlifting Occipital bone Stall (flight) Chiropractic Dog Coeliac disease Hulk (comics) Ulna Stress fracture Group A streptococcal infection Motor cortex Stopping power Casualty lifting Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Diabetic neuropathy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Anatomical terms of location Breastfeeding Breaststroke Growth hormone treatment Proprioception Rotator cuff tear Fibula Fugu Climbing specialist (cycling) Squat (exercise) Adjustable gastric band Thermoregulation Folic acid
