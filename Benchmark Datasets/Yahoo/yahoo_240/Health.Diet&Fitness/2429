have you noticed this when i lose weight the fat from my stomach seems to lose from the outside in like if you imagined a circle of fat on my stomach the circle would just get smaller and smaller and smaller has anyone else experienced this that's possibly because when you put on weight around your waist fat gathers around the centre of the stomach first and then continually increases outwards if you continue to put on weight usually when you lose weight you will lose it first from the places you've put it on most recently so you will lose the weight from the sides of your stomach first continuing inwards don't worry keep working at it and you'll have great abs in no time you'll probably find though that because you've lost weight at the sides of your stomach first the shape of your figure will become more defined quicker i e pear apple hourglass etc keep up the good work though good luck Tightlacing Obesity Tide Professional wrestling holds Weight loss Coriolis effect Hourglass corset Weight training Adjustable gastric band Nuclear weapon design Equine conformation Cuisine of Denmark Aerial (dance move) Suplex Atkins Nutritional Approach Corset Anorexia nervosa Pruning fruit trees Abdomen Professional wrestling throws Contredanse Osteoarthritis Glossary of partner dance terms Milk Breastfeeding Body image Circle Secondary sex characteristic Solar system Tocopherol Puberty Bicycle brake systems Shen Gong Wu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Critic Mattress Arado Ar 80 Paragliding Strap-on dildo Diamond Sailing Trans fat Craps Wood carving Super Size Me Gastroesophageal reflux disease Dieting Ontological argument Hotei CPU design Aspartame Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Skirt and dress Canoe Abbey Omega-3 fatty acid Stomach Incarnations of Immortality New Zealand English Stomach cancer Sperm Whale Sumo Hair Recovery position Farthing (coin) Albatross Bodybuilding Tree Celtic Tiger Infantilism Charge (heraldry) Kitesurfing Pear Stonehenge Tank locomotive German cuisine Jet engine Pascal's triangle 613 mitzvot Inception of Darwin's theory French cuisine Protein Archie Moore Comanche Hourglass Brassiere Tire Garfield Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Normal distribution Microeconomics Foie gras Classical music era Bicycle frame Chocolate Social rule Charles Goodyear Manifold Porsche 911
