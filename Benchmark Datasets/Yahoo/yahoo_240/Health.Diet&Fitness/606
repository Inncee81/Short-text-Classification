how do you stay determined to loose weight i can't loose weight i have been trying to but i keep stopping losing weight is really tough it takes discipline and self motivation the crazy thing about losing weight is no one can make you do it but yourself the best way i have learned to lose weight is by setting realistic goals what you see on tv and read about in magazines with people losing lbs here and lbs there is mostly hype and very rare occurrences what you need to do is set an initial weight goal that you want to attain make it like pounds don't torture yourself just ease into it with a mixture of exercise and controlled eating you can really make dieting become second nature the key with sticking with a weight loss routine is to work hard and not forget to treat yourself if you have a sweet tooth figure out alternatives to eating bad things example replace ice cream with a low fat flavored yogurt if you have too put it in the freezer to get the same feel now you state that your problem is you can't stick to your weight lose routine and you stop that is because you are setting unrealistic goals and once you get to a point where you feel like you arent acheiving anything you give up or you slip right back into eating bad everyone has what is called will power some have more than others your will power is what drives you to do good and stay away from the bad and fight those urges my point behind all this is that you have to train your personal source of will power to be strong and stick with a workout program and healthy eating program this doesnt happen over night so its best to start with a small goal and once you achieve that continue to add to it be confident and you can do anything good luck Weight training Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting New York Giants Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mixed martial arts Anorexia nervosa Ice cream Fecal incontinence Bodybuilding Equine conformation Knife Tocopherol The Contender (television series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shit Poker jargon Urinary incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct Tai Chi Chuan Gliding Goodness and value theory Mitsubishi 3000GT Weight Watchers Car handling Anchor Strategic management Transactional analysis Stomach cancer Chocolate Humphrey Bogart Hamster Tofu Weight loss Super Size Me Adjustable gastric band Social rule Motorcycle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Prostate cancer Extreme Programming PlayStation 3 Cheese Mountaineering Folic acid Logic Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dairy Fancy rat Boxing training Objectivist philosophy Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cleveland Browns Battle of the Bulge South Beach diet American football Garfield Ice hockey Sento Unreal Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tlingit B-47 Stratojet Teen Girl Squad Diabetes mellitus Uzumaki Naruto Tea Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Coffee San Francisco 49ers Pitaten Hydrogen economy True Crime: Streets of LA Clinical depression Narcissism FC Rostov Alcoholic beverage Chess strategy and tactics Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Fable (video game) Yoghurt
