does it really matter if you don't eat well but exercise a lot i know a ton of people that are very physically active but eat crap all day and they seem fine i know what you mean but my experience says that they are just delaying the consequences a good example would be how sore your muscles get after a workout if you eat a bunch of sugar cookies ice cream etc your muscles will be more sore than if you eat healthy organic whole foods a bad diet will make you more prone to muscle aches clogged arteries and circulation problems here are some good ideas losing weight do something that gets your heart rate up a bit like walking running biking and swimming eat whole organic foods like broccoli cabbage organic brown rice spinach sweet potato apples and other fruits and vegetables in their natural state avoid eating corn white bread white rice candy sodas chips and anything else that you already know you shouldn t be eating drink clean water as your beverage of choice avoid fruit drinks and fruit juices unless you juice them yourself stop smoking drinking beer wine and drinking coffee get hours of sleep each night hang out with people who want to be healthy tone up the muscles join a gym and get a trainer if you re short on cash start a light stretching yoga regimen do push ups and light dumbbell curls for the upper body as i said above walk run swim and or bike take an aerobics class a yoga class or some other fitness class join the local ymca mental health get a friend to talk to each day about your feelings if you have some money or insurance get a counselor to talk to learn how to meditate join a support group for the issue you re dealing with ask your higher self or god for guidance start keeping a diary or journal about your feelings thoughts write a gratitude list every night Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Breakfast Atkins Nutritional Approach Exercise Word of Wisdom Food Soft drink Alcoholic beverage German cuisine Chocolate Dieting Jewish cuisine Wine Coffee Hamster Cuisine of Argentina Folic acid Vegetarianism Tea Urinary incontinence Healthy eating Bodybuilding Prostate cancer Insomnia Cuisine of the Southern United States Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cuisine of the Philippines Beer Meditation Coronary heart disease Japanese cuisine Bread Ice cream Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vitamin C Serbian cuisine Breastfeeding Clinical depression Equine conformation Swimming Vinegar Fancy rat First aid Potato Street food Cuisine of Singapore Nutrition Kosher foods Diabetes mellitus Sugar Drink Cocaine Sauerkraut Social rule Coeliac disease Swedish cuisine French cuisine Massage Cuisine of Malaysia Health insurance Carbon dioxide Cuisine of Greece Chronic fatigue syndrome Consciousness Tocopherol Rum Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sherbet Soup Ramen Apple South Beach diet Milk Anorexia nervosa Mouth ulcer Caffeine Snack food Stomach cancer Food preservation Bong Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Africa Binge eating disorder Rice pudding Soul food Dog Tea (meal) Domestic rabbit Tomato
