cardio etc after a lower back injury background i injured my back somehow in or around february by july i was diagnosed with a ruptured lumbar disk l l and a bulging lumbar disk l l in mid july i had epidural cortisone injections my pain level has gone way down and my ability to walk has gotten a lot better i can actually walk more than a block or two without needing to sit down i've started core strengthening using yoga pilates and stretching per a book called back rx but i'd like to do more i am desperate to regain my cardio stamina without re injuring my back any suggestions i concur with the writer who mentioned the elliptical and it will burn the most calories per minute consider taking a pilates class at a studio studio instructors are almost always highly trained including continuing ed courses on students with 'issues ' pilates conferences almost always have seminars on back issues so i feel you would benefit from such a class given that you tell the instructor about your injury she he will be able to adapt pilates exercises to you and still teach the others who don't have your issue there is also one on one pilates apparatus work but you would probably want to do some mat work first to see how it works for you Alexander Technique Pilates Back pain Lumbar puncture Equine conformation Weight training Exercise Carpal tunnel syndrome Massage Traumatic brain injury Local anesthesia Les Mills Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Childbirth Triage Aikido First aid Professor Reiki Denis Law Intracranial pressure Pontius Pilate Prostate cancer Milton H.
