why does systolic and diastolic bp not elevate when doing lower body aerobics aerobic literally means with oxygen in other words cells need oxygen in order to produce energy therefore your blood pressure needs to elevate to increase oxygen Cardiac cycle Exercise Heart Intracranial pressure Aerobic exercise Circulatory system Artery Blood vessel Hypertension Cellular respiration Atrial septal defect Heart sounds Aortic insufficiency Atherosclerosis Oxygen Glycolysis Physical examination Weight training Reptile Blood Sewage treatment Pulmonary alveolus Carbon dioxide Aortic valve stenosis Biochemistry Nutrition Decompression sickness Red blood cell Lung Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Ozone Senescence Fire fighting Bacteria Myocardial infarction Cyanide Hemoglobin Drowning Mitral regurgitation Skeletal muscle Brewery Swimming Hydrogen economy Stroke Acute respiratory distress syndrome Muscle Obstetrics Photosynthesis Cardiac output Aikido Ventricular fibrillation Explosive material Coronary circulation Torpedo Pneumonia Fermentation Diabetes mellitus Cardiology Sickle-cell disease Rebreather Hydrogen Energy development Fuel injection Autonomic nervous system Magnetic resonance imaging Apnea Citric acid cycle Water (molecule) Iron Platelet Nickel-cadmium battery Sphygmomanometer Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Chemical reaction Traumatic brain injury Soil life Cardiovascular disease COX-2 inhibitor Anemia Carbon monoxide poisoning Diabetic ketoacidosis Redox High altitude Cyanobacteria Coronary heart disease Oxygen toxicity Mitral stenosis Gasoline Respiratory system Folic acid Erythropoietin Helium Hyperventilation Hydrogen vehicle Flatulence Angina Tourniquet Immune system Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
