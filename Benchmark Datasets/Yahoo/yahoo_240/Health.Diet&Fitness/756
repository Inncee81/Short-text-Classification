weight watchers i'm ' and weigh somewhere from lbs i know i don't need weight watchers to loose weight but i think it would be easier to loose weight if i had some sort of plan i'm too young to join by myself so i need my mom to do it with me even though she says it would be a good idea she won't go through with it because she's cheap and she makes up excuses like all you have to do is eat right and exercise and she's right but i think i would have more motivation to loose weight if i did join weight watchers if you know anything about weight watchers or have joined before can you tell me about it if your gunna be mean please don't reply here's some things that may help if you are under the age of you will need a signed doctor's note saying you can join ww and it should state what your goal weight is you have to be at least to join but it sounds like you already know that you and your mom can attend one meeting for free with no obligation to pay anything or ever attend another meeting if you don't want to she and you can ask any questions you want while you are there are you sure mom's just cheap or maybe she really can't afford it i dont' know i'm just asking cause i don't live in your house if you really want to join what about you earning the money through babysitting mowing yards recycling aluminum cans whatever even if you can't earn all the money you will show your mom you are really serious about wanting this now as to ww i am a six year lifetime member and meetings leader the program was the easiest weight loss program i have ever done it not only helped me get the weight off but it taught me how to keep it off for the long haul and learning how to keep it off is as important as learning how to get it off Weight Watchers Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Tag Space Shuttle program Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Theory of conduct Anorexia nervosa Marshall Plan Garfield Literacy Cindy Sheehan David Hume Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Andr__ the Giant Weight training Public policy Alcoholics Anonymous Recycling Pound United States Postal Service Hydrogen economy Capitalism Calvin and Hobbes The dozens Warren Buffett Article One of the United States Constitution Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Education in the United States Contract Mnemonic Mixed martial arts Obesity Esperanto as an international language Donald Rumsfeld Live 8 1919 World Series Theodicy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Goodness and value theory U.S. Electoral College Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Aluminium Military history of the Roman Empire Rick Santorum Great Teacher Onizuka Scientology beliefs and practices Anarchism and capitalism Adjustable gastric band Boy Scouts of America Plenary Councils of Baltimore The Tracey Ullman Show shorts No Child Left Behind Act Rush Limbaugh Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Corporation Money Futurama (TV series - season 2) Logopolis The Adventures of Pete & Pete Humphrey Bogart Pioneer Zephyr Sharon Tate Graduate school Therion (band) Divine grace George Costanza Methos Weight Satchel Paige Sersi Fecal incontinence Economy of Russia British House of Commons Roe v.
