whats the proper way to jog or is there one i finally after mths of trying have learned to jog for a hour without stopping but i read somewhere where your suppose to jog then sprint then walk or some like that is that true you might be talking about hiit high intensity interval training instead of just jogging you hit high points of sprinting the idea behind it is you get your heartrate waaaaay up there and it will stay there for a while then you jog some more and again you raise your heartrate i've done if for a while and it is a killer but it does help eliminate a lot of time you can drop your time down to minutes or so and get an even better calorie loss over regular jogging because long after you stop your heartrate will still be racing from you hitting the sprint you can get more info and even some workouts to follow here Running Equine conformation Triathlon Aerobic exercise The Amazing Race Weight training Sprint (race) Hurdling Iditarod Scrabble (game show) 2002 Tour de France Boxing training Social rule Bicycling terminology Cycling sprinter Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Paris-Brest-Paris Stage (bicycle race) Horse gait CityRail Tour de France Indianapolis 500 Sprint Nextel Corporation Horse The Contender (television series) Teen Girl Squad Final Fantasy XI United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Talking Heads United States at the 1900 Summer Olympics Munich massacre Paintball Little Britain WQHT (FM) Biathlon Parade (military) Orienteering Avenue Q Inline speed skating 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Adventure racing Day of Defeat Haile Gebrselassie Exercise Quake III Arena Super Mario 64 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) American football Dirt track racing Special Air Service RuneScape Orders of magnitude (energy) Milton H.
