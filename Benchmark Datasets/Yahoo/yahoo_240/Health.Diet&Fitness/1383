dieting metheods please i am a little heavy and i just cant lose the wait but i dont like salads or vegetibles except corn an potatoes help i lost a lot because i started taking dancing classes which i love at the same time my doctor thought i might have pcos and be diabetic i also was scheduled for gallbladder surgery i had to watch fat otherwise i would get pain and i had to watch sugar otherwise i'd feel awful and headachey and i didn't want to turn into a full blown diabetic requiring needles turns out wasn't diabetic but i noticed my mood improved with avoiding simple sugars anyway makes sense i could summarize my success with consciously eat small meals big point every time you are about to eat something ask yourself if you actually feel hungry and need food if the answer is yes then have a small meal or snack if not don't i didn't deny much just reduced my simple sugars i had to stop buying chips because bag disappears quickly keep relatively healthy granola bars with you or make your own so you can snack if you get hungry when it's inconvenient to eat if you do order out order a burger without sauce and no fries diet drink or order a kid's meal i did this on occasion when i was in weight watchers and it still fit into the plan after supper try not to eat anything if your stomach is growling before bed have a small snack wait minutes then go to bed if your stomach feels funny but isn't growling just go to bed eat something for breakfast even if it means a small serving of oatmeal a banana or a glass of milk i discovered i like spinach a lot better than lettuce i like fresh baby peeled carrots i still didn't eat as much vegetables as i should so i used a multivitamin if you splurge on something like junk food count it as something towards your meal i e eat less at your next meal because of it treats aren't extras you can have on top of your meals treat them as any other calorie if exercise isn't your thing find something that doesn't feel like exercise that's a reason dancing works well for me i take the bus a lot so i will also check the bus schedule on my cell phone see how much time i have i start walking down the route until my bus comes i go swimming when it's hot outside or when i have a sore back i like swimming because i don't get overheated when i do it try to do the best you can to find more vegetables and fruit you like and eat them but simply reducing calories goes a long way too take a multivitamin and watch your iron levels Veganism Breakfast Obesity Dieting Vegetarianism Insulin Snack food Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Hypoglycemia German cuisine Food Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Hamburger Healthy eating McDonald's Japanese cuisine Breastfeeding In-N-Out Burger Little Britain Milk Meal Peruvian cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tofu Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jewish cuisine Prostate cancer Ramen Garfield Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian cuisine Low-carbohydrate diet Cuisine of Malaysia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dim sum French fries French cuisine Diabetes mellitus Potato chips Fish and chips Dietary fiber Coffee Gastroparesis Cat Sandwich Banana EastEnders Tea Bread Fancy rat Adjustable gastric band First aid Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Brazil Nutrition Cuisine of Singapore Rice pudding Super Size Me Binge eating disorder Tooth Bodybuilding Homer Simpson Bengali cuisine Egg (food) Korean cuisine Tomato Coeliac disease Breakfast cereal Weight training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Polycystic ovary syndrome Chocolate Street food Fast food Cuisine of Africa Urinary incontinence Domesticated turkey Tea (meal) Cuisine of Laos Burger King Exercise Comanche Theory of conduct Mattress Soul food Pizza Delicatessen
