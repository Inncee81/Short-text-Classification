really help you jess i'm years old about feet and inches and i weigh pounds and school is starting soon and i cant start highschool looking like this help me best answer chosen by asker i understand what you are going threw however lets be realistic you want to loose a lot and if you try to starve yourself you will end up in the hospital now if you really want a healthy way in getting your self in shape and have a life long change try what i have done first i know it is hard to do by yourself so call up some friends a family member or just your mom it always helps to have support and do not try and loose the same as the other person everyone is different and looses at a different rate second look at what you eat and what you do everyday some people just need to cut out junk food snack foods sodas and candies also check out what you do physically all day you might just need to do a little bit more to start loosing third make a choice do you want to loose and keep it off well really think about what you want and how it needs to be done i know there will be days were you will not see loss or days when you don't feel up to it that is where you need to shine keep it in your mind that you want to stay a certain shape again i know you can do it but it is going to be something you choose forth cut out all the stuff you know you don't need like that second scoop of ice cream and the extra handful of chips when you are thirsty don't reach for that soda or punch get a glass of water as well as right before you eat dinner drink a really tall glass of water do not skip any meals studies have shown that when you do you body think it is starving and turns anything you eat straight into fat so eat full meals a day a heavy breakfast a medium size lunch and a nice dinner with a good size veggie dish then if you can take a long walk about one hour to an hour and a half a day that will work out all the fat in the belly butt and legs well this goes with the exercise part which is next fifth do what works for you something that will get your heart pumping really good for a good strong hour jump rope climb stairs run play some sports something that will make you sweat and if you are able to swim for that same time but just swimming no diving its a whole body work out do that at either in the beginning of the day or middle of the day four days out of the week minimum but keep that hour walk at night every night of the week some people like to work out with weights but unless you want big muscle arms just follow my instructions you will get lean and toned you will not only loose the weight and feel better but you will start sleeping better as well do not sell yourself short you are worth the work and it is work but it will be worth it when you start looking the way you want to just do me a favor if you see someone who wants to loose weight encourage them share how you did it and don't make fun of them when they are trying my friends did that to me and look better than they ever will be kind and real and people will see you for you not your body never loose weight and get healthy for anyone other than yourself i will be praying for you god bless Dieting
