eating habits i've been going swimming alot recently and i was wondering what should i eat after swimming cause i dont want to eat the calories i just burned also i swim for about hours rest in between also i want to tone legs and arms and extremely loose some belly fat so any help is appericiated d you should drink lots of water because believe it or not swimming in a chlorinated pool makes you dehydrated afterwards you should eat some protein to keep your energy levels up like chicken or fish or peanut butter on toast the legs and arms will take care of themselves if you swim as long as you stretch properly you can tone up your belly by doing sit ups and crunches i know i hate them too or by doing something called the plank where you lie on your stomach and lift yourself up on your forearms and toes and hold it keeping your abs tight you can also look online for good abs exercises one thing that i recommend is to get an exercise ball to do ab work and arm and leg work too hope this helps and email me with any other questions Weight training Swimming Diving Aerial (dance move) Dieting Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling holds Veganism Peanut Drowning Backstroke Butterfly stroke Suplex Bodybuilding Atkins Nutritional Approach Fancy rat Professional wrestling throws Sauna Equine conformation Obesity Cuisine of Denmark Breastfeeding Triathlon Low-carbohydrate diet Calorie Happy Tree Friends Hamster Infantilism Breaststroke Insulin Peanut butter Anorexia nervosa Omega-3 fatty acid Chicken Breakfast Nutrition Milk Escherichia coli O157:H7 Textile manufacturing History of swimming Food Water polo Water Poker jargon Brewery Marathon (sport) Tetrapod Body piercing Hydrochloric acid Mojave people Fast bowling Piccolo Junior Saga Livestock Cuisine of Brazil Stomach cancer Orca Iliotibial band syndrome Violin Dog Kosher foods Cuisine of Laos Horizontal bar Paget's disease of bone Healthy eating Japanese tea ceremony Ramen Jewish cuisine Domestic rabbit Diving suit Glossary of ballet terms Fasting Goofy Garfield Dog training Bread Make money fast Schlock Mercenary Tofu Plastic Chlorine Joke Sewage treatment Professional wrestling aerial techniques Social rule Internal ballistics Porridge Chocolate Shark Anatomical terms of location Allergy Little Britain Sea-Monkey Singlish Piledriver (professional wrestling)
