questions about shaving my legs ok so in about the beginning of june i started using this carefree leg hair remover stuff because i wanted stuff that would last longer than shaving the first time i used it my legs got very itchy but the stuff did its job and my legs were so smooth once that was gone i had to buy nair pretty because they don't sell refills only the full package of the carefree which is too expensive to just keep buying eventually i switched back to shaving because it's more afforable and easier but now everytime i shave my legs get super super itchy and i do use lotion a lot so my skin doesn't get dry i put some anti itch creme on it and try not to scratch but it's hard help also why does it take forever for a shaving cut to stop bleeding idk why yahoo put this in this category but it was supposed to go in beauty style skin or something sorry not my fault maybe you're allergic to the shaving cream soap whatever you use i generally shave using a little bit of conditioner it's easier cheaper and it makes my legs feel really good afterwards also continue with the lotion and try drinking more water because if you're dehydrated your skin will dry out to stop cuts from bleeding you can get a styptic pencil which you wet and then dab on the cut it stings a lot for a couple of seconds but it stops the bleeding Shaving Eczema Pubic hair Fecal incontinence Allergy Textile manufacturing Soap Tarantula Razor Diving suit Manicure Itch Leather Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Floppy disk Wound Stomach cancer The Star Wars Holiday Special Mosquito Tattoo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bleeding Hair Waxing Depilation Scabies Social rule Kodocha The Amazing Race Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Coffee Equine conformation Hard water Dehydration Piccolo Junior Saga Urticaria Cruising (maritime) Tofu Theory of conduct Double Dare Ice cream Cosmetics Leg shaving The Ashlee Simpson Show Callus Toilet paper Global Gillette Beard Moisturizer Janet Jackson Violin Baldness Survival skills Pseudofolliculitis barbae System/36 Characters in the Smurfs Embalming Skinhead Massage First aid Mattress The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Upholstery Ron and Fez 613 mitzvot Friends About a Boy Aluminium Wig (hair) Happy Tree Friends Professional wrestling holds Swingout Phonograph cylinder Skateboarding trick Tea Manual transmission Dialysis Sento Tanning Inkjet printer Fancy rat Illegal drug trade Professional wrestling slang Dairy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sampling (music) Fast bowling Dry cleaning Oreo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hiberno-English UK Singles Chart Spider Anderson Cooper Super Mario Bros.
