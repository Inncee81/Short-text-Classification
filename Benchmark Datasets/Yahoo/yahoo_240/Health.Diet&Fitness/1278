im sticking to a low calorie diet but will the calories from fruit screw this up for example sometimes i eat up to calories a day just in fruit i eat well balanced meals whole grains proteins etc but im worried about the calories from fruit will those affect my weight loss umm an apple doesnt have calories its up in the and mangos have over as well this i why im curious if you eat more calories a day then you burn you will gain weight regardless of what kind of calories they are i don't believe fruit can affect you too bad because it take a lot more calories to digest fruit than many fruits have in them i would say just make sure your calorie intake leaves you at a level that you can still lose weight take in about calories a day Dieting Low-carbohydrate diet Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Calorie restriction Super Size Me Nutrition Milk Bodybuilding Healthy eating Veganism Calorie Anorexia nervosa Hamster Fasting Vegetarianism Carburetor South Beach diet Adjustable gastric band Protein Mango Life extension Zone diet Fecal incontinence Food guide pyramid Raw food diet Omega-3 fatty acid Tooth Food Frugivore Insulin Hypoglycemia Binge eating disorder Alcoholic beverage Olive oil Fruitarianism Weight loss Protein-energy malnutrition Sugar substitute Egg (food) Macular degeneration Breastfeeding Junk food Sleep Guinea pig Explosive material Breakfast Cassava Glycogen storage disease type I Fancy rat Weight training Tofu Crohn's disease Little Britain Slim Fast Tocopherol Food preservation 613 mitzvot Aspartame MRE Body type (exercise) Robert Falcon Scott Diarrhea Weight Watchers The Coca-Cola Company Pig (zodiac) MyPyramid Chicken Orders of magnitude (energy) Hamburger Vitamin C Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Gastric bypass surgery Coeliac disease McDonald's Banana Pomegranate Paleolithic diet Cereal Brewery Domestic rabbit Peanut Glucokinase Tomato Prostate cancer Apple Korean cuisine Stomach cancer Colorectal cancer Jewish cuisine Chewing gum Food storage Diabetes mellitus Brown rice Raisin
