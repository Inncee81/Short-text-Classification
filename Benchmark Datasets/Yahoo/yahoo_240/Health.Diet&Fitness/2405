is it possible to drop a stone in a month would it damage my health lbs is this too much to lose if not how would i go about it i don't want to absolutely starve myself i like my food are there any healthy foods out there which taste nice i'd appreciate your suggestions thanks the problem with rapid weight loss is that its short term its only achieveable by really restricting yourself from essential nutrients etc as soon as you start eating normally again your body will store all the things you eat as it'll have started in some sort of starvation mode you'll be back to square one im sure you know the best way to lose weight is exercise and careful diet i lost stone but i did it over nearly years its never come back because i did it slowly as for nice tasting healthy foods wholemeal granary breads are tastey vegetables if you cook them right try green beans or cauliflower low fat meat like chicken fish is good for you i ate a lot of things like nuts and seeds as snacks one thing though plenty of water will do you no end of good and its really true that once you adapt your tastes away from sugary things you wont crave them anymore and probably wont care for the taste Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Veganism Healthy eating Organic food Hamburger Food Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Guinea pig German cuisine Anorexia nervosa Egg (food) Folic acid Fancy rat Raw food diet Bread Tocopherol Nutrition French cuisine Tofu Hamster Insulin Jewish cuisine Low-carbohydrate diet Soul food Chocolate Curry Ramen Hypoglycemia Vegetarian nutrition Cuisine of Brazil Breakfast Snack food Weight loss South Beach diet Adjustable gastric band Dietary fiber Cuisine of the Philippines Fast food Marmite Chili con carne Nutrient Bengali cuisine Dog Coeliac disease Binge eating disorder Diabetes mellitus MRE French fries Prostate cancer Cuisine of the Southern United States Acorn Domesticated turkey Food preservation Russian cuisine Roman eating and drinking Cheese Chicken Coronary heart disease Cuisine of Singapore Antioxidant Pizza Breastfeeding British cuisine Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Finland Peruvian cuisine Fasting Chinese cuisine Agriculture Sugar substitute Tooth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Korean cuisine Cuisine of Laos Trans fat Stomach cancer Miso Cauliflower Cooking oil Barbecue Kebab Taiwanese cuisine Soybean Vegetarian cuisine
