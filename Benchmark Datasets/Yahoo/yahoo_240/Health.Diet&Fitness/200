good workout if i did one armed push ups handstand push ups chin ups and pull ups dips with benches and parallel bars would that help me get alot stronger it is fine if you have no access to weights or are under you will get better results with weights if they are an option at minimum i would supplement it with some cardio and stairs here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help arms lying dumbbell triceps extensions standing barbell curl behind head reverse hammers one arm preacher curl close grip pushdowns incline dumbbell curl parallel bar dips hammer curl single arm reverse grip pushdowns reverse grip ez bar rope push downs super light dumbbell curls chest dumbbell incline presses pullovers and presses dumbbell bench presses narrow grip bench presses incline dumbbell flyes barbell incline presses push ups between benches cable standing incline flyes cable standing decline flyes back barbell row dumbbell row lat pull downs cable row lower back machine forearms lite wide lat pulldowns supermans shoulders lateral raises bent over lateral raises no rest front raises shrugs military presses front raises rotator cuffs superlight lateral raises on incline bench with lbs dumbbells st facing forward bring dumbbells up from sides to parallel to ground palms inward slow repeat for ten reps nd facing bench bring dumbbells up from sides backwards as far as you can palms inward slow repeat for ten reps rd stand up with dumbbells and do lateral raises th back in position raise arms so they are forward palms inward arms bent in a semi bear hug position and parallel to ground bring to sides and back to center for reps i usually do lbs here because this exercise is hard do this set three times with out rest the third set i change to all lb movements all of this is slow pace like second up and one second down legs squats leg extentions leg curls adductors abductors calf lifts glute machine leg lifts i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles Suplex Skateboarding trick Humerus Boxing Bench press Professional wrestling aerial techniques Volleyball Fast bowling Anchor Powerlifting Glossary of climbing terms Swingout Arm Squat (exercise) Bicycle Butterfly stroke Clean and jerk Front crawl Internal ballistics Dumbbell Diving Carpal tunnel syndrome Scapula Powerbomb Ulna Deadlift Exercise DDT (professional wrestling) M16 (rifle) Horizontal bar Elbow-joint Glossary of ballet terms Muscle Figure skating Tetrapod Salute Pole vault Mixed martial arts Insulin Sailing Lindy Basic Glossary of American football Weightlifting Casualty lifting Mouse (computing) Backbreaker Sport rowing Massage Hip (anatomy) Terminal ballistics Eye Heckler & Koch G3 Recumbent bicycle Drill bit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Marathon (sport) Dieting Urinary incontinence Horse Puberty Hypoglycemia Childbirth Action potential Abdomen Aikido Combine (Half-Life 2) Iliotibial band syndrome Rail terminology Dodge Charger Archery Spanking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Temporal bone Obedience training Leaf Car handling The Time Machine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Neckbreaker Wood carving Strap-on dildo Piledriver (professional wrestling) Shaggy dog story Scar Contredanse Fencing
