i need to gain weight because it is not healthy to not have a period but i am so afraid of gaining weight i cringe everytime i am at the gym and see i have gained a pound even though i know it is just from all the food i ate during the day i usually exercise at night how should i go about dealing with this gaining weight eating disorders it sounds as though you are interested in recovering from your eating disorder but aren't receiving the guidance and help that would benefit you does your physician know that you have an eating disorder what about your family if you are dealing with recovery on your own it would greatly benefit you to seek out support from experienced professionals that your family or others might help you find other resources are listed at the end of this answer gaining weight without resolving the underlying issues is not a cure weight gain can help alleviate some of the medical complications that are caused by malnutrition and being severely underweight however one of the difficult parts about weight gain during eating disorder treatment is that as a person increases his or her food intake his or her metabolism increases requiring even more calories this is further complicated by the fact that eating disordered persons need more calories to gain weight than non eating disordered underweight individuals this could be due to the fact that a person's metabolic rate is depressed in anorexia and so is the thermic effect of food the amount of calories being burned during the digestive process as anorexic persons get well and eat more both their metabolism and thermic effect of food increase raising their caloric needs levels of growth hormone leptin and other hormones are also lower in eating disordered people and become more normalized during recovery which may also contribute to changes in calorie needs the same disproportionate rise in metabolic rate to body weight is not seen in non eating disordered individuals in order to gain weight you need to follow a schedule of steadily increasing your calorie intake until you reach a level that is appropriate for you weight gain termed re feeding is a process that often requires help and guidance your calorie needs for weight gain need to be assessed by a registered dietitian specializing in eating disorders s he can help you gain weight at an appropriate rate for you many factors are considered when developing re feeding plans some of these include your current medical status body frame weight history current food intake and eating patterns just to name a few in addition on going nutrition counseling can help you to understand and cope with the changes that happen to your body as you succeed in gaining weight it is well documented that the most effective treatment for eating disorders is to work with a multidisciplinary team consisting of a medical provider psychologist and nutritionist gaining weight is not the only answer dealing with the problems that are
