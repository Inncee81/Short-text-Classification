is it safe for me hello i'm years old and was wondering if it would be safe for me to start taking creatine monohydrate on a regular basis i have been reading a lot about and it seems to be safe i was planning on doing just g during the five day loading period and then just sticking with a g a day after that right now i am taking l carnitine to try to cut weight and i think partnered with the creatine would be great oh and i wouldn't be taking anything that had anything other than the creatine monhydrate thanks then uh what would be a good supplement to take and any thoughts 'bout the l carnitine creatine's great for strength and mass not as much for weight loss Creatine Weight training Bodybuilding The Contender (television series) Carnitine M16 (rifle) SoBe Mountaineering Anorexia nervosa Space elevator Muscle Explosive material Sumo Gliding Extreme Programming Anchor The Apprentice 2 Knife About a Boy Archie Moore Nutrition The Midnight Sun Vitamin C Jet engine Tocopherol STS-114 Coupling (railway) Mixed martial arts Saturn V Breastfeeding Protein Characters of Naruto Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Motorcycle Lipoic acid Battle of Kursk Avalanche Machine gun Ayurveda B-47 Stratojet 2005 United States Grand Prix Heinkel He 112 The Star Wars Holiday Special Douglas Adams Heinkel He 100 Car handling Johnny 5 Citric acid Paragliding Piccolo Junior Saga Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dieting Blood on the Tracks Energy drink Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Battle of Crete Charmed Hyperthyroidism Daredevil Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Battle of Berlin Hard disk Equine conformation Skinny Dip F-15 Eagle Battle of France The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Consumer price index Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Mario 64 Not Fade Away (Angel episode) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster United States Postal Service Newborn screening Space Shuttle program Civilization III Folic acid Adjustable gastric band Boxing training History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Bondage (BDSM) Casting Tom Richardson Helicopter Carmen Basilio E85 Diamond cut 2000 Australian Grand Prix Weight Reaction to the assassination of John F.
