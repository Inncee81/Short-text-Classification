how can i lose pounds in and a half weeks i am a gymnast and i need to lose pounds in order to get mor stamina for my routines i am currently ' and please do not say i don't need to lose weight pounds is all i want to lose and it will make a huge difference i try to eat healthy for the most part today i kinda went off my diet but i did good yesterday and the day before i work out on my stationary bike for minutes like days a week and i have my gymnastics practices but i have hit a plateu and need to drop these last pounds thanks i'd imagine that since you are a gymnast you are already in pretty good shape so i'd imaginge that you can only really hope to lose water weight or weight stored up from intestinal colonic deposits if you can stomach a decent diet plan for the and weeks paired with the following info you should have a good chance at achieving your goal that being said i'll start with the latter since it's the easiest go to a spa you trust and get a colonic plain and simple most people on average have pounds of stored waste trapped in their lower intestine over time this can add up one man had pounds of stored waste over his years ranging from crayons he ate as a child to a penny and pieces of barely digested food do not try this yourself with laxitives or extreme colon cleansers from the store this will only dehydrate you and possibly land you in the hospital the taboo about colonics is highly overrated the procedure doesn't hurt like most say it does it can get a little uncomfortable at times if you've air gas deposits that will impede the flow of water but those are massaged away and the water moves on easy day this will most likely be the easier of the two choices for losing weight quick now for the fun one the one that requires some work i would recommend starting each day with a cup or two of black coffee don't over do it and drink an entire pot as this will only dehydrate you and work against you in the long run for this plan make sure the coffee is black if you add any creamers or sugars it will only work against you in this water weight caloric battle after you've finished your cup s of joe follow up with a minute moderately intense cardio routine elliptical treadmill stair climber track bike etc you get the picture this will get your system kickstarted to be burning calories all day long it's been proven that min of cardio in the morning will allow your body to burn almost twice the calories in a day vice not doing cardio in the morning on top of this routine i would recommend getting one of those trash bag esque sweat suits to aid in caloric burn and water loss be careful though these suits will increase your bodies internal temperature thus causing your sweat much more wear thick socks so be sure to hydrate adequately i personally recommend a water gatorade mix the water will obviously hydrate and quench thirst and the gatorade will replace much needed electrolytes gatorade alone will dehydrate more than help i'd recommend the lime gatorade rain it's light and flavorful will add just a hint of flavor to your bottle of water and only has something like calories for a whole bottle this teamed up with smaller meals times a day vice regular meals a day will keep your metabolism going strong and burning calories all day long if you use an appetite suppressent hydroxycut ripped fuel etc this will also aid in cravings don't eat after p m and allow up to hours before bed for food to digest so that you're not just packing on more calories and fat stay away from fast food for the and weeks and focus on salads and protiens tuna is an excellent choice skimp on salad dressings and toppings also most sodas and juices are packed with empty calories and sugars if diet is your thing diet coke etc are a good alternative with only calorie it is almost like an inert substance add another cardio routine mid day to early evening time frame for minutes without the sweat suit and with the gatorade water mix and you should be ok by weeks end best of luck i hope this helps Milk Anorexia nervosa Dialysis Dehydration Water Dietary fiber Tea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Marathon (sport) Weight training
