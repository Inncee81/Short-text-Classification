how to deal with junk food withdrawl i'm trying to eat a cleaner diet meaning less process foods and zero fatty meats and more whole foods and fish i feel that my body craves fatty foods and sugar highs what's a good way of dealing with the side effects of the transition i feel my energy is up but i often feel bored or that i'm missing out since i'm not eating fatty meats and cheeses and sweets anymore then when i'm eating unhealthy i get depressed it's like i can't win against myself i often thinking about junk and miss it even though i feel better it's weird the best way to deal with this kind of situation is to not completely eliminate your likings for unhealthy foods always when you try to withdraw from food that is not right for you you tend to crave it even more and you give up and go back to your old habits my recommendation is to plan your week in a way you can manage so try to pick at least days out of the week where you get to enjoy whatever food you like but of course remember it is the portion that you have to watch so the remaining days you need to be religious with your healthy eating pattern this way you will not miss your favorite unhealthy foods and at the same time you will also discipline yourself with the healthy choices you make hope this helps Atkins Nutritional Approach Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Dieting Food guide pyramid Oily fish Hamster Food Vegetarianism South Beach diet Hamburger Breakfast Fasting Fecal incontinence Tofu Stomach cancer Super Size Me Hypoglycemia Obesity Cheese Egg (food) Low-carbohydrate diet Milk Breastfeeding Junk food Trans fat Kashrut Jewish cuisine Addiction Raw food diet Soul food Vegetarianism and religion D__ner kebab Chinese food therapy Bengali cuisine Cat Poker jargon Fish and chips Colorectal cancer Clinical depression Margarine Prostate cancer Vegetarian nutrition Bodybuilding Adjustable gastric band Cuisine of Denmark Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Vitamin Domestic rabbit Cuisine of the Philippines Insulin Buddhism Bipolar disorder Street food Sugar substitute Atherosclerosis Bread Eating Glycerin German cuisine Chocolate Coronary heart disease Vegetarian cuisine Natural Hygiene Fancy rat Drug addiction Alcoholism Anorexia nervosa Hypercholesterolemia Cuisine of the Southern United States Bacon Japanese cuisine Tobacco smoking Sushi New York Jets Pork rind Barbecue Vitamin C Nutrient Biotin Diabetes mellitus Hedgehog Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hot dog Cuisine of Africa Carnivore Alcoholic beverage Saturated fat Cuisine of Turkey
