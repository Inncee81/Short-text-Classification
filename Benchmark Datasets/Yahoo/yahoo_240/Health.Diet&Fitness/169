i have a sore knee i hit it somewhere about a week ago workout question and i have been working out anyway it doesnt seem to be getting any better should i let it rest a few days or could i just do some cardio a few days what do you think i would definitely let it rest you may have pulled a ligament or something and working out may aggravate it i did this to my knee and i went to my doctor because i wasn't getting better he gave me prescription anti inflammatory meds and told me don't do any exercises involving my knee for days i absolutely followed his instructions and sure enough weeks later it just started feeling better however i still have a nagging twinge of discomfort every once in a while if i'm not careful Weight training Osteoarthritis Equine conformation The Ashlee Simpson Show Fecal incontinence Bodybuilding Psoriasis Migraine Rush Limbaugh Urinary incontinence Chondromalacia patellae Andr__s Galarraga Chronic fatigue syndrome Ravi Shastri Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Ben Johnson (athlete) Anterior cruciate ligament COX-2 inhibitor Denis Law Medical prescription Scenes from a Memory Social rule Exercise I Want to Hold Your Hand Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Osteopathy Pain Moe Berg Sandy Koufax Knee Brian Clough Professional wrestling attacks Milton H.
