how come pro fat is ok but not pro ana both are considered unhealthy but in magazine artilces its seen as ok and i heard its possible to be overweight and healthy but how come its not ok for both but one like here is a whole list of them and none were deleted http www uppitywomen net fatlinks html shouldn't it be deleted also because its an unhealthy lifestyle that can also kill to poster ok but being overweight has been proven un healthy also but obese people are saying there healthy too as long as they can walk poster very true and even in air planes it takes extra energy for the planes am not against anyone but i think it should be fair on both sides but you did made some good points that are true the more and more i think about your question the more i agree with you i think that society is so wrapped up in saying anorexia and bullimia are bad bad bad and that people kind of treat those who live their lives that way as being really unhealthy and are just generally discriminated against more and looked down upon more than overweight people like you always hear about people wanting to shut down pro ana and mia sites because people trade tips on them or whatever on how to different things like purge maybe people don't see a problem with pro fat websites because they don't trade tips on how to be even fatter or whatever but it's a good point i guess people feel sorry for overweight people cause it's like embrace your curves and stuff but people don't feel sorry for too skinny people it's definitly a double standard being fat can be just as dangerous as being too skinny you've brought up a really good question Anorexia nervosa Obesity Theory of conduct Pro-ana Binge eating disorder Super Size Me Little Britain Goodness and value theory Utilitarianism Hamster Atkins Nutritional Approach Body mass index Health insurance Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sharon Tate Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Cultural Revolution Sin City Quotation mark Milk Exercise Epistemology The Apprentice 2 Philosophical skepticism Objectivist philosophy Ethics Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit The Ashlee Simpson Show Evil Ajax (programming) Skinny Puppy Healthy eating David Hume Jennifer Lopez Year of the Spider Force (Star Wars) World Wide Web Discordianism Weight loss Cancer Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory CPU cache Prostate cancer Fast food Tennis Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Time Out of Mind 1957 World Series Escape from New York Equine conformation Indian English Babe Ruth Tariff Infantilism Physical attractiveness GunBound Nicomachean Ethics Dieting Trans fat Altruism Dragon Booster The McGuire Sisters Vegetarianism Spider Out-of-body experience Paul W.
