how can i drop dress sizes in weeks ways to lose weight take it one step at a time start by paying attention to what you eat cut back on fat and sweets and add more fruit and vegetables after you have that under control add exercise if you hate to exercise try it for only minutes a day at first then a hour keep in mind that while you are exercising you are burning calories and not eating also it will be easier if you chose an activity that you enjoy find a friend it is always good to have support when you are trying to lose weight find a friend who wants to lose weight and compare notes weigh in together and maybe even have a contest use weights working out weights will build muscle and raise your metabolism so you will burn more calories also muscle takes up less space than fat so you will be smaller but probably weigh more eat fewer carbs don't eat as much bread and pasta and you will see a difference set a goal set a deadline to lose the weight and write it down for example ' by dec i will weigh lbs or less' put it somewhere you will see it daily give up soda if you drink a soda or a day you are adding empty calories if you find it hard to stop completely cut back at first and drink water instead grill or boil avoid fried meat grill and use lots of spices you will get used to it and probably enjoy it more don't buy junk food when you go shopping don't go on an empty stomach and you will be less likely to buy junk food keep your home 'junk food free' so you won't be tempted to indulge eat breakfast consume most of your calories early in the day and always eat breakfast don't eat after pm and not only will you avoid those added calories but you will sleep better give yourself a treat when you tell yourself that you can't have something you want it more give yourself a treat once a day ie half a cookie and you won't feel you are missing out use smaller plates trick yourself into believing that you are eating more by using a smaller plate drink lots of water drink water when you are feeling hungry and you will get that 'full' feeling don't eat everything on your plate many times we eat just because it's there pay attention to when you have had enough eat five or six meals a day eating more frequently will keep you from getting too hungry plan your workout sessions write your workout sessions in your journal or planner stay away from fad diets fad diets don't work if you lose weight fast chances are that you will gain it back and more just as fast it takes time to put it on and time to take it off do several workouts a day while you are watching tv do crunches and leg lifts measure your food if you decide to have junk food for a snack be sure to measure and control what you eat keep pre cut vegetables and ward off those cravings create good habits it is a known fact that when we do something twenty one times it becomes a habit create good eating habits Breakfast Food Fecal incontinence Super Size Me Hamburger Cuisine of the Philippines Bodybuilding Low-carbohydrate diet Jewish cuisine Anorexia nervosa Cuisine of Denmark Obesity Tofu Binge eating disorder Japanese cuisine Healthy eating Fasting Hamster Adjustable gastric band Breastfeeding Tooth Cuisine of the Southern United States In-N-Out Burger Bread Egg (food) Alcoholic beverage Kosher foods Bacon Veganism McDonald's MRE Cuisine of Malaysia Hypoglycemia The Amazing Race Chocolate Cuisine of Argentina Coffee Equine conformation Chinese cuisine Ramen Folic acid Hot dog 613 mitzvot South Beach diet Tocopherol Cuisine of Brazil Omega-3 fatty acid Korean cuisine French cuisine Roman eating and drinking Urinary incontinence Tea (meal) Prostate cancer Cheese Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Vegetarianism Cha chaan teng Snack food Soft drink Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Domesticated turkey Peruvian cuisine British cuisine Tea Poker jargon Pizza Junk food Coconut crab Bengali cuisine Fugu The Contender (television series) Garfield Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Chicken Fast food Barbecue Burger King Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Africa Cajun cuisine Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Raw food diet Guinea pig FoxTrot Watermelon Insulin Fancy rat Pancake
