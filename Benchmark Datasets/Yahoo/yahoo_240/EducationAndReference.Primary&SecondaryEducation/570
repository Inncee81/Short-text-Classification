i have just enrolled my son with a holiday scheme teaching them maths and english days a week he is refusing point blank to go he is almost whats the best way of bringing him round he is adamant at the moment its only hours a day and of his friends are going i think he is scared but wont admit it i do kind of agree with the other posters that it is his holiday he is only a child and shouldn't have to worry about studying yet but i also understand that as his parent you want the best for him and for all we know you have had to put up with him being miserable at school all year or longer because at the moment he can't cope with the work in this case obviously you want to help him improve his skills so that he will be happier and more confident does he know exactly what the sceme involves i'm sure if it's a holiday scheme it will try to teach the kids in a fun way do they have leaflets or a website that you could show him as he may think that it will involve sitting down taking tests for hours each day of the scheme what will he be doing if he doesn't go try to make this option seem much worse than the scheme i e you want to clean out all the cupboards in the house so if he doesn't go he can be a big help to you if he thinks that he won't have fun even if he doesn't go he may be more willing to give it a go have a heart to heart with him choose a quiet time when you're both calm maybe when he's just got into bed and explain that you want to know why he doesn't want to go to the scheme if you stay calm and don't get cross with him he may be able to do the same and might open up with any worries which you can address be honest with him if he isn't doing so well at school he is likely to realise this at his age and you can talk to him about how much more confident he will feel starting a new school year a step ahead of his peers maybe arrange with the parents of the other kids a treat for the end of the scheme something that is just for those friends for going along and having a go ensure he knows that this treat is going to happen whether or not he goes to the scheme and it's up to him whether he wants to be able to have the treat along with his friends something like a trip to a theme park that you don't do often so he would know he would be really missing out if he didn't go i know when i started a new school year i always loved buying new stationery maybe go to a shop that sells nice stuff and explain that you are willing to buy him some supplies for the scheme even if he doesn't actually need any equipment he might be swayed by some of the funky pencil cases and notepads etc you can get these days obviously this is an extra expense but even cheap shops often have quite good ranges and if it gets him there it would be worth it maybe pair that with the idea of a new outfit for his first day as even if he has friends there he might be worried about what the kids who don't know him might think of him and a new tshirt and stationery set might boost his confidence enough to make him agree to go ultimately try not to get cross 'you are going ' is easily responded to 'no i'm not ' and once he's said this he might not want to 'lose' and backtrack so might always kick his heels in even if he's not that bothered anymore but keeping calm and trying out a couple of suggestions might help to bring him round in a way that makes him still feel he has a little control over the sittuation Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Theory of conduct Social rule Poker jargon About a Boy Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.
