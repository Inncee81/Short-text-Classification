i have a busy school year ahead of me any hints basically i take my sats next year and i am also taking two extra languages which are italian and french on top of german which i have been learning for two years i just want a bit of help on how to manage my time and i know that hanging with friends will be limited also my friends they aren't very intellectual thus they always tell me to hang with them when i should be studying because they don't have anything else to do so a little bit of help on how to manage my time and what to do about em i don't wanna ditch them i'm actually in the same boat as you except for the insane amount of languages just schedule your time so that you have set times to study and take care of homework it will help a great deal if you decide on a specific time it helps to keep you from procrastinating my friends are the same way they don't really take school seriously and would rather just hang out at this point they understand that i take school more seriously than them and not to push me to hang out with them during the school week i try to do as much as i can with them on the weekends chances are you and your friends will become slightly distanced at least that seems to be the way things are going for me just explain that you're going to have a lot to do for school and not to take it personally if you can't spend as much time with them they'll understand Social rule Theory of conduct GED SAT Paragliding Procrastination Education in Romania 2000 Australian Grand Prix Psychoanalysis Propaedeutic value of Esperanto I Don't Wanna Cry Spice Girls She Loves You CPU cache Saved by the Bell Roxette Computer numbering formats Pitaten Education in Hong Kong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Education in the People's Republic of China The Book of Five Rings Asperger syndrome Skateboarding trick Education in Germany Humphrey Bogart Psychology Modem Friends Avenue Q Spanish verbs Embedded system Ra (board game) Another Side of Bob Dylan The Apprentice 2 Education in England National Football League Domain Name System Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada The Isley Brothers Paradox Sheepshead Nicomachean Ethics Kender The Sims Autism Sailing Sesotho language Coldplay Poker jargon Gifted Blankets (graphic novel) Scientology beliefs and practices Economics Education in the United States The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie C__line Dion The Emancipation of Mimi Prostate cancer Hiberno-English Ayrton Senna Final Fantasy magic Transactional analysis Chess terminology Aesthetic Realism Eugene Wigner Bowl Championship Series PostScript Hangul German grammar Speech synthesis YuYu Hakusho Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Rational Unified Process Emotions (album) Interlingua T-V distinction Second language acquisition Equine conformation About a Boy Michael Garibaldi CPU design Billboard Hot 100 Philosophical Investigations Tina Turner Snooker UTF-8 Electrophysiology Noam Chomsky Prayer Social psychology Extreme Programming Aaliyah Paintball Strategic management Syphon Filter ITV Characters in the Smurfs
