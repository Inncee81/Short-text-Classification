i am just entering geometry in school and i am a little afraid did you have fun in geometry i was in algebra a year earlier and i liked it a lot but people keep telling me that if i like one i won't like the other i usually get a's in math but this year in geometry i am skeptical in th grade i loved geometry but i think it had more to do with the teacher than with the information the basic difference is that with algebra there is usually one specific way to solve an equation you apply the formula and boom there you go with geometry there can be a number of different theorems that you can apply to solve a problem for kids that really like the one way structure of algebra that can throw them off you'll probably do fine especially if you understand the concepts behind lower math and algebra don't let the different way of doing things throw you geometry isn't really that hard Algebraic geometry Geometry Arthur Cayley Algebra Mathematics education Clifford algebra Ordinary differential equation Curve Polynomial Axiom Galois theory Exponentiation Calculus Topology Linear algebra Group theory Elementary algebra Complex number Newton's identities Sheaf (mathematics) GED Combinatorics Henri Poincar__ Adjoint functors Josip Plemelj Fermat's last theorem Philosophy of mathematics Category theory Mathematics of general relativity __tale cohomology Projective geometry Ruler-and-compass construction Elliptic curve Pythagorean theorem Timeline of mathematics Education in Romania Algebra over a field Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Manifold Prime number Joseph Louis Lagrange Pi Where Mathematics Comes From Euclid's Elements Computer vision Motive (algebraic geometry) Gauge theory Non-standard analysis New math Algebraic variety Tensor William Rowan Hamilton Lie group Exact solutions in general relativity Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Physics Slope M__bius transformation Algebraic topology Richard Feynman Naive set theory Singularity theory Education in Taiwan History of mathematics Covariance and contravariance Probability Einstein-Cartan theory Deformation theory Symmetry Matroid Philosophical skepticism Exterior algebra Supersymmetry Hermann Weyl Scheme (mathematics) Leonhard Euler Boolean algebra Carl Friedrich Gauss Education in the United States Logic Matrix (mathematics) Abstract algebra Special relativity Differential geometry and topology Victoria University of Manchester Hamiltonian mechanics Alexander Grothendieck Hodge theory Associative algebra Diophantine equation Rendering (computer graphics) Alfred Tarski Economics Graph theory
