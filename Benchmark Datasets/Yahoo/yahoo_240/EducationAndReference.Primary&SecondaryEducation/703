what should i do if my child has a teacher that i don't like i've worked in the school system in the past and am familiar with a teacher who i feel is mean to her students i witnessed her smack her own son in the mouth for peeing his pants in first grade and this teacher asked me to remove a child's books which were peed on because she didn't want to touch them she has access to gloves as much as i do but she was pregnant and used that to hide her ignorance to disease processes i didn't request another teacher at the end of school last year because i have done this in the past with another child and have been told that requests cannot be granted and i figured with teachers in this grade the chances are only that she will be my child's teacher well guess what so other parents and teachers what should i do should i wait and give it a chance i'm not sure anything can be changed at this point school starts aug th can someone be horrible personally but still be a good teacher i've seen it time and time again people i thought would be dismal failures in the classroom because of my reaction to their personalities and then the students loved them since your school doesn't take requests you probably can't do much anyway i would be vigilant but don't let on to your child how you feel about the teacher act as if you don't know anything about her you don't want to either prejudice your child against her which could hurt your child or to make your child uncomfortable about telling you about anything that goes on in the classroom i agree with you that the fact that she hit her own son was very disturbing but i think you may be overreacting on the other issue if the teacher didn't have children of her own yet most people aren't very comfortable with bodily secretions obviously if reports surface of real potential violence or even verbal abuse against children you need to say something immediately Kodocha Theory of conduct Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public EastEnders Narcissism Humphrey Bogart Education in the United States Education Philosophical skepticism Motion picture rating system Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Grade (education) Milton H.
