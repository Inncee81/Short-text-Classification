im entering high school in about a month any tips i'm a little nervous and dont know what to really expect what were the worst and best things about freshman year of high school don't crowd the center of the hall you'll get run over don't try to be a teacher's pet upperclassmen won't like you as much don't skip lunch line that's an obvious one the teachers aren't going to be as easy on you as they were in junior high middle elementary not even close don't waste time in the halls the teachers hate having to put up with people being tardy make sure you learn the do's and don'ts of most of your classes they should hand out forms with rules etc in my personal experience freshman year wasn't that bad outside of the fact i had really hard classes you get a longer lunch less classes a shorter day in my case and you get to go to all the games football baseball basketball etc i'd suggest you play a sport if you can it's a great experience even if it's just for your freshman year you get to meet some great people try to make friends with other freshmen for the first few weeks you can meet some interesting people to say the least overall though freshman year isn't as bad as it's made out to be unless your school does freshman fridays which nobody really does lol Georgia Institute of Technology Education in the United States Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Jesuit College Preparatory School Yearbook Shaggy dog story Lynbrook High School Social rule Student Texas A&M University New Trier High School University of Houston Theory of conduct Volleyball Football (soccer) Baseball Azumanga Daioh American football Middle Tennessee State University The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cricket The Catholic University of America Pennsylvania State University FoxTrot Tai Chi Chuan Babe Ruth Sandy Koufax Education in Romania Duke University Great Teacher Onizuka University of California, Irvine United States Air Force Academy Lowell High School (San Francisco) Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Craps Norway national football team Bristol Grammar School Washington State University Columbine High School massacre University of Georgia Michigan State University Education in the People's Republic of China Murdock-Portal Elementary School Clements High School University of Massachusetts Amherst Princeton University Ty Cobb Hunter College High School University of Pennsylvania Hank Aaron American and British English differences Ron and Fez Auburn University Wall Street Poker jargon The College of New Jersey Sport Sumo Miami-Dade County Public Schools Major League Baseball television contracts New York Mets Hopkins School Baylor University Cranford, New Jersey Rice University Mickey Mantle Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Massachusetts Institute of Technology Secondary education in the United States University of Tennessee Reggie Jackson 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mack Brown Big East Conference Football IBM PC compatible Syracuse University Orange Roy Williams (wide receiver) Virginia Commonwealth University Cincinnati Bengals AFI 100 Years series Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Cornell University University of South Carolina Grimsley High School FC Rostov Playoff Bobby Knight Kender Spidey Super Stories Laws of cricket National Football League Lore The Fairly OddParents
