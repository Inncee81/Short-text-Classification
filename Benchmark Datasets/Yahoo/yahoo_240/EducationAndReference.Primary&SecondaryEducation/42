please answer i'll be your best friend i'm a junior in high school but this year i'm starting a two year course in vocational school for medical skills because i want to be a doctor or surgeon later in life however i'm having second thoughts because a lot of people say everyone who goes to vocs doesn't want to go to college is this really true should i just drop out of vocs and just stay in hs also i'd still be in home school half a day vocs half a day i'd get all the math and science credits i need and vocs would probably even help me in college because i'd automatically recieve credits for college from vocs if that is what you really want do it don't take into consideration what other people say Physician Education in Taiwan College Medical school Quizbowl Education in Finland High school Education in Romania Education in Australia Dentistry Vocative case Juris Doctor Institute of technology Education in Germany Dutch East India Company SAT Community college Little Britain Education in the People's Republic of China Hunter College High School Vocational education Virginia Commonwealth University Columbia University Brazilian Portuguese Education in Portugal Advanced Placement Program Education in Canada Social rule National Certificate of Educational Achievement Pennsylvania State University Education in the Republic of Ireland Junior Certificate Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons Florida Institute of Technology Taiwanese aborigines Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Cooperative education Saved by the Bell Secondary education Podiatrist GED Graduate school Secondary education in the United States The Adventures of Pete & Pete Law school Kender Education in Sweden National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Scottish Qualifications Authority Miami Dade College General practitioner Salt Lake Community College Associate's degree School accreditation Natural gas Scrubs (TV show) Volatile organic compound Higher education in Japan Belmont Abbey College Williams College Cooper Union Education in Hong Kong Grade (education) Katy Independent School District One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct School University of Houston Hwa Chong Institution Clements High School Battle Creek, Michigan University of Illinois at Chicago Columbine High School massacre Education in Singapore Montgomery Blair High School Education in Malaysia St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Latin Napoleon Dynamite Canadian football Public high school Billboard Hot 100 David Bohm Tetragrammaton Naturopathic medicine Nurse Weill Cornell Medical College Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Leonard McCoy Osteopathy Stuyvesant High School Triage Cape Town Laurel Clark Emergency Medical Services Texas Woman's University
