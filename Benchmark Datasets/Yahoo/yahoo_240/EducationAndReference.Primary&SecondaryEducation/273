job corps or job ok i signed up for job corps right before i graduated highschool in late may and they called me back yesterday and gave me my leave date and airline ticket info the problem is that i have a job interview one day before i leave i really need money and wanna take the job but job corps has already brought the ticket and did arrangements i would feel bad wasting there time buying all that stuff and then i just dont show up should i take the job if offered or go to job corps will they trash the ticket or give it to someone else im at job corps right now and i think that the job is wayy better if ur going to get a decent paycheck and sign up for college but then again if u arent able to pay for college then i guess job corps is good for u instead im complete in a month with job corps and they payed everything they even took me for clothes for my interview but yea if u cant pay for ur college then job corps is it but yea its going to be hell living there but yea if u put ur mind to it u can be out like in to eight months depending on ur trade since its self pace so yea it would be worth it plus u can join a college program and they will pay for ur college so yea living there for such a long whille may not be so great but yea id say job corps offers u a lot Wheel of Fortune Education in Romania The Amazing Race Barbara Boxer Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Warren Buffett Knots Landing Microeconomics Economy of the United States Moe Berg Great Teacher Onizuka Social rule Walt Disney World College Program MapleStory Graduate school Time Out of Mind James T.
