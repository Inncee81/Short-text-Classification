luck play a big part in examination luck or being hardworking or other factors i think that luck plays about a part in examinations factors that are beyond your control may include a harsh examiner or you may guess a few questions the biggest part is your confidence genuine confidence if you feel that you have studied hard enough and have done the best you can then you will feel confident if you know deep down that you haven't studied hard enough then any confidence you may pretend to have will be undermined by your subconscious fear my teachers always told me to look at an exam as an opportunity to show off how much you know this is a great way to look at it this way you are focusing on what you do know not what you don't which will give you a boost of genuine confidence and faith in your ability so i won't say good luck i'll say you can do it Game show Hypnosis Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Graduate school The nature of God in Western theology New York Knicks Bernard Williams Education in the United States Card Sharks Hyperinflation Prostate cancer College admissions $ale of the Century Social rule Sharon Tate Education in Portugal Boston Public Press Your Luck Galaxy Angel Luck Second language acquisition The Price Is Right Confidence trick Test (student assessment) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Homeschooling Race and intelligence Education in Romania Tai Chi Chuan Aikido Hip hop rivalries Stomach cancer American and British English differences Supernatural Martial art Abduction Phenomenon Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland International cricket in 2005 A-level Good Morning, Vietnam Sociobiology Ouija Uzumaki Naruto Great Teacher Onizuka Religion The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Wheel of Fortune Milton H.
