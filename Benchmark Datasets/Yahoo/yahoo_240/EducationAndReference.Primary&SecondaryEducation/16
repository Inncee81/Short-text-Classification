hooked on phonics not really working for me i have the kinder version and my yr old is excited about the program but she doesn't want to take the time to start at the beginning she doesn't even recognize the letters yet but wants to jump into the more complicated stuff i'm guessing it will just take patience on my part but does anyone have any ideas that will help me direct her to where she needs to start oh she's starting kindergarten in weeks how about playing some letter games you could play an alphabet version of memory using the upper and lower case letters as matching sets i used index cards to make the set leap frog also has a couple really cool games using letter sound cards leapfrog also has some really fun videos for beginning sounds numbers words and math writing letters in shaving cream on the kitchen table is also fun or cutting out familiar letters words from magazines or the newspaper keep in mind though that she might not be ready quite yet i have had kids start school with no knowledge of letters sounds but they pick it up quickly once kindergarten starts because they are immersed in it it sounds like you are trying your best to give her a good start just your exposing her to the idea of learning about language is super keep it up and yes patience plays a huge part good luck and have a blast with whatever you do President (game) JumpStart Mao (game) Game programmer Wheel of Fortune Yu-Gi-Oh!
