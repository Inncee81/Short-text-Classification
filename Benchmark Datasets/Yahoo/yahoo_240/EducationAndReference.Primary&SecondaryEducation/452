can anyone tell me more about online school for my brother's senior year he wants to stay at home and do that online school for the state of ohio i dont think this is a good idea but i need to know more about it can anyone give me some information about it are you talking about the senior year of high school if so i would really recommend that you skip the online school and go to regular school there are so many senior moments that can not be repeated with online school from prom to grad nite and socializing with friends for the last year regardless of whether it's high school or college schooling from home can be both rewarding and a pain in the neck first of all you need to set up a designated time to study each day otherwise you will find plenty of other ways to fill your time secondly you need to have a lot of discipline and understand that when it's time to work it's time to work and that means turning the video games and television off to actually get something accomplished third they often give you more work when you study at home because they figure that you have more time to do it and you don't have to sit through all of the lectures and so forth more information about online schooling in your state can be found at http www ohdela com Graduate school Theory of conduct Prom Education in the People's Republic of China Economics High school GED Dog training Mathematics Education Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Bondage (BDSM) Tai Chi Chuan Internet Yearbook Social rule Computer-supported collaboration Jacques Derrida Full House SAT Columbine High School massacre St. Joseph's College, Hong Kong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Extreme Programming RuneScape quests Prostate cancer Student Education in the United States Friends Fischer Random Chess Jesuit College Preparatory School Aerial (dance move) Don Daglow Quizbowl Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mapua Institute of Technology Game theory Chiropractic Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Japan Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Carnegie Mellon University Electronic commerce Computer and video games Social psychology World Wide Web Newbie Education in Germany Milton H.
