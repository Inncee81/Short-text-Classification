school starting soon and i'm sooooooo nervous i was wondering is anyone had any advice for the first year of high school throughout middle school i was made fun of and teased about the way i looked so i decided to get a new look over the summer and now i'm afraid everyone is going to make fun of my change any advice to overcome this fear thanks every freshman is nervous about high school regardless for how middle school went so you won't be alone there my best advice is to take pride in who you are and what you're good at join clubs and sport teams they will allow you to meet people with similar interests make friends and feel like you fit in belong know that you do not need to change for anyone you are fine as you are and if they can't accept you for it then they are not worth it also don't give in to peer pressure if you felt you needed to make a change in appearance to fit in know that you don't need to start drinking or using drugs to fit in so join up and get involved be yourself and don't change for anyone but you good luck and have some fun One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Kim Possible Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Badminton The Beach Boys The O.C.
