my son is years and months old can he get admission in first grade my son will turn in december i want him enrolled in ist grade this year can he get admission even if he is less than also when do houston schools open and what paper work do i need to bring on first day in our district you have to be by september i know how you feel my son was halfway through second grade at age the only options you're likely to have would be to find an accelerated private school or homeschool him one thing i would highly suggest not knowing your particular situation make sure that he really is ready for it before you accelerate him as he gets into nd and rd grade he'll be hitting several abstract concepts like telling time and working with sequences and variables often gifted kids are ready for these at a young age but not all are i sent my son to an accelerated private school for years but then we moved and we don't have that option so we homeschool i have worked with kids in my classes however whose parents insist on giving them material or sending them to grades classes that they're not developmentally ready for and the results are never good in the case that your son is ready for it though mine was i really recommend either accelerated private or homeschool there are great public school programs but they are geared by necessity toward the majority of students most schools won't look into that range of acceleration until a student is in jr high or high school for developmental reasons hope that helps Homeschooling Education in the United States GED Education in Taiwan Graduate school Waldorf Education Grade (education) Education in Malaysia Charter school Education Education in Romania Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in the People's Republic of China High school College admissions Boston Public Houston Independent School District No Child Left Behind Act Education in Singapore Secondary education in France Education in Portugal Community college Education in Hong Kong Spacecraft propulsion Gifted Equal Protection Clause Murdock-Portal Elementary School Hunter College High School Magnet school San Rafael, California French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Class (computer science) Secondary education in Japan Kindergarten Education in Albania Montgomery Blair High School University of Houston Education in England Numerus clausus Cornell University A-level Education in France Bronx High School of Science Open access Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in Japan Stuyvesant High School SAT Bipolar disorder __cole Polytechnique Secondary education in the United States Affirmative action Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Medical school Law School Admissions Test Boston Latin School IB Diploma Programme Jon Secada Code: Lyoko Homer Goes to College School University of Arizona E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
