how to survive high school i'm a year old going to be sophmore kinda quiet all my life people are like you never talk but i only talk to my friends dont' have good fortune with girls for me personally how can i survive academically i am very good yet lazy to all those who post to this i thank you alot we all had trouble adjusting to high school life you are trapped in a public system where everyone is required to be up to a certain age so you get stuck with a bunch of different types of people you might have never known this can be a nightmare and a blessing high school is about discovering who you are what your interests and beliefs are how you are different from your parents and where you alike this is a confusing time for parents and teens i graduated years ago and i'm now in college the best advice i can give is to find out the things you love and the things that interest you and pursue them as much as you can take classes that interest you and take up a hobby my freshman year i hated reading all the books the teachers made us read but by my senior year i met a girl that got me into books and now i'm studying to be a librarian also if you want to go to college start doing good in your classes you are already smart so just get the work done and don't be afraid to ask for help this will help you in the future girls like boys that have their own interests and they like boys who are not afraid to be themselves i was also the shy type i didn't date until i was a senior in college you will meet alot of girls trust me One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
