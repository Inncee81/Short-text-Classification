starting th form im starting in a few weeks at the same school that iv been going to since year but im worried is it really different to the other years do friends become more separated oh and also in our school the yr s have to share a big room thing with yr s and im worried that they'll all really hate us lol thank you its been years since i completed sixth form so here the low down on my experiences its true some people can be quite territorial over their section of the common room however there will be far more yr s then yr s at the start that is until about january when all the year 's will have to sit there first as exam then they'll drop like flies but at that point you will have secured your share of the common room i don't know of any hostilities anyway between yr s and s when i was th form i like you continued on at the same school for sixth form and the distinct advantage is you'll feel more comfortable with the teaching staff who have probably taught you in the past and the surroundings i must warn you to brace yourself for your a levels as they will be the most difficult thing you will encounter harder then your degree at uni i can vouch for that due the difficulty of a levels you may find your friends may quit a few of mine did but don't be disheartened and if you make some friends with the same gritty determination as you you will make mates for life good luck with your results on the rd RuneScape quests A-level High school Harrow School Prostate cancer Equine conformation Graduate school Education in Germany American and British English differences SAT 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tai Chi Chuan Education in Hong Kong Androgen insensitivity syndrome Social rule Shaggy dog story Education in France Milton H.
