is public school better than private school well i know that private school is safer and teach about god but the public school that i'm going to doesnt have a school nurse or a school consuler spelled that wrong i'm sure lol and my cousin goes to a public school and she was telling me about how they have a lot more classes to take than i do like they have shop and home ec etc and at my school u have to take spanish but at her school u have an option to either learn spanish french or german or swedish and i know that public school doesnt let the teachers teach about god but isnt that why we go to church so do u think that you guys could possibly help me out some public schools are better funded than others or have more dedicated teachers and admin along with supportive parents private schools aren't necessarily safer the only ones that teach about god or the religious ones typically catholic altho there are all kinds of christian ones i went to private christian schools from pre school to second grad and then a non religious private school for rd to th i went public from there on out i had plenty of opportunities to learn about god in sunday school at church i didn't have to do it during regular school if you don't have a school nurse it's not that big a deal i never thought they were that useful anything major and you'd have to go to a hospital anyways anything less and a coach or regular teacher could stick a bandaid on you just as well as a nurse could not having a school counselor could suck however i've never had a school counselor who knew what they were doing even in college all it did was force me to go out and figure out how to do stuff on my own i learned about colleges by asking friends and family now you've got the internet so it's a lot easier i learned how to apply to colleges by reading the instructions carefully my high school only had spanish and french at first no biggie later on it added a whole bunch of different languages like chinese japanese korean tagolog german etc but only because a local resident volunteered to be a teacher i didn't think it was a big deal that i couldn't start in those new languages spanish is going to be the most useful in the us anyways maybe chinese Education in the United States Separation of church and state Homeschooling College Education in Japan Clergy Education in Romania Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Malaysia Humphrey Bogart Christian right Reiki Culture of the United States Graduate school Multilingual Family name Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simplified Chinese character Teach the Controversy Religious education Education in Hong Kong Languages of Hong Kong SAT Private school French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Intelligent design movement Non-native pronunciations of English Korean language Catechism Tai Chi Chuan Milton H.
