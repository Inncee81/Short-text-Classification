can u tell me which reference book is good for che phy n bio for th cbse syllabus n other competitive exams is comprensive reference bookgood for physics and wat about abc reference book for bio if you actually wanna learn something just read the ncerts and do their additional exercises at least for physics for chem the subject is so full of crap that no book can teach it just somehow cope with it organic's the only thing you'll understand so do it well as for math you need a good teacher i've seen no book that can make you understand math as well as my ex teacher as for sums just follow any good book rd sharma tmh etc but don't do too much they have all the same ones i'd suggest you against reference books for two reasons they have everything written in them so you just keep reading through and you never tend to think ncerts on the other hand have some matter unexplained so it makes you think as to why it happens etc it improves your imagination and analytical skills they have too much bullsh t and hi fi stuff which isn't even required in graduation but you won't know what to leave since you're inexperienced ncerts again score better since they have just what's required hence every line is important you can't skip anything they're thin books anyway Tai Chi Chuan SAT Education in Romania Aikido Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Music lesson Dyslexia Hogwarts subjects Grade (education) Mathematics Homeschooling Speed reading Education in the People's Republic of China A Course In Miracles GED Music Teacher Socrates Craps Test (student assessment) Normal distribution American and British English differences Drama Scientology beliefs and practices Graduate school Autism Standardized testing Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Chinese martial arts Logic Stuyvesant High School Aristotle Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Secondary education in France W.
