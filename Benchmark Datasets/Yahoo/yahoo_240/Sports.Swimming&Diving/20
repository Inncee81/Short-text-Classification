should i end my year old grudge with my old swim coach the pool's swim coach is about to retire after years he's famous for one thing paying attention the ones with potential and ignoring everyone else ever since i was i went to swimming classes with him but i never learned to swim because he would only pay attention to the taller boys while he left the rest of us to playing in the pool i was in swim classes for years but i never learned to swim i was too short for him to waste his time on me my mom took me to another pool and on one season this coach taught me to swim but he left to a better job i kept swimming on my own with a lot of discipline by i was reaching competitive times it was then the coach who always ignored me asked to join the team but i said no for years i've been competing independently even against the team from the pool i swim at sometimes i've won at a some meets more medald than the rest of the team from pool i swim at combined he's retiring what should i do if he was too good to pay attention to you i think you did the right think by declining his invitation to the team personally i don't think you need to do anything now that he is retiring he's just some guy that didn't even do his job you don't need to have a grudge but you don't need to give him undue praise either New York Knicks Pittsburgh Steelers Triathlon Denis Law Jim Thorpe Sport in Ireland Water polo Syracuse University Orange Buffalo Bills New York Jets Ty Cobb Swimming pool Carolina Panthers Tag Michael Phelps Swimming Stanley Cup Diving Medley swimming West Bromwich Albion F.C.
