swimming pool pump not running long enough how long should i be leaving my pump run for my pool every day that i get in there is a pile of stuff right in the middle that needs to be scooped out am i not leaving it run long enough i usually leave mine run near sun up to sun down but turning your water over twice is a good minimum to figure this out you will need the volume of your pool and figure out how much water your pump is rated for then run it long enough for the pump to turn your volume of water over two times actually that pile of stuff right in the middle of your pool is a good thing it makes it easy to vacuum up just imagine if the debris was spread throughout the bottom of the pool i'm guessing that your discharge is aimed with a slight angle downward this way your water moves all the water in a circle pushing all the debris that is on the bottom into the middle your vacuum is still working for dirt etc that is suspended or on the surface but the stuff that has settled on the bottom you need to vacuum it up here's a fun way of creating the same effect with a pool full of kids http troublefreepools com viewtopic php t it's a fun read dan Vacuum Swimming pool Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carburetor Vacuum cleaner Anchor Siphon Solar power Breaststroke Internal ballistics Backstroke Swimming Dundas Square Sea-Monkey Diving Cavitation Professional wrestling throws Naval mine Mattress Water (molecule) Rachel Corrie Professional wrestling holds Diving suit Brewery Tide Newcomen steam engine Ocean thermal energy conversion Glossary of firefighting equipment Bong Textile manufacturing USS Tang (SS-306) Pump Two-stroke cycle Radar Fast bowling Amateur telescope making Speed of light Carnivorous plant Heat pump Planetary orbit Laser Explosive material Water polo Oceanic trench Vacuum tube Poker jargon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Wheel of Fortune Billiards Pump It Up Sundial Fountain USS Whale (SS-239) Sun USS Trigger (SS-237) Wind turbine Action potential Whitewater Nuclear explosion Polarization Winter of Discontent Aerial (dance move) Temporal bone Electric motor Campfire Milton H.
