i'm going on a swim team for my first year of high school i was wondering if any of you are have done that in the u s and i was wondering if everyone makes it also how is it hard or easy do they train you to swim better i've never been on a team before of any sort so i have no idea how this works haha i'm a fairly good swimmer but i still need some practice thanks all for the answers i was also wondering what exercises do they make you do like stretches etc because it says that we'll be doing exercises in and out of the pool i'm just really nervous that i won't ever get picked to swim at any of the meets thanks for the asnwers well my highschool just opened last year so no we've never gone state and we only practice from pm to and it doesn't say how many days or when we have to share a school with another high school that's been around much longer thank you again and thanks for the luck but everyone makes the team at my school thankfully i was just wondering if someone was so bad that they'd cut them is that done thanks so much in some cases it'll be a take all situation where everyone gets to be involved while in some other cases there will be tryouts for the team for the most part as far as i've seen personally it's a lot of take all reject none kind of thing honestly i can't even name a single school in our whole area league that has tryouts for their swim teams when you first get in the water you'll think to yourself wow this is so hard how can i ever swim like the guys in the faster lanes but once you get over the normal mental blocks and get a hang of how you swim you'll be in great shape from there and this is also what happened to me so when you look back at your freshman and sophomore years as a senior you'll think that they were actually easy but they absolutely train you to be a better swimmer that's the whole point of the team as for exercises that you'll do you'll always have a swimming workout to do these workouts include the distance you swim how many of them you're supposed to do and how much time you have until you're supposed to swim the next thing i typically get about rests of about minutes each you can get a drink or go to the bathroom during this time but we're in the pool about of the time but as for dryland that you do different teams have their different policies on this you might go running for a mile or or you might just to dockside exercises like push ups and sit ups jump rope some walking jogging exercises there's actually a lot you can do with these of course almost every team stretches before practices but as for meets it's a more relaxed policy with stretching all i can really say about the exercises you never know how hard or easy it'll be until you try it Backstroke Social rule Swimming Swimming pool Triathlon Theory of conduct Breaststroke Diving Weight training Medley swimming Drowning History of swimming Water polo The Ashlee Simpson Show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Diving suit Butterfly stroke Quizbowl Pittsburgh Steelers Front crawl Equine conformation Lynbrook High School Education in the United States Volleyball Epistemology The nature of God in Western theology Extreme Programming Cranford, New Jersey Time Out of Mind Milton H.
