should i stay on my college swim team next year i'm debating whether or not to swim on my college swim team again next year i swim for a small liberal arts women's college in california we're d i've swam the past years and loved it the first year but last year major drama went down and the only two friends i had on the team are gone leaving me with a bunch of frienemies new radicals song and two enemies i'm starting my junior year the year that matters a ton for law school so i really should focus on school but i love competing and i love the traveling trips i swim fly and there is just something about getting out there and pounding on that water that i love and i know that without the team i won't do that nearly so much hopefully you swimmers understand this anyways your advice all my friends who see the pain i endure are telling me to quit the team focus on school but i feel like my family etc want me to stay plus i never did sports in high school so this is my chance your opinion thanks as a former college swimmer who swam four years my thought is you would regret the time you missed when you are out of college and no longer in shape you will miss the shape you were in when you could swim hours a day work keeps you from ever reaching that level again even if you do masters you cannot get that time back and the opportunity will never present itself in the same form again from a team dynamic standpoint i would suspect that with a new year new people and your old friends being gone team dynamics will change and people who were your enemies may be friends and others might not bottom line you could always quit if it becomes unbearable and it is much more difficult to come back after deciding to quit from a fitness standpoint not to mention as a graduated law student the skills in balancing school and swimming will be critical in law school and life beyond when you will probably need to balance much more responsibilities and your remainder of your post collegiate life Fanny Blankers-Koen Triathlon Swimming Quizbowl Diving American football Georgetown University Education in Japan The Amazing Race Medley swimming Blonde on Blonde The Catholic University of America One Tree Hill (TV series) Swimming pool Breaststroke University of California, San Diego University of San Diego Education in the United States University of Denver Saved by the Bell University of Houston College basketball Tai Chi Chuan Williams College Boston University Graduate school University of Michigan Caulfield Grammar School University of Alabama The Book of Five Rings University of California, Los Angeles Volleyball Debate Adventure racing Backstroke Cliff Richard 1896 Summer Olympics Marching band Butterfly stroke Surrender of Japan Sydney Riot of 1879 Juris Doctor Tufts University Ecco the Dolphin Scientology beliefs and practices The Four Tops High school Cranford, New Jersey National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) Education in the People's Republic of China College Grammatical aspect EastEnders University of Central Florida Avenue Q Drowning University of Washington Dartmouth College Sport rowing History of swimming Drew University Boston College Affirmative action W.I.T.C.H.
