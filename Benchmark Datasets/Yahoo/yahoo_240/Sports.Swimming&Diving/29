is it possible to use a chlorine generator designed for an above ground pool in an inground pool i was wondering if it is possible to use a chlorine generator designed for an aboveground pool in an inground pool if the inground pool is small and is within the gallon limit if the salt generator is rated for the volume of your inground sure but with a condition here i think you'll find though that the plumbing connections on it will in all likelyhood be inch that's standard for above grounds your inground should have been plumbed that's standard for inground return lines as well as at the pool equipment you'll be restricting the water flow considerably as your pump motor is also going to be at least a hp likely it's not going to make for as good a filtration as you've enjoyed to this point if that generator has the hook ups that are dual size accepting on the iid of the pipe and on the od you're fine water flow wise it'll just depend on the pool volume rating then Brewery Sewage treatment Hydraulic machinery Swimming pool Dundas Square Fountain Aquarium Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Irrigation Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster E85 Air conditioning Siphon Jet engine Reef tank Chlorine Dry cleaning Anchor Gas metal arc welding Panama Canal Water purification Electric motor Fuel injection Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Flush toilet Water supply Ocean thermal energy conversion Pump Autonomous building Elevator Glossary of firefighting terms High-voltage direct current Domestic water system Home repair Glossary of wildland fire terms Uninterruptible power supply Dialysis Hot tub Bong Drowning Solar power Dodge Neon Volcano Tap (valve) Aquifer test Diving Glider Eifel Aqueduct Fossil fuel power plant Welding Renewable energy Rocket fuel Sea-Monkey Fire extinguisher Electrical wiring Windsurfing Ozone Equine conformation Three-phase electric power Swimming Tank truck Stream Vacuum Universal Serial Bus Coriolis effect Pelton wheel Soldering Space shuttle main engine Plumbing fixture Stage lighting P-47 Thunderbolt Drainage Ground and neutral Hydropower RS-232 Fire hydrant Motor oil Dog agility Apollo Command/Service Module Nuclear reactor Floppy disk Manifold vacuum Fire fighting Sodium hypochlorite Marine aquarium Filling station Opportunity rover Wood Clifford algebra Escherichia coli O157:H7 Transistor Eldfell Infusion pump Dowsing Wind turbine Tidal power Rebreather R.C.
