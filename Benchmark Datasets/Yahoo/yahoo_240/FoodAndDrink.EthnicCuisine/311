i feel queasy whenever i eat ethiopian food here's the story my sister dad aunt and i go to an ethiopian restaurant in chicago called the black diamond or something close so we order one of each and i enjoy most of the food unfortunately the after effects aren't so enjoyable i felt very weird on the way home i started to get these weird stomach aches and migraines strange thing is that i eat a turkey sandwich that we got earlier at the p j clarke's found somewhere around michigan avenue and i feel better what the hell causes the weird stomach aches and migranes thanks your answers are always appreciated since ethiopian food is spicy your body may not be able to handle it some people cannot eat indian food because of the spiciness of it or perhaps you are allergic to one of the spices if you can find something less spicy on the menu try that and see if you don't feel better Hot dog MRE Cuisine of Ethiopia "Weird Al" Yankovic German cuisine Curry McDonald's Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Peruvian cuisine British cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Chili con carne Spice Food Citalopram Fecal incontinence Barbecue Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Spidey Super Stories Friends Korean cuisine Hamburger Solanaceae Clark Ashton Smith Black pepper Delicatessen Breakfast Japanese cuisine Stomach Hell's Kitchen (television) Salad Fingers Cuisine of India Cheese Common cold Coeliac disease Cuisine of Laos Rastafari movement Kodocha Cantonese cuisine Hiccup Satay Restaurant Avenue Q Ramen Fast food Kashrut Mexican cuisine Foodborne illness Cuisine of the Philippines Anne Rice Paracetamol Hot pot Witches (Discworld) Raw food diet Bilal ibn Ribah French cuisine Tea Take-out Bart Simpson Anorexia nervosa Shawarma Soul food Cuisine of Africa YuYu Hakusho Expert system Kender Vegetarian cuisine Comanche Essential oil Fish and chips Coriander Helicobacter pylori Adjustable gastric band Kitchen The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dualism (philosophy of mind) Gray Wolf Gastroparesis D__ner kebab Springfield Elementary School The Demon Headmaster Social rule In-N-Out Burger Didache Garlic EastEnders Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Coffeehouse Fugu Brown Bear Sant Thakar Singh Cuisine of Denmark Cannibalism Cha chaan teng Diclofenac Cuisine of Brazil
