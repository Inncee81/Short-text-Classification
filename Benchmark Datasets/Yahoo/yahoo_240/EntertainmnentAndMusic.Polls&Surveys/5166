when you're standing at your life's crossroads how do you decide choose on which way to go i used to do crazy stuff when i had to decide like if a blue car passes now i am going to do this if not that i am not going to do it and stuff like that once i had to decide if i am going to join a project in one ngo and i couldn't so i did it like this i have a friend who never picks up the phone by the first call you have to call him or times anyway i said to myself i am going to call him and if he picks up in the first call i am joining if not that i it wasn't meant to be and he did he picked up very fast and i joined and it turned out to be one of the best decisions i made in my life now i grew up a bit and i changed my mode of deciding now i think really good about something and consider pros and cons ask people what they think and so on and if i still cant decide i look for the blue car or the phone call Social rule Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind One Tree Hill (TV series) Paul Is Dead Pump It Up The Apprentice 2 The Amazing Race Taxicab Dodge Charger Initial D Winning Streak Castlevania: Lament of Innocence Knots Landing Good Times Wheel of Fortune The McGuire Sisters W.I.T.C.H.
