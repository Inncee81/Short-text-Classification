why does the republican party fight so hard against universal health care i support universal health care or at least universal health insurance i met a person today who has no insurance and has cancer and has almost no health care i almost believe that the republicans fight so hard against health care is because they already have good health care and if we got universal health care their health care would go down they say it wont work don't need it well what about those of us who do not have it and therefor do not get proper health care let alone the medications needed i would love to see our country get universal health insurance are you for universal insurance yes no why if you are not for it what are your reasons and do you have insurance now no one owes me an answer but i hope everyone will answer thanks in advance for your answers it is easy to sit back and say you want health care give up half your income i don't think so first of all it would not take half you income unless your in the top and make twenty million a year or more if that is the case you could lose of your income and still make more in months then most people make in a life time second what about the millions of people who are not insured and america said sorry about your luck third i bet you have insurance already right you mean we can fund wars then fund re building the country we went to war with at our expense at a cost of billions of dollars and send billions of dollars to other countries for foreign aid but we cannot afford universal health care right we are supposed to be the richest country in the world remember you say free clinics try to go to a doctor first thing they ask is do you have insurance if you are jobless and on medicade yes you will get free clinics if you work at a and make over a year you do not qualify for free clinics unless you have children thank god children ger wick and medicade i do not hate rich people it just makes me so angry that most rich people or upper middle class people think if your underemployed its your own doing if you do not have insurance its because you do not want it if your homeless its because you want to be and here is the best one they think that if you can go to a free clinic your a drug addict give ne a break notice how universal health insurance is made out to be a bad thing to say i see my mom have to scrape and beg to get her medications and the rich person on a boat complaining because he had to pay a higher tax then the poor man the more money you make the less of a you pay of what u mak here are some thoughts if a person from canada or england can come to america to get medical care hello does that not tell you that person is rich the rich already have medical care they so not have to make the choice do i feed my children or do i pay for medical insurance you can color the picture anyway you want but your way out of line i believe only million americans have health care the republicans don't want universal health care because they'll lose money as not everyone can pay it in addition to other taxes expenses so they tell their pet the insurance companies to restrict it Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Unemployment Life insurance Medicare (Canada) Health care in the United States Flat tax Medicare (United States) Medical malpractice Health savings account Tax Taxation in the United States Education in the United States Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics FairTax U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 National Health Service Variable universal life insurance Wal-Mart Prostate cancer Education in the People's Republic of China Freeters Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economic inequality Health care in Canada Arguments for and against drug prohibition Pharmaceutical company American Medical Association National Kidney Foundation Singapore Health maintenance organization Blackjack Bank Hillary Rodham Clinton Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Food and Drug Administration Divorce Unemployment benefit Marshall Plan Abortion in the United States Stomach cancer Medicine Hyperinflation Warren Buffett US health reform under Clinton Canada Health Act Tort reform AIDS in Africa Capitalism Education in Germany Heather Wilson Tuition Mother Teresa Economy of Russia Social work Avenue Q Public policy Social security National Institutes of Health Millionaire 401(k) Emergency Medical Services Progressive tax Child support Poker jargon Abortion debate Migraine Economy of the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder New Deal General practitioner Abortion Abortion in Canada AIDS United States dollar Involuntary commitment Alternative medicine Consensual crime Dalton McGuinty Cuba Illegal drug trade Annuity Tariff Overpopulation Ontario Liberal Party AIDS pandemic US health reform 1912-1920 Paul Martin
