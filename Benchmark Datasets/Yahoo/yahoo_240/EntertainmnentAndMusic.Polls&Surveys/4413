what is the most embarassing thing that has ever happened to you one time when i was i went to a drive in with two of my friends and we went outside and we saw the progector that puts up all the movies on the big screen and no one was guarding it so we thought it would be really funny to walk right through it so our shadow would be up on the screen so one of my friends did and right behind her me and my other friend linked arms and skipped through it and i closed my eyes when i did it because i was really nervous and i ran right into a bush it scared me and plus i was laughing really hard from walking thru the projector and i peed my pants not just a little but like really bad my friends took me to the bathroom and were making fun of me and i almost cried because they left me in the stall trying to clean it but then they came back and gave me one of their dad's jersey's to wear to cover it up it was soo gross and very embarrassing but it was also probably one of the funnest days of my life Social rule Toilet humour The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete Camp Lazlo The Shining (film) Teen Girl Squad Time Out of Mind Jackass: The Movie Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ron and Fez Movie projector Bad Wolf Pitaten Buttocks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tag Piccolo Junior Saga Grandview, U.S.A.
