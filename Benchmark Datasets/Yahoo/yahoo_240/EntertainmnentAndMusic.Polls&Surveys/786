have you ever walked through a drive thru instead of driving i know someone who did that once and it was like in the middle of the night so there were no cars to run him over anyway i was laughing cause i could just picture him walking up to the window instead of driving they wouldn't give him his order since he wasn't in a car and he can't get a driver's liscense until he's cause he got a misdemeanor for stealing his dad's car so anyway i was just wondering if anyone's ever tried that i don't recomend trying it though and he had to use the drive thru cause the restaraunt was closed but the drive thru was still open i did it once but they wouldn't give us food Grandview, U.S.A.
