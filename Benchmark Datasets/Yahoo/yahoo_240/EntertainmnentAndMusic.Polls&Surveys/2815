airline regulations i have decided to never fly again due to the ignorant unamerican unconstituntional regulations placed on the passengers of the airlines i read on fox news that a woman was 'detained' and questioned by police officers for using the term 'fair dinkum' and a stewardess thought she was cursing her did you know cursing a stewardess is a federal felony i'm tired of being treated like a criminal every time i fly i'm tired of having to prove i'm one of the good guys the only way i can carry a gun on the aircraft is to 'declare' it which in most states is a crime and then only in my checked baggage i think everyone should be able to carry a weapon onboard so that the bad guys will think twice before commiting a crime what are your thoughts about this absurd treatment macy please drop me an email so i can respond thanks that is actually why a lot of people are starting to go back to trains faster more reliable in most cases and gets you closer to the destination Unlawful combatant Airport security Ryanair Airline Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gun politics in the United States Japan Airlines Flight attendant United States Postal Service Murder Plame affair John Lott Columbine High School massacre Freedom of speech VIA Rail Human rights in the United States Pakistan International Airlines Saudi Arabian Airlines Airport (film) Hong Kong International Airport Appeal Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Northwest Airlines Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Second Amendment to the United States Constitution 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Singapore Changi Airport Vietnam Airlines Gun politics Pilot certification in the United States Hearsay American Airlines South African Airways Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Boeing 727 Airplane!
