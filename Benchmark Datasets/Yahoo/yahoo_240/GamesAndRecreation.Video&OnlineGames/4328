world of warcraft and ventrilo together does anyone have an idea as to why my vent will work when i have wow minimized or off but when i have wow up my push to talk key won't work thanks for your help the p t t isnt the same as any of my hotkeys thanks for the help though thanks for the help vic it didn't work for me though i'm going to try and see if reinstalling ventrilo will work your push to talk key might interfere with wow most people have it as ctrl but if you put the key onto that go into key bindings and unbind ctrl s becaue that will keep turning the sound off and on if you push to talk when you are running also if you have a keyboard or mouse that has the extra buttons they might have a setting that does not allow them to be pushed when playing so see if you can set up the button that you are using as push to talk as a shortcut for something on your action bar first if you can then the problem is within ventrilo but im guessing it wont try to use ctrl as your push to talk key and it should work Uniform Resource Locator Video game console Nintendo GameCube Computer and video games History of video games (Sixth generation era) PlayStation Portable PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 Sony Computer Entertainment Nintendo Revolution Sega Console game HyperText Transfer Protocol Xbox Handheld game console MobyGames Star Fox series Super Nintendo Entertainment System Rare (video game company) Game Boy Advance Game Boy Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Game controller Resident Evil Computer and video game packaging Console emulator Intellivision The Sims Sega Dreamcast Handheld video game Final Fantasy The Legend of Zelda series PlayStation 3 GameFAQs History of video games (Seventh generation era) Nintendo Power Website History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Nintendo DS Soul Calibur II The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Nintendo Entertainment System Homestar Runner Wiki FIFA Series Action Replay HTTP cookie Crash Bandicoot Square Enix Mozilla Firefox Metroid series Super Robot Wars Console wars Resident Evil Code: Veronica Madden NFL D-pad Pok__mon (video games) Video game developer Hiroshi Yamauchi Modchip Spider-Man 2 (video game) Game Critics Awards Regional lockout Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Video game music Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever History of computer and video games Gradius Resident Evil (video game) Spyro the Dragon (series) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Defender (game) Game programming Nintendo 64DD Cartridge (electronics) Homebrew (video games) Eurocom Metal Gear Solid The Sims 2 WWE SmackDown!
