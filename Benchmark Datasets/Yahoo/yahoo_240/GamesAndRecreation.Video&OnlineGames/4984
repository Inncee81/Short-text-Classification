morrowind game of the year help bounty unfortunately my orc warrior was a dumbass and i killed so many guards i amassed a bounty of over septims guards no longer go to arrest me they attack me on sight how do i get rid of the bounty ive heard something about the thieves guild i don't recall how to remove bounties but check other websitesm including morrowind's home website and you should be able to find your answer there and to djking i think he is now aware he shouldn't have killed so many guards stating that doesn't help him you also didn't answer his question just bragged that your in every guild and you beat the game if that's true next time try actually being helpful and answer the person's question rather than hold your head and nose in the air and try and seem better than everyone else to me you 'sound' snobby like your excrement doesn't stink like everyone's does PvP Basset Hound Camp Lazlo Elvis Presley Clarinet Full House The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Paradox Scent hound Damn Yankees Make money fast Philip J.
