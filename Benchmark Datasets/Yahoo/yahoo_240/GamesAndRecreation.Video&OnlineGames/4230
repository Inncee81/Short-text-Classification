why should i buy guild wars i was thinking of buying factions i dont have guild wars yet at all and have never played i dont wont to buy it and hate it is there anyone thats played for a while i really want to know some great features about the game that are fun i play alot of diablo and runescape if that helps any also whats the main way of obtaining equipment how does the magic skill system work score the pvp please definitely buy guild wars but get nightfall not factions it is a must especially if you've been playing runescape which blows here's whats great about it no monthly fees so you can just drop it and come back you have no obligation to play constantly its easy to play for short periods of time and still get stuff done the quests don't take too long and pvp battles take like minutes time factors into it but does not dominate it like other games in runescape whoever plays the most makes the rankings its always the people with absolutely no life that own at it guild wars is fun even with out huge time sacrifices mainly you obtain equipment by killing things and taking stuff from them pretty basic yoiu cant really buy much from the merchants and have to trade with others to get really good stuff quickly when you sell something to a merchant its gone you get most skill by doing quests and missions that develop the story you get xp from creatures but quests are much more time effective you have eight spell slots but hundreds of spells to choose from which can lead to many different creative strategies the pvp is fun but for someone like me who doesn't have too much time to pour into the game make sure you do it with some friends i give it an though others may rate it higher hope this helped and i certainly recommend the game Pok__mon Abilities Flygon Pok__mon types Aggron Characters of Naruto Shen Gong Wu Wild ARMs 2 Pok__mon Trading Card Game Bagon Boss (video games) Altaria RuneScape weapons Pok__mon Colosseum Naruto jutsu Sceptile Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Zero (Mega Man) Professional wrestling attacks Cradily GunBound Toa Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Slayers Blood (computer game) Static (superhero) Cliff Richard Limit Break Eggerland series Golf Twelve Swords of Power Charizard Waking the Dragons Milotic Curling Equine conformation Drill bit Professional wrestling throws Piccolo Junior Saga Transformers: Cybertron Robot Master Unreal Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Zanpakut__ Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Volleyball Xiaolin Showdown Castle Wars Final Fantasy magic Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Pok__mon (anime) Shadow the Hedgehog Butterfree YuYu Hakusho Groudon Cincinnati Bengals Team Rocket Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Seismic retrofit Sabretooth (comics) R-Type Doom enemies RuneScape quests Super Metroid 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Space Pirate (Metroid) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Orre Flood geology GunZ The Duel Glacier Eberron Professional wrestling aerial techniques Taikyoku shogi Hatake Kakashi Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Onimusha Pok__mon Adventures Mario series enemies Hamster Guilty Gear Priest (World of Warcraft) Ice Pok__mon Snap Thor (Marvel Comics) Rhydon Akatsuki (Naruto) Grade (climbing) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tenshinhan Axe Professional wrestling holds Sacrifice (computer game) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Lawn mower Creatures in Bionicle Items in the Metroid series Guild Wars
