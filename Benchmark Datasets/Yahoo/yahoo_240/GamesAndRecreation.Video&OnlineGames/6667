is it possible to run a vista game on a windows xp computer i heard there was a program that allows windows xp to run windows vista games i searched on yahoo and google and i only got articles that talked about it but no link so i was wondering if anyone on here new a site or the programs name your answers are greatly appreciated i have not heard of any way to do this and if there is a program it is probably illegal and may screw up your computer it sucks that microsoft dropped support for the currently better windows xp but it seems we all have to deal with it darn Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Missingno.
