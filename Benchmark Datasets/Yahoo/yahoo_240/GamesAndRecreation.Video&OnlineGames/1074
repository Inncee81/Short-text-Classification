i really need help with action replay ds heya i need help with action replay code manager when i search for codes on websites besides codejunkies the submitter of the code i want always says i recomend copying and pasting this into your action replay code manager if it's a really long code eg all items for pokemon diamond but i don't know where i paste the stuff into because you can't right click it anywhere i read on another post that you can create a new folder then add a new cheat to that folder but does that mean create a new codelist and if so when i right click on the new codelist a create new cheat option isn't there what do i do help please if you cant copy and paste does anyone know if there are any other websites besides code junkies that you can put in your subscribers box thanks i tried adding my own code using the method below but it doesn't have an add new code option when i scroll down you are best to just use the codes that you get when you update your action replay there are a lot of bad codes out there for games that can damage saved files for games and even destroy the games if it is a new game update regularly as they will prob add new codes that you want when they find safe working ones if you do want to add your own codes however add the game of your choice to the custom codelist you can do this by dragging the game title into the custom codelist box click the game in the custom codelist box to view all codes scroll to the bottom to the 'new cheat' option with the tick and double click on it type in the name of the cheat and copy paste the code into the box below Mouse (computing) Minesweeper (computer game) Action Replay Macintosh Finder Gmail Windows XP Windows 2000 Mac OS X Object Desktop Warcraft III Computer virus Missingno.
