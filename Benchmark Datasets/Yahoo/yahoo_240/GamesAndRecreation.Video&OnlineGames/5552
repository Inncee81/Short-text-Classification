hacking the psp i hear that theres a way play old snes games on it how is it done is it hard can it be done on the new psp coming out in september yes it can be done however since it involves emulation and roms its actually against yahoo's tos to give detailed decriptions about how to or link to sites involving that now heres what i can tell you its actually the psp's firmware updates that makes playing those roms possible or impossible you arent plugging the snes cart into your psp so hardware doesnt really matter here when the psp first came out people went to work and got nes snes genesis etc games to play on their psps however sony made changes in the next batch of firmware that made playing those roms impossible from what i've been told people find ways to work around each new firmware release that causes problems with the roms but it takes time so yes the new psp should be able to play those roms as well allowing that someone has figured out how to get around the new firmware again do a search online for psp and snes and emulation and rom some combo of the above will get you a fair number of websites to search through and those websites may give you other search terms to use as well you'll have to decide which are the genuine homebrew hackers game geniuses vs the people who talk a lot of crap at best and are going to try to install spyware on your pc at worst my advice here is to check out a lot of sites and take your time reading through them and dont download anything until you know exactly what youre looking for you are probably familar with people playing snes roms on their pc this will work basically the same way emulation but the emulator and the roms will be saved to a memory stick Windows Vista Mac OS X Windows 2000 NTFS System 7 (Macintosh) Windows XP File system Macromedia Flash ITunes Object Desktop Gmail Macintosh Finder Windows registry E-mail Stardock ZIP (file format) Mozilla Thunderbird Mod (computer gaming) Opera (web browser) Konqueror Linux Uploading and downloading MSN Messenger PlayStation Portable Microsoft Windows RollerCoaster Tycoon AmigaOS PHP P__li Mozilla Firefox Mac OS X v10.4 Computer virus MAME IPod OpenDocument Webmail Apple typography Windows Me Wget Enterprise content management Digital rights management Online music store Microsoft Office BitTorrent Filename extension Google Desktop .NET assemblies Disk image Mouse (computing) Google Cascading Style Sheets Spyware Windows Picture and Fax Viewer BZFlag Internet Message Access Protocol Web page Emacs Spatial file manager Peer-to-peer System 6 File Allocation Table WordStar Bluetooth Warez Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol WordPerfect Lotus Notes Internet Explorer Windows 3.x Cue sheet System/36 Outlook Express Proxy server Perl Mandriva Linux File format MDAC Xbox TiVo Start Menu Kazaa Computer file QuickTime Danger Hiptop Unicode Xcode CPAN Mac OS X v10.3 Internet Relay Chat Backup Secure copy Disk cloning Symbian OS Microsoft History of Microsoft Windows
