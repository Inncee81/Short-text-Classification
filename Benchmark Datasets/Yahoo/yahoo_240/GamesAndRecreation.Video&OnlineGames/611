installing the sims on a mac when i insert the disk i drag the icon into my macintosh hd folder and click on the sims icon when i try to launch the program a notice comes up that says the sims requires at least mb of free disk space free up some space on your local disk and then re launch the sims what does this mean and how can i fix it i have already emptied the trash if that helps i'm also pretty sure that my computer meets all the system requirements since i just got it last august this is due to the fact that the game is being launched from the sims dvd instead of the the sims application folder that should be installed to the hard drive to install the game double click on the sims dvd icon on the desktop and then drag the sims folder onto your macintosh hard drive icon after the game has finished installing click on the macintosh hard drive icon to open it open the sims game folder icon and then double click on the sims application icon to launch the game Macintosh Finder System 6 Windows XP Apple Macintosh System 7 (Macintosh) Object Desktop Mouse (computing) Mac OS X Floppy disk Hard disk Windows 2000 AmigaOS Stardock Icon (computing) Xerox Star Apple Computer Windows Vista File system Mac OS history IPod Linux Spatial file manager Apple II family USB flash drive IBM PC compatible LiveCD MS-DOS Atari ST ILife NTFS The Sims 2: University File format Disk image Computer virus The Sims Knoppix File Allocation Table Mac mini Macromedia Flash Mozilla Firefox Classic (Mac OS X) Apple IIGS Apple Open Collaboration Environment PlayStation 2 System/36 Unicode Personal computer Redundant array of independent disks Microsoft Windows Pretty Good Privacy Taskbar Screenshot HyperCard Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cache NeXT History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS 9 Commodore International History of computer and video games Macintosh Plus Laptop Computer Apple typography X Window System Embedded system IMac Xbox Windows Me Microsoft Virtual memory MSN Messenger Apple PlainTalk Graphical Environment Manager Atari 8-bit family EMac Halo: Combat Evolved Dock (computing) Power Macintosh G3 Steam (content delivery) Double-click (computing) Linux distribution Library (computer science) Game programming Mac OS X v10.0 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Operating system Macintosh 128K Windows registry Forth programming language
