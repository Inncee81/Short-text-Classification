ds or ds lite ok we got a ds lite for xmas or months later my bro broke it so my father got a black one for his birthday my bro broke that too he's anyway we sent them in is fixed we got it in the mail and the black's mine coming when it comes i don't want my brother to break it again he's not allowed to play but if he sneaks it so i was thinking of selling it on ebay to get the money for a regular one cuz my friend said they're harder to break than the lite so witch one should i get the lite or the regular the two biggest problems with the ds lite are weak shoulder buttons and the game boy slot because gba games don't sink all the way in they are more likely to be twisted bent or snapped with a game sticking out of the port and weak shoulder buttons if you drop it and it lands on l or r that button will never work right again original's buttons are stronger so if you're the type who likes to keep both a ds and gba in at all times or if your brother broke your old ones by damaging the shoulder buttons then the original is right for you if not go for the ds lite better screens battery life stylus and stylus slot mic and speakers PowerPC IBM PC compatible Pentium M PlayStation 3 Laptop Apple Macintosh Counter-Strike Windows XP AMD PlayStation Portable IBM PC History of Microsoft Windows Personal computer Computer Microprocessor CPU cache ATI Technologies Bluetooth Microsoft Windows Intel PowerBook Nintendo Revolution X86 64-bit PC motherboard Celeron CPU design Opteron Cell (microprocessor) IMac Linux Athlon Central processing unit Apple Intel transition Athlon 64 RISC Transmeta Windows Vista Trusted computing Sega Dreamcast MAME Random access memory Windows 2000 Moore's law Cyrix History of computer and video games History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Read-only memory Linux kernel Hard disk Wi-Fi Timeline of computing 1990-forward Server Northbridge (computing) Dynamic random access memory AMD64 Computer and video games Wireless LAN IEEE 802.11 Pentium III Xbox 360 Wintel Apple Computer Windows Server 2003 Thread (computer science) Google PC Engine Acorn Archimedes First-person shooter Distributed computing Mainframe computer Pentium D Centrino Compaq GeForce 4 Sequent Computer Systems ThinkPad Supercomputer Internet Xbox OS/2 Magnetic core memory Apple II family Digital Equipment Corporation Universal Serial Bus Lag Computer bus Xbox Live Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Itanium 2 Overclocking IBook Doom 3
