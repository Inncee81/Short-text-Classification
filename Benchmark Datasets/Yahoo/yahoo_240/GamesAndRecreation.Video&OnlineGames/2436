harvest moon ds help please how can i marry muffy im confused on how to work in the mines and is there anyway to get g in one day thank you ps you can just answer one of the topics if you want this is a bit of information but it should help mining mining can make you a few hundred thousand dollars a day if you get good at it while time will not change in the game while you are mining mining itself is a time consuming process and can take hours you need to make sure that you have the second mine unlocked to do this you should go into the cave between pm with your hammer equipped you will then see a scene that opens up a mine to open the second more profitable mine you need to make it to the bottom of the first mine and then return again after like you did before to open the second mine before going mining you need some items to heal your stamina and fatigue to eat along the way the most efficient way to mine is to save when you get to a level i usually make sure that i only stop on the bigger levels then kill the monsters with your sickle and then search for what rocks the gems are in break the rocks using the hammer i usually only keep diamonds pink diamonds and alexandrite these can be found in levels divisible by and that are also deeper than the th level then memorize where the gems and exits are and reload the game that way you don t waste stamina on breaking rocks that don t matter and reload the game if you fall to a floor that isn t what you wanted marrying muffy you need to give muffy items that she likes daily to increase how much she likes you there are other requirements called heart events but these usually come with you being around her more i find that the best way to get girls to like you is that when you are mining as described above levels above that are divisible by both and like will have lots of regular diamonds in them the girls like these diamonds so i just give them one a day and it will increase their liking you once you have watched all the heart events and muffy s heart is at the red level you can by the blue feather and present it to her like a proposal a lot of things in the game are specific and rather complicated below if an online faq that is very helpful and can answer more of your questions http www gamefaqs com portable ds file i hope this helps and also the new harvest moon is coming out in a few weeks so watch for that Missingno.
