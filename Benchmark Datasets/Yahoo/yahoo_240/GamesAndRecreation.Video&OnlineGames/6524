best weapon in dead rising whats the best dead rising weapon mini chainsaws from adam are very good weapons but i would also like to add some of my other favorites to the rankings the sledgehammer it is very useful in blocking the attack patterns of psychos it can actually stop most of them from doing any or major damage to you the lawnmower is fun but the area it can be used in is very limited it wears out quickly if you have the correct upgrades the regular two handed chainsaws are also very nice it allows for a spin attack that kills all the zombies around you if you get surrounded if you are going for straight zombie kills then i recommend the sword found in the knife shop in north plaza with the weapon equipped it can cut through many zombies at once and it you jump you can get a straight forward downward swing that will cut them in half as far as mass chaos weapons grab any gun and move through the mall looking for zombies pussing helium or oxygen tanks if you shoot them they explode and kill all the zombies in the area the car is good for moving into a large group of zombies and then exiting the car and throwing a queen you can kill up to zombies at opnce through this method World of Warcraft Macintosh Finder Windows XP Stardock File system Windows 2000 Emacs Orbiter (sim) ITunes Virtual memory Konqueror Mouse (computing) Directory Linux History of the graphical user interface ZX Spectrum Object Desktop Steam (content delivery) History of operating systems Opera (web browser) File format IPod Mozilla Firefox Mod (computer gaming) Library (computer science) Windows Vista Backup Xcode Mac OS X System 6 Gmail WebSphere System/36 File Allocation Table ALGOL 68 Windows Explorer Bluetooth Common User Access E-mail Master Control Program Exclamation mark Common Unix Printing System Compact audio cassette File folder SAM Coup__ Mac OS X v10.4 NTFS junction point Apple typography Modding Btrieve Java programming language Windows registry Concurrent Versions System MSN Messenger ZIP (file format) Miranda IM Malware K-Meleon Quake II Screenshot Melissa worm Orthodox file manager Microsoft Windows Enterprise content management NTFS Windows Me Partition (computing) Spatial file manager Computer file Computer file management System 7 (Macintosh) Haiku (operating system) Macromedia Flash PHP Icon (computing) DCPlusPlus StarCraft Xerox Star Tab (GUI) TI-83 series DirectShow Header file Mac OS Python programming language WebDAV Drag-and-drop Case modding Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Apple Computer, Inc. v.
