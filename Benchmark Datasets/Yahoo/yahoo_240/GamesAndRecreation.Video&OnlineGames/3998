rocko's modern life game on super nes a friend at work lent me a bunch of his old super nes games and there is a game based on rocko's modern life a favorite of mine but i can't figure out how it is played seems similar to the old nes game a boy and his blob where you feed rocko's dog different items to make him do different things but i can't seem to figure it out the dog won't follow me and i can't even get past the first level i can't access any gaming sites from work and don't have internet at home so i need some help from you guys thanks i remember that game i think you just need to guide spunky to the end of the level you can like use chairs and stuff to launch him into the air to get on platforms and all just jump and punch objects and see what they do IMac Apple Macintosh ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Mac mini Desktop computer Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Windows XP Atari ST PlayStation 3 PowerPC Windows 2000 Radeon PC motherboard Power Macintosh G3 PowerBook Xbox 360 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox History of Microsoft Windows Amstrad CPC Nintendo Revolution Apple IIGS IBM PC Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Sound Blaster EMac TRS-80 Color Computer Computer hardware Microsoft Windows Cell (microprocessor) Timeline of computing 1990-forward NVIDIA Sega Dreamcast USB flash drive Graphics processing unit IPod Apple II family Amiga Graphics card Sound card GeForce 6 Series Atari 8-bit family Pentium 4 Computer bus Windows 3.x Commodore 64 The Sims 2 PowerBook G4 PlayStation 2 Apple Computer ZX Spectrum Overclocking Acorn Archimedes PC Engine OpenGL Celeron Computer Atari 2600 Acorn Electron Doom 3 3dfx Computer and video games TRS-80 Commodore 128 MIPS architecture Flash memory BBC Master Sharp Zaurus IBM Personal System/2 AMD Upper Memory Area Far Cry Bluetooth Mac OS X v10.4 MSX Architecture of Windows 2000 DDR2 SDRAM Linux Digital audio player Commodore PET Commodore International Creative Zen Hard disk Screenshot Nintendo GameCube AmigaOS Xserve Tandy 1000 Microprocessor Sinclair ZX81
