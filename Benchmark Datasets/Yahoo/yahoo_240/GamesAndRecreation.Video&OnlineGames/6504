how can you get a bigger bag in runescape can you get a bigger bag unfortunately you are always limited to spaces in your inventory there are however some workarounds for different tasks say for example you are doing woodcutting on willows or yews the best places to go would be draynor willows and edgeville yews this way you can quickly run to the bank and put your logs in then go back to cut more the same can work for other skills like mining and fishing if you're out killing monsters and taking their dropped items you would sadly have to return to the bank constantly or trade them to a friend so that you can get more what i personally do is take only what i know i am going to need around with me i only take my axe for example if i am planning to go woodcutting the only weapons i carry are my sword my bow and my staff arrows i have equipped at all times so that they do not fill up space and i only take the one outfit set of armour with me by only taking what you really need with you you should find you have a lot more space to fill up in your inventory Fishing Fishing rod RuneScape quests Angling Trapping Fox hunting Poker jargon RuneScape locations Pysanka RuneScape skills Lakitu Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Ark of the Covenant Trolling for fish Johnny Appleseed Whitebait Casualty lifting Apple II family Frog Seine (fishing) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Bob and George Ganon Weekly World News Elis Prefecture Striped bass J__rmungandr Apple Computer virus Shrek 2 The Inside Orangutan Stretcher Digimon Characters of Lost Apple pie Mango Garfield Ice fishing Gray Wolf Tag Animal Crossing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening IPod Highlander: The Series Elementary arithmetic Discworld gods Christmas tree Luke Appling Historical persecution by Christians Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Mouse (computing) RuneScape Random Events Planets in science fiction Tlingit Empire Burlesque The Pilgrim's Progress Chopsticks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Finding Nemo Maple syrup Characters of The Sandman Aurora (astronomy) Kaaba Cider April O'Neil Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Mad Money Lindisfarne Emergency Medical Services Aladdin (1992 film) Wing Chun Pentagram Glossary of American football Cross-country skiing Snake Leopard Eisner Award Ninja Scroll Past teachings of Prem Rawat Lead Bottlenose Dolphin The Untouchables The Haunted Mansion (film) Arkanar Castlevania The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) Great Old Ones compendium Aqua Teen Hunger Force Albatross Snake handling Aquaman Rave Master YuYu Hakusho The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Juniperus virginiana Ecco the Dolphin Big-game fishing The Twelve Labours
