better game then wow are there any games as good as wow and that have a lot of people playing it if i understand your question you re interested in something different outside of world of warcraft there are two games that come to mind you may be interested in guild wars an online game using the medieval fantasy genre there is no monthly fee though you do not get free updates like in other mmorpgs each update you have to pay for separately so keep that in mind the game itself seems to be still popular though it does not hold the number of subscribers wow does the game itself is not bad and i enjoyed my short time in it lord of the rings online this might be something you would really be happy with as this game is new and uses the wow interface this is great because those wanting a break from wow can still jump into this game see something new but still have enough of the good parts of wow to be familiar there are a lot of people in it because the game is new but there is no telling how long those accounts will hang around i have an account in this game an have been having a lot of fun with playing in monster play the pvp aspect of this game and in the normal game itself the quests are like warcraft and really help keep you entertained and busy and thankfully you never run out of things to do if you want an alternative to wow look no further then lord of the rings online out of all the mmorpgs on the market world of warcraft dominates all others with sheer accounts but the games listed above are grand alternatives for your gaming experience Power Rangers Power Rangers: Time Force Zord Power Rangers: Wild Force Villains in Power Rangers: Wild Force Wild Force Power Rangers Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy EverQuest II Villains in Power Rangers: Time Force Villains in Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers: Ninja Storm Villains in Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy Villains in Power Rangers: SPD Lord Zedd Power Rangers: Dino Thunder RuneScape weapons Thomas Oliver Villains in Power Rangers: Zeo New York Rangers Texas Rangers (baseball) Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Villains in Power Rangers: In Space Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers Time Force Power Rangers Zordon Zords in Power Rangers: Time Force Zords in Power Rangers: Wild Force Planets of Power Rangers Zords in Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy Forever Red Dino Thunder Power Rangers Power Rangers: In Space Bulk and Skull Tanya Sloan The Connaught Rangers John Stark U.S. Army Rangers Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers Power Rangers: Zeo Rangers F.C.
