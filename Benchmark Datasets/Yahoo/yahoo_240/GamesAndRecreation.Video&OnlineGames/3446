questions about guild wars hello i want to ask some questions concerning the guild wars games i was a wow fun from its first day that released but stopped it couple monts ago but i have some questions and i wont purchase the game till i get some answers read that the max lvl is how easy you get to that are there 'end game' items i mean for all classess is there the best chest boots etc that you can get how and how hard you have to try to get em read about arenas pvp and ladder system are there any rewards concerning ur pvp ranking read that there is no mindless grinding which is a big disadvantage in wow is this true seen many armor sets is one upgrade of the other i have some more but i'll stop here for now maybe if they get answered i'll come up laters with next i thank you all a it is easy to get to the highest level because guildwars is more about skill than wow which is about how high your level is it depends what version to how fast you get to level because in factions for example you get much more exp for quests than the others a there are end game items at the end of factions and nightfall these items are like any other rare items it depends on what skills you are taking etc on what weapon you should use a well only that you will get accepted into teams etc and there are rare gold items that can be accessed for completing certain pvp games also the higher your rank you get a cool emote that only people with a high pvp rank can use a well you get more exp in guild wars for quests than you do for killing things so yes this is true a the higher your level and the distance you are through the game determines what kind of armour you can get naturally the best looking armour is the most expensive also to add guild was has much more of a story line compared to wow so you are doing the game for a purpose and not just constantly trying to level up hope i helped i will gladly take your other questions Xbox 360 Computer and video games Gamer Game show Computer and video game genres MMORPG Friends Atomic Kitten Wile E.
