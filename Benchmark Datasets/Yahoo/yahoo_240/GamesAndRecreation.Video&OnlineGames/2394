what color nintendo ds lite should i get well i'm getting a ds lite and i'm having a lot trouble picking a color between black or white i want a color depending on how many scratches smudges and fingerprints will get on the system appearance matters too thanks i have both black and white ds i gave my sister the black one the black ds seems to show a lot of finger prints while the white one hides it better i would recommend the white one because of that you can always get a cover for the ds though and that way you can choose which color you then like good luck Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album Hey Arnold!
