internet on the psp my friend accesses the internet on his psp for free he has no wireless router or anything so i was wondering how it happens but when hes at certain places he cant get a signal and it wont work ive heard its something to do with the l an switch or something so were are the locations you have to be to get the internet and how does it all work who's paying for it someone near your friend must have a wireless internet connection this signal must not have a password when you are creating a new connection and you hit scan and the options come up unless you know the wep key you can only connect to the wireless with no protection this doesnt mean that your psp is in danger of any sort it has nothing to do with that the lan switch is a sliding button on the left side of the psp that must be flicked up so you can connect to the internet the psp will inform you if it is not when trying to connect sometimes you are in a place in a room where the signal is weak and the psp cannot pick it up any where you go you can probably find wireless internet most stores have wirelees but they might have a wep key that protects anyone else from taking their signal which answers your next question the person with the psp does not pay for the wireless they are using someone elses signal and the people who pay for their wireless pay for your signal or if you have your own wireless than you are paying for it hope this helps Wi-Fi PlayStation Portable Wireless LAN IEEE 802.11 Password Xbox Wired Equivalent Privacy Local area network Wireless access point AirPort RC4 IEEE 802.11i Federal Standard 1037C Computer surveillance Cable television Nintendo Revolution Modem Extensible Authentication Protocol Router Windows XP Broadband Internet access Telephone Cisco Systems Telegraphy Danger Hiptop Floppy disk Nintendo DS Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Internet Phreaking Related-key attack PlayStation 3 Wireless Wipeout (game) IP Multimedia Subsystem Surveillance Mouse (computing) Cellular network Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Voice over IP Universal Serial Bus Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Covert listening device Internet cafe Super Nintendo Entertainment System Cryptanalysis Wireless network History of radio Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Computer keyboard Wireless Application Protocol Harold Sydney Bride Digital General Packet Radio Service Internet fraud Transmission Control Protocol N-Gage Vertical service code Spyware Wireless community network LAN party Ethernet Global System for Mobile Communications Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Internet Group Management Protocol Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Quality of service Charles Ives IPod Password cracking Verizon Wireless Copy protection BlackBerry Game Boy Advance Denial-of-service attack Wireless mesh network Burglar alarm Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Oscilloscope NSA encryption systems Radio Handheld game console Breath of Fire III Computer and video games Call for help Enhanced 911 British national identity card Network Switching Subsystem Syphon Filter Asynchronous Transfer Mode E-mail Avalanche Telnet Gmail Diablo II
