what are the good grass pokemon in d p i'm thinking about getting budew cause i was stupid and had to pick chimchar i'm also going into floaroma city i just started over again for like the nd time so i'm not gonna redo it again i'll give you a run down torterra the final form of turtwig he's grass ground the only one and oriented towards physical attacks he learns earthquake on his own and a heart scale will net you the powerful wood hammer move these two moves are his main way to deal damage and go well with stone edge down the line overall he has pretty good attack and defense and will be a sturdy and reliable team member he is x weak to ice but that doesn't stop pokemon like salamence from being powerful and neither should it stop torterra he has some handy resists that help him thrive though it may be tempting curse is generally a bad idea as he won't survive special based ice attacks ever roserade roserade on the other hand is an entirely different pokemon she is frail but is a powerful special attack she will hit harder than torterra and is fairly speedy the trick is making sure budew evolves into roselia at a reasonable level ideally at level as that is when roselia learns leech seed and when budew stops learning new moves you can't really expect her to weather attacks like torterra but quite unlike torterra she can score the coup de grace in battle and thus is a more glamorous pokemon though you do need sturdy stuff like torterra the only other one you can get before the elite four is carnivine in the great marsh he's a physical attacker like torterra but is slow and frail which makes him weaker than either of the other two torterra being able to take the abuse that comes with being slow and roserade being able to kill before being killed after the elite four you'll have access to many many other grass types pre eminent among them sceptile venusaur leafeon and especially tangrowth but roserade and torterra can hold their own against even the cream of the grass type crop ultimately don't forget to build a balanced team balancing offense and defense support and status your favorites versus what is best National Basketball Association Xbox 360 Xbox Live Computer and video games NBA Finals Electronic Arts Xbox Los Angeles Clippers New York Knicks NBA Street NBA Live series Microsoft Game Studios Utah Jazz Counter-Strike Video game console Cotton Fitzsimmons Moses Malone Pinball Playoff Wilt Chamberlain ESPN Charles Barkley Midway Games Modchip Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX June 2004 in sports Shaquille O'Neal December 2004 in sports Steve Kerr Barry Bonds Mois__s Alou Nintendo Revolution History of video games (Sixth generation era) 989 Studios Ubisoft NBA Jam Nintendo GameCube Dave Kingman Sonic Heroes NARC (video game) January 2005 in sports Dance Dance Revolution Jeff Hornacek Halo 2 Yao Ming PlayStation 3 Player's Choice Major League Baseball Boston Celtics Dikembe Mutombo Need for Speed Indiana Pacers Enter the Matrix Memphis Grizzlies Mark McGwire Pete Maravich 2005 World Series Andrei Kirilenko (athlete) NBA Draft Phoenix Suns Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Chicago Cubs Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Dead or Alive (video game) San Antonio Spurs Snoop Dogg Salary cap New Jersey Nets Exhibition game Orlando Magic Bungie Studios Major League Baseball All-Star Game Rare (video game company) Houston Rockets America's Army Kyoto Protocol July 2004 in sports Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Acclaim Entertainment Houston Astros Tommy Lasorda ATI Technologies Andr__s Galarraga Eurocom Tim Duncan Boston Red Sox Major professional sports league Arizona State University Match fixing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar New York Giants Minnesota Timberwolves Robert Horry EA Sports Clarksville, Tennessee 2004 NBA Finals Allen Iverson Pump It Up Golden State Warriors
