people against war playing war games online i'm curious as to how many people who are against the war are playing war games online such as call of duty would that not be ironic war is war eh it's kind of hard to be truly against the war when the media and government do not tell the whole truth of what is going on and personally i think that it's better to be playing a war game at home then it is to be shooting somebody that you don't even know and you don't know why you're shooting them but to answer your question i prefer to play fantasy action games like doom or god of war and shoot at aliens and monsters rather than people i still think that it's better to release your aggression in a game than in real life so i say play those war games all you want Nintendogs Nintendo DS Battlefield 2 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Les Savy Fav Dalmatian Hot Coffee mod One Hundred and One Dalmatians Simulation game Crash Team Racing Atomic Kitten Dog breed Jennifer Lopez Digital pet Shigeru Miyamoto Gun dog Alignment (role-playing games) Dog Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Peter Falconio disappearance Relative clause Companion dog Katamari Damacy Cockfight Bradley Nowell RuneScape Mini-Games Game Critics Awards American Pit Bull Terrier Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Komondor Poodle Jak II DrumMania Sydney Riot of 1879 Nintendo Labrador Retriever Guinea pig Golden Retriever Thom Yorke Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Korea Jindo Dog Theory of conduct Patrick Star Basset Hound FoxTrot Bradley John Murdoch The Rolling Stones (album) Big Brother (USA TV series) Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Harry Nilsson Dog show Weimaraner American Kennel Club Bleed American Medieval hunting German Shorthaired Pointer Alaskan Malamute Dog breeding Ethics Herding dog Game show Ninja Gaiden Metroid Fusion Myst V: End of Ages RuneScape quests Schutzhund Chesapeake Bay Retriever Deftones REO Speedwagon Steam (content delivery) Dog fighting 101 Dalmatians: The Series Ferret German Shepherd Dog Kirby: Canvas Curse Love and Theft Sex Pistols Mechanical Animals Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Mewtwo English Springer Spaniel Working animal Montgomery Burns Mixed-breed dog Working dog Boxer (dog) Housebreaking Bernese Mountain Dog Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Sled dog Lady and the Tramp Toy dog Shiba Inu Elton John That dog.
