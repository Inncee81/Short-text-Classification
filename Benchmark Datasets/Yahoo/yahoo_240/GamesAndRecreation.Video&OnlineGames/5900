where can i buy half life in geelong on cd i have wanted half life for ages but i can't find it anywhere and another thing do you have to run it through steam or can you play it on your computer like any other normal game no you cannot play it without steam i saw no use in buying it from the store because the cd only has the steam software on it and it will download the game from its servers just download steam from www steampowered com and buy it through steam with a credit card so once again the cd has nothing on it but steam and the cd key once you download the game online than you can use offline mode to play without having to connect Nintendo DS Nintendo Power Metroid Metroid series Metroid Prime: Hunters Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Game Boy Advance Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Samus Aran Super Mario Kart Player's Choice Intelligent Systems Toad (Nintendo) Mario Kart Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable Wario Metroid (video game species) Metroid Prime Computer and video game genres Metroid: Zero Mission Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
