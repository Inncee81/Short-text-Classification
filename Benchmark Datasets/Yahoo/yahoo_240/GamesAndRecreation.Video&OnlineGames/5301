wow players only hey i used to play world of warcraft because i thought it was fun but i got bored and broke so i quit all my guys were on a pve or pvp server and i never really understood what a role playing server is what exactly do u do differently please don't start a flame war about wow sucking or not i've been on an rp server ever since i started a few years ago an rp server is pretty much the same as a pve server except you can't have stupid names like ipwnnoobs you can actually be reported for having a non rp name you want names like morganne raynar etc people like to act out stories with their characters and there are lots of roleplay guilds where you basically can't talk out of character no talking of like zomg i just leveled you'd have to say something like i sense that i've gained some strength or something stupid like that for the most part though it's pretty much the same as a pve not everyone roleplays you just have to join a guild that isn't a roleplay one and in instances roleplay doesn't really happen Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Emerald Missingno.
