is the game the settlers good i've enjoyed most of the series i played the first one on my amiga settlers wasn't really to my taste but i haven't played the revised version i think i enjoyed settlers the most but since it i can't get it to work on xp i've been playing settlers which is nearly as good i was rather disappointed by settlers which was a very different game to the rest of the series more like age of empires than any of the previous games it seemed a solid enough game but it didn't really fit into the same series had roads which could lead to some frustrating bottlenecks and allowed greater control of military forces than before had the most flexibility and is still enjoyable whenever i go back to it Hitman (computer game) Symphonic Game Music Concert Eidos Interactive O.
