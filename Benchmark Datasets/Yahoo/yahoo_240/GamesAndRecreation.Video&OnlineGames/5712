what is worth throwing the master ball at in pokemon diamond pearl i am hunting down cressilia but my golbat is too slow to use mean look on it so now i'm debating if to throw the master ball at it alright yoshi personally i would use it on cresselia cresselia is unusual she runs but when she gets stuck and needs to fight it is pretty strong lvl mesprit can easily be blocked and kept under control so dont use it on mesprit for palkia or dialga find a great defensive pokemon buy lots of dusk and timer balls go to p or d at night and use dusk balls the first turns then after the ten turns use the timer ball also try to put them to sleep and get them down to red hp giratina was actually the easiest i used dusk balls idk if the power of the dusk ball stacks up at night and in a cave so try to fight giratina at night also for mesprits brothers or whatever you should have no problem with them RuneScape RuneScape locations RuneScape cheats RuneScape skills RuneScape economy RuneScape quests RuneScape Mini-Games Jagex RuneScape Random Events RuneScape weapons Massively multiplayer online game RuneScape slang and terminology Star Wars: Galaxies MMORPG RuneScape dungeons Computer and video game genres Computer role-playing game RuneScape gods Sheryl Crow Combine (Half-Life 2) Discworld MUD Eggerland series Newbie Jon Secada Interactive fiction Conan the Barbarian Creatures in Bionicle Hatake Kakashi Kalphite Queen Sonic Adventure RuneScape runes MUD EverQuest TimeSplitters: Future Perfect Castle Wars Rokugan Zones of EverQuest Diablo II Stormfront Studios Captain Beefheart Gamemaster Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Don Daglow Flight simulator Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game Orc The Legend of Zelda series enemies Real-time strategy Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Rome: Total War Rush (computer gaming) Halo 2 Doo-wop Greyhawk Eberron Baldur's Gate series Super Mario Sunshine Kalimdor Craps Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Role-playing Daz Dillinger EverQuest II Platform game Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Rock Lee Xenu The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rocket Power Wise Old Man Mercenary Meta-reference Hermit crab A Tonic For The Troops Darth Revan Kirby Sonic Heroes Gary Gygax Adventure Island Myth (computer game) Ultima Online History of Greek and Roman Egypt DragonQuest Dungeons & Dragons manuals Def Jam Fight for New York EverQuest Online Adventures God of War Polymer City Chronicles U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Doki Doki Panic Star Fox Adventures My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Fable (video game) Crazy Horse Neverwinter Nights Battle of the Little Bighorn G-Man (Half-Life) Pink (musician) Devils Tower National Monument Toad (Nintendo)
