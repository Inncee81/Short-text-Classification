how do i move a saved game to another gamer profile on i have a saved game on my gamer profile in which i have achieved a few achievments i made a new gamer profile but now when i play the game it starts all over again and i don't want to do that is there a way to move my saved game to this new gamer profile and the achievments too it is impossible to move acheivement points between accounts you can move your save data from one to another by going to the system screen on the dashboard then in the memory option and moving whatever you need to from there if both profiles are on the same hard drive i tried shortly after the system launched and you just can not transfer acheivement points that would make them virtually pointless if you could just copy over other people's points to your name you will have to start over to regain those points on your new profile i'm not sure if you will gain new acheivements off of copied save files though Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon (video games) Celebi Pok__mon Crystal Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Pikachu Mewtwo St Ives, Cornwall Pok__mon Yellow Pok__mon Missingno.
