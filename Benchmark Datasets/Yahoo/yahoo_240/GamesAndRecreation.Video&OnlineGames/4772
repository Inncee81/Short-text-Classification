mesprit diamond i'm very anoyed at the rare pokemon mesprit in my game it's at hp and it's asleep the only disadvantage is my pokemon haunter uses mean look so it cant escape and then mesprit wakes up and attacks haunter super effective so then mesprit runs away and i lose again it's very annoying as i've been attempting to catch it for about a week please help i don't have wi fi no trades i don't want to use my masterball i'm thinking that i'll beat the elite four then trade my pokemon from sapphireholding my masterball from that game or start a new game in ruby and then send the masterball over i admit that i've been going over this too much help i have encountered mesprit over times at least and each times the same thing happens i know about cressila and i plan to destroy the elite four and get another masterball if i don't get some advice that can tell me something that hugely helps i've had the same problem the way that pokemon catching works depends on a bunch of factors you know this the status hp and pokeball effectiveness the other thing that adds to it is a randomly generated number which is added to the chance of catching the opposing pokemon the way i caught it was i just loaded up on dusk balls and fought it at night did the same thing that you did with sleep and mean look but just keep trying the dusk balls over and over and over it worked for me you just have to get lucky Karaoke Karaoke Revolution I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue A Hard Day's Night (song) My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Sinfest Late Night with Conan O'Brien Crash Nitro Kart (PS2) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
