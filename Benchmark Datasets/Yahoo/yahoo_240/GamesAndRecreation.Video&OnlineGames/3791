my nintendo ds opens all clanky how can i fix it ya know how it opens up well my doesnt open smoothly anymore it opens 'clanky' and always goes down to the flat line screen the last clank the screen can go down to i cant send to nintendo because my mom is mean what does one do if your mom won't let you send it to nintendo try checking with some of the local independent game and electronics shops to see if they can repair it and what they would charge it sounds like the spring or a piece of plastic connected to the spring in your ds' hinge needs to be repaired i wouldn't recommend doing it yourself since it's very easy to accidentally make things worse by damaging an unrelated piece of the ds plus these are often specialty parts that only nintendo can replace for you as they don't always make them available to other repair shops your best bet really is to send it in to nintendo for repairs i've worked with nintendo customer support repair technicians on hardware issues ranging from the original bit nes to my wii and they're always professional and reasonable if you can't convince your mom this is the best idea try showing her this or getting a local repairman to talk her into it i promise you you won't get a better repair job anywhere else Mouse (computing) Dance Dance Revolution PHP Harmonica Ajax (programming) Beatmania IIDX Quake III Arena Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Double bass Guilty Gear Violin Sega Dreamcast Advance Wars: Dual Strike BZFlag Floppy disk Drag racing AmigaOS Gesture 2000 Australian Grand Prix RISC Screenshot R-Type C64 Direct-to-TV Dragon Booster TGV Pac-Man Pop'n Music Garbage collection (computer science) Folk music Linux Gmail Fountain pen F-Zero X Blood on the Tracks GameFAQs Music of Ireland Chaos Emerald Bubble Bobble Shadow the Hedgehog Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microeconomics Quicksort Mario Ecco the Dolphin Oscilloscope Gradius Web design Web server Fast bowling Software engineering Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority GunZ The Duel Guitar Lane Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Gas metal arc welding Synthesizer Viewtiful Joe MySQL The Chemical Brothers Internal ballistics Power Rangers: SPD Python programming language Canon T90 Fencing Associative array Nintendo GameCube Capoeira HyperText Transfer Protocol ImageMagick Unreal PlayStation Portable BitTorrent Eye Nintendo 64 Manual transmission Ultraman Music video game Billiards Toyota Prius Elevator Konami Code Pinball Croquet Cheating in Counter-Strike Mandarin (comics) Legal research Web crawler GunBound HTML element Vehicular cycling Knight Rider Spyware Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Speed reading Microsoft Windows IPod Linked list
