my cousin got a new xbox but we won't let me even touch it what should i do my cousin traded his zune for an xbox he's always taking advantage of it he lets my brother play but not me what should i do why should he let you touch it it isn't yours it is his therefore it is his decision who can and can not play with it and you should respect that i wouldn't suggest trying to as some others have suggested black mailing him or telling his father about his decisions regarding his xbox all that will succede in doing in making your cousin resent you and you will have even less chance of him ever letting you use anything of his in the future plus it sets a dangerous precedent if you can't get your way you'll just run and tell tales on people to get your way if that is the way you wish to procede you will find quickly that you will not be welcome in any activities undertaken by your peers perhaps it is your insistance that you have some right to use the xbox even though it isn't yours that is the reason your cousin won't allow you to use it i think your best course of action might be reverse psychology up until now i can imagine you've whined and complained about the fact that you have been denied access to the xbox you've probably even begged that is probably extremely annoying for your cousin but it does give your cousin power over you he knows you want to use his xbox and by denying you access he has power over you the easiest way to breach that power is to just simply no longer appear at all interested in his xbox don't beg to use it don't whine if you're not invited to use it don't even mention it if you look like you have absolutly no interest in the gaming consol what so ever then your cousin will quickly realise that denying you access no longer holds the power it once did he may invariably even allow you to use it in time but invariably i would suggest you grow up life is full of disappointments and we can't have everything we want just because we whine and whinge and complain about the fact we don't have it it's not like when you get older and you see someone driving a really nice car and you want that car you can just complain long and loud until one falls in your lap or the owner of the nice car gives it over to you life doesn't work like that the world is going to be full of people who have things you wish you had but that does not mean you have any right of ownership over those things merely because you covet them the sooner you learn this the happier your life will be Theory of conduct The Smoking Room True Crime: Streets of LA Prince Edmund (Blackadder) RISC MAME Pok__mon Live!
