what is the best rpg game for an boy apart from world of warcraft well its not starcraft because that's not an rpg so there are multiple options first off guild wars is very much like wow with some better aspects and is just a off payment so no monthly fees secondly if you don't want to pay anything maple story is available for download this game is a good on line rpg in cartoon platform game style if your not looking for an on line rpg then there is elder scrolls but this is quite ott for an year old in my opinion hope i helped Missingno.
