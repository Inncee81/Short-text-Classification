what age would you call your son able to play m for mature games speaking from a purely personal perspective i think that it really depends on the context that family puts into the environment i know that i myself was playing games with gore or blood when i was in my teens but i was steered away from things that may have been overtly sexual in the end the big difference is the fact that there was someone there to discuss my games with me to tell me what was true and what needed context what was reality and fantasy it's the same theory behind what you let your child watch on tv or in the movies if you're not comfortable with it there don't be comfortable with it here and take an interest in what he's doing talk to him about it even if it bores you out of your skull just don't talk down to him they hate that and don't judge him if he just killed a whole bunch of guys good parenting and showing an interest goes a long way for a kid nowadays Drag racing Motorcycle Nitrous The Fast and the Furious (2001 film) Need for Speed: Underground Auto racing Motorcycle racing Metropolis Street Racer Methanol Crash Team Racing Nitrous oxide Ridge Racer Need for Speed: Underground 2 Sonic R Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Super Mario Kart Snooker Racing game Racetrack (game) Track cycling Downhill Tux Racer Street racing Namco Racer PlayStation Portable Kirby Air Ride Rad Racer Import Scene Choro Q video games Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
