egm vs gamepro there's good and bad in both magazines egm has a lot of really good articles and the reviews offer three different opinions which is very handy but it has such a negative tone the writers can be down right snarky and sometimes even just plain mean no not sometimes they're often mean especially toward the people who send in questions and they're biased if all i read was egm i'd think that the ps was a horrible system with absolutely no redeeming quallities although i will admit it is getting a little better about that now that it's starting to pick up some steam the articles in gamepro are good too and the whole magazine has a much more positive tone than egm they're even gasp nice to the people who write in with questions i'm not saying they're not a little biased but rather than tear down the systems that are less popular they tend to extol the virtues of all of them i think that's better for the gaming community as a whole what are your thoughts i originally put this question in the magazines section but only got one real response i'm really curious to know if anyone else has noticed the same thing i have and if you feel the same way yeah i think gamepro is the best out of the two egm is said to be the best video game magazine though but i get gamepro Super Mario 128 Video game magazine Extreme Programming Amiga Power Computer and video games Next Generation Magazine The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Theory of conduct Ethics Audiophile Sonic the Hedgehog Noam Chomsky H2G2 Super Mario 64 Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Socrates Narrator Non-native pronunciations of English Nintendo Revolution Theodicy Social rule Little Britain Scientology beliefs and practices Cyberpunk David Horowitz Homophobia Ziff Davis Scientific skepticism John Lott Goodness and value theory Opinion poll Kung fu Alignment (role-playing games) Newspaper The Apprentice 2 Child sexuality Transactional analysis Standard Cantonese Plame affair Video game music Summa Theologiae Enter the Matrix SAT Dragon Booster Sydney Riot of 1879 Criticism of libertarianism Anthroposophy Paul W.
