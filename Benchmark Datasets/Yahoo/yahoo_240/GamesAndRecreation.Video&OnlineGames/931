please ps of can't decide i really can't decide between these two i wanna get one but i dont no which one to get ps exclusives i want killzone resistance fall of man metal gear solid exclusives i want gears of war dead rising lost planet and these are cross platform games i want assassins creed call of duty grand theft auto i just can'tt decide well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives around christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword killzone metal gear solid etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series get the ps its better in the long run for the games you like too ps assassins creed grand theft auto and call of duty are not exclusive on the xbox PlayStation 2 Halo 2 Halo: Combat Evolved Xbox Live Nintendo First-person shooter Nintendo GameCube Halo (video game series) PlayStation Portable Wipeout (game) Sega Dreamcast Counter-Strike Video game music IBM PC compatible Grand Theft Auto III Nintendo Revolution Dead or Alive (video game) ATI Technologies History of video games (Sixth generation era) History of computer and video games Final Fantasy XI Machinima Killzone Nintendo DS Sega Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ninja Gaiden Microsoft Console game Timeline of computing 1990-forward Gradius Video game controversy Sega Saturn Game controller Game Critics Awards Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Grand Theft Auto: Vice City The Sims DVD Need for Speed Modchip Mouse (computing) Metal Gear Solid Apple Macintosh Rockstar Games Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Marathon (computer game) Intellivision MMORPG Sega 32X Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance IPod Voice over IP MapleStory Nintendo 64 Grand Theft Auto (series) Pump It Up Handheld game console Bicycle lighting FIFA Series Sonic the Hedgehog Game Boy Advance Ninja Electronic Arts PowerPC Star Wars: Battlefront Interactive Achievement Awards Universal Serial Bus History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Super Robot Wars Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Spider-Man (games) Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Resident Evil History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo Power Shen Gong Wu Radeon Star Wars: Galaxies Airsoft Computer role-playing game Blue screen of death N-Gage
