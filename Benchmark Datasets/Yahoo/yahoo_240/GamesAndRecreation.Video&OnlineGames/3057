why are there so many beggars on runescape do they have no honor i constantly have people begging me for stuff when i m ingame i also see lots of it on some of my groups on here what makes people think it s right to beg either for items or accounts i personally don t mind giving help information is always free but come on if you want something work for it it s a bloody game for petes sakes how hard is it to click a mouse to make your character swing his pick or axe if you need something made at least gather the materials for a higher level character to work with don t expect him to just give you something or to just give you his character that he s worked on for a long time what makes these beggars think he should the hand cramps must be sooo terrible if they re forced to begging to get what they need what do you feel about this i'm talking noobs not newbs i have no problem helping new people out its just the ones that go around doing nothing but begging that's annoying there's also lots of people posting on here asking for high level accounts because they are mostly little kids who haven't learned that you have to work for what you have in the real world let alone a virtual one they are kids still being taken care of by their parents and think everything should be given to them free they might actually learn some things about life ahead and be better prepared to deal with it if they would just shut up begging and do something in the game by the way i don't see anything wrong with your question i noticed the put down by some of the others giving answers there are always some jerks out there ready to say something like get over it while contributing nothing positive to the resolution of a valid question they are about as annoying to me as the people who constantly ask questions about pokemon in yahoo answers Xbox 360 Xbox Live Xbox StepMania Need for Speed ITunes Computer role-playing game ITunes Music Store RollerCoaster Tycoon Halo: Combat Evolved Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 Last.fm Electric guitar Mixtape Pump It Up First-person shooter Warcraft III Sonic Heroes Browser wars Metallica Stuart Davis (musician) Video game music Foo Fighters Samples of music from the United States Half-Life 2 Ubisoft Counter-Strike Console wars Microsoft Evanescence Bolt Thrower (band) Fable (video game) Remix Machinae Supremacy Karaoke E-Bow Weezer Steve Earle System of a Down Action Replay Cheap Trick Sega Saturn Folk music Scorpions (band) Alexi Laiho Clawfinger Game programmer Dave Matthews Band Bruce Springsteen Megadeth Grateful Dead Oldsmobile Howie Day Digital download Modchip Guitar solo Commodore 64 MP3.com Sigur R__s Ramones Netscape Navigator Dramarama (band) Music of Scotland Beastie Boys Peter Gabriel Guns N' Roses Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Pearl Jam StarCraft Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Pixies Lil Jon Country music Serious Sam Ultima Online Song IPod Aerosmith Vocoder Radiohead The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Paul Simon Second Life Billy Corgan Joy Division (band) Halo 2 Rage Against the Machine Madness (band) Crimson Skies Rhythm guitar Lenny Kravitz Nine Inch Nails Brian May Slipknot (band) Trey Anastasio Object Desktop
