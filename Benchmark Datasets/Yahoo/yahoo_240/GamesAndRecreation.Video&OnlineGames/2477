please help i can hear people talking to me online with my ps but they cant here me whats going on and how do i know if people will be able to hear me i'm just guessing but i suspect that you would have to go into settings and configure the audio for network i play online buti have never bothered with the whole headset thing but there does seem to be a lot of things you have to set up but it is worth doing i suppose as for knowing if you can be heard i think you do an initial test to get the levels right and if you are playing with friends surely you will get some response so to recap try system settings audio best of luck The Sims Ragnarok Online Stardock Monopoly (game) Steam (content delivery) Minesweeper (computer game) Ultima Online Chess Computer and video games BitTorrent Machinima Xbox Live Counter-Strike Electronic Arts Nintendo DS America Online Abandonware Interactive Achievement Awards Quake III Arena RollerCoaster Tycoon City Building Series Railroad Tycoon Transport Tycoon TotalGaming.net MAME History of computer and video games Mario Kart DS Free game software The Sims Online Interactive fiction The Sims 2: Nightlife Poker jargon America's Army Mod (computer gaming) Scrabble Neverwinter Nights ITunes Neopets Board game Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Video game music Slot machine SimCity 4 Massively multiplayer online game Grand Theft Auto 2 Xbox Bulletin board system Gaia Online EverQuest MMORPG SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Commodore 64 Nintendo Revolution Copyleft Microsoft Office Warez Online casino Robert Maxwell Sid Meier's SimGolf ITunes Music Store Sega Dreamcast Yohoho!
