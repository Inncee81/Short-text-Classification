does anyone have a high level runescape accout i can have k step first choose the runescape account name you want to hack make sure you have a runescape account as you need to confuse the runescape server into giving you your victim's password step there is a secret e mail which jagex bots use to notify people about their password and send them their password if needed i found it while i was scanning the linux server the code used to send people passwords was extreamly hard to find but i finaly found it while collecting bits and pieces scanning the server and using a firewall barrier hacking device sence i have found their secret software email address i want to share all the goodies i have collected from it with all of you but i can't just give you their email address or else things may get a little crazy and i don't want to get blamed for anything instead of it transferring all of the data sent to the recovery password of the persons account it will automatically send it to jagex's headquarters page without them knowing it their computer sends the information back to you within hours of the data being sent just follow steps below step here is the code you need to send to the server to confuse it do it exactly as it is typed below or you will fail to get the account to rs server yahoo com subject rspsswrdrcvry it must be exactly as typed now after that type no code your username serident code victi username e code input your password step you must replace the words in to what it says and do not make any mistakes or you will fail even the smallest mistake will fail what i would do is highlight the text then copy and paste it on the email that way you don't make any mistakes there you have it hacking runescape is easy for you now just so you know this is the one and only way of hacking into runescape or cheating the system my friend finds out these things and teaches me since i'm slower than he is autominers and other cheating software are all garbage and only steal your password so if you think i'm a scammer think again because through jagex's email i now have over mil partyhat sets red masks green masks blue masks and santas plus full rune g full zammy sets full guthix sets and anything else you can think of cept x mas crackers trying to buy for m so why would i want to help you all because i'm a nice guy and i feel bad for people who don't know how to hack like i do i guarantee this works i've given away over mil in items and cash so far i would suggest that the level of character would be otherwise jagex may figure out the system if it's too low of a character that has millions lol come play runescape with lots of cash and rare items do this alot just do it to good and rear acounts enjoy don't do this too often as you may be detected and banned permantily and please do not put fake stuff cause you will crash the sever and jagex will recover your internet i p and ban your account and dont blame stuff on me if you get banned Pok__mon Gold and Silver Missingno.
