in ncaa football for the ps how can i make my qb hb or fb dive into the endzone in different ways i know to push square to do a regular dive but i want to do different types thanks in advance it all depends on where you're at when you dive and what's in front of you when you dive if you're on the and in the goal line formation you can attempt to dive over the linemen and into the endzone if you're by a pylon you can angle your dive to do a one arm extended dive and other various dives if you're standing at the goal line you can dive and he'll just get on his toes and fall into the end zone it takes experimentation dive from farther lengths out but not too far or you won't get in for a touchdown Airplane!
