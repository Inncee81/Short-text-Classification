hou do i how do i beat shadow ganon in the orcina of time on gc note i copied this from gamefaqs after the opening sequence you'll see him ride into a painting run to the center of the room and get in the bow view the view that appears when your getting ready to shoot an arrow circle around and look at each painting until you see him be careful there are two the fake one will turn around right before the end of the painting if the one you are watching creates a purple portal then shoot it with an arrow before he leaves the portal if he turns around then quickly press b to slash your sword which will quickly get you out of the bow view and then run to the edge of the platform there is still a possibility that you could get hit with his blast but you still stand a better chance then if you were in the middle after you are done search the paintings again and repeat the process until you've shot him three times with an arrow part two once you shot him three times with an arrow he'll leave his horse and float around use z targeting and stay as far away from ganon as possible if you've played a link to the past think back to the wizard and how you used the master sword to deflect his spell back at him do the same thing here when he shoots a blast at you then swing your sword when it gets near it may take a while to get your timing down but don't worry just keep practicing when you hit it back at him one of three things will happen it will hit him in which case you should run up to him and try to jump attack him ganon will hit it back in which case you should keep hitting it back at him until it hits him then refer to step one keep in mind that the more times it's hit back and forth the faster it will go and the more powerful it becomes it will totally miss him in which case just wait till he fires another blast i have had experiences be it rare where he will hit it back at me and after i hit it back at him he'll quickly move and fire another blast whatever happens just keep repeating the process of hittting it at him and jump attacking until he's dead Neopets HyperText Transfer Protocol Phishing Uniform Resource Locator Jabberwocky World Wide Web Digital pet Website All your base are belong to us PIC microcontroller The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Tic-Tac-Dough Gaia Online Domain Name System Detroit Tigers Max Payne Bob Hope Web server Anubis XRI The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Proxy server Wizards of the Coast Wait Wait...
