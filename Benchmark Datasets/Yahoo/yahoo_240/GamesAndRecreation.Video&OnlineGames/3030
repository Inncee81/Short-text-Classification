how can i play a used copy of half life on my pc when i try to activate it steam stops me and says that it is already activated on another account i have seen alot of patches online but none work for me if anyone has detailed instructions on how i can play this game that i paid for please provide me a solution steam and valve will not help me because they do not accept ebay receipts or any used receipt to get a new key this has actually happened to a friend of mine some jerk sold half life to him ebay and kept playing it himself the good thing is that since he was mailed the materials cd and book he was able to contact steam and provide proof that he had the actual physical property unfortunately i can't remember if he faxed them a copy of the cd key or mailed it to them they actually stripped the previous owner usage of the cd key activation key and gave my friend rights to use it and register it under himself instead kicking the other guy off the game hopefully you have some physical proof of ownership that you can inform them of i would just say you bought it from an online site and didn't know it was used previously activated i hope you can settle it and get to use the game you freaking paid for RollerCoaster Tycoon Roller coaster Hersheypark Paramount's Carowinds Paramount's Kings Island Knott's Berry Farm Valleyfair!
