sims downloading hair mesh okey i downloaded the mesh first then i downloaded the custom hair but every time i go to the game and open the custom hair it just show the regular hair also i met the requirements of the expansion pack also i already extracted all the files under ea games downloads the problem is the hair is just regular when it comes to custom what i mean is the hair is different my guess is i need to download the recoulour but the website does not show where to download the recoulor its really frustrating when it comes to this kind of s h i t you may need to enable custom content in the game if a window doesn't pop up right before getting to the main neighborhood select window the option will be at the bottome of the game options menu if you do this you will need to exit the game entirely then restart your game before the newly enabled custom content shows up if you did the above and have placed the downloads both the mesh and the recolor in the proper place on your computer use the downloads guide in my source for a reference the custom hair should show up also in my source is an advanced downloads guide which gives detailed instructions on how to incorporate meshes and hair recolors into your game if your custom content still does not show up then the mesh and or recolor may be bad creators of custom content are human after all good luck and happy simming The Sims 2 Windows XP Steam (content delivery) Xbox 360 Mod (computer gaming) Macromedia Flash Wget Half-Life 2 SimCity 4 Mozilla Firefox Nintendo DS RollerCoaster Tycoon Commodore 64 Opera (web browser) Minesweeper (computer game) Microsoft Windows Diablo II: Lord of Destruction BitTorrent Linux Podcasting PlayStation 3 Windows Vista Atari 8-bit family Internet Explorer Computer virus MAME Verizon Wireless Nintendo System 7 (Macintosh) Ultima Online SAS System Gradius Stardock OpenDocument MDAC Machinima Virtual memory OpenBSD Warez Battlefield 2 Nintendo Revolution Galactic Civilizations Mozilla Application Suite Macintosh Finder Mandriva Linux CPU cache Scrabble Web crawler IPod Computer and video games Doom System/36 Xbox SimCity 2000 Simulation Cheating in Counter-Strike The Sims 2: University Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis BZFlag Expansion pack MSN Messenger Manual transmission AmigaOS Game programmer Musical Instrument Digital Interface SubSpace (computer game) DVD Skype Screenshot World of Warcraft Bluetooth Chess Bish__jo game Java programming language Apple typography Warcraft III Neverwinter Nights Peer-to-peer Xbox Live PlayStation Portable Online music store LaTeX The Sims 2: Nightlife Mouse (computing) First-person shooter Unicode StarCraft Windows 2000
