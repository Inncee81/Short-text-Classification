mariokart ds is there a way to beat a blue shell if it is fired at you i have never tried it but i've heard that a bob omb's explosion can block a blue shell you just have to release it at the right time alternately driving off course so that lakitu comes to fish you out works only do this if the course has fast recoery or you're way in the lead course recovery is a little faster to get out of than a blue shell's blast something fun to do is to let people catch up a little bit and right before the blue sell hits brake gently hey will either get caught in the explosion or swerve off course giving you another shot at the lead Pok__mon types Rustboro City May (Pok__mon) Pok__mon evolution Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon Mysterious Dungeon Bulbasaur Mudkip Pok__mon: Jirachi Wishmaker Pok__mon Crystal Magical Pok__mon Journey Pok__mon Trading Card Game Snubbull Brock (Pok__mon) Cyndaquil Raichu Breloom Shedinja Pok__mon Yellow Ralts Wailord Meganium Torchic Shroomish Wailmer Kecleon Aggron Chikorita Spheal Sableye Pok__mon Red and Blue Lileep Corphish Gardevoir Marshtomp Umbreon Metang Eevee Jigglypuff Pok__mon Snap Omastar Togepi Max (Pok__mon) Typhlosion Pok__mon Colosseum Charmander Kabutops Cinnabar Island Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Heroes Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Loudred Mightyena Pok__mon Chronicles Flygon Azumarill Skarmory Squirtle Cradily Treecko Kirlia Pok__mon: The Movie 2000 Nincada Trapinch Omanyte Ivysaur Swinub Bagon Absol Slakoth Whismur Mawile Team Aqua Cubone Espeon Lotad Scyther Quilava Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Legendary Pok__mon Meditite Sudowoodo Pok__dex Slaking Latios Azurill Kabuto Totodile Formula 3000 Kabuto (Pok__mon) Claire Trevor Snorunt Trevor Linden Sealeo New York Islanders Wurmple Horseshoe crab
