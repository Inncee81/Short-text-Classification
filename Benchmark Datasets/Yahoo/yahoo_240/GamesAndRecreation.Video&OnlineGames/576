whyy does this happen ok well i was wondering when im playing a game on my pc for example the sims i cant enjoy playing that game cause its slooww it aint fast or anything and it pisses me off anybody know why your pc most likely can't handle the graphics check to make sure everything meets the minimum requirements for that game you probably need to upgrade your graphics card ram processor or maybe even your entire computer also check that your graphics drivers are up to date go to the website for your graphics card and download and install the latest driver you can also try messing with the graphics settings turn everything down to low and see if performance improves then turn things back on one by one to see what your computer can handle IBM PC compatible Windows XP Windows 2000 The Sims 2 Modem Windows Vista Mac OS X CPU cache PlayStation 3 Linux ATI Technologies CPU design MAME Atari ST History of Microsoft Windows Game Boy Advance Embedded system Computer and video games Radeon Game programming ZX Spectrum Atari 8-bit family DirectX Commodore 128 RISC Apple IIGS Linux kernel Computer and video game genres Grand Prix Legends Mandriva Linux Counter-Strike First-person shooter Windows 3.x Cheating in Counter-Strike PlayStation 2 Personal computer PC Engine History of operating systems 3dfx Knoppix Apple II family Diablo (computer game) Microsoft Windows Star Trek Customizable Card Game 64-bit History of computer and video games Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Apple Macintosh Sinclair ZX81 Overclocking Original Amiga chipset Object Desktop Redundant array of independent disks Computer bus Poker jargon PlayStation Portable Mac OS X v10.4 FIFA Series Doom 3 System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Server 2003 Visual Basic Graphics card Sim racing Timeline of computing 1990-forward Nintendo Revolution A600 Steam (content delivery) Gran Turismo (game) Betting (poker) Motorola 68000 AmigaOS IMac TRS-80 Color Computer Apple Newton NVIDIA Graphics processing unit Mainframe computer X86 Need for Speed Commodore 64 Bluetooth Java programming language NX bit MIPS architecture Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond) Blackjack Stars!
