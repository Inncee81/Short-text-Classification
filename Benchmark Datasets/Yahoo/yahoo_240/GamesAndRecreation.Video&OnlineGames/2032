guild wars free trial um im trying to play the guild wars free trial but i cant for a stupid reason i dont know where the access key is on the web page can someone help me hello i do not believe that arena net just posts up trial access keys on their website the closest thing i found was the option download the game client directly from their website link posted in sources and then add an access key that you already have i do know that access keys for trial accounts come with the main game purchase so many people who buy the main game end up with extra trial access keys there are many message boards online with people giving out keys what i would suggest is to either find a friend who already has the game with an extra access key or to look online at gw message boards for an extra one i hope that helps you MMORPG Warcraft Universe Computer and video game genres Blizzard Entertainment Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans Orc (Warcraft) Computer role-playing game Warcraft Computer and video games Warcraft III Platform game Massively multiplayer online game Sonic Adventure Role-playing game Human (Warcraft) Thrall (Warcraft) The Legend of Zelda series World of Warcraft Battle.net Warcraft II Jurassic Park (video game) Xbox Live Wario PvP Super Mario World Final Fantasy VI Tauren Spider-Man (games) .hack//SIGN EverQuest II Pure Pwnage Dizzy series Command & Conquer: Generals Yu-Gi-Oh!
