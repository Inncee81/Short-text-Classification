heres a question for all people who play sims pets hey i really want to get my sim to turn into a werewolf but i cant seem to get the wolf to bit do you know how high of a relationship you have to have with a wolf befor they bite your sim ive had a wolf visit my property times now and i tried to get my sim to be really nice to it and it did but the wolf just wont bite her am i doing something wrong well first of all it can't just be any wolf it ha to be the one with the glowing yellow eyes all the other wolves are just wolves let it be noted that there are actually a few wolves with glowing eyes and any one of them can bite you so next time a wolf with glowing eyes shows up have one of your sims interact with it you need to get their relationship pretty high so it could take several encounters to get it to bite you patience is very important here it may seem like the wolf will never bite you but it will eventually just keep interacting with it even if their relationship is at the top eventually it will work alternatively there is a game mod available on modthesims that makes it possible to turn a sim into a werewolf cure them by clicking on them and choosing an action from the pie menu it's very cool and it does satisfy werewolf related wants Gmail E-mail Hotmail Webmail Mozilla Thunderbird Viral marketing Internet fraud Sender Policy Framework E-mail spam Yahoo!
