whats a gameshark where do you get one i have heard about gamesharks but i don't have a clue what they are i know you can do something with your ds its also called a action replay isn't it gameshark devices for specific consoles and or handheld game systems were discontinued so far i've only seen action replay and codebreaker cheat game devices selling out in stores a lot of people had problem issues using gameshark because gameshark's cheat device seemed to be in its early stage of cheating your way into games you want to beat i bought a couple times for my ps and my gameboy color from gameshark and each failed and didn't last long they don't mess up your game if you don't know how to work and use the gameshark device that's probably why people mess up their games that way i also used to have a gameshark cd for ps and that didn't last a month i wasted a lot of money on gameshark but not too much action replay seemed to be in good terms so far i've only used codebreaker for the ps no cheat device required to use just a simple codebreaker cd and your ps memory card i have the codebreaker cd for two years now and so far nothing messed up my saved games or anything gameshark are discountinued and they're not action replay action replay co existed with gameshark around the start of the year as far as i know i recommend using codebreaker the ps version haven't failed for two years so forth and so on i haven't tried the other available codebreaker for a specific console but there is nintendo ds version of a codebreaker check out the site http www codebreaker com Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon (video games) Groudon Pok__mon Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Pok__mon (anime) Mewtwo Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Emerald Softball Pok__mon Crystal Vegeta Snorlax Naruto jutsu Smeargle Celebi Teddiursa Pok__mon Colosseum Team Rocket Scyther Volleyball Ursaring Jynx (Pok__mon) Power Rangers: SPD Shaggy dog story Tracey Sketchit Pok__mon Yellow One Life to Live Ralts Baseball Aladdin (1992 film) Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Pok__mon move Missingno.
