this is a serious question is it cheating if u are playing mario cart on game cube the tv screen is split into sections if i look down to aim shooting something behind me and hit the person behind me my dude says if i look at his screen its cheating i call it being skilled which is it look i play games that are also split and it is a golden rule not to cheat and look at the other persons screen but in saying that its very hard not to when they are right together i would keep playing the game the way that you do just dont look on perpous just to get ahead in the game if you need to look at the other persons screen to win then you just arent that good so you might need more practice i dont think your cheating if you happen to look down because your aiming at something behind you so i would say that its just skill an the other guy needs to man up Volleyball Cheating in poker Game Boy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Super Mario Bros.
