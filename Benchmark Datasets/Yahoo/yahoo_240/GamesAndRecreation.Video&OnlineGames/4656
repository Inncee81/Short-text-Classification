how do you get a canoe for psp final fantasy i i've already got the earth crystal and am wondering what is next and where do i get the canoe so i can go across the river awesome that was alot of help i feel kinda dumb though cause i didnt realize there were sages in that town lol where is the ice cave btw i've never played the psp version but i hope it's the same as every other version if you climb in your boat and sail directly west of the earth cave eventually you'll wrap around the map and end up on the east side farther south than where you'll end up you'll see a dock that's near a lake shaped like a cresent moon walk to the town in the middle of this lake in the town go to the north east corner and follow a wooded path to find a circle of sages one of these wise men will give you the canoe at this point you can go for the fire cave or you can skip it for now to go to the ice cave which will snag you the levistone which powers the airship which gets you to the northern half of the world and aims you at the transformation quest given by the dragons good luck Missingno.
