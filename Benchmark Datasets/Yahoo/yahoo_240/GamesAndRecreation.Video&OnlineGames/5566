on the pursuit game i need help it says i need more item but i can't find it hurry and answer if you are still in the apartment at the very beginning of the game you need six items before you can leave some of the items i can understand like the gun though you never use it the the light bulb the knife and the banana but why do you need the birthday note and who in their right minds would bring their teddy bear though the bear is used later in the game so those are the six items hope this helped Missingno.
