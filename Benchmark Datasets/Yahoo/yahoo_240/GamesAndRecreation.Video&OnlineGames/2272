fighting game fans what do you prefer d or d personally i like d style i like some d fighters but for some reason i like the moves and quick pace and intensity used in capcom fighting games and snk fighting games of course there are some d fighters that i do like dead or alive and tekken as well as virtua fighter i don't think this should be in the same category but it is in d and a fighting game a different kind though but def jam fight for ny is a really good fighting game i just hope the makers of that game do another game with that engine give me your input has any of you guys ever played fighting games like thrill kill or wu tang shaolin style it maybe in the same style as tekken in terms of being in d and control scheme but you don't jump in those games d fighting is the way to play in my opinion i've just always preferred the simple way of up down left and right rather than rotating across the stage plus my fighting game of choice wouldn't work if it were d you'd be surprised how deep the game of smash brothers gets when you're playing against the best in the game in my opinion it's by far the most technical of the fighting game genre not to mention the necessity to be able to learn and react to a new opponents fighting style Alakazam Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Missingno.
