mortal kombat shaolin monks question in ko op mode with sub zero and scorpion when you are in the living forest and after you get all the three tree hints and then you go into the room that has clay soldiers coming at you really fast how do you destroy them because each time me and my brother try to destroy those things the moment we get into that room raiden tells us to press l fatality stunner for some reason and then we cant use our other buttons such as triangle and square but we can use circle but only with r and r with circle is not an attack on clay soldiers we read a guide from ign com and it said to use multi directional attacks but we cant even use square which is the attack button so if anyone can help with that part that would be nice the one with the best answer gets points take a hike dejavu you have no business answering questions like this unless you know the answer don't listen to that guy we are all gamers here and there i may be able to help my highest standards are in mortal kombat shaolin monks raiden has never said that to me before but it sounds to me like something is wrong with your game if raiden is asking you to press l don't if you are talking about the clay soldiers that come out of the walls in the living forest on your way to fight reptile then you have to be quick all you got to do is study which ways they come out and hit them in the multiple directions and they get harder as they go but trust me there are only three sets of the soldiers you must break but after beating that you should be able to unlock brutalities in which you and your brother will be faced by putrid corpses and one must fill up the fatality bar to level three to do a brutality and that is when you use the stunner but if what you are saying is true then something doesn't sound right try cleaning your game or your ps 's laser lense but do not touch it use a q tip or cotton swob i use rubbing alcohol when cleaning my video games it helps especially when there are finger prints smudges and such there is even something called a scratch remover that you can buy to help if there are tons of scratches RuneScape RuneScape cheats RuneScape Random Events RuneScape Mini-Games RuneScape skills RuneScape locations RuneScape quests RuneScape dungeons RuneScape economy RuneScape slang and terminology E-mail Wheel of Fortune Divorce Countdown (game show) Phishing Shogi Gmail Google Anonymous remailer Animal Crossing Castle Wars MMORPG Fibromyalgia Criticism of Prem Rawat Internet forum Ford GT40 RuneScape runes Password Match Game King of Town Gospel of Thomas Continental Basketball Association Licensed to Ill Computer and video game genres The writing of Principia Mathematica National Certificate of Educational Achievement Foodborne illness Newbie Anselm of Canterbury Aisha Sexual orientation RuneScape gods Electronic mailing list Succession to Muhammad Credit card Scrabble Dog agility Internet troll Webmail F.
