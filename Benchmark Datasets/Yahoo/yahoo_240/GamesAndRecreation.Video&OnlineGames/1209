who knows how to use dosbox to play downloaded games like oregon trail i already downloaded the game and i downloaded the newest version of dosbox i mounted my c drive but i cant figure out what to do next with it for it to let me play it from what you described you mounted oregon trail to your c drive also right ok after mounting your c drive you need to find the oregon trail directory at the c prompt type in dir w without the quotes and hit enter this will give you a list of all of the directories on your c drive find the one for the oregon trail for example oregon and type cd oregon and hit enter that should put you into the oregon directory remember i'm only using oregon as an example the oregon trail directory may be different while still in the oregon trail directory type in dir w again without the quotes look for the exe file for example ot exe type in the name of the exe file and it should load i hope this helps Windows 2000 DOS Windows registry Files-11 COM file File system Blue screen of death Btrieve ITunes LiteStep MegaMan Battle Network Microsoft .NET Ls Filename extension Cmd.exe Oregon Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Metadata Windows API Mozilla Firefox Library (computer science) Portland, Oregon Symbian OS HTML element PHP NTFS Steam (content delivery) Deir Yassin massacre Windows 3.x Commodore DOS FreeDOS Commodore 64 Barack Obama The Oregon Trail (computer game) Computer virus NTFS junction point MegaMan NT Warrior Pump It Up MSH (shell) 1957 World Series AmigaOS Metropolitan Area Express (Portland, Oregon) Podcasting Windows XP BitTorrent TOPS-20 IPod Bulletin board system DIGITAL Command Language Oregon Highway 213 ZX Spectrum Computer file .NET assemblies Mandriva Linux Kansas Website Windows 1.0 Perl PlayStation Portable BZFlag Gnutella File Allocation Table Norton Utilities Partition (computing) Forth programming language MS-DOS Knoppix Uniform Resource Locator Computer security EMule Oregon Trail Emacs Hello world program DOSBox American Old West Ebook Trojan horse (computing) Mega Man SonicStage Macintosh Finder Linux Dynamic-Link Library Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Minesweeper (computer game) QBasic Lincoln Highway Rootkit Table tennis Freeware Vertical service code Wget SubSpace (computer game) Crater Lake National Park OS-9 Batch file U.S. Highway 101 System 7 (Macintosh) We Belong Together Washington
