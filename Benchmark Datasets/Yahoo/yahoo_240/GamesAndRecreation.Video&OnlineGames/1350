roller coaster tycoon problem with building since yesterday i have had a problem with building buildings and scenery the problem is you know you can hold down 'shift' to change the height of things the item i want to build is slightly elevated off the ground when i use 'shift' to set it to the correct height it flashes red it wont let me build it there what is going on mine used to do that try to do it the long way and if you still can't do it change the point of view if you can't see anything in the way you may have to just eat the loss and delete everything and level the ground i had to do that a few times but after two or three rides everything went back to normal hope that helps RollerCoaster Tycoon Cedar Point Space Mountain Roller coaster Rock 'n' Roller Coaster View camera Six Flags Over Texas Millennium Force Magic Kingdom Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Aerosmith Equine conformation Parallax Mario Anchor Mouse (computing) Lake District Alton Towers Dog agility Diablo II Determinism Neopets Launched roller coaster Knott's Berry Farm Traffic light Valleyfair!
