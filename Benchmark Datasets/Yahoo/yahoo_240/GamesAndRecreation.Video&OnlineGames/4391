pokemon question i'd like to know i kinda understand ev's but what are iv's the better the explanation the more chance you will get the best answer ohkay here it is this took me a while to get my head around and i'll explain it the best i can every pokemon has these things called ivs they are unique for each pokemon it's like their dna these ivs say just how strong that pokemon can get in their statistics atk def sp atk sp def spd hp these ivs are a number between that is different for each and every pokemon each pokemon has ivs one for each stat category all of which are random now this is where iv's make a big difference at lvl max stats suppose that there are alakazams alakazam timid nature speed iv is ev trained in speed points speed is alakazam timid nature speed iv is ev trained in speed points speed is alakazam timid nature speed iv is ev trained in speed points speed is maximum for alakazam the iv is different for each of the and it makes a big difference of speed points the simplest way i can explain it is iv's are set in each pokemon they don't ever change what they do is set a limit on how good a pokemon can be in any stat category it's rare to get a pokemon with iv points in one category its almost impossible to get a pokemon with iv points in every category unless you use action replay i hope this helps you use the link that the rd guy said to find your ivs for any pokemon but it's more accurate the higher the lvl they are DVD Laserdisc Blu-ray Disc Gramophone record DualDisc Video game music Compact disc Movie projector Phonograph Modchip PlayStation 2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System System/36 Sega Dreamcast Universal Media Disc Visual Basic Copy Control Nintendo GameCube Enterprise content management Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 MAME System/34 Console game Nintendo Revolution The Sims 2 Blue screen of death Nintendo Entertainment System Floppy disk Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Game programming Atari 8-bit family Apollo 8 Chrono Trigger Final Fantasy VI Laser Aliens versus Predator (computer game) Nintendo Commodore 64 Carburetor Hard disk RISC PlayStation Portable Starsiege: Tribes Magneto-optical drive ZX Spectrum Nintendo 64 Sega Saturn MiniDisc Disc jockey Blizzard Entertainment IBM 1620 Pop'n Music Disc brake Electricity meter Super Audio CD Tower of Hanoi Animal Crossing GunBound CD-R Acne Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Sega Acorn Electron Atari Federal Standard 1037C Commodore DOS Halo 2 PlayStation (original) CPU design Multiplayer Quake II IBM PC compatible Volleyball Sega CD ROM image Pok__mon Colosseum CPU cache CD-ROM Final Fantasy IX Half-Life 2 Cartridge (electronics) Amstrad CPC DVD-R EXpanded MultiPlayer Computer virus Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tag Doom Gran Turismo (game) Team Fortress Classic Scientology beliefs and practices Phonograph cylinder Audiophile The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Chess terminology Ultimate (sport) Holography Cheating in Counter-Strike
