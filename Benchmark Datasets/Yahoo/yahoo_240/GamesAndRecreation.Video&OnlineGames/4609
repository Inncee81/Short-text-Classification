do you play your videogames in high definition if yes do you play in p i or p p progressive scan currently i'm not playing my console games in high def i think one of the mistakes that sony and microsoft made in the design of the ps and xbox respectively is overestimating the amount of homes that have hdtv's i think the next wave of consoles would have been bettered suited for high def gaming since more homes will have hdtv's in the next to years the prices for hdtv's are still to high for the average consumer to afford as are the ps and xbox one could easily spend roughly between to just to play their ps or xbox games in high def if they don't already own an hdtv since there's not an overwhelming number of homes with hdtv''s sony and microsoft betted the farm in designing their next next gen consoles strictly with high def in mind as we've seen the sales for both of these consoles have tapered off while nintendo's wii is selling at a brisk pace Universal Serial Bus Xbox Xbox 360 GeForce 6 Series Nintendo Revolution Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo DS Atari 2600 IPod Sega Saturn Memory card USB flash drive Nintendo Gold standard Supply and demand Microeconomics Serial ATA Video game publisher N-Gage Australian dollar Bond Inflation Deflation (economics) Joystick Nintendo 64 Anastacia (singer) Nintendo GameCube Monopoly (game) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Video game crash of 1983 Timeline of computing 1990-forward D-subminiature Atari Blockbuster Video ATI Technologies Commodore International Game Boy Apple Macintosh PowerPC Softmodem Game Boy Advance Commodore 64 IBook Gross domestic product Sound card East Germany Shill Externality Super Mario 128 DVD ZigBee IMac Super Nintendo Entertainment System Cadel Evans GamePark Price PC Engine Mario Suggested retail price Laptop Digital photography Economics Atari 8-bit family Australian cricket team Retailer ZX Spectrum 2002 Tour de France RS-232 Keynesian economics Power Mac G4 Cube Ownership Pound sterling Shopping Game port Game Boy Advance SP 2000 Australian Grand Prix SCART Handheld game console Barcode reader Call option World Cricket Tsunami Appeal Computer and video games FireWire Dollar store PlayStation Portable Tungsten Handheld Anarchism and capitalism Animal Crossing Rare (video game company) MIPS architecture Nintendo Virtual Boy Labor theory of value Opportunity cost Supply-side economics WarioWare: Touched!
