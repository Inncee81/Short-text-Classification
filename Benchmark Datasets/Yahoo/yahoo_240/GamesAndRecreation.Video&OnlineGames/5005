is there a way to change the button configuration on a psp a few months ago my o button fell off my psp and was lost forever don't ask me how it happened i've been playing without the button with no problem since then but just yesterday the button completely died on me i was wondering if there was a way to change the button configuration so as to switch the o button with one that is less used such as the select button any help would be greatly appreciated ps any possible way to do this would be appreciated whether through registry hacks homebrew or the actual psp i know that the o and x buttons can be switched but unfortunately both are used frequently i'm very sorry but currently there is no way to change the button config of the psp unless you wanna switch your o with your x then use pspset only for firmware Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Gmail Missingno.
