sims games out of all the sims game which one is the most fun and family friendly i'm looking for rated e but if one is rated t and not that bad thats fine i would say that the original sim games which the sims was based upon by maxis are probably the most family oriented of all the sim games there's simfarm simtown simtunes sim theme park simsafari sim city sid meier's sim golf and a whole score of other sim games created by maxis these original sim games were created the earliest being sim earth to sim city all with the rating of e the majority of these older sim games usually cannot be found in stores like wal mart so you'd probably have to purchase it online like on amazon com or ebay or at a second hand type store such as half price books or gamestop maxis was later purchased by ea games and that's where the sims comes in the sims is a simulation or god game and you can make the characters you create do pretty much anything that being said some of the things that your sims can do especially in the sims with the ability to woohoo in bed the make out interaction or some the romance sim aspiration's goals are inappropriate for children the sims is probably more risqu than the sims but they both have mild sexual content innuendos although there is no way to totally eliminate this from your game you can avoid it by having your sims abstain from having a bunch of romantic interactions or having sims do nothing in bed but sleep for most children the sims or sims shouldn't be a problem if they're older children that are more prone to curiosity and experimentation you may need to watch and supervise occasionally as to be sure that they don't have their sims do anything dirty the best child friendly expansion pack for the sims would probably be pets although you need the sims in order to play The Sims 2 Maxis SimCity Electronic Arts SimCity 4 Will Wright Video game controversy Bish__jo game Motion picture rating system Machinima Computer and video game genres Sid Meier's SimGolf SimCity 2000 Mod (computer gaming) The Sims 2: University Neopets Child sexuality Normal distribution Renai game EverQuest Virtual economy Personal computer game Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Sims Online Flight simulator Object-oriented programming ELO rating system Sim racing Final Fantasy XI Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Rise of Nations SimTown Don Daglow Interactive fiction Magic: The Gathering Civilization III Simulation Expansion pack Pinball History of computer and video games Combat flight simulator Beavis and Butt-head Entertainment Software Rating Board Teresa Heinz Kerry Pornography SimAnt Diablo II Grand Theft Auto III Theory of conduct Simming Jack Thompson Nintendo DS PlayStation 2 Advanced Squad Leader Censorship in Australia Star Trek Customizable Card Game SimCity 3000 Railroad Tycoon Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Animal Crossing Sant Thakar Singh Ultima Online Streets of SimCity Society and Star Trek Squad Leader Megatokyo Computer role-playing game Eric Cartman RollerCoaster Tycoon Collectible card game Friends The Sims: Superstar Hot Coffee mod Avenue Q Dead or Alive (video game) N-Gage Game programming World of Warcraft Norway national football team Hentai The Brady Bunch City of Heroes MMORPG Sid Meier's Pirates!
