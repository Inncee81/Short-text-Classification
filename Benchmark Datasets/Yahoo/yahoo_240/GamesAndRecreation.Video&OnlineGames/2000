does anybody like hospital tycoon i bought it today and really love it it's the first game i've bought in many months cos there's just been nothing that i liked i like the sims and settler games if anybody else has it i'd like to hear what they think about it i believe this is being compared to theme hospital and it is not as good in the sense that there's no micromanagement i prefer this tho after a long day at work i want to relax not think too hard i have not played ht but when i saw it i was reminded of a really old game i have and love theme hospital i like simulation games and this one was always funny and challenging i might consider getting ht but right now i think i'll go play my old theme hospital Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Yu-Gi-Oh!
