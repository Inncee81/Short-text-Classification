in world of warcraft how hard is it to find groups being a holy priest i know about million people are level but is it late if i start from level holy priest my main is a hunter and as such i can never find a group because everyone and their brother is a hunter at least on my sever so my guild was low on healers so i rolled a priest i now am on my priest times more then my hunter and i only do instances with my priest because he is holy so you will never have any trouble finding a group as a priest whether you only want to run in guild or if you want to pug a group just look in the lfg channel and you can find one in about seconds everyone needs healers and not a lot of people like to play them for a long period of time because the job is not the most fun and you have a lot of responsibility to keep the group alive so yes you will always find a group as a priest if you are decent at healing but that class is not for everyone RuneScape cheats The Apprentice 2 MMORPG Gaia Online Auction Retailer Arbitrage Mutual fund Mortgage Microeconomics Wal-Mart FairTax Online shop Gmail Donald Trump RuneScape economy PE ratio Monetary policy Supply and demand Commodity Deflation (economics) $ale of the Century Sears Holdings Corporation LiveJournal Loss leader Viva La Bam Surplus value Tax Estoppel Privatization Price discrimination Tariff Textbook Parallel import Bulk vending Capital accumulation Health insurance MapleStory Short selling The Long Tail Danny Phantom (character) Animal Crossing Canadian and American economies compared Airline Digital photography Xanga Islamic banking RuneScape slang and terminology Bond BASIC programming language Organic food Tesco Rational pricing Investment bank Food and Drug Administration Predatory lending Coin collecting Free trade Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Balassa-Samuelson effect Nintendo DS User (computing) Illegal drug trade MOS Technology Bedroom community Final Fantasy XI Prices of production Value added tax Uniform Resource Locator Evil Amway Newstead Abbey Ident Economic shortage Katamari Damacy Ultima Online Locomotive Progressive tax Inflation Something Awful Forums Flat tax Melissa worm Baseball Stars Ragnarok Online Giffen good Mastertronic Contract Economy of Russia Capitalism Option Ives Manufacturing Company Copyleft Card Sharks Seymour Cray White flight Topps Union Pacific Railroad Inventory Technical analysis
