mame emulator that can play swt im looking for an emulator that cen play star wars trilogy anyone know one all variations of mame at least up have support for star wars trilogy however there are likely a few issues to deal with there are copyright issues when playing roms with an emulator like mame so i cannot give you any links to rom sites since the arcade game was released in it's likely that the game uses a cd or a hard drive this will require you to obtain the disk image for the game as well as the rom files most rom sites don't carry disk images due to their size mb to gb which makes it harder to get the game working since the game probably runs in d you'll need a top of the line pc or a supercomputer class pc to properly emulate it something around the lines of ghz to get a fair frame rate something around ghz to make it really playable again mame is dedicated to accuracy of the machines it emulates not speed therefore the newer the game is the more processing power you'll need to properly emulate everything i'm sorry that i cannot assist you further on this PlayStation Portable PHP Ajax (programming) PlayStation 3 Nintendo DS Commodore 64 Wireless Application Protocol Website Video game music BitTorrent Xbox Apache HTTP Server Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Sony Computer Entertainment HyperText Transfer Protocol Wget History of computer and video games Namco Museum WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Internet Linux World Wide Web Action Replay Handheld game console Mozilla Firefox Tomb Raider N-Gage User agent CPAN Square Enix Computer and video games April 1, 2005 Console emulator Neopets Java programming language Lemmings (computer game) Warez Grand Theft Auto (series) Xbox 360 Need for Speed Console wars Twisted Metal Spyware Nintendo Entertainment System PHP-Nuke PlayStation (original) Uniform Resource Locator Warcraft II Newgrounds Gmail The Sims Ridge Racer Hot Shots Golf (series) Open Database Connectivity ZX Spectrum Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Homebrew (video games) Phishing IBM PC compatible Microsoft Final Fantasy VII Web server Football Manager Tekken Sega Quake III Arena GameFAQs WWE SmackDown!
