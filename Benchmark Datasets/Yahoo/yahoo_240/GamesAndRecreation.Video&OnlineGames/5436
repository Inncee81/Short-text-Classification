how do i install and run the original diablo for mac on my macbook pro with osx do i need a specific patch or an emulator or something it's an original copy of the first diablo game brand new just opened for the mac and my mac says i can't install or run it unfortunately i don't think it's possible for you to run it here's the deal diablo was written in for os or later in apple put out os which was based on unix it was ridiculously different from a programming standpoint from os and earlier to let apps written for os and earlier apple included classic mode in os in apple switched from powerpc processors to intel processors and decided not to rewrite classic mode for the intel systems thus you cannot run programs that were only written for os or earlier on intel macs like the mac book pro i believe that the oldest blizzard game compatible with current macs is starcraft since blizzard wrote a patch to make it run natively on os x sorry but d is just too old d still works fine though Computer and video games __on Flux Sunni Islam Nicene Creed Winter Olympic Games Regional lockout Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Michelle Kwan Olympic Games 1988 Winter Olympics 1960 Winter Olympics Video game console World Figure Skating Championships 1994 Winter Olympics Roller skating Harrowing of Hell Sega Counter-Strike Counter-Strike maps Figure skating Roller hockey IGN Lu Chen Graydon Creed Handheld game console Spider-Man (games) Boba Fett Bally Streets of Rage Patrick Roy Yuka Sato Electronic Arts Christian Miniature figure Nolan Bushnell International Skating Union 1924 Winter Olympics Rush (video game series) Demoscene Short track speed skating Bebop and Rocksteady 2004-05 NHL lockout Sport Trinity 720 Degrees Ice hockey Creed (band) Hunter: The Reckoning Mary, the mother of Jesus BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Ursarkar E.
