why do people call runescape gay i play runescape but when i tell people about it they mostly say that game is so gay why is that most people who don't favor runescape feel it is too elaborate of a game they can't handle the riddles puzzles and intricate gameplay of course those people won' admit it so instead they choose to insult the graphics and say it is gay those same people also prefer other online games that are centered on combat the fact that rs is't based solely on fighting makes runescape too complicated for them and they get frustrated when they fail to do well in the time they try to play rs so they go back to their other online games where they can do nothing but run around and fight people and not have to worry about putting any actual thought into their gameplay keep playing runescape it is an ever expanding game and always has something to do RuneScape Random Events RuneScape weapons RuneScape skills Computer and video game genres RuneScape Mini-Games RuneScape quests Massively multiplayer online game Castle Wars RuneScape cheats RuneScape locations Computer role-playing game RuneScape slang and terminology Castlevania: Circle of the Moon GunBound RuneScape gods Betting (poker) Poker jargon Little Britain Backgammon MapleStory Tag Mithril Role-playing Go ranks and ratings Professional wrestling match types Cribbage Dice Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Natural Selection (computer game) Kalphite Queen Newbie Lookin' Through the Windows Protoss Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Conker's Bad Fur Day RuneScape dungeons The Apprentice 3 Homestar Runner Double Dragon Donkey Kong 64 Final Fantasy magic Minesweeper (computer game) Counter-Strike Wild ARMs 2 Adamantium Tank Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Slashdot trolling phenomena Diablo (computer game) Champions of Norrath Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
