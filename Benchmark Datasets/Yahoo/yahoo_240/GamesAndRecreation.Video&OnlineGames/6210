pokemon diamond ev points rare candy question i have heard that people don't like using rare candies because it doesnt give them as much stats those extra stats that you get without rare candies are ev points right so right after i finish ev training all points can i keep using all my rare candies will i gain the extra points from ev training my ninetails just finished ev training it's level i hard that the full effects of ev trianing don't take place until you reach level will rare candies effect the full effects at level will training to on wild pokemon be any different than getting to with rare candies thanks everyone d i read somewhere that rare candies are fine when your fully ev trained does 'fully' ev trained mean that you hit evs or does it mean that all extra ev stat points have been added to the pokemon u can gain up to evs for each stat but usually u want to gain for every stat because isnt divisible by then u can use the extra for another stat well and the extra is just waste after u have fully ev trained u can rare candy away without damaging their stats in any way Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi Rayman Nintendo DS Dragon Ball Z Rayman 2 Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2 Video game character Piccolo Junior Saga Gogeta Nintendo GameCube The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Tenkaichi Budokai Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Nintendo Ubisoft Sonic the Hedgehog Resident Evil 4 Resident Evil Mario Player's Choice Resident Evil 3: Nemesis Resident Evil 2 The Legend of Zelda series Rayman series Resident Evil Code: Veronica Super Mario 64 Wario Donkey Kong 64 Cel-shaded animation Resident Evil (video game) Battletoads Rayman 3 Ganon Resident Evil 0 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Nintendo 64 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Toad (Nintendo) Super Mario 128 Ninja Gaiden Super Mario remake series Super Mario Bros.
