ps or xbox i currently own both systems and prefer the xbox alot more then the ps there just aren't enough games for the ps and graphics wise the xbox holds its own against the playstations graphics what do you think xbox no question the costs less than the ps and that alone makes the better plus the has tons more games than the ps and i don't know about you but i don't like to only be able to play a few games over and over again while waiting for sony to take forever to come out with more you are absolutely right about the graphics is the best and ps doesn't come close and the best reason to me why the is better is that microsoft has the online gaming perfected sony has a long way to go before they can equal the Steam (content delivery) Counter-Strike Opera (web browser) Skype IBM PC compatible Cheating in Counter-Strike Warez Game programming Timeline of computing 1990-forward MSN Messenger Object Desktop Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Pretty Good Privacy Lineage II Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gmail ZX Spectrum Darwinia (computer game) Extreme Programming Google Talk Windows Vista TotalGaming.net BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Uru: Ages Beyond Myst Sonic the Hedgehog 2 PlayStation 3 Commodore 64 Gaia Online MAME Football Manager MapleStory The Matrix Online Software testing GunZ The Duel OpenOffice.org Game demo Chrono Trigger Star Trek Customizable Card Game Nine Inch Nails Arianne Computer and video games RollerCoaster Tycoon Championship Manager Plasma stability Ecco the Dolphin Betting (poker) Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Microsoft .NET Unreal Tournament 2004 Quantum computer Windows XP FIFA Series X Window System Gran Turismo (game) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Flight Unlimited Amiga Resident Evil (video game) Super Mario 128 American football Insulin N-Gage SubSpace (computer game) Rare (video game company) Far Cry Unreal Tournament 2003 Patch (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis BitTorrent WebObjects MSH (shell) PONG Ultima Online The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Quake III Arena Asthma Digital rights management Nintendo DS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Spyware Wine (software) Copy protection Brian Close Curry-Howard Verizon Wireless HyperCard Microsoft Test Drive (video game) NeXT World of Warcraft Abandonware Nintendo Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer Alpha Centauri Need for Speed Deadly Rooms of Death
