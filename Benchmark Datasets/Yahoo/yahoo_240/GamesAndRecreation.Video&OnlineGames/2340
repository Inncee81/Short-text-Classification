why are all the gts offers stupid diamond pearl seriously o o i've been looking and looking for some decent trades and nothing p how come most not all traders from japan have so really messed up offers is it on purpose or what o o pfffft its annoying ahhh typo third sentence i meant some not so they are most likely trying to clone their pokemon they don't want people to take them so they put up offers that people can't reach or are really hard to reach like a lvl torchic when i clone i ask for a lvl and under arceus that can only be obtained by hacking the gts is not only a place to trade pokemon but it has now become a place to clone them as well Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Blood on the Tracks Dance Dance Revolution The Cure Bomberman Guilty Gear Pop'n Music Embedded system Super Mario Bros.
