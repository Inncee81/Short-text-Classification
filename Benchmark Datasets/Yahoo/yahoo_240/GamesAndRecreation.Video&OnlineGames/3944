diff between pacman ms pacman really by wayne campbell wayne's world so what is the diff to u which is better fav these games are completely different in pac man the maze is always the same the fruit appears in the middle of the maze after a set amount of pac dots are eaten and there are select patterns that can pass each level in ms pac man the mazes change every few levels ms pac man is slower the ghosts are slightly more intelligent the fruit bounces around the levels and yes ms pac man wears a bow i think both are great games with completely different strategies on a side note the shape of pac man was actually created while the development team was at a pizza parlor they didn't know what shape to use for the hero looked down and saw the shape of a pizza with one slice missing thus pac man was born Perseus God of War Athena RX-78 mobile suit series Gorgon Waking the Dragons The Keeper of Traken Age of Mythology Technology in the Stargate universe Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure Andromeda (TV series) Tales of Symphonia Combine (Half-Life 2) Great Seal of the United States Terran (StarCraft) Jean Charles de Menezes Unreal Covenant Elite Cosmic Era locations Glaucoma Star Wars: Battlefront Team Fortress Classic Weapons of Star Trek Gradius Lightsaber combat Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Shinn Asuka Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Romulus and Remus Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Moblin Sin City Raffles Institution Ultraviolet Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Wild ARMs 2 Universal Century Technology Minor vehicles in Star Wars Cobra Commander Johnny Cage X-ray Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters British coin Guinea Welding The Covenant GunBound Weebl and Bob Heraldry Clash of the Titans Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
