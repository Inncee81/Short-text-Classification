ps or xbox yo i need to know which one is better i have a ps rite now but i want a elite please explain to my bro which system n be honest i want a systen that wil last long i think the ps is the best system out of any the three game systems because of a free online which is also improving quite a bit b is somewhat cheaper than the xbox ps xbox gb ps xbox elite hdmi slot free hdmi slot only with elite wifi free wifi rechargeable controllers free recharge kit online free online a year blu ray player free hddvd player total total you might not use these accessories so that s why i say the ps is somewhat cheaper c has great exclusives coming out heavenly sword lair eight days warhawk metal gear solid metal gear online killzone grand turismo little big planet getaway driver god of war iii final fantasy xiii final fantasy versus xiii jax and daxter lost frontier motorstorm ninja gaiden sigma ratchet and clank future tools of destruction resistance fall of man socom confrontation tekken uncharted drake s fortune and white knight story that s all the games i can think of over minutes d the ps is superior due to cell technology this allows the ps to produce complex graphics far superior to any other console the ps is equivalent to xbox in processing speed the down side is however that it will be a while until game producers can max its potential but i m not impatient also it is somewhat good too because then sony wont have to make another console as soon but yet nobody knows what technology can come to in years e ps will probably be the better quality as in life span many xbox are already having hardware problems xbox have red rings of death when there has only been a reported faliure chance with the ps ps also has an emergency shut down feature so if you ps overheats it will automatically shutdown until it is out of a dangerous temperature isnt bad but ps is way better for the cost Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Mewtwo Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Team Rocket Boss (video games) Latios Pok__mon Gold and Silver Groudon Pok__mon Adventures Pok__mon: The Movie 2000 Pure Pwnage Diamond cut Magical Pok__mon Journey Pikachu Charizard Marilyn Monroe Snorlax Legendary Pok__mon Pok__mon Heroes Gemological Institute of America New York City Subway nomenclature Manene Battle Frontier Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon 4Ever Golden Axe Mightyena Missingno. 1990s Articuno Game Freak Salamence Aladdin (1992 film) Neil Diamond Spoink Flygon Raichu Dragon Ball Z movies Alice Cooper Sceptile Skiing Microeconomics Orange Order Ho-Oh Misdreavus Magneton Grunge music Lucario Hip hop culture Timeline of alternative rock Latias Engagement ring Mobile Fighter G Gundam Reckoning (R.E.M. album) Hair metal Pearl Jam Crown of Mary of Modena Indigo Plateau The Cure Freestyle music The Sand Reckoner Professional wrestling throws Pok__mon Trainer Rushden & Diamonds F.C.
