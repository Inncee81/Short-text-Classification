world of warcraft or lotro shadows of angmar i don't know which game i should get i stopped playing wow over months ago and i haven't played any rpgs since then the new lich king expansion sounds pretty fun but i don't have the burning crusade even my character is still at lvl so i would still have a lot of catching up to do if i started playing wow again lotro looks really fun i got to play beta a little but my computer was shit so it literally took me minute to move ten steps i got a new computer though that is pretty good it has g ram but i haven't gotten to try the beta so i don't really know how good the game is so which one do you like better lotro or wow and why im just afraid i'll get bored of wow again and i'll have wasted all that money i was able to level from to in two weeks playing casually then leveled my alt to about a month later and am now leveling one from to she's now and it hasn't been that bad from what i've heard lotro looks pretty but isn't that great of a game it lacks other players since people weren't as interested and is far to similar to the movies for it to be unique wow is still wow with opened up new areas same old graphics and a bunch of new and exciting story lines to pick up on while you still have to do the normal rep grind some of the rewards and lore are pretty cool when wotlk comes out for wow the whole game is getting a face lift so it'll look just as pretty as lotro well maybe still a little pixel y like wow is now but they're doing some pretty cool things personally i would stick with wow but its really your choice GameFAQs Computer and video games Metroid series Strategy guide GameSpot Grand Theft Auto III Nintendo Power Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Toe Jam & Earl Banjo-Kazooie Super Mario 64 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Earthworm Jim Tomb Raider WWE SmackDown!
