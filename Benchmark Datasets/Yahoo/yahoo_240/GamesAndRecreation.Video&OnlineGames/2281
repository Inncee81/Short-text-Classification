which is better porygon z or spiritomb why for porygon z it has download and adaptability download depending on foe's strongest stat porygon z raises itself in that stat adaptability if porygon z uses an attack that has the same type as it then the move's power is increased spiritomb has some good affects also when an enemy attacks it the enemy loses pp instead of one pp there is nothing that is super effective against spiritomb in the end i personally like porygon z more Nintendo Super Nintendo Entertainment System Square Co., Ltd.
