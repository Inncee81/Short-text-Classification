ps xbox or wii what gamesystem is the best i think it's ps i'm totally biased towards nintendo but i'll try to break out of that for this review p wii innovation new method of getting in the game with the wiimote nunchuk and motion sensitivity so so although very good looking no matter what the specs say graphics hardware notice the word hardware the stuff on screen can look good with the wii's hardware too no homebrew compatibility yet i'm hoping no dvd cd playback again hopefully that's a yet opera web browser with flash you can watch youtube videos with it classic nintendo series of games i just finished started over played through again legend of zelda twilight princess although it's my first zelda game it's probably my favorite game ever xbox for the more hardcore gamer halo halo halo good graphics and graphics hardware hdtv support built in hard drive no blu ray but who really needs blu ray it's a waste of money xbox live though it costs money per month wii's online is free is supposed to be good ps playstation for the more hardcore gamer as well but with a side of expensive uselessness all my friends hate it and they aren't all nintendo like i am although it has the ultra powerful cell processor the blu ray was overkill and the price is way high the controllers lack rumble packs but are wireless and have accelerometers like the wiimote but the form factor limits the usefulness of the ps motion sensing i've heard there aren't many good games but i don't look at ps 's much i mean any i'd definitely say get a wii but it's really a personal choice review them carefully but don't rule the wii out on system specs alone loz looked really good graphically and it was designed for the cube also remember that hdtv support is downright useless on an sdtv so if you're planning on using an xb or ps on your average bedroom tv you aren't going to get the most out of the expensive graphics hardware Computer and video games Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 Nintendo DS Video game music ATI Technologies Sega Saturn Handheld game console High-definition television Nintendo Entertainment System PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of computer and video games Game controller The Legend of Zelda series Super Nintendo Entertainment System Console game Final Fantasy NVIDIA PowerPC Console wars Modchip Windows Vista Game Boy Windows XP Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family IBM PC compatible Radeon The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Halo (video game series) Link (Legend of Zelda) Halo 2 Doom 3 Wipeout (game) Game Critics Awards Apple Macintosh Halo: Combat Evolved Counter-Strike Amiga First-person shooter ZX Spectrum Grand Theft Auto III Microsoft Intellivision Sega CD History of video games (Sixth generation era) Sony Computer Entertainment Super Mario 64 Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Atari 2600 Commodore 64 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Mac OS X Game programming Machinima The Sims FIFA Series Windows 2000 Regional lockout Timeline of computing 1990-forward N-Gage Rare (video game company) IPod History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) GamePark Computer role-playing game The Sims 2 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting USB flash drive Atari ST Zelda II: The Adventure of Link IMac Yu Suzuki DVD The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess DualShock Nintendo Virtual Boy GeForce 6 Series Personal computer The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Resident Evil (video game) The Legend of Zelda TurboGrafx 16 Copy protection
