wii remote not working properly my wii remote which came with the system i bought yesterday doesn't respond to well i think sometimes when i try to use it i play mario party the cursor for the wiimote little hand on screen starts blinking or repeatedly dissapears and reappears a lot i don't know why this happens maybe i am too close to the tv too far i am about feet from the tv and sensor when i get real close the same thing happens so can anyone help me i've already synced it and know that the problem is the wiimote has to be facing the sensor bar directly so i'll pick a person the problem is the sensor bar make sure nothing is blocking the space between the wii remote and bar you can also try putting the sensor bar on its stand there is no need to re sync it since the problem is not about the motion sensors Mouse (computing) Swingout Hard disk Aerial (dance move) Movie projector Combine (Half-Life 2) Burglar alarm Traffic light Digital photography Danger Hiptop Computer and video game genres Floppy disk RFID Canon T90 Baroque chess Nintendo Revolution Galileo spacecraft Geographic information system Diving Social rule Embedded system Sensor X Window System ITunes Motion capture Volleyball System/36 AmigaOS Rebreather IMAX Airbag Windows XP Surveillance Jacobo Arenas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an STS-62 Cursor (computers) Inertial guidance system System/34 Bluetooth Super Mario 128 Spring operating system X10 (industry standard) Digital camera Side pass (dance move) Eye Dance Dance Revolution Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Equine conformation STS-114 Universal Century Technology Indianapolis 500 Oscilloscope Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Knight Rider Charleston (dance move) HTML element Milton H.
