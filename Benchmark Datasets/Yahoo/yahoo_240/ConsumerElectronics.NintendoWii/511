help with gamecube capabilities on wii i borrowed the gamecube game zelda the wind waker and a gamecube controller and memory card for my wii but for some reason the controller won't respond and i can't even make it into the game because i can't choose the agme over the mii and i tried the game on someone elses gamecube and it worked so it's not the controller is there something i am doing wrong for it not to work well if i use the wii mote i can get to the screen for the actual game and the game works on the other gamecube aswell the wii seems to be fine in every other way so there are three possibilities your wii is broken either it won't play gamecube games or the controller port is broken your controller is broken your disc doesn't work since you already tried the game on somebody else's gamecube i would say is not true did you use your same controller with the other person's gamecube a memory card is not necessary to play the game only to save it iirc so you should be able to put the game in the wii picture side to the right top and the wii should recognize the game whether the controller works or not if you can't select zelda under the very first window nd window is mii etc from the main menu then your wii is broken Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Nintendo Revolution The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Nintendo Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda series Princess Zelda Resident Evil 2 The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures Resident Evil (video game) Sega Dreamcast Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Game Boy The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Animal Crossing Koji Kondo The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition Dance Dance Revolution The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Handheld game console The Legend of Zelda series characters Phantasy Star Online PlayStation Portable The Sims 2 Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Super Mario 128 PlayStation 2 Computer role-playing game Legend of Zelda series songs PlayStation 3 Xbox Nintendo DS Game Boy Player Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game controller The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Game Boy Advance Console game Computer and video games The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Modchip The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$ Tales of Symphonia Hyrule Castle Sega Nintendo Power BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Resident Evil 4 Mouse (computing) MAME Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Game programmer Gradius The Legend of Zelda series races Console wars Nintendo Entertainment System Bubble Bobble Metroid series Screenshot Windows XP Pok__mon (video games) Ganon Resident Evil Pok__mon Box Game programming Sonic Mega Collection Atari 8-bit family IBM PC compatible The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Apple II family Hyrule Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker characters Octorok Acorn Electron Blue screen of death Nintendo 64DD Floppy disk Card game Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microsoft Windows Final Fantasy VIII Betting (poker) FIFA Series Action Replay GoldenEye 007 E-Reader True Crime: Streets of LA Slot machine
