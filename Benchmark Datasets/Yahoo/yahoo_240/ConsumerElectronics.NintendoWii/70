what are good wii games for a yr old boy for a birthday gift any others beside wii play some that are easy for him to follow and possibly a learning type game mario zelda and such deal with story i don't think he can play and understand you've got to be kidding me you all sound as if the wii has all those violent games for older people it's geared toward everyone i know most wii games are for older children but i'm sure there are at least one or two games out there meant for learning for his age vtech and others have learning type games of their own for his age so this is nothing new and no i don't expect him to sit him all day in front to play it conclusions conclusions btw i know this is nothing new but why answer if you don't have one that helps the question keep your rude comments to yourselves they arent' helpful my niece is turning next month and after playing wii sports with me at my house my brother decided to buy one for them they recently got a shrek game that she can play and really enjoys i tried to help her learn several of my games like cooking mama elebits zelda paper mario etc but they were too involved we found that if we play mario party along with her it's set up like a board game with mini games and we practice the mini games before we play them for real she can follow along fairly well granted we are helping her along at this point because she can't read but she has a great time and it's nice to have the grown ups playing with her it makes her happy also she has been able to play warioware warioware is a game full of minigames we picked which games we thought she could handle trying and then let her go at it she is able to do a pretty fair amount of them because they are simple and grouped well they put them into groups of how you use the wiimote like turning it spinning it twisting it etc it helps them learn how to do one motion with the wiimote well and it enforces it by having them to that motion over and over in different ways super monkey ball banana blast is ok it has less mini games that she is able to do and some are a little more sensitive and complicated but if you can't find anything else it is plausible it can be a little frustrating because as a parent of a child the same age i'm sure you know they want to play all the ones you know are too complicated for them but it isn't a total loss and as a side note you can't underestimate these little kids with the wiimotes my niece at and months was consistently bowling over in wii bowling it drove us crazy she'd just wing her arm and get a strike almost every time so really you never know what they are capable of until they get some practice i guess The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Wario Computer and video game genres Link (Legend of Zelda) Nintendo Theory of conduct Kodocha Table tennis Video game music Animal Crossing Shaggy dog story The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Aerial (dance move) Laws of cricket New York Giants Samus Aran The Legend of Zelda series Boss (video games) Volleyball Nintendo GameCube Wheel of Fortune Super Mario Bros.
