which is a better wii game resident evil or call of duty i am looking for a first person shooting game i got these two options but i heard that using the wii controls in cod is difficult can anyone who has played both these games on a wii comment and help me out thanks a ton i have played both games and resident evil in my opinion is way better than cod re is a good survival horror game that works well with the wii remote the graphics are decent for the wii and the storyline is interesting and play time is long there are a few puzzles to be solved but mostly shooting and slacking zombies i played cod after re and was disappointed the wii controls for this game werent as smooth as re also i felt like i was advancing in the game without really doing anything seems like if i stayed with my platoon than i was ok even if i was shooting or not i personally would get re it is cheaper and in my opinion a better game Resident Evil Resident Evil 0 Resident Evil 2 Zombie Resident Evil 4 Survival horror game Alone in the Dark (series) Paul W.
