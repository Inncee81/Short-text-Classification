mario party or zelda i like multi player games but i like deep games too so which one do i get ummmm i wholeheartedly agree that mario party is a copy of the previously released versions however i want to mention that the following aspects have to be taken into consideration millions of consoles have been sold the wii remote the fact the wii is enjoyable for non gamers the wii's game audience will include hundreds of thousands of players around the world who are buying a console for the first time they possibly have never played mario party at all this game will be exciting and fun for them especially with friends having picked it up last night i invited other friends over and we played a full round of the first board it was fun we tried to gang up on each other and steal peoples coins in full mario party fashion so while i agree that the games are not all unique and new i must say at least nintendo ported over the most important portion of mario party the fun factor this game will be whole heartedly enjoyed by the new wii owners who have never experienced mario party not to mention fans out there who may have only owned of the previous versions for the wii this is the best party game released so far on par with rayman raving rabbids hardcore gamers or mario party fantatics may want to rent this game and play a round before jumping out and buying it overall the controls were ok and the games fun and you and your friends will have a lot of fun not to mention laughs The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Super Mario remake series Nintendo Mario Nintendo DS Nintendo 64 Super Mario Bros.
