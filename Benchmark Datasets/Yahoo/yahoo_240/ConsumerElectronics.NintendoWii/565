will the wii classic controller work with gamecube games when i go to the disc channel after i insert a gamecube game and press start the controller turns off while it is loading then it won't connect until i turn it back on what am i doing wrong no when you put a gamecube game in the wii it transforms the wii's hardware to a gamecubes specifications this includes reducing its cpu and video card speeds to that of a gamecube this also means that it is no longer a wii and does not have the knowledge or ability to recognise wiimotes so you have to use a gamecube controller and gamecube memory cards the classic controller is only for use in some games like super smash brothers brawl when it is released dragonball z budokai tenkaichi and a few others they can also be used on all virtual console games Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 2 Nintendo Super Nintendo Entertainment System Xbox Nintendo 64 Sega Dreamcast Console wars PlayStation 3 PlayStation Portable Game Boy Advance Game Boy Modchip Sony Computer Entertainment Resident Evil (video game) Animal Crossing ATI Technologies Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nintendo DS Video game music TurboGrafx 16 Action Replay Game controller Super Mario 128 PC Engine History of video games (Sixth generation era) Handheld game console PowerPC Sega Saturn Dragon Ball Z Video game console Commodore 64 Sega Console game Pok__mon Amiga Atari 2600 Windows 2000 Xbox 360 Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Super Smash Bros.
