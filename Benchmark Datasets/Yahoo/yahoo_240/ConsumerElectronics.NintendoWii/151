if you buy the wii ds usb adapter what else do you need i have a broadband connection with a modem and a computer running windows xp and is it a good buy i personally would say buy a wifi router they're affordable these days for a basic one and it's a lot more useful compared to the nintendo wifi usb adapter you can use a nintendo wifi adapter for just the wii and ds you can use a wifi router for wii ds laptops pda's ps xbox cell phones that support wifi printer sharing desktops with wireless cards and any other device that supports wifi i'd look for a g wireless router they're pretty common you hook it between your cable modem and your pc and it will have a setup where you can give your access point a name then you go in your wii's internet settings and configure it for your access point Universal Serial Bus Wireless LAN Bluetooth Xbox Laptop Modem Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Nintendo Revolution Voice over IP Desktop computer PlayStation 2 Local area network Router PowerPC Personal computer ATI Technologies Secure Digital card AirPort Nintendo GameCube Windows XP USB flash drive Wireless RS-232 Digital Subscriber Line Broadband Internet access WiMAX Computer hardware Computer bus PlayStation Portable Xbox 360 Computer and video games Network address translation Cisco Systems Memory card Personal digital assistant Windows Server 2003 Nintendo DS IEEE 802.11 Pocket PC Embedded system IMac Game Boy Advance Wireless community network Internet Integrated Services Digital Network Satellite internet IPod Television Softmodem Game Boy Linux Telephone IPAQ Nintendo Entertainment System Ethernet IBM PC compatible Hewlett-Packard General Packet Radio Service Handheld game console Mobile phone Microsoft AppleTalk Telegraphy Timeline of computing 1990-forward Digital video recorder Denial-of-service attack Apple Computer Serial port Super Nintendo Entertainment System ZigBee Novell NetWare Sharp Zaurus MSN TV Wireless network Atari 8-bit family Computer MAC address Power line communication Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 Tungsten Handheld Password History of Microsoft Windows IBook CompactFlash Wireless Application Protocol Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Internet service provider
