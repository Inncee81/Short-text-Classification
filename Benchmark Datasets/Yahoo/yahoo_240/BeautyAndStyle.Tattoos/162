why won't some tattoo parlors tattoo directly below the ankle bone i am trying to get a tattoo in the little spot just below the ankle inside above the arch of the foot and the heel i have one on my right ankle that was done about years ago and now want one on my left ankle i have spoken with a few different shops and they all say that it is shop policy not to do a tattoo in this spot on the body something about the color lasting in this spot because of natural exfoliation the tattoo that i want is small and does not have a lot of detail so i am confused as to why they won't do it especially when my other one is still as colorful and bright as the day it was done can anyone offer me any ideas of why they won't do it all said they can do it above the ankle bone which is less than inches away from where i want it or on top of the foot neither location is an option for me thoughts thanks for your help i'm not sure i can offer any new information other than that it is a spot on your body where you go through skin really fast exfoliation tattoo artists are generally a lot less willing to do a tattoo if it is going to look really bad in a few years they like to be able to stand behind their work i'd say your best bet is to either look for a new location for the tattoo if you really want it to last and be crisp and not blurry or try to convince one of the artists that that's really what you want and you don't care if it looks crummy later good luck Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Horse Shoe Kurt Angle Customs and etiquette of Japan Volleyball Brian Close Irish dance Avril Lavigne Opportunity rover Foot Fable (video game) Fancy rat Comanche Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sento Scarification Psoriasis Stereoscopy Anatomical terms of location Achilles' tendon Poker jargon Memento (film) Dragon Booster Billboard Hot 100 Dodge Charger Vanilla Ninja Yosemite National Park Unreal Glossary of partner dance terms Glossary of ballet terms Jessica Lynch Cheating in poker Pterosaur Diving suit Gaia Online Massage Crucifixion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma San Andreas (state) Basketball Craps Mark Calaway Human anatomy Pain Dominoes The Dalek Invasion of Earth Mid-levels Professional wrestling slang Columbine High School massacre Akatsuki (Naruto) Dallas, Texas High-heeled shoe Physical characteristics of the Buddha The Rock (entertainer) Blackjack Decompression sickness Minor characters in Morrowind The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Body painting Skateboarding trick Body modification Pittsburgh Steelers Irezumi About a Boy Dinosaur Acne Social rule Marching band Good Charlotte Proprioception Shawn Michaels Waterworld Anatomical position Henna The Apprentice 2 Andr__ the Giant Angelina Jolie Crocodilia Hip hop rivalries 613 mitzvot Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Swingout Platypus Flat feet $ale of the Century Brassiere Australian cricket team Chris Jericho Manhunt (video game) Leopard Sunlight Human skin color The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Badly Drawn Kitties Norway national football team 1957 World Series
