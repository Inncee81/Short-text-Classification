why does the outline on a tattoo hurt the most i know they do this bit first usually but i still dont get why like a few people here have said it's like doing a drawing you can't colour a picture in until you've drawn it i thought the outline hurt the most on all mine but i think it also depends where you get it in the first place how much body fat you have etc i'm pretty skinny and i have one on my shoulder blade which didn't hurt a bit but then when i got the one done on my lower back it hurt a bit for the outline and then as someone else on here said your endorphins kick in and you don't feel it as much they are addictive and believe me is nothing compared to childbirth get one you'll be back for more i promise get yourself some numbing cream from the chemist my friend uses it for everything piercings tattoo etc and doesn't feel a thing wish i'd thought of that for mine but as i said not too bad pain wise Nine Inch Nails Self-harm Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Jackass: The Movie Tattoo LSD Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Addiction Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Transactional analysis Swimming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Drug addiction Vegeta Slayers Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling holds Rich Mullins Breastfeeding Milton H.
