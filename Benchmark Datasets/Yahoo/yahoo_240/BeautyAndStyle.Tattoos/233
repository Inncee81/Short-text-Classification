if tattoos were artwork hanging in a gallery would you visit it i find that most tattoos are hideous i understand wanting to be 'cool' and 'hip' and 'oh so rebellious' but of tattoos are just plain ugly especially the big ones i do realize tattoos are a kind of art but i just think the prevailing style is rather unappealing so gnarly and busy and dark and generally detracting from the beauty of the human body in my opinion anyway still i know not to judge people who get them to each their own d it depends a lot of tattoo artists are incredibly good artists and do beautiful artwork and prints that don't end up as tattoos some even exhibit their work in galleries a close friend of my boyfriend is a tattoo artist and he's also done some really beautiful pieces of art if i felt they were good as an artist not just a tattooist and enjoyed their work then i would most definately visit their exhibition their are also a lot of people out there that tattoo but are terrible artists the quality ie appearance of the tattoos they do may look good but their art could be horrible a lot of these people work from flash copying designs out of books etc this i feel is the distinction between a 'tattooist' and a 'tattoo artist' a tattoo artist has the ability to take an idea or suggestion draw it up in to a beautiful design and then turn it in to a good quality tattoo on a persons skin i agree that a lot of people have some really ugly tattoos i believe that is because these people didn't do enough research to find a good tattoo artist and because they lack the imagination to make a tattoo their own i'll readily admit i was guilty of just picking a tattoo out of a book and now i regret it but soon i'll be getting it covered up with something beautiful that i've put my thought an imagination in to i feel the human skin is a blank canvas and i feel tattoos and piercings are a way of making it more interesting and of expressing yourself the problem is a lot of people see tattoos and piercings as a fashion accessory rather than a form of expression thats why in so many ways it's started to become uniform and generic for hundreds if not thousands of years tribes from all over the world have used body modification as a way of being seen as more beautiful or to carry some other kind of symbolism women in certain tribes in africa are not seen as beautiful and able to marry unless they have rows of scars cut in to their skin it all depends on your social ideals and how you percieve things like tattoos as to whether you accept them tattoos can be extremely beautiful and a lot of tattoo artist are incredibly talented people often overlooked because tattoos are still general socially unacceptable Tattoo Art Clothing Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness Irezumi Scarification Abortion debate Human The Emancipation of Mimi Dragon Booster Body modification Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pablo Picasso W.
