i am considering getting a tattoo and have a particular tattoo in mind i am thinking of getting a frog holding a heart with my kids names and birthdates inside the heart what do you think can anyone give me an opinion if that is something you think you would want then great however you do realize that to get a heart with names and dates inside of it the heart would have to be big big as in atleast three square inches at minimum which means the frog holding it would have be be much larger unless you want a tiny frog holding a gigantic heart it really is something to think about while your idea may sound feasable when you say it in reality it would probably look odd if you got that at the size that it would need to be and any artist who tells you that they can do it really small is just wrong lettering can't be tiny or it just won't hold up over time good luck on whatever you decide tho Game show Vegeta Double bass Poker jargon Betting (poker) Marathon (computer game) Saint Seiya Tattoo The Fairly OddParents Treehouse of Horror V Numerology Craps Jon Secada Vanilla Ninja Dead Like Me Infinity Care Bears Phoebe Halliwell Aerial (dance move) My Sassy Girl Rocko's Modern Life Mantra Glossary of graph theory Dinosaur Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Radiohead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adjective Professional wrestling aerial techniques Friedrich Schleiermacher Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance The Contender (television series) Ed, Edd n Eddy Memento (film) Sant Thakar Singh House of Leaves Ashlee Simpson Paper size Sonic Adventure Psychokinesis Hey Jude Modernism Intelligent design Jumpstart 3rd Grade Lung The Life and Times of Juniper Lee David Hume W.
