idea for tattoo on lower middle back my mom and i have had alot of problems in the past and just now getting over the whole schpeil i thought it would be a very cool thing for us to go in together and get tattoos of possibly the same thing i wanted to do it maybe close to x mas my idea was for a gun with thick vines wrapped all around the barrel and a flower growing out of the end also a butterfly with a beach scene in the wings landing down atop the barrel possible somthing else to tie it all together lots of color lots of shading we just so happened to be watching miami ink the other night together and she said things like i wish i had gotten a tattoo on my lower back what do you think well do not get one there unless you want every guy who sees it thinking you are a hooker or work in adult movies get your mum to watch a few and you will quickly find out what i mean i think the sexiest place for a tattoo for women is around the pubic area but it will hurt like hell a butterfly with a beach scene in the wings sounds awesome forget the rest design something yourself or have someone design it for you tattoos guaranteed to two weeks after death sign in tattoo parlour Memento (film) About a Boy Tattoo Unreal Sin City The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders Jon Secada Angelina Jolie The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Irezumi Undergarment Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pitaten Meat Loaf Professional wrestling throws Angel Sanctuary Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
