did having kids change you in what way how were you before having kids completely yes it was quite scary at first thinking there was this little person that totally depended on me all of a sudden it wasn't just 'me' anymore i was a mother i had a massive responsibility which arrived literally overnight nothing was ever the same again it's made me more mature in some ways and less mature in others i feel like i've turned into my mother in some respects but i am still capable of being completely daft and childish with my kids too it's fun to be able to let go of your inhibitions like that having my second child changed me even more because he is autistic having a child with special needs changes you it has to you find energy reserves you never knew you had and a level of patience and understanding you never had before every little bit of progress he makes gives me a thrill like nothing else my daughter always makes me proud but when he came along it gave the word a whole new meaning i don't find my life has been hugely restricted sure there are things we used to be able to do like pop out for a meal whenever we felt like it now we have to get a babysitter so it's more of a big occasion when we do it but really we've found there isn't much we aren't able to do if we put our minds to it we still have dinner parties we still socialise we still have a good time i suppose the biggest thing about having kids for me has been that knowledge that there is suddenly someone in the world i would die for without hesitation keeping them safe and well is my job and nothing else is as important as that Autism Humphrey Bogart Social rule About a Boy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Milton H.
