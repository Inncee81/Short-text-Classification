question for parent of or more kids i have a yr old daughter and i just found out last week were expecting again we have been trying to have another baby my question is how did all of you make the transition from child to how hard and stressful was it how did your first child react and how long did it take for everything to settle down and to get things in a schedule id like to hear everyones stories and advice im due april th so my daughter will be about months old then it is good to have the first two close together that way there is minimal jealousy get things ready practice with a doll so your little one is included make sure she holds feeds changes and reads to the doll just like you will to your new baby when s he comes when the baby arrives make sure your daughter is included while you nurse she can nurse her doll when you bathe the baby she can bathe the doll etc and above all make sure she gets some one on one time with you and your husband different times as well as all together so she knows she is still special teach her that she is the big girl not a baby she can help by fetching diapers bath accessories etc if you do all of this your transition won't be too hard because although two little ones is a bit more work everyone will have positive feelings instead of the negative ones that come when mom is too tired to pay any attention at all to the older child except to say no and feed and change her when i transitioned to two children my older child was already three he was not so easy to bring onboard he wanted his sister to be returned from wherever we got her animosity reigned between the two as they grew up too with lots of fights all because of jealousy well she adored him but he would do a lot of hitting and teasing and when his two other siblings came along he continued to terrorize them i think three years is too long to allow a child to think the world revolves around him the earlier you have the second one the better and don't do what i did allow the older one a lot more independence so you can focus all of your attention on the new one i did it all wrong and would not do it that way again as far as schedules they work themselves out with baby number just as easy as with baby number two babies are a lot to handle all day every day plan some time to get away for a weekend if you can and during the day take those babies to mommy and me classes so you can have some adult conversation sure it's all about child rearing but it is adult conversation Breastfeeding Infantilism EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Social rule Urinary incontinence Kodocha Jon Secada The Adventures of Pete & Pete Spice Girls Infant Child sexuality Rugrats Craps Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series My Little Pony Mary Cassatt Avenue Q Hollyoaks Romulus and Remus Knots Landing Characters in the Smurfs Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Another World (TV series) Transactional analysis Kimi Finster Pitaten Neighbours School bus Second language acquisition 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Family from One End Street Childbirth Britney Spears Shaggy dog story Laura Schlessinger Guiding Light Hilary Duff Billboard Hot 100 Cindy Sheehan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Love Hina main characters Slow Train Coming Comanche Ayyavazhi mythology Hermione Granger W.I.T.C.H.
