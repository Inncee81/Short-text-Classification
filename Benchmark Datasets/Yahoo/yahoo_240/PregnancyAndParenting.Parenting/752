in mass if a family friend watches my kids days a week at their home are they required to be licensed my ex told the court that our boys would be in a licensed day care while she works but after talking to the state i found out the daycare was not licensed but just a family friend since finding this out my ex has began placing the kids with that friend for two days and another friend for days every week because its only two days each per week do they need to be licensed daycare providers or not they both live in the same town a few miles apart i have joint physical and legal custody and i am home day during the week i have had custody during the week for months with her having them on the weekends the judge just reversed the order for month to see how she does we originally agreed that i would have the kids while she was at work during the day but she then got mad about something else and changed her mind one of the friends has an extensive criminal record and the other just leaves the kids infront of the tv all day while she goes outback and gardens not the best enviorments for my kids to be in to my knowledge all homecares in ma must be liscensed regardless of how many days a week the child attends if your kids are the only kids these people are watching that could change things ma has long had some of the toughest rules for homeday cares the inspections they go through are just as tough if not tougher than the ones many large scale daycre providers go through another issue many people don't consider when using an unliscensed daycare is that by doing so they may not be able to claim daycare exspenses on thier taxes claiming child care costs on your federal and state returns will allert the irs to the fact someone is getting the money and they can ask for proof cancelled checks receipts etc to verify the claim since most unliscened daycares are operating that way to avoid the taxes this could mean some nice fines and fees if they get found out if you are paying for childcare as part of the custody agreement i would ask for a receipt for tax purposes the bigger issue here is that your ex is willfully disregarding the custody and child care arrangements agreed upon when the change in custody took place i would contact your lawyer as well as the person handling your case in the family court and report this keep a record of where and who is caring for the child since the present custody arrangment was on a trial basis i would think you would be going back to court to discuss if it will stand bring up all of these concerns again in front of the judge the lack of liscensed daycare the fact that she changed the care arrangments without your agreement and against court orders the fact that one of the providers has a criminal history hopefully this should be enough for the court to order her to comply and return childcare responsibilities to you if not and if you are paying for the childcare costs i would ask the court to order her to place them in a certified daycare with her being required to provide reciepts for services to you as well as copies of the center's licenses to the judge Day care Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Appeal Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson SCO-Linux controversies Probation officer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Vivian Solon Article One of the United States Constitution Court system of Canada Public domain Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bush v.
