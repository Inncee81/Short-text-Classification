parents and the way they let their kids act why do some parents not allow their kids to talk down to back talk or mouth them but they allow them to do it to other adults seen some things going on this weekend and didn't understand why they let them treat others that way but didn't let them treat the parent that way what do you think the reasoning in that is parents have strange double standards when it comes to things like that they often preach many things but don't act upon them or don't apply them in all areas my parents weren't perfect but if i was ever disrespectful to another adult i knew it was wrong and that i could be punished even the slightest comment said out of line even unknowingly was corrected i grew up sensitive to the needs and feelings of other people and as a result i am privileged enough to be able to move about in the world successfully as a result i think maybe some parents might encourage their children to 'answer back' to other adults because many years ago children were abused regularly because of the 'children should be seen and not heard' attitude and as a result many people were tortured in silence now we're completely the other way children have an answer for everything and because they don't respect other people consistently they don't have real respect for themselves or real discipline it does send out mixed messages to children parents these days though i feel with the media and everything scaring people have a feeling of dread about their children and their safety Plame affair Theory of conduct Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Infantilism Milton H.
