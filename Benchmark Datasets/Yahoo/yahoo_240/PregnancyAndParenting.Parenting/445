help my moms crazy i don't know what to do ok here's the story i walked down from my room into the commons area of the house and she started like yellin at me she was like hey hey look at me when i'm talkin to you i couldn't hear her cuz i had my ipod on then i looked over to see her yellin at me i was like what then she starts yelling again don't what me young man blah blah blah she was yellin at me for ever and i go i'm gonna be late for tennis so we can carry on this convo later so i walked out do most parents yell at there kids for know reason do ur parents yell at you for know reason i don't know why she was yellin at me i mean se dosen't drink or anything so idk mabye's it's just estrogen or whatever i'm she doesn't do house work we have maids for that so there's no way in he l im cleaning my room sry ronald why would i want to contruibute everyone in my family does thir own thing mom shops tans dad works busisness trips me shop sports girlfriend friends school t lexi shop boyfriend shop cheerleading shop gymnastics shop friends we don't spend any time together and i really don't want to we all just do our own thing you're the first child right realize that your mom loves you but raising a child is hard and it must be so hard on her to realize that the perfect little family that she might have pictured growing up is not the reality not to say that your family isn't normal it is totally normal for teens to want to do things on their own and with their friends i'm not an expert and i'm not judging you either it seems like something that would help is a better way of communicating with each other if mom gets frustrated and yells try not to get angry and calmly explain to her that you didn't hear her mom i'm sorry i didn't hear you what did you need hopefully mom will calm down she probably didn't even realize that you had your ipod in and get her point across people yell when they feel they aren't being heard unfortunately being human if someone gets mad at you you will get mad right back in order to communicate effectively you have to break that cycle mad mom mad son chaos and anger mad mom calm son results hopefully mom will get it and respond to you calmly the next time you are frustrated good luck Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Kodocha The Marshall Mathers LP Kim Possible Little Britain Hey Arnold!
