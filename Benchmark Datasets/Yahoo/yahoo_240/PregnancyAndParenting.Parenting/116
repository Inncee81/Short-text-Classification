how can i get my month old to take a nap with out listening to her cry she naps for or so minutes then wakes very cranky i always rock her and sing to her till she falls asleep i absolutely do not believe in feberizing children i personally feel it bordrs on abuse sh sleps wih us at night and in her co seeper during the day because i worry about sids when i am not in bed with her just looking for new ideas i let my month old take her naps on our bed most of the time so i can lay down next to her until she falls asleep or at least is nearly asleep i hold her for a few minutes beforehand she usually rests her head on my shoulder and i rub pat her back sometimes even rock her then i lay her down tuck the blanket around her body and rub her arms legs head while either shush shush shush ing or quietly singing a lullaby the whole thing takes about minutes and it's much more soothing to us both than letting her cry it out if she's having a hard time staying asleep you might try adding some white noise i e a fan as long as it's not blowing on her just point it toward a wall or something a radio set to an a m station or even just to static and turned down very low even the tv if turned to a channel where there is a lot of talking don't turn it to a cartoon channel where there's lots of songs that will only wake her we've used all of the above with both of our girls and they help Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sleep Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jam (TV series) Siesta The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Jon Secada Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Professional wrestling holds Social rule Knots Landing The Shining (film) Blankets (graphic novel) Time Out of Mind The Emancipation of Mimi Highway 61 Revisited Out-of-body experience Mattress Narcolepsy She Loves You The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Blood on the Tracks Professional wrestling attacks Sin City Avenue Q Diving King Crimson Professional wrestling throws L__ Bu Chicago (band) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Elvis Presley Lucid dreaming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Year of the Spider Hey Jude Slow Train Coming Ty Cobb I Want to Hold Your Hand Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Day in the Life Salad Fingers Backstroke Oh My Goddess!
