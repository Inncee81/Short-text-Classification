you have any suggestions to help this child i know a year old little boy that is scared of everything and i mean pretty much everything it has just him and his dad for the past and a half years his dad got hurt real bad in an accident a few years back but has been doing good for the past three years or more this little boy is scared to sleep in his own room at night scared to be in a room alone during the day most of the time has to know where and what his dad is doing at all times when he goes and sleeps over at a friends house which only happens maybe once every four months or so he has to call his dad every few hours just to say hi tell him what he is doing and to see what his dad is doing his dad has a girlfriend with kids of her own and when they stay the night he is still scared to sleep in the room with her kids he is right there with his dad does anyone have any suggestions on why he is like this and what advice i could give his dad to try to help him out with it thanks so much also his dad reasures him just about every night that nothing will hurt him and that he will be there in the morning when he wakes up but still don't help he still sleeps with a blankie and alot of stuffed animals too is that uncommen i think that the child needs some counseling this child has been through a lot he has lost his mother either due to divorce death or her taking off and that is traumatic under any circumstances it is traumatic in different ways depending on the reason why mom is not in the picture if mom ran off and left him no one's mom leaves them so it must be his fault if mom died suddently that's not suppose to happen your mommy should always be there for you if mom died after a long illness he saw her suffering and there was nothing he could do helpless if divorce why didn't mom fight for him if divorce why didn't she get custody or regular visitation was she abusive to him there are a lot of different scenerios and each could cause a lot of different problems that only a reputable child psychologist can address then he almost lost dad recovery was slow scary to think that he was that close to losing his dad too i agree with the answer of maybe getting a dog let him stay in the house at least at night i think he would feel more secure if he had a living thing lying next on the bed or floor next to him and another kid won't have the same effect because he may be embarrassed about being so afraid a dog won't make fun of you because you are scared dad needs to continue to be patient maybe dad should go as far as to tell him that if something happens to him dad then he would go and live with grandma grandpa so he will know exactly what would happen fear of the unknown can also be really scary i wish this family good luck encourage counseling The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kodocha 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Grandview, U.S.A.
