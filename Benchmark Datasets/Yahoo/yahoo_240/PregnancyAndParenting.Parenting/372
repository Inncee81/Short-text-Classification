son took the blame for someone else little help my yr son is a cit at a camp this summer and hates it yet is good with the kids his best friend joe who works with him on the other hand is the complete opposite my son came home yesterday with a look that said something was on his mind so i asked he told me that joe was on pool duty not doing what he was suppose to be doing and a kid got hurt the owner of the camp said that who ever was suppose to be watching the kid wasn't going to asked back next year so my son told the owner that he was on pool duty b c joe wants to come back next year and my son doesn't i can see why he did this but i don't want him being blamed for something he didn't do or losing this camp and a reference for the future what would you tell your son in this situation i would explain to your son how you know why he did this but telling someone this lie so a friend gets a job next year is wrong even if you hate the job to begin with he's going to need the reference from this place to do something different next summer not paying attention is not a quality employers are looking for and i'm guessing since he's a cit this is one of his first jobs it would look wonderful to have a reference like this especially if he was good at it i would advise him to talk this over with the camp owner privately explain what he did and why he did so it's not fair that joe be rehired again next year if he's the one who isn't doing what he's suppose to be doing this is something your son needs to do without your help it's not like he was the one who wasn't paying attention and causing serious trouble as simple as the task was to take the blame it sounds like he has no idea how not simple the crime that he took the blame was lying about doing it is just as unprofessional and immature as lying about doing it i was reading your profile and i've answered some of your questions in the past and you have an older daughter right i'd suggest having her say something to your son as well let him know how important it is not to take the blame about this situation or any situation for that matter unless you've done the crime best wishes Theory of conduct Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ann Coulter Vegeta Kodocha Milton H.
