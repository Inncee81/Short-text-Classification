should i allow them out i live in a small estate where children as young as are allowed out around the estate to play im not too keen on this but my kids aged and are often asking to go i dont think i could be as relaxed about it as other parents they dont seem to see the dangers of it and im sure im looked at as been weird they have school friends and cousins who come to stay do they really need this interaction with other kids on the street or am i been overprotective any advice welcome thanks i feel less weird now and they have a big back garden with plenty of toys i often look out and wonder how some of these kids will end up been pushed out the door so young out of sight out of mind ive often seen them wonder out on to road its just terrible we have the same sort of layout where i live and there are children as young as four out in a group playing at am alone when they should be in bed asleep i was taken to the park most days during the school hols by my mum and taken swimming etc to keep me and my friends busy but and is a bit young to be outside alone to play though kids who play outside where i live have the worst language the worst behavioural skills and the worst manners i've ever seen so keeping yours away from this kind of negativity can only be a good thing i'd say let them have their friends over take them and their friends out swimming to the park etc and let them mix with children that way or enrol them in a summer activity scheme if they have one at their school lots of kids go on those where i live and they go on trips etc with qualified and education authority registered youth workers there's lots of ways for them to have fun without having to go out on the streets to make their fun Social rule About a Boy Care Bears The Fairly OddParents Play School Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Adventures of Pete & Pete YMCA RuneScape quests Characters in the Smurfs Theory of conduct Swimming pool The Family from One End Street Our Gang EastEnders Wonderland (McFly album) Milton H.
