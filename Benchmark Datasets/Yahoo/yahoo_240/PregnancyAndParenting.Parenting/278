should parents take more responsibility ok first off let me explain that i in no way endorse the filth that is child pornography in any way shape or form but my point is valid non the less do you think that parents should take more care in what they dress their children in these days i see so many young girls walking around in clothes that make adults look like slappers and when you see shops selling bras for year olds it makes you wonder are they encouraging the problem i'm not saying its the parent or the childs fault if anything was to happen or that it makes it ok for the paedophile but should parents be a little more thoughtful and dress their children as children oh i couldn't agree more the shops are just as much to blame however there are still shops that sell clothing that's perfectly fine if people stopped buying it the shops wouldn't stock it some one obviously had an idea which for some reason caught on this is a tricky question because i personally do not agree with little girls wearing bra's or g strings nor do i like them wearing hot pants and tiny skirts that most would call a belt however paedophiles strike no matter what a child is wearing its more a case that some parents have babies and wish them into adulthood very quickly yes the parents are to blame for making them look older as they have ultimate control but this does not cause paedophiles to abuse children they do it because they fantasise about having sex with children and believe they have the right to do so although they know it is wrong they break through the external and internal barriers that would stop normal people from abusing children i love the question though because it gets us all thinking and debating i was abused as a child and to my horror i discovered a close family member was abusing my then year old and my year old i have set up a website to try and help abuse victims see the light please feel free to post this question in my forum www libertyfromabuse com many thanks Childlove movement Serial killer Child pornography Undergarment Transsexuality Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Gender role Sento Child sexuality Transactional analysis About a Boy EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Rape Theodicy Theory of conduct Androgen insensitivity syndrome False memory Video game controversy Brassiere Free will North American Man/Boy Love Association Dissociative identity disorder French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Comanche Polyamory Child Jam (TV series) Pornography Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Microeconomics Child sexual abuse Cross-dressing Characters in the Smurfs Solar system Social aspects of clothing We Belong Together Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Intelligence quotient Avenue Q Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Ex-gay Professional wrestling match types Children of God Human sexual behavior Good Times Adult Charmed Neopets Trailer Park Boys Prostitution Nudity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cult Borderline personality disorder Past teachings of Prem Rawat Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Humphrey Bogart Satanic ritual abuse Autism Madonna (entertainer) Kylie Minogue Miss Saigon Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Trousers One Tree Hill (TV series) Divorce Friends Left-handed Paedophile Information Exchange Spanking Bish__jo game Hikikomori Aqua Teen Hunger Force Incest Scientology beliefs and practices The Amber Spyglass
