i am in a really bad situation here please read the question i would love answers following my other question i posted earlier about taking my year old sister who i am in the process or adopting to my mom's house and her asking to come home and throwing a tantrum she wrote me a letter a while ago in big letters and on the page she wrote please please please don't take me back there any more i hate it x x x with a little drawing at the bottom of the page obviously i know not take take her back so please don't just state the obvious and i have already talked her but she wouldn't talk to me much so my question is does anyone who have slightly older kids late pre teen early teen have any tips on getting them to talk about their feelings because i tried to talk to her and she didn't really talk much so after about minuets i just said i loved her and she didn't have to go any more and let her go back to playing on her computer i know you mean well but for the time being don't try to force your sister to talk to you let her come to you obviously she needs to be in counseling too i haven't read the other question yet but just don't make her talk when and if she gets ready to talk to you she will hope this helps okay i've read your other questions about your sister quit taking her to your parents' house now there is obviously something going on there no more if you are taking on the responsibility of your sister you need to start looking out for her and that includes keeping her away from that house period until you know that it's fine which i don't think you ever will i repeat she needs to get into some professional counseling and as for rewarding her for her good behavior i agree with the best answer give her your time she obviously has not had someone positive give her their time if your mom smacked her around don't buy her 'stuff' that doesn't mean anything and will give her the wrong message give her your time and make sure you let her know that she's important to you and that you are looking out for her know what a mess i'll be thinking of and praying for you guys good luck Friends Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Cindy Sheehan Kodocha Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Singlish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an My Life as a Teenage Robot Poker jargon Pitaten Time Out of Mind Charmed Milton H.
