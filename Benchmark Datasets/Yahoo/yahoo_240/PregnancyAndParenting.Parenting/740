if you are the parents of a year old would you let her date someone if you are the parents of a year old would you let her date someone im amazed by the outpour of answers to this serious question keep answering and thank you so much for writing your opinion i'm and my boyfriend is i'll call him 'v' i was when we met i know many people would assume that as abuse statutory rape anything they would think but i'd suggest you first read what my opinion is as a person who is in high school dating a college person as some of you said everyone will say that love between a yo and a yo isn't possible but it is anyway why am i with v here is why he is a vey kind gentlemanlike and well bred man he is a friend with everybody and everybody likes him when i'm with him he is always careful with me we understand each other we talk about thing i can't talk about with anyone and he understands me and always gives me advice so that i can go out of a hard situation when he hesitates about something we talk and consider all the things he can do and which one is the best to be done now no matter he is he is a person and like all other people he has feelings he has problems and he has worries just as everybody he also has his right mind as alll other people when we go out wherever we go he protcts me from dangerous situations even while we cross the street he never lets me feel 'alone' and he never lets anyone harm me or do anything dangerous near me about the sex question i know many of you will ask for that too we never have sex if i don't want and he never asks me to do anything i don't want if it is not important according to him sex is waaay not important enough so he should ask me to do it and that is right sex is definitely not that important in a true love relationship you might ask youselves why would a yo man want to date a yo girl if he doesn't have sex in mind they have nothing in common that is not so right if a man doesn't have sex in mind of course he has hormones but he is not attracted by me because of the idea of having sex as most yo men are there are other thing which make an attraction between two as first sight different people one of the most important things is that we understand each other and we can talk about everything i can ask him anything he can ask me anything when we disagree about something we sit down and discuss it after that we make a consensus if he asks me whether to do something or not he is sure he will get an answer which is the best for him and sam is with me if i ask him whether to do something or not i know he will give me an answer which will help me most about the age thing yes he is and i'm he is a man i am a girl i am a bit more developed than my coevals people still ask me what do i study in the college and i had the same questions when i was which means i have looked more grown than i really were i hardly ever meet a person who follows the logic in him and not the emotions only a lot of people about of all the people i know and probably more percentage of the people you know follow only their emotions when taking an important or any decision so v is not a person that follows his emotions emotions are love hatred happiness sadness anger jealousy and covetousness it's a real happiness to find a person who doesn't take important decisions under the emotion effects so i'd say yes i would let a yo or a yo date a yo if he is a responsible right minded person and if the girl is a responsible right minded person Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Social rule Philosophy of language Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology EastEnders Prostate cancer Friends Pedophilia God Emperor of Dune Pitaten Infantilism Little Britain Transsexuality Milton H.
