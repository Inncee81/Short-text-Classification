bi polar sister to watch my toddler here the deal my sister is and bi polar she is getting out of prison this week for meth related my mother keeps suggesting that my sister could help me out by watching my month old girl i am definatly not comfortable with this i dont mind if she comes over and helps while i take a shower or mow my yard those kind of things my husband can not stand my sister and dosent even want her in our home my mother insists she has changed i'm stuck in the middle and can see both points of veiws in the past whenever she stops taking her meds she seems to turn to drugs she is really good with children and they adore her what would you do if you were in my shoes i want to keep the peace with all involved and that never seems to happen i would make everyone happy you said that you don't mind if she helps out while you're still there then that's what you should do and make a really big deal about asking her thanking her profusely for helping you out and just generally make her feel important and appreciated however you don't need to leave her alone with your daughter just ask her over to help out on your terms but you're still inviting her this way your mum will be happy and you and your husband are comfortable knowing that your daughter is safe but still having a relationship with her aunt if she's genuinely good with kids and is supervised by you i don't see a problem good luck hope this helps EastEnders Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Milton H.
