do you believe this is true about kids many people tell me that i shouldn't get on a kid's level joke around with them because they'll think i'm their age not have any resepct for me when it's time for me to discipline them they also say i shouldn't treat kids nice like buying them snacks giving the money because they'll keep expecting it then the day i tell them no they're gonna start hating me not respecting me other kids' parents tell me that their kids have every right to disrespect me treat me like they have authority over me because i should've never done anything nice for the kids in the first place are they telling me right or wrong are you supposed to be serious with a kid not have any humor that's pretty boring my sisters tell me about how my nieces nephews have a right to disrespect me for wanting to spend time with them but other people tell me that i must joke around with kids do kiddie activities with them to help their learning growing i'm very confused on this subject that is not true of course you can joke around and play with them they will still respect you i do that all of the time joke and get on their level it really is the parent's fault when their kids do not show respect for you that is something they should have learned at home it is not something you would be able to teach the kids in the time you spend with them i remember something an author wrote that really hit home with me she was speaking of her late mother it said what i loved most about my mother was that whatever age i was she was the same age i think that is a great tribute many people prefer to make excuses for their children and blame you rather than take the time to teach the kids manners and respect Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Avenue Q Friends Social rule Ten Commandments Little Britain Shaggy dog story Codename: Kids Next Door The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Laura Schlessinger Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Rush Limbaugh Cardcaptor Sakura Rich Mullins Married... with Children The Ashlee Simpson Show The Young Ones (TV series) YuYu Hakusho Recurring South Park characters Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Roxette Our Gang Garfield Lindsay Lohan Beavis and Butt-head Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Joke Bill Cosby The Catcher in the Rye Invader Zim Kevin and Kell Kylie Minogue Steely Dan South Park Marilyn Monroe Singlish Bat Lash Mnemonic Blooper SpongeBob SquarePants Zhao Yun The Human Stain About a Boy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Spy Kids Scooby-Doo Dixie Chicks One Tree Hill (TV series) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Radio Yerevan Blood on the Tracks Knots Landing John the Baptist The Contender (television series) Infidels Jewish humour Asperger syndrome Fancy Crane Lie Megan Griffin Luke and Laura Spencer Kender Biff Tannen Grimke Sisters Obi-Wan Kenobi April Fool's Day Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Good Times The Angry Beavers John Lennon The Magic School Bus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Critic Craps Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Fruits Basket Transactional analysis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Incest Radiohead Confucius Springfield Elementary School The Brady Bunch Fox Broadcasting Company Kodocha Bon Jovi Novel Calvin and Hobbes Ocean's Twelve Queen (band) Rajneesh The Jim Rome Show Hey Arnold!
