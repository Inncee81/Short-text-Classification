to circumcise or not to circumcise to women who have had boys did you circumcise your son why or why not to pregnant ladies who are having boys are you planning on circumcising why or why not ayla i like your answer it is a personal decision we didn't do it to our son there didn't seem to be any reason to so we couldn't figure out why we would just seems kind of silly to alter the perfectly fine healthy body that our son was born with for no reason re locker room teasing circ rate is falling to less than these days i just don't see that as a problem and well when it comes right down to it who's more likely to be teased really the guy who's not circed or the guy who makes it obvious that he was looking at the other guys' equipment re looking like dad dudes a grown up penis looks nothing like a baby penis at all anyway or well i hope that your husband's penis doesn't look like a baby penis by the time they're old enough to look anywhere near the same they probably won't be comparing them anymore ask your husband when the last time was that he his father compared penises re hygeine it's no different teaching your child to clean their penis than it is teaching them to clean their bottoms you're going to teach them to do that right re phimosis in the insanely unlikely case that that happens he can get it taken care of at that time re cosmetic appearance what the girls will think see above re falling circ rate i guess the natural look will help my son weed out the superficial girls in his life re health benefits the benefits risks really balance themselves out in my opinion anything that he might get in the future we'll take care of at that time it seems like a pretty extreme preventive measure to take for some very unlikely risks Phimosis Circumcision Kyle Broflovski Medical analysis of circumcision Breastfeeding History of male circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Penis Masturbation Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Circumcision advocacy AIDS in Africa Condom Balanitis xerotica obliterans Intersex surgery Infant baptism Penile cancer Theory of conduct Gay slang Human sexual behavior David Reimer Gender role Birth control Growth hormone treatment Sex assignment Jam (TV series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Penis removal Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Cancer Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma About a Boy EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hillary Rodham Clinton History of intersex surgery Oral sex Jon Secada Body modification Abortion in the United States Domestic violence Foreskin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sex and the City Vitamin C Tocopherol Jean Grey Joke Smegma Transsexuality Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Hypoglycemia Puberty Utility cycling Microeconomics Cytomegalovirus AIDS American Dad!
