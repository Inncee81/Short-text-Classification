who how does one support children on one salary in to days lifestyle ask that family in arkansas who just had their th kid i don't know how they do it she's a sahm and homeschools and he was once a state representative but don't know if he's still involved with government or not i wouldn't be so concerned so much about financial support as much as how do they get the time and energy to give each child quality time and genuine love do they play favorites do the kids feel like they are just a number or have to vy for attention from their parents those are the emotional risks you take with very large families i also would wonder about the mother what was this stepford wife wannabee thinking does she have no other identity than mom no time for herself because she's constantly on call how does she and her husband actually have time to build their relationship as lovers and partners if they are so busy running family inc and does she ever wonder what she would do if her husband dies or if despite their professed christian beliefs he decides to walk out on her for someone younger prettier and no kids which does happen to people all too often even christians then she's stuck with kids no visible means of support and let's face it she's probably lost her 'girlish figure' long ago from having too many kids what man is gonna be attracted to a woman with kids from another man none that i can think of to the husband i would say he and his wife are being extremely irresponsible even if they are financially solvent the world is overpopulated as it is kids is enough and your wife is not an incubator with legs get a vasectomy i don't care what the media puts out there i seriously doubt that things are as rosy as they make it out how can it be when it seems more like a litter than a family i fail to see how they can make it with any decent quality of life financially or emotionally especially when i remember how hard it was at times when i had only one child to raise whom i raised alone without welfare after my marriage ended when she was age but then i suppose that as long as they don't clutter up the welfare rolls it's really no one's business but their own but still doesn't stop us from having an opinion does it lol Infantilism EastEnders Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Divorce Fathers' rights Polyamory About a Boy Domestic violence Laura Schlessinger The Marshall Mathers LP Marriage Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Friends Hillary Rodham Clinton Sexual orientation Charmed Theory of conduct Social rule Rick Santorum Fathers' rights movement in the UK Zoophilia Blonde on Blonde The Fairly OddParents Marilyn Monroe The nature of God in Western theology Cliff Richard Freddy Fender Baby Blues Married... with Children Recurring South Park characters Age disparity in sexual relationships Aerial (dance move) Same-sex marriage Mina Mongoose Philosophical skepticism Childfree Little Britain Dead Like Me Polygamy Kodocha Mojave people Transsexuality Boston Public Jon Secada Ex-gay Emotions (album) The Amber Spyglass Birth control Rich Mullins Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John the Baptist Adoption Yoko Ono Empire Burlesque Past teachings of Prem Rawat Reparative therapy The Good Soldier Daredevil Pedophilia Grief Ten Commandments Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Extreme Programming Eastern Orthodox Church Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Frankie Laine Love Neighbours The Human Stain Fiddler on the Roof History of sex Derek Parfit Gender role Knots Landing YuYu Hakusho True Crime: Streets of LA Hey Jude Incest Pitaten Gross domestic product God Emperor of Dune Ted Kennedy Immortality Days of our Lives LaVeyan Satanism Condom
