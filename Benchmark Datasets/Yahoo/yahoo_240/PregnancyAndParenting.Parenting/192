is this legal child tkane from parents some of you may have read my question yesterday my brother in law got his then month old baby taken away for months because she had skull fracture two happened at once the other was older he and his girlfriend got the baby back after she was in foster care since no else wanted her i cannot take her i'm and live at home since then he's gotten back into his violent behavior of throwing breaking things and hitting people i couldn't understand how they had gotten her back until i realized they didnt his girlfriend's mother got custody after a long battle and has since given the baby to them what can i do about this clearly they were taken away for a reason how can this go on without cps catching on call cps on the grandmother what she did was arguably worse than what they do she purposely evaded the agency that is looking out for her granddaughter's safety and willingly handed her over to her abusers it may be better to just call the police or to call a court clerk to ask what steps you should take cps often involves looking into claims of abuse your sister in law's mother is most likely in violation of a court order which may be acted upon much more quickly than calling cps to resume the investigation when they realize what she did it's unlikely other family members would be able to get the child unless there is some serious court supervision involved but at least the baby wouldn't be with mom or dad considering the situation even though you can report anonymously i would give your information they won't share it with the parents but i know from personal experience that calls are taken more seriously if the caller leaves info after all if you truly are close to the situation and feel a child is in danger you'd want authorities to be able to get as many details as possible for the child's safety which can only be done if they know who you are the fact that you call and you leave your information could salvage your chances of getting visitation with your niece something that may be denied family members for the time being seeing as one close relative has so horribly abused their rights as the baby's guardian 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Fathers' rights Domestic violence Charmed EastEnders Knots Landing Adoption Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Children of God Child support Family Infantilism Incest Divorce Abortion debate Theodicy Kodocha Child custody Fathers 4 Justice Child pornography Child abuse Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Days of our Lives Probation officer Theory of conduct James Bulger Yusuf al-Qaradawi Child sexual abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Plame affair Rape Fancy Crane Daredevil Traumatic brain injury Appeal Jon Secada Angelina Jolie Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Mental Health Act 1983 Transsexuality Classified information Guantanamo Bay Involuntary commitment LiveJournal Henry Lee Lucas Everwood Free will Serial killer British nationality law Stolen Generation Spanking Privacy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eddie Guerrero One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Alois Hitler Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Ethics Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda One Life to Live Rais massacre StarCraft: Uprising Extraordinary rendition Cindy Sheehan Columbine High School massacre USA PATRIOT Act Surveillance About a Boy Ranma __ characters Human rights in the United States Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Satanic ritual abuse Good Times Torture Cult James Hanratty Fred Phelps Sharon Tate Roy Meadow Paradox Neighbours Vivian Solon Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Amish Sin City The Contender (television series) Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks
