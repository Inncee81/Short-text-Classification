my daughter says that she sees ghosts in the house what can i do im not a child and we see them at my fathers house and i am not the only one to see them or hear them either one example i was at my fathers house waiting on my nephew to get in from school i heard the side door open and screen close then the door leading downstairs open and footsteps going down i called his name he did not answer so i went down after him he was not there no one was there and i looked every where including closets and bathroom i went back up to the living room thinking i was just hearing things and i heard footsteps coming back up stairs both the doors opening and the outside door closing i looked outside and no one was there his upstairs main bathroom door will open and close many times a day no explination and when your sitting in the living room you can see a shadow walk past into the hall way doesnt worry me much at all i believe spirits are around us all infact when i was smaller i remember running down the stairs of our story home to go outside and play tripping on my roller skates many yrs ago the skates had metal wheels if that'll give away my age something caught me and sat me down otherwise i would have fallen down flights of stairs this has happened in houses we have lived in one in alabama in texas and my father currently lives in nd unless your daughter is frightened i say do nothing about it if she is frightened you might want to ask her why The Shining (film) Stairway The Star Wars Holiday Special Trapped in the Closet Eastern Illinois University Columbine High School massacre The Brady Bunch What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
