spoiled children my children are draining me the more i try to make them happy the more miserable they are i am an older mom with young children how can i make them understand isn't the same as being your job is not to make them happy your job is to guide them you need some objective outside help so you can change your unsuccessful parenting patterns kids will run you over if you let them the key is to let them know what you expect and hold them accountable for their responses this is not to say you should make their lives miserable you have to be creative in finding ways to enjoy them and let them enjoy you too one thing i learned is the harder you try to get anything done the harder it is to succeed when they demand your attention stop what you're doing and really focus on their needs usually they just need to know you're paying attention and that you care then they'll go entertain themselves for a while and you can actually get more done Pitaten Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Milton H.
