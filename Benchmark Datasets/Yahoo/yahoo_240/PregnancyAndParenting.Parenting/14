my daughter is mt whenever we go out in public places she screams a lot how can we stop her screaming the best thing to do is not to pay attention to her when she is screaming explain to her that that is bad behavior calmly when she isn't screaming tell her that you will not talk to her if she does that again seriously don't talk to her don't just scare her she is a little more than a year now and is capable of understanding do not underestimate her this is also partly your fault children need exposure to all kinds of places and you have to provide her with that exposure do not put her at home all the time and frequent the outdoors it will help her blossom more beautifully Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Milton H.
