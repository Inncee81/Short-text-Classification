i dated a woman who lied about having her tubes tied now she's pregnant supposedly what are my rights here i have proof that she also slept with another man while we were dating and also told him her tubes were tied she has also contacted him to say she is pregnant both of us suspect that she was trying to get pregnant on purpose to get child support as she is currently on welfare with three kids and we are both well off men who seem to have been targetted for this sick game of extortion if she is pregnant and i am the father i want full custody of the child because she lives a life of lies drugs violence and chaos and that is no place for a child i also feel that her current children are in danger and probably should not be allowed to stay with her please tell me i have a chance here any lawyers out there please don't assume that i knew her lifestyle and slept with her anyway that was not at all the case i broke things off after i started finding these things out then suddenly a few weeks later i am contacted by some guy who says that she told him he was the father the same day i got a phone call saying the same thing sigh thanks to those of you offering encouragement i admit i didn't really want a child but if i am the father i definitely want to make sure my child has the best home that i can give him or her i'm in law school but i'm afraid i've yet to take family law basically i think you need a court order for a dna test as soon as the child is born and you need some kind of proof that she's an unfit mother does she have an arrest record has she been reported to the dept of children and family services you could always make a call to them if you know she has drugs in the house and if you suspect she's using drugs while pregnant with your child yikes call dcfs and see what your options are here you can also post your question on lawguru com and if you're well off as you say why not go ahead and meet with a lawyer get your ducks in a row i guess i don't have to advise that in the future you always wear a condom pregnancy isn't the only thing you need to worry about in this day and age if she's a drug user and sleeps around you should be tested for stds men frequently have no symptoms but they can mess you up trich is very common and pretty much symptom less in men but can lead to urinary tract kidney problems later on EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Knots Landing Urinary incontinence Pregnancy Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Fathers' rights Birth control Terri Schiavo Human sexual behavior Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Schapelle Corby Kodocha Condom Obstetrics Folic acid Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Gonorrhoea Premature birth Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Abortion Poker jargon Katelyn Faber Boston Public Mumia Abu-Jamal Rosa Parks Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Infantilism Ben Johnson (athlete) Divorce Extreme Programming Tupac Shakur Fathers' rights movement in the UK Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Endometriosis Child custody Oral sex Big Brother (USA TV series) Plame affair timeline Daredevil Herpes simplex virus Pelvic inflammatory disease Mensal__o scandal Twin Pitaten The Contender (television series) Domestic violence Sexual intercourse Marriage Psoriasis The Death Gate Cycle Days of our Lives Vernon Schillinger Prostitution Kurt Cobain James Hanratty James Bulger 21 July 2005 London bombings The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sin City Miscarriage Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Health insurance Elvis and Me Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Stroke Oral contraceptive Vivian Solon Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Abortion in the United States Sex and the City Survivor (novel) Jam (TV series) 1919 World Series Neighbours Tom DeLay Melanie Wilkes Drug test History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Volkert van der Graaf The Amber Spyglass Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Negima The Smoking Room
