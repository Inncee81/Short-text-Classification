looking for new disipline ideas for children that does not involve spanking i have children between the ags of and and need some ideas of creative disipline if there is such a thing i dont want to spank or padal and the time out thing just does not cut it any suggestions i think it's all about concequences make them relevent and follow through with a sympathetic voice i told you that if you didn't pick your toys up i was going to put them all away for a week shrug shoulders it was your decision to leave them there so now they have to be put away i'm sure when i bring them out next week you'll decide to pick them up when i ask if you do i won't have to put them away again will i or that's a shame your toy got broken did you leave it on the floor i guess you'll just have to save your pocket money up and buy another one it can take a while for them to get it but they will just make sure you dump the responsibility on them if they complain look surprised and say it's hardly my fault you didn't pick your toys up eventually you'll have the other kids saying well what did you expect if another of them complains i'm a champion at this if you want more examples just ask EastEnders The Apprentice 2 The Contender (television series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shawn Michaels Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives Milton H.
