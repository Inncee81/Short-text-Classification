are there any parents here that oppose corporal punishment often when this debate comes up the people who oppose corporal punishment for children are usually assumed to be childless folks who just happened to get ahold of a few child psychology books in my life i have heard a few parents one even had grown kids say that they did not see spankings and whatnot as necessary forms of punishment so i was just wondering if there were any parents here that opposed it and what the reasoning was thanks i'll turn around the old 'pro spanking' argument just for the fun of it my parents never spanked any of us we all turned out fine i'm the th of kids in my family by the way oldest was born in the late 's my parents weren't trendy psychology book reading people so i would imagine that they too were not spanked and that they probably had peer parents that both weren't spanked and didn't spank but anyway spanking was not a necessary teaching method in my family when i was raised i can't imagine why i would choose to physically hurt someone especially my own child when it wasn't necessary that's why we don't spank Spanking Corporal punishment Punishment James Dobson Parenting Homeschooling The Giver Human sexual behavior Paddle (spanking) Erotic spanking Serial killer Theodicy Caning Buttocks Child abuse Infantilism Capital punishment Children of God Transsexuality L.O.C.K.D.O.W.N.
