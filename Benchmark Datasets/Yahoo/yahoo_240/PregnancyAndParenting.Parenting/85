if you suspect a family member of neglect endangerment quick history my sister in law and her husband bought a small house in a small town the house was condemned when they bought it so they paid cash and got it very cheap this was several years ago and they've since had two kids and months they're always telling us how horrible their house is and they won't let anyone visit because they're afrait that cpc will find out which makes me think that cpc should find out would you call them if you were me they aren't excellent parents anyway the kids drink kool aid constantly instead of milk sometimes their mom forgets to fix lunch until in the afternoon and the kids just end up sleeping until dinner etc i'm wondering if i'm doing a disservice to my niece and nephew by not calling or if i'd be stinking my nose where it doesn't belong if i did call what would you do hello i would not stay out of this i would contact cps child protective services immediately with my concerns i am sorry but no matter how cheap a house is children deserve to live in a clean and well repaired house period end of story there are many services to help parents out including wic food stamps and even help from the local dhs department of human services agency that could help them find churches or organizations that can help them repair their house at little or no cost i am sorry and i will probably get flamed for saying this but children deserve to have the best start possible in life and by your sister in law not taking proper care of them it is just inexcusable and neglectful do you have any idea how many childless couples would love to have such precious babies as these and these childless couples would make sure that they had a good roof over their head plenty of nourishing meals to eat and they would receive lots of love and care too i am not trying to sound catty by saying that but children really are a gift and it is our responsibility as parents to do the very best for them that we can i would call cps and it is anonymous so you wouldn't have to give your name or anything but you will have to state to cps what you have observed or what is going on such as alleged neglect abuse etc i don't think you are sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong you care about these children and you know that this just isn't right so it would be a good idea to talk to cps and state your concerns to them about these children you had better believe if it was my nieces or nephews if i noticed and knew that something like this was going on i would call cps because they deserve so much better than being neglected and not getting the proper meals or proper beverages such as milk and water that they need to have also they deserve to live in a clean house that is safe and isn't falling apart Humphrey Bogart The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Kodocha Shaggy dog story Pitaten Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Theory of conduct Rent (musical) Fathers' rights Recurring South Park characters Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Charmed Little Britain Fiddler on the Roof Friends Breath of Fire III Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Abortion debate Fecal incontinence Tooth Babylonian law Marriage Knots Landing Marie Antoinette Breakfast The Smoking Room Survivor (novel) Theodicy Hannibal Lecter Yusuf al-Qaradawi The Amber Spyglass Calvin and Hobbes Child support 613 mitzvot Miss Saigon Adoption Codename: Kids Next Door Marilyn Monroe Phoebe Halliwell Karl Rove Food Garfield Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Fairly OddParents Malcolm in the Middle Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Marshall Mathers LP Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Rais massacre Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Baby Blues Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Roy Meadow Elephant Too Short a Season (TNG episode) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Characters in the Smurfs Beetle in an Anthill Ocean's Twelve RuneScape quests Honey and Clover Poker jargon Dairy AFI 100 Years series Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S__vign__ Make money fast Rich Mullins Tea Jean Schmidt Hillary Rodham Clinton Justification (theology) Meal The Human Stain Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Death Gate Cycle Series finale Polyamory Plame affair timeline Married... with Children The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Cha chaan teng Bruce Johnson
