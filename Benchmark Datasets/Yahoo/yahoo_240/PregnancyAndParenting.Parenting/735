question for all spanking and non spanking parents friendly and polite debate can you say if you're 'pro or anti' spanking give your reason and also explain the benefits you see for the other side for example i choose not to spank because i feel that there is always a way to modify behaviour without using physical punishment and i prefer my children to be raised without any physical force being used i can however see how spanking creates a more 'instant' response in many children and how used correctly provides a good deterrent for children to not misbehave i'm not 'anti' smacking but i definitely don't do it and never will my reasons are that i can always find a way to discipline my children without it and i feel that children should receive natural consequences whenever possible as that is how it will be in the real world i also prefer to set the example to my children and have them see me in control of myself solving problems with talking and actions i can see how spanking would be effective with very stubborn children who aren't easy to discipline and would help the parents get control over the situation very quickly Corporal punishment Punishment Theodicy Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Infantilism Parenting James Dobson Aikido BDSM Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Determinism Microeconomics Adoption Efficiency wages Child time-out Ethics Domestic violence Expert system Transactional analysis Economics Prisoner's dilemma Buttocks Serial killer Philosophy of language Abortion debate Divorce Information Technology Infrastructure Library Sociobiology Social justice Breastfeeding Utilitarianism Collision detection Anger management Incest Ageplay Universal Century Nations and Factions Transsexuality Law of value Fathers' rights Education in the United States Moral Politics Creationism Criticism of libertarianism Erotic spanking The nature of God in Western theology Randomness Policy Debate Social psychology Richard Feynman Sant Thakar Singh Paddle (spanking) Experiment Fecal incontinence Second language acquisition Scientology beliefs and practices Fast bowling Logic Science Dogville Principal-agent problem Autism rights movement Presuppositional apologetics Social rule Caning Free will Radical behaviorism Motivation Consciousness School discipline Politics of Canada Alexander Technique Halting problem Philosophy of space and time Rape Same-sex marriage Philosophy of mathematics Sexual abstinence Diablo II: Lord of Destruction U.S. Electoral College Original sin Esperanto as an international language Religion Problem of Hell Franz Boas Scientific method Modified Newtonian dynamics Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Visual Basic Tai Chi Chuan Karma Kender Physics Strategic management Plame affair Rudolf Hermann Lotze Quantum mechanics
