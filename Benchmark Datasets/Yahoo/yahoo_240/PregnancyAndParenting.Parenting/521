as a parent what are you doing to teach your children how important it is to have their own voice and to make their own decisions if you are a parent of a very small child what things do you plan to do to teach them that it is so important not to just follow the crowd i am a birth mother of three a stepmother to one and a foster mother to two each i have raised to understand they have a voice they are independant and can make their own choices as the ages allow of course they are taught to be respectful in their voicing of opinions to stand up for what they believe in and to do things on their own its very important to make sure a child knows that they have a voice that their opinion counts and they will be listened to as long as they voice such in a respectful manner i will admit my year old is a little to opinionated and is having to learn the hard way that sometimes its just best to keep your mouth shut but its a live and learn situation as a child i was allowed to question my parents descisions when it came to me as long as i was respectful i knew that in the end it was their choice and their word was final but they listened to what i had to say and even sometimes changed their minds because i had a good point as a result i grew up to be the type of adult who doesnt follow crowds i think on my own and do things my way it doesnt always agree with society but i am happy with the outcome of my life i think its important to teach a child that they are individuals and they dont have to follow the crowd i started by letting them make choices at an early age about what they would wear within reason what they would eat what they liked to watch etc i was mindful of what was appropriate but gave them as much liberty in these choices as i could to promote individual thinking i was and still am strict on alot of things but the rules of my house are set and the children know them they are not like my parents rules nor like my grandparents and they even conflict with alot of other parents ideas on the types of rules a child should have but they work for my house my girls are grown now and all have lives of their own they make me proud in the fact that they dont follow trends or try to fit in they choose to stand on their own and be individuals my boys are showing the same signs of individuality and i am grateful that the have listened and learned over the years Infantilism Abortion debate Theory of conduct Objectivist philosophy Pitaten Milton H.
