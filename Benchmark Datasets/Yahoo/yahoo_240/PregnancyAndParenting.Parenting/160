stuggling to be a good mother to both of my children i am sure i will be judged at this question but i want to bare my soul anyway i have two children a little girl almost and a son who is now my problem is that i struggle to bond with my daughter for some reason i often find it hard to touch her and reach out to her which is no problem with my son i am aware of it and have to make special time to have with her and open my heart towards her it is hard to explain and i wondered if anyone else found the same problem my son has always been hard work and very demanding and he will make noise until he gets my attention but my daughter is much more passive for example i spent an hour talking with her at bedtime stroking her and being her mummy but this doesn't happen all the time i have to make it happen and i do totally enjoy this bond between us but it is much harder with her than with my son your experience and advice is greatly appreciated i can't believe how wonderful these answers are you are truly inspriring my daughter is very loving and i tell her hundreds of times a day that i love her but sometimes i find it hard to reciprocate her affection whereas i struggle to get cuddles from her brother and i will actively seek them out from him dad and i are married he is great with our kids in fact eons better at parenting than i am i guess i just have to keep doing what i am we have our own time every week and i make time every single day for her to make sure she knows i love her even if i don't appear to show it during the day thanks i guess i am a good mom after all i just wish i could give them both all the time how do i achieve that i didn't read much of people's answers but i am moved to answer your question for my own reasons if you can i would recommend you talk with a good therapist i'll explain why but try to find someone you like and feel comfortable with and talk with her about your daughter and your feelings for her it sounds like you are very aware of how you feel and you are doing whatever it takes to be sure your daughter grows up without any doubt that she is loved i don't mean to sound difficult but i think kids can really tell what's going on that's why i think you should find a good therapist to talk to don't settle for someone who is just okay or you figure is probably fine or you don't particularly connect with it can take a while to find someone you can work well with the reason i recommend this is that i am a mother of kids and i had and have issues all my love about whether my mother loved me or not i know she loved my brother and i was never conscious of being jealous because i didn't really want her love the thing is that children do want their mother to love them and it's not a good situation when a child learns to not care if their mother loves them or not i've been working on this issue for a long time and it is something i just think is a part of me but i do wish my mother could have found a way to show her love for me in a way that i could take in she died when i was yrs old so that obviously complicates things too i think you sound like a wonderful mother and you are clearly aware of the need for your daughter to feel loved just don't let it become only that About a Boy Transactional analysis Avenue Q Sant Thakar Singh Breastfeeding Autism Theory of conduct Milton H.
