don't know who the biological father is and i wanna adopt my stepson i been with my girl since my step son was months old he is now and we plan on getting married later this year for her birthday how do i go about adopting him if there's no biological father at all do i got to get a lawyer for this and are there cheap lawyers for stuff like this where in texas minutes outside houston my step son was months old when i meet my girl he is years old now my husband adopted my two children so i know the laws here fairly well they vary from state to state but in general you will need to get a lawyer to file all the papers for you usually this will require that you make a good faith effort and the judge decides if you have met this obligation to find the child's biological father to get permission if you do find the father chances are he will sign off his rights immediately and you won't have a problem there even if he refuses to do so since he hasn't been in the child's life he won't have a leg to stand on in the eyes of the court if you can't discover the real father's identity you will have to pay for an attorney ad lidum to represent his interests in the court and of course that is significantly more expensive you will also have to wait for at least a year after you are married before you can start the process the court may also order that social services investigate your home and your relationship with the child but since you have been in the child's life this long you may be able to skip this step the process took months for us but if you can't find the father it will probably take longer for you it cost us about good luck getting all this done email if you have any other questions Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Lawyer Marriage Supreme Court of the United States Fathers' rights Child support Abortion debate Legal aspects of transsexualism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Law of the People's Republic of China 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Roe v.
