weight training for mma fighter i would hit the gym about times a week to work on heavy weight training since like most males liked being very strong and look built i would also take a supplement called celltech every now and then i am a lightweight and i got quite big but then realized the muscle mass was slowing me down in my boxing the strength i acquired helps me push guys around while grappling but made me a bit slower my coach told me i don't need to lift heavy weights at all several guys have told me that bulking up will really slow down my boxing basically i want to know some of your weight lifting workouts i've been considering circuit weight training added on to my regular cardio workouts so what do you all do to keep strong and look muscular and roids are not an option yet remain speedy and fluid a few years ago i ran into the same question after talking with a couple of personal trainers and some close friends who are weight lifters i've come to this conclusion in essence your body is built to handle a certain amount of bulk while performing at your optimum speed and agility if you go beyond that then you will lose speed agility and believe it or not straight up hitting power even though by then you can bench press a city bus you are also more prone to muscle tear at a larger size especially when grappling i am technically a middle weight but a few years ago i was fighting heavy weights do to a rather large gain of muscle mass no roids just supplements i was getting my a handed to me all the time at that weight by both heavy weights and a couple of middle weights i lost alot of speed and hitting power from bulking up so i decided to try circuit training and uping my cardio huge difference after a year i was back into middle weight class and faster than ever i also looked better because the circuit training did more for toning than straight up weight training i was able to hit harder do to a better core work out from the combination of both circuit and cardio my advice would be tone what you've got find what your optimal weight is and run with it bruce lee or oscar de la hoya did not or do not look like punks but niether of them are what you would call big good luck Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Bodybuilding Boxing Unreal Martial art Muscle The Contender (television series) Drill bit Internal ballistics Computer M16 (rifle) CPU design Weightlifting Terminal ballistics Knife Jet engine Armored Core Urinary incontinence Triathlon Boxing training Tank Mass Exercise Dog agility Heinkel He 112 Swingout Poker jargon Sport rowing Swimming Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Heinkel He 100 Explosive material Carburetor Passenger car 24 Hours of Le Mans Professional wrestling throws Rugby union positions Table tennis Skateboarding trick Car handling Puberty Professional wrestling slang Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
