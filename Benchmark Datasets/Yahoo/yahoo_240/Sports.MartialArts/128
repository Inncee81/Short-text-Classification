learning martial arts without an instructor there are a few classes around here but they're like tae kwon do and karate every miles if i wanted to learn something exotic like ninjitsu or muay thai could i just study the books diligently please use the money you would waste on books and videos on a good karate or tkd class i know you probably don't want to go there because you have heard some bad things or because it's not the cool art at the moment but consider this you are not stuck with one art you can always do another art when you are older and or move to another area i wanted to learn kendo i studied in japan for a year and came back home where there were no schools but ended up learning iai instead i am very happy i did i have gone back to kendo once or twice for seminars and i realize i had a lot of new prespective i didn't have before and it helped me greatly your first art will teach you many other things other than technique like discipline focus quick reaction time hard work ethic etc when you switch to another art the instructor will not have to teach you these things and no matter what you will always be able to find something helpful to retain technique wise so my advice to you is to find one of those karate tkd schools that you can stomach and stick with it you might love it you might be able to switch later but you will be training which you won't do by reading books Martial art Muay Thai Aikido Mixed martial arts Kata (martial arts) Chinese martial arts Kendo Ninjutsu Iaido Eskrima Bruce Lee Hapkido Kickboxing Ninja Tai Chi Chuan Shotokan Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Genseiryu Pitaten Bas Rutten Goju Ryu American Kenpo Past teachings of Prem Rawat Graduate school The Book of Five Rings Tekken characters Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Jeet Kune Do Kung fu Anko Itosu Eagle Claw Punch (strike) Robert Garcia Ryo Sakazaki 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kenpo Blood on the Tracks Korean martial arts Milton H.
