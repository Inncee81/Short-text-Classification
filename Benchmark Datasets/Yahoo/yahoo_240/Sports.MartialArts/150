muay thai information or persuade me to other martial art alright well we have a muay thai school by us and i was considering taking it heres a few aspects its dollars a month for classes per week there is no belt system i guess they want traditional style i called the school but they gave me no real descriptive answers its called the ohio muay thai academy does anyone know anything about this what types of exercises will we practice i want all details on muay thai and also if you suggest any other martial art over this one please let me know i live in ohio so obviously some are limited muay thai is a combat sport known as the art of eight limbs because you can punch kick elbow and knee thai boxers are known for harder kicks cause they kick with the shin instead of the foot also generating power from the hips rather than snapping from the leg most of the moves are simple no fancy movements and pretty powerful making it a very popular stand up art in competition striking like k and mma like ufc also kinda unique to muay thai is the clinch aka neck wrestling where two thai boxers are holding around each others necks often times delivering knees to the body and if your lucky enough to pull the other person's head down that a knee to the face thai boxing shouldnt have belts its similar to western boxing in the since that you train and compete without colored belts to establish your ranking if you choose to compete your record will be your ranking thai boxing training is similar to western boxing training they both focus on conditioning you'll probably be running alot and doing a lot of push ups sit ups squats lunges medicine ball training and jump roping thai boxers work on focus mitts like boxers for punches and thai pads for kicks knees and elbows also you'll be hitting the heavy bag thai bag too and you'll do shadow boxing a lot too they'll start you off with basics of course how to wrap your hands proper stance moving around different punches kicks etc and then work you into combos blocks and counter attacks all the technicals things about the sport once you got all the basic stuff down and the coach thinks you are ready you'll start sparring if you want to to learn timing reading an opponent all that fun stuff bucks for twice a week sounds kinda steep to me though my gym offers classes x a week throughout the day and you can go to as many classes as you want to and that is per month like i said muay thai is becoming popular throughout mma so if you find a mma gym they'll probably teach muay thai and perhaps cheaper as for other arts to take it depends on what you are looking for and how the local teachers instruct for instance if there is karate in your area and they teach you how to realistically fight and focuses on conditioning sparring etc then go for it but then again there could be a karate dojo that is just teaching you b s and cashing in on you if you chose not to do muay thai see if you can drop by whatever art you are considering taking and see how they train ask it they participate in any tournaments or matches and see how well they do see if they spar full contact of for points avoid points if you are looking for self defense or in ring fighting see how long the instructor has been doing martial arts teaching or if he won any competitions http www history com minisite do content type minisite generic content type id display order mini id Wing Chun Shotokan Volleyball Hapkido Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Strike (attack) Tenshinhan Boxing training Professional wrestling match types Wushu PRIDE Suplex Professional wrestling Royce Gracie Grappling Skateboarding trick Wanderlei Silva Goju Ryu Rugby union Weight training Breaststroke Softball Baseball Bruce Lee Kyokugenryu Karate Eagle Claw Swingout Guilty Gear Archery Capoeira Kumite Powerbomb Naruto jutsu Shawn Michaels Jeet Kune Do Kata (martial arts) Computer and video game genres Shoot boxing Neckbreaker American football Table tennis K-1 Ultimate (sport) Muhammad Ali Savate Professional wrestling slang Leon White Glossary of American football Fast bowling Japanese tea ceremony Kurt Angle Marching band Nunchaku Swimming Sport YuYu Hakusho Dog agility Diving MapleStory Shoe Glossary of climbing terms Lightsaber combat Kyokushin Welterweight Fencing Horse Pump It Up Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Sumo Greg Valentine Piccolo Junior Saga Paintball
