i am interested in starting jujitsu i would like to know what it incorporates and weather it is well rounded practitioner of judo for and a half years well i can only comment on brazillian jiu jitsu becuase that's what i do it's not very well rounded at all at my school we concentrate about of our time on the ground game and the other on takedowns no striking or weapon defense a lot of it is geared toward competition grappling with that said doing bjj will make you extremely good on the ground and that's it my bjj experience has been the polar opposite of what someone described earlier as a jack of all trades master of none style is this a good thing it depends on what you want i love it because i think it's fun and i compete for self defense it's not so good by itself that's why i kickbox as well in most street fights you want to stay off the ground but many street fights i have witnessed still go to the ground so it can be usefull although it's especially useless if multiple opponents are involved i don't think i need to explain why but if that's the case you're probably going to get your kicked anyway with that said it depends on what you want if you do bjj you will be very good on the ground and in combination with your judo experience you will have a very well rounded grappling game but it sounds like some of these other styles have it all tough choice jack of all trades master of none or grappling master what to do what to do edit i also have to add that i agree with samurai if you can find a school that incorporates all those styles equally that would probably be the best place to train if well roundedness is your main goal however be very careful if you find one single instructor that claims to be a master of all these styles there's a good chance that it's bullshido if you found a school that has a resident black belts in each of those arts whom are reputable and competition tested you've landed on a gold mine Jujutsu Martial art Judo Royce Gracie Muay Thai Aikido Taekwondo Grappling Ultimate Fighting Championship Karate Football (soccer) Professional wrestling holds Capoeira Tennis Eskrima Professional wrestling throws Eagle Claw Poker jargon Tai Chi Chuan Norway national football team Rugby union Boxing Kickboxing Jeet Kune Do Hapkido Savate Ra (board game) Pittsburgh Steelers Skateboarding trick Kalarippayattu Akuma (Street Fighter) Bruce Lee Masahiko Kimura Ultimate (sport) Black belt (martial arts) Eternal Champions Extreme Programming Piccolo Junior Saga Lightsaber combat Double Dragon Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Gliding Shoot boxing Social rule Fencing RuneScape skills B-47 Stratojet M16 (rifle) Sub-Zero Warrior (World of Warcraft) Counter-Strike Super Bowl XXVII Rugby league Kajukenbo Volleyball Korean martial arts Miyamoto Musashi Wrestling Sambo (martial art) The Contender (television series) Lincoln-Douglas Debate West Bromwich Albion F.C.
