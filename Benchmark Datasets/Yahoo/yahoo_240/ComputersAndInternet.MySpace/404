i have a myspace question if they are cracking down on deleting profiles does that mean if put up pictures with phrases that joke about stalking and hiding dead bodies will i get deleted they are not actually cracking down on deleting profiles that is just another rumor that keeps circling every once in awhile there are at least million profiles on myspace it is just totally impossible for the people at myspace to actually go through people's profiles or bulletins one by one and actually delete profiles or save them from being deleted as stated in another rumor if you are reported by another myspacer for the pictures phrases because they think they're offensive then maybe they'd take action but it's highly highly unlikely there is no one working for myspace that is actually out looking for people to delete contrary to popular belief they only delete people if they actually violate the terms of service and someone reports them so make sure people know that you're joking or set the album of those pictures so that only your friends can see them or something after you sign in click add edit photos then click friends only next to the album here are all the terms of service tos that apply to what you choose to post on your profile regarding the pictures phrases you're talking about i suggest you read through them real quick and make sure you don't violate any of them content posted myspace com may delete any content that in the sole judgment of myspace com violates this agreement or which may be offensive illegal or violate the rights harm or threaten the safety of any person myspace com assumes no responsibility for monitoring the myspace services for inappropriate content or conduct if at any time myspace com chooses in its sole discretion to monitor the myspace services myspace com nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the content no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate content and no responsibility for the conduct of the user submitting any such content you are solely responsible for the content that you post on or through any of the myspace services and any material or information that you transmit to other members and for your interactions with other users myspace com does not endorse and has no control over the content content is not necessarily reviewed by myspace com prior to posting and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of myspace com myspace com makes no warranties express or implied as to the content or to the accuracy and reliability of the content or any material or information that you transmit to other members content activity prohibited the following is a partial list of the kind of content that is illegal or prohibited to post on or through the myspace services myspace com reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who in myspace com's sole discretion violates this provision including without limitation removing the offending communication from the myspace services and terminating the membership of such violators prohibited content includes but is not limited to content that in the sole discretion of myspace com is patently offensive and promotes racism bigotry hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual contains nudity violence or offensive subject matter or contains a link to an adult website includes a photograph of another person that you have posted without that person's consent myspace tos http www myspace com index cfm fuseaction misc terms mytoken ad b c bdf d c a a ae Independent Media Center LiveJournal Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Motion picture rating system Treaty Abortion debate Freedom of speech Spyware Plame affair Article One of the United States Constitution Pornography Hate speech Separation of church and state Supreme Court of the United States Public domain Appeal Copyright Stopping e-mail abuse Constitution of Ireland First Amendment to the United States Constitution Consensual crime MySpace Internet troll Censorship in Australia Classified information Child pornography Democracy Children of God Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Wikipedia Drug abuse OpenDocument Australian constitutional law Contract SCO v.
