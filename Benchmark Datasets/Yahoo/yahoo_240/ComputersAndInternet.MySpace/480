myspace song stealer i lyk a song on sumones myspace profile and i want to add it but they hide it and i dont know the name of it so is der anyway dat i kuld find out the artist or the name of the song witout asking her thanx you could unhide the player by disabling styles on your browser in firefox go to view page style no page style disabling stylesheets in ie is a pain and i don't recommend it as it messes with the registry just use the slightly harder technique below with the player visible you can use the add link remember to enable styles back when you're done here's another solution but it's not for the easily confused same idea though view the person's source code to do this right click for their profile and click on view source code or something like that a text editor should open with their source code in it now you have to find the music player code search for var s within the text editor and it should bring you to an area in the code like this script type text javascript language javascript cdata var s something so addparam allowscriptaccess always so addvariable culture en us so write mini script but instead of a something there should be a url copy and paste the url into your address bar and a huge myspace player should show which has the add link you could use to add the song to your profile Web page Ajax (programming) Mozilla Application Suite Gmail Mozilla Firefox Cross site scripting HTML element Macromedia Flash JavaScript Cascading Style Sheets HTTP cookie Opera (web browser) Wiki Unicode XSL Transformations Search engine optimization Forth programming language HyperCard Hello world program Website ITunes Uniform Resource Locator World Wide Web Bookmarklet Perl XML HTML editor Link spam International Phonetic Alphabet Greasemonkey User agent Web browser MySpace Slashdot trolling phenomena Scalable Vector Graphics PHP Computer virus Google Maps Konqueror Chinese character Click fraud Object-oriented programming SAML XForms Captcha AmigaOS Internet Explorer Web design Emacs Ebook HTML ActionScript About: Quotation mark Client-side scripting Hyperlink Python programming language Google search AppleScript Computer Sherlock (software) Pointer RuneScape cheats Password Spyware Obfuscated code Morse Code Wget IPod Portable Document Format Scripting language Netscape Communications Corporation Internationalized domain name Atari 8-bit family C Sharp Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hash table Unix Windows XP Favicon NetCaptor JScript .NET Associative array Music genre Windows 2000 ZX Spectrum XHTML Digital rights management AOL Instant Messenger Java programming language RuneScape quests Mac OS X
