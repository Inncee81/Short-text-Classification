what would be a reason you could think of to take someone off your friendslist give me at least reasons as to why you'd delete a friend on myspace i want a list of real friends and not a bunch of strangers some people try to collect a mob of strangers to look popular but i want friends who really interact with me if months go by without a word i tend to delete them they are starting drama on other people's pages and their page is full of people's retaliation comments to their insults and i don't want any part of it i just like to keep my list small i actually visit everybody's pages and blogs and read them and i only have so much time in a day a smaller list means i actually can interact with my friends again because i don't like to collect strangers i want to interact with the people on my list would be impossible to interact with on a meaningful level i thought he wanted to be friends but he is just chasing booty if i say i'm not looking then i'm not one guy i deleted because he kept leaving crude comment graphics with naked women in them on my page i didn't like that all over my page the announcement a day spammers have to go the pass then on to friends and if you get it back you are loved e mail spammer has to go too spam only tastes good with eggs their page is suddenly set up to appear like an advertisement i've made tons of money sealing envelopes at home are you interested in a business opportunity blah they have really really creepy friends that start visiting my page and leaving weird comments and i just don't like their crowd and i don't know them that well anyway a blog entry put me off like a racist rant or something politically charged that tainted my feelings toward them enough E-mail spam Gmail Blog Stopping e-mail abuse Little Britain Theory of conduct EastEnders Andrew Sullivan Neopets Internet phenomenon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Shaggy dog story Make money fast Link spam One Tree Hill (TV series) Social software E-mail Friends Kodocha Search engine optimization Ocean's Twelve Cindy Sheehan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Privacy Knots Landing Goatse.cx Internet troll Ludwig Wittgenstein H2G2 Philosophy of language Kender The Best Page in the Universe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Trusted computing Daredevil Surveillance Electrophysiology Prank flash Fahrenheit 9/11 Extreme Championship Wrestling Internet fraud FidoNet Undergrads Spam Prevention Early Warning System Kill Bill Homestar Runner Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Samurai Deeper Kyo Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Frank Sinatra The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Paul Is Dead Prisoner's dilemma Oasis (band) Time Out of Mind Internet forum Ren and Stimpy Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Major League Baseball television contracts Whois MAME Independent Media Center Spidey Super Stories Religious Society of Friends South Park Objectivist philosophy Plame affair Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Meta-reference America Online Megan Griffin Email authentication James T.
