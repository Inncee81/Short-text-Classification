do you ever stop yourself from sending friend requests altho you so want to do it and rather hope for some odd in life to put your profile in their way for them to send you a friend request first im not sure if that made sense but i'll try to explain it i've had friends in the past high school for example that i really liked at one point but you know how after high school everyone goes different ways now im in college and i happen to bump with their profiles once in a while but for some reason i dont send them friend request altho i want real bad because i start thinking that maybe they will feel odd or wont have something in common with me anymore especially now that it's been over years and they seem to have changed in ways i think hat they might be creeped out instead especially if they are the opposite sex what are your experiences yes that allways happenes to me Kodocha Avenue Q Atomic Kitten Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Religious Society of Friends God Emperor of Dune Infantilism Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Theory of conduct Free will The Lovely Bones RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Craps Shaggy dog story Teen Girl Squad Transsexuality Sexual orientation Witches (Discworld) Poker jargon Strap-on dildo Traumatic incident reduction Futurama (TV series - season 5) Year of the Spider Nico Robin Directed-energy weapon Luck W.I.T.C.H.
