what about myspace is so special myspace is cool for like mintutes but then it gets boring why are all these people obsessed with it going on for like hours every day doesnt it get lame after awhile it's not that cool unless you like getting spam mail from naked girls and band requests and not taking that real time to keep up with your actual friends i have had friends come over to my house time and time again and have me sit there while they use my internet and check their myspace profile and messages people didn't used to be that rude when we just had e mail did they and using it at work i know people who have been fired for using it too much besides half the time back when i had myspace the sight was crashed and i couldn't log in anyway and people where hacking into pages it got too big too fast myspace is not for me the only thing it was good for was connecting with old friends but there was so much other bs to get around that is made it not worth it i prefer my friends calling me and actually hanging out there are plenty of things to check out without myspace than again i do live in a huge city and not everyone has that i guess it's for some and not for others MySpace E-mail spam E-mail Gmail Make money fast Nine Inch Nails Internet fraud Time Out of Mind Viral marketing .hack//INFECTION Good Morning, Vietnam GameFAQs message boards Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Spam (electronic) AOL Instant Messenger Usenet CPU cache Internet slang Social software Web crawler Fall Out Boy Stopping e-mail abuse Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside .hack//SIGN Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Little Britain Blood on the Tracks Domain Name System Sluggy Freelance Hey Arnold!
