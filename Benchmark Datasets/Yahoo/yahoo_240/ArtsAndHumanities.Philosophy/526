can the peopleof the dead rise again welll the people that are dead are dead so can the come back to life there is no such thing as dead people but i know what you mean you mean dead when the soul leaves the body think of it this way people appear dead to us because we see the body without life it is because the soul which is made of energy chose to leave the body yes that is right the soul chose to it is what the soul did because it believes it will not serve it anymore to remain in physical form you must understand that the soul is always longing to be free and be light as it is that is why we sleep the soul always comes back to being itself because it enjoys being itself more that being with the body and mind you feel the freedom your soul is enjoying whenever you dream you must understand too that to be with the body and mind is such a great burden to the soul because it cannot be completely what it is when the soul is with the body it has to conform only to what the body and the mind can do know and believe and that would be too many limits mainly physical limits the soul only chooses to be with the physical world when it is eager to experience itself as something within our physical world for example when it is eager to know itself as a bringer of light it would choose to separate itself from the great light which is the source of all of us because as long as it is surrounded by the great light it cannot know that it can give light now will the soul be convinced to go back to its late body once more once it has decided that it has already experienced what it came with the body for the body and the mind could try to convince the soul to remain because the body and the mind will seek as much as possible their preservation so they will argue when the soul sees that yes the body and the mind might have a point that maybe the soul would experience some more of what it came to do then it would indeed return to be with the body but this reason to come back must be a hell of a great reason knowing the way some of us is living our lives today monotonously and some are even asking what is the point in living is there some more hell of great reasons for the soul to come back Soul Phaedo Out-of-body experience Incarnations of Immortality Immortality Dualism (philosophy of mind) Christian eschatology Jewish eschatology Animism Simone Weil The Amber Spyglass Afterlife Rudolf Hermann Lotze Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human Hell Heaven Sri Aurobindo A Course In Miracles Kain (Legacy of Kain) Reincarnation Moral objectivism Socrates Summa Theologiae Vishnu sahasranama Human nature Egyptian pyramids Sant Mat God Divine grace Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hinduism Supernatural Virtual Realm Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Eastern Orthodox Church Consciousness Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Emanuel Swedenborg Meaning of life Subud Angel Sanctuary Dharma Advaita Vedanta Problem of Hell Jon Secada Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Resurrection of Jesus Micronauts Religion Mind Infantilism The Invisibles Rudolf Steiner Philosophy of perception The Death Gate Cycle Hindu philosophy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Ghost Books of Blood Jean Grey Exorcism Max Planck Astral projection Bah__'__ Faith and Science Kosas The Subtle Knife Infinity Person Arthur Schopenhauer Siegfried Schtauffen Social psychology Evolutionary creationism Ekadasi Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses The Unquiet Dead Carl Jung Kender Abortion debate Original sin Science Avenue Q Psychopannychism Burkhard Heim One Tree Hill (TV series) Nicomachean Ethics David Hume Mojave people Free will John Wesley Paradise Lost Death
