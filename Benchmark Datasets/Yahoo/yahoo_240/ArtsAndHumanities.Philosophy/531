does anyone else dislike that psychic'' sylvia browne i was outraged when i looked at her website http www sylvia org home readings cfm and saw that she charges for a psychic reading and her psychic reading lasts only minutes long this is in u s dollars and i'm on disability in canada that would eat up the entire funds for a month of my disability pay and that does not include the long distance bill that would accrue she doesn't even have a number to call she has written over books many being bestsellers i don't know why i read one that was total crap she is sooooo rich and she can't even afford to have a number or give to the poor by lowering her prices my son was right when he stated in his will suicide note that greed rules the world it even says on her site that her and her son are the best psychic readers in the world such conceit i believe that edgar cayce was the best psychic that ever lived in north america dear barbielady i'm not bitter about being poor because i'm not poor at all i make a thousand dollars a month because i have a rare form of muscular distrophy my husband is on disability as a result of the loss of our son i thought of suing the company that produced the pills that killed him but i did not want to make a cent or profit over his death p s there are many class action suits against this company and i live a comfortable life which is all that i pray to god for i do not want to be rich with money being rich to me is not money to me but being happy loved and i even though i am not financially rich i am rich inside my heart because i give a lot of money to the homeless take them out for a meal and even buy clothes for them being rich to me is being a giver not a taker barbielady i am sorry to disappoint you but i have never felt any jealousy over anyone with a happy'' living son i still have another son and a daughter who is married and they have a child of their own if you have a ''happy living son'' and he commits suicide don't ask for my sympathy dear lyyman you have stated ''she is charging those big fees so she can help you '' she's actually helping herself i have been to several psychics in canada and the most i ever paid for a psychic was canadian i had also been to see naturopath hypnotist who only charged me canadian when i said i was outraged by her prices let me rephrase that her prices are outragous a better way of putting it is she has the audacity to charge these rates as well lyyman what i said to barbielady is not for you to comment on because she said something to me that was hurtful about my son and i had a right to respond to let her know that she is heartless and has not walked in my family's shoes so that was between me and her dear believer the reason why i ended up on her site was because i had joined montel's website and signed up for his newsletter then greedy sylvia thinks she can start sending her newsletters to me trying to sell her stuff that's how i ended up on her site i know all about her and her son's biography she's also told us enough about herself etc while on montel she also claims that she is years old and by the way years ago was probably the going rate so she was overcharging people by even in those days she was ripping people off you also state '' call montel williams get on his show and she doesn't charge a dime if she was greedy she wouldn't offer her services once a week every week for free for the past years wrong you might not realize this but if she wasn't on his show she wouldn't have any best sellers she uses his show because it is so popular to sell her books it's all a gimmick that's how she makes her money hello believer you state ''you sound very bitter sounds like you are using her as an outlet for your anger sorry but you don't sound like a happy person at all '' sorry but if you're calling me bitter then that would make you bitter don't you know by all the types of books you've read i saw your profile and you have said you've read books by neale walsch etc so have i you state ''i may not be able to change the world but i if i can change one person's world than i am happy '' if you have ever read the course in miracles it states to tell others that they are right as well in louise hay's book it states ''would you rather be right or be happy'' which is a quotation from the course in miracles'' how can you be happy as your calling me bitter i am not angry with sylvia brown but i find that her prices are unfair i would prefer you not to use the word bitter with me i have cried an ocean of tears since our son has passed away two years ago believer continued when our son died i went into shock for about eight months i have felt his pain when he committed suicide i have also felt the pain of my husband and others who witnessed his body after he jumped stories to his death i am still feeling the pain of my other son and daughter and son in law i am crying as i write this try losing a year old son who was not only a son to me but like a brother and a best friend and feel not only your sorrow but the sorrow of all who knew and loved him as far as taking my anger out on sylvia brown as you stated i wrote her an email and gave her a compliment once which i will not go into i will apply one of the principles of the course in miracles you are right but the word is not ''bitter'' but grieving however i do write lovely poems and try to laugh as much as i can because humor is truly the best medicine dear captain savvy you're right sylvia brown shows no emotions at all when she answers peoples questions like who killed my brother and did he suffer etc '' but i've seen montel in tears a lot when he hears details concerning matters like these p s when anyone charges outragous rates like that i would question the authenticity of this person and run in the other direction when i see her i can imagine spittle just flying all ove the place plus her nails always look so dirty and she keeps putting
