how to find inner peace and happiness i feel that i just want to know what others have to say about this what have you done in your life to find it i learned to look at the positive in every situation because no matter how crappy a situation is there is always something to be learned from it i also learned to live my life with no regrets do unto others as you would have done unto you or something like that in other words if it would hurt me to have someone do something to me i don't do it to anyone else i live my life freely i make my own choices and i follow my own desires i let my parents tell me what they believe is best but i still listen to my heart when making decisions i don't let the people around me influence those decisions without having done the research myself i choose happiness every day i don't live in a happy situation but i choose to be happy regardless i am working to change the situation and when i am able will do so until then i refuse to let it define who i am instead i define who i am i give whenever i have anything extra it makes me feel happy and complete i am not a selfish person i don't try to hoarde what i cannot use in a reasonable amount of time if i have something extra i find a good home for it if i have extra money i save some and i use some to better someone else's life i work with habitat for humanity the best organization i have ever been a part of i volunteer whenever i get free time the great thing is they don't make demands on my time i show up whenever i can i do something unexpectedly nice for a complete stranger whenever the mood strikes sometimes i'll pay for a meal for an elderly couple before i leave a restaurant i often pay for a meal for a veteran which is my small way of thanking them for serving our country before i did sometimes i'll give the cashier in a grocery store an extra and tell him or her to apply it to the next person's bill sometimes i'll visit someone that i know is lonely an elderly church member a neighbor who is house ridden etc and bring a meal and puzzle or board game you have to find your own peace but it starts with being comfortable with yourself and who you are from there build out and learn to make others happy too without sacrificing your own peace Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Utilitarianism Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic inequality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Current teachings of Prem Rawat Love Expert system Fasting Alcoholics Anonymous Alignment (role-playing games) Poker jargon Chess strategy and tactics Consensus decision-making Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Altruism Sant Thakar Singh 1957 World Series Freeters Nicomachean Ethics Pitaten Transactional analysis Opus Dei Economics Infantilism Supply and demand Externality Bernard Williams Objectivist philosophy Evil Tenshinhan Meaning of life Theodicy Kender Parasite singles Incarnations of Immortality Paradox Appeal Scientology beliefs and practices Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Publicly funded medicine Tip Religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Gift economy Social rule Religious conversion Rosa Parks Transsexuality Free will The Catcher in the Rye English grammar Sexual orientation Traumatic incident reduction The Human Stain Mojave people Humphrey Bogart Summa Theologiae The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie W.I.T.C.H.
