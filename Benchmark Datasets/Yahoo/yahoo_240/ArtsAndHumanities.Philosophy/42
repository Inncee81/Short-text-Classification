did you know the biggest miracle of mother theresa what was yours mother theresa's biggest miracle as i see it was how a timid person with a cotton sari blouse a pair of sandals and a bucket moved the world gandhi was too in many ways a 'mother theresa' of his times in a much different way i had a great uncle who was a monsignoir with the hungarian catholic church in budapest he didn't know english but loved the laughter of young people and would come sit by us and laugh with us i often translated for him in german as we had that in common as our communicative language and his endearing laugh gave us so much peace when he watched tv with us or just sat at our table instead of the older people it was a blessing i hope one of my miracles was being a part of a person's life who brought so much peace to others but i think truly it was that he offered me the miracle of peace in order to take care of my special needs child because that has been very difficult despite that others tell me how patient i am i got that patience from my uncle Mother Teresa Whose Line Is It Anyway?
