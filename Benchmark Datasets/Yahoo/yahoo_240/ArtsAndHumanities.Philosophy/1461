so how do you determine a good choice is the choices you make the least selfish or is it whatever most you can get i know when buying things you want to get the most for your money is that the same in relationships do you strive to make the most unselfish decisions when i make choices i try to make ethical and moral choices that i feel good with based on my life and the people that are in my life that are affected by my choices i am not a selfish person i always think of others then again we have to do what is good for us but in the overall big picture with again the people i choose to have in my life good choices make your life and others shine you can always tell when you make a good choice in life you feel great thats how you know its not being selfish to take care of yourself and feel good about you because when you can feel this way you can shine your light to others that have not made good choices in their own lives Alignment (role-playing games) Ethics John Howard Yoder Goodness and value theory Evil Coercion Objectivist philosophy Economics Altruism Love Ethical consumerism Sexual orientation Nicomachean Ethics Polyamory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Confucius Abortion debate Utilitarianism Moral objectivism Simone Weil Derek Parfit Theodicy Theory of conduct Morality Economic inequality Social justice Friedrich Schleiermacher Prisoner's dilemma Conscience S__ren Kierkegaard Bernard Williams Predestination Honesty Happiness Health insurance Individualism Microeconomics Moral Politics Game theory Urantia Public policy Human nature Free will The Selfish Gene Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Externality Decision making Scientology beliefs and practices Pitaten Social progress Value system Gratitude Sant Thakar Singh Force (Star Wars) Cinematography Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Non-aggression principle Socrates Infantilism DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Summa Theologiae LaVeyan Satanism Fasting Paternalism Childfree Social psychology Economic anthropology Technocratic movement Yusuf al-Qaradawi Adam Smith Meme Michael Lerner (rabbi) Divine grace Uneconomic growth Supply and demand Capitalism Value Gender role Homosexuality and Christianity Surplus value Euthanasia Ethics in religion Japanese values Animal rights Lie Hillel the Elder Ethics and evolutionary psychology Expert system Two Treatises of Government Numerology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion in the United States Determinism Natural law Homo economicus Moral code
