why does society think it is bad to be an alcoholic the guy that killed himself after writing the book leaving las vegas just wanted to drink without being judged or saved or bothered unfortunately most people who drink cause many problems for others that being said i have read about the author of leaving las vegas and it does sound like he was an unobtrusive drinker by choice and did not want to be bothered by others he was also a great writer obviously so his gift is missed however i think that society does a lot of judging across the board and if someone makes a decision to maintain their drinking of large amounts of alcohol no judgment of labels here then as long as the behavior does not have an adversary affect on others so be it they have to remain away from hurting others not drive etc otherwise to each their own Mothers Against Drunk Driving Alcoholism Evil Theory of conduct Hunter S.
