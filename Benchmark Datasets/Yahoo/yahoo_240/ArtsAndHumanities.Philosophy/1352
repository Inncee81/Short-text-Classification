from living life what have you discovered about yourself the world and learning i'll start with learning the more we know the more we realize we don't know if someone thinks they have all the answers they need to ask themselves bigger questions along the same lines i'll quote a minister i knew theres nothing more dangerous than a religious fanatic who knows he is right but now i'm getting into knowledge of the world the world is all about balance our relationship with the world is best when we seek to find balance light and dark sleep and wakefulness joy and sadness etc note viewing our planet from afar light and dark are half the globe is sunlit half is dark but the shade on the lit side probably balances the moon and starlight on the dark side as for myself i have learned to look at issues and life from many perspectives not just one to see the world from the eyes of others and to walk in their shoes how can i be a good parent if i cannot see the world from a child's perspective seeing from varying perspectives gives me a greater appreciation of life and allow me to love more fully wonderful question very thought provoking thank you Force (Star Wars) Shaggy dog story Socrates Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Out-of-body experience Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Darth Vader Fundamentalism Children of Dune Terranigma Origin belief Moon Milton H.
