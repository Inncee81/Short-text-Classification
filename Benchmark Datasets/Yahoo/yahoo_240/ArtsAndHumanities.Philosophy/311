epistemology why have philosophers given up on this project why have philosophers given up on this project and either abandoned the study of knowledge or have turned to skepticism can't they accept a little uncertainty with respect to defining knowledge after all look at the inclusiveness of many other disciplines such as psychology and anthropology science if we have to tweak a definition of knowledge on ocassion to get past a gettier problem so what no body gave up it is a hard subject to advance in a general way probably harder than any other there is some quiet private research ongoing at all times in all fields of understanding just as all major advances in philosophy have always had just because the nature of this subject is not like physics where one can see the studies being developed it does not mean it has been given up plus you are missing the point knowledge and its validity are things which must be defined with accuracy or they just don't mean anything at all if it was more flexible it would matter none also epistemology includes the study of justified belief which is the more flexible side Epistemology Science Philosophy Belief Western philosophy Supernatural Human Gettier problem Cultural relativism Psychology Scientific method Religion Philosophy of mathematics Knowledge Metaphysics Phenomenology History of science Anthropology Immanuel Kant Atheism Free will Ethics Propositional knowledge Sociocultural evolution Karl Popper Causality Objectivist philosophy Franz Boas Reality Property (ownership right) Determinism Philosophy of language Existence of God Common sense Aristotle Mathematics Nihilism Social sciences Rudolf Steiner Origin belief History of psychology Presuppositional apologetics Philosophy of biology Deconstruction Rudolf Hermann Lotze Philosophy of religion A New Kind of Science Cognitive science Young Earth creationism Idealism Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Religious studies Philosophical skepticism Agnosticism Intelligent design Edmund Gettier Scientific revolution Regress argument Mind Archaeology Transpersonal psychology Sociology Physics David Hume Alchemy Creationism Creation-evolution controversy Meaning of life Bertrand Russell Social psychology Problem of universals Cognitive bias Theory of conduct Music Naturalism (philosophy) Faith and rationality Social epistemology Postmodernism Reincarnation History of philosophy Goodness and value theory Geography Truth Willard Van Orman Quine African philosophy A Course In Miracles Theology Internalism and externalism
