could time be a human perception i know time just is i wanted to know what other people think i find it interesting well i think things like the changing of seasons and aging provide a general frame of reference for us by which we can estimate the passage of time as does the invention of the clock and it's interesting also why we feel that time moves slowly for some things usually tedious things and rapidly for others things like fun or worse aging now let's suppose there is a creator if this is true then time really is our own perception and very different for god also if he did design the universe this would mean that all of nature is set to a certain clock this is why there are mating seasons hibernating seasons and seasons in general if not then this programming must be purely biological also what about animals dog years are very different from years as humans perceive them for example and what about other human beings does time feel the same and move with the same rapidity for everyone no probably not in this case time is very likely subject to our own perceptions of it Immanuel Kant Human Determinism Ontological argument Evolutionary creationism Consciousness Objectivist philosophy Free will Existence of God God Zoophilia Meaning of life George Berkeley Human nature Time dilation Eye Mind David Hume Religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Critique of Pure Reason Philosophy of space and time Thomism Extinction Time travel Maurice Merleau-Ponty William James Gender role Existentialism Supernatural Philosophy of perception Creationism Fox hunting K' The nature of God in Western theology Aristotle A Course In Miracles Rudolf Steiner Artificial consciousness Friedrich Schleiermacher Epistemology Problem of evil Psychology W.
