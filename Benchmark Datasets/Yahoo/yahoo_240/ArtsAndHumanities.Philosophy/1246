please tell me what you think of this scenario there is an utopian society somewhere sometime there are no wars crime disorder just a fulfilled group of people happy stimulated and self sufficient and healthy they have all they need or want the price of this utopia however is that somewhere in a basement of one of the houses is a small child who is kept starving and although not beaten is kept in total isolation as soon as she it is sometimes a he is he is incorporated into the group and another younger child is sent down does the happiness of the majority justify this sacrifice no with that one starving child it is not a true utopian society and what you describe as no crime etc is false what you describe is child abuse and that mars the 'utopian' thing beyond any potential claim to such a perfect society i could also go into the mindset that would justify abuse as well as why one and a child at that would be required to suffer so all else could be 'fine' but again this in my view is flawed because there is crime and not all have all they want or need and are not stimulated etc additionally ultimately this one child would be quite damaged end every years or so another damaged person would be added to the world at large this further mars the scenario also i would find it hard to fathom that no one not one single person would sit still for that abuse of the child i wouldn't i'd take the false utopian society down in an instant to save just one child good question Utilitarianism Theodicy Criticism of libertarianism Goodness and value theory Dissociative identity disorder Rape Domestic violence Theory of conduct Evil Arguments for and against drug prohibition Utopia (book) Animal Farm Capital accumulation Satanic ritual abuse Autism rights movement Utopianism Altruism Simone Weil Child sexual abuse Polygamy Drug abuse Anarchism and capitalism Microeconomics Causality Anorexia nervosa Drug addiction Justification (theology) Epistemology Pedophilia Narcissism Strategic management Nicomachean Ethics Transsexuality Religion Normal distribution Infantilism Summa Theologiae Charles Grandison Finney Serial killer Convention on Psychotropic Substances Law of value Peace Brave New World Plame affair Christian eschatology Alcoholics Anonymous Child pornography Postmodernism Eugenics Peter Singer Objectivist philosophy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Philosophical skepticism School of Salamanca Moral Politics Controlled Substances Act World government Addiction Satanism Morality Bipolar disorder Free will British national identity card A Course In Miracles Resident Evil (video game) Equilibrium (2002 film) Political ideas in science fiction Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Chronic fatigue syndrome Deflation (economics) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson RuneScape cheats End times Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Scientology beliefs and practices Sacrifice Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Coercion Slander and libel H.
