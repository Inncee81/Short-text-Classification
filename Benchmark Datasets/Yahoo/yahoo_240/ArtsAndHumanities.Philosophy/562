for you personally what is the meaning of life no right or wrong answers im new life is a very complicated thing for something so complicated their cannot be just one answer i agree with e fn w there could be a million reasons for life i believe that the purpose of life can vary from each individual for a teacher it would be to help youths by gaining a substantial amount of knowledge and to pass that knowledge on knowing that you have helped a young life like what miser said finding something in life that you truly love dedicating you life to it i like it but not in an obsessive way moderation i think is another quality in life humans should seek out i think in general what could be strived for amongst most human beings is acceptance tolerance safety and happiness contentment maybe the meaning of life is to be prepared for the afterlife or as others have suggested glorifying god or just simply continuity to keep living this all depends on the individual if a person dies happy and feels fulfilled i believe they have found all of the above qualities that can be found in life and therefore although the absolute meaning of this is unclear know that they have lived life to the fullest however it is not easy to gain acceptance tolerance safety and happiness contentment acceptance in a world full of judgment tolerance in a life full of impatience safety were nothing is certain and happiness and contentment in a world of sorrow and inequality could you really as some one put it smile in the face of adversity maybe these hostile environments we are surrounded in are what are stopping us from fully seeing the meaning of this life because humans are too busy fighting wars consumed in greed and hate and jealousy it is blinding us from working together and to stamp out all of the wrongdoings and injustices in the world maybe the meaning of life is a test from the big guy in the sky to see how long we can overcome these differences and stand in unity union and achieve peace life is a beautiful thing to have been given even if we don t understand it and it seems to me that we our ruining the experiences by constantly fighting and belittling people for various reasons power greed selfishness pride narcissism ect because of all the hurt these emotions and their consequent actions causes people the pain and suffering it is obvious that we are not living life properly as a whole because we should be focusing on increasing the positive aspects on life and decreasing the negatives we are not experiencing life to the fullest extent in that we should be or maybe as some people could argue that feeling loss pain sorrow hunger these are all ways to truly experience life living it the fullest extent you cannot of fully experienced life if you have not felt all the sensations that it has to offer i ask is it fair that some people experience the negatives and others do not living life to the full maybe this is the bigger picture maybe we can achieve everything we strive for by really living life feeling every breath tasting every morsel or food or appreciating the smell or the smile on your loved ones face and doing everything to the best of our ability that will eventually result in us really experiencing life and be at peace with ourselves acceptance tolerance safety and happiness jus my opinion anyways Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Meaning of life Human Evil Religion Goodness and value theory Current teachings of Prem Rawat God Happiness Simone Weil Summa Theologiae Theory of conduct Alexander Technique Infantilism Friedrich Schleiermacher Utilitarianism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Objectivist philosophy Abortion debate Christian eschatology A Course In Miracles Breastfeeding Social justice Theodicy Economic inequality Narcissism Urantia John Howard Yoder Michel Henry Karen Horney Alcoholics Anonymous Clinical depression Altruism Internet troll Peter Singer Socrates Asperger syndrome Microeconomics Traumatic incident reduction Merit Sexual orientation Soul Free trade Reincarnation Original sin Aristotle Democracy Mortification of the flesh Divorce Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Supernatural Liberalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Motivation Value system Scientology beliefs and practices Duties of the Heart Intelligence quotient Love Transactional analysis Addiction Moral objectivism The nature of God in Western theology Human nature Human sexual behavior Orgasm S__ren Kierkegaard Cultural relativism Stoicism Philipp Melanchthon Autism Aikido Autism rights movement Consciousness Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Propaganda Force (Star Wars) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capitalism Person Heaven Arthur Schopenhauer Al-Ghazali Social rule Phaedo Cyberspace Buddhism Animal testing
