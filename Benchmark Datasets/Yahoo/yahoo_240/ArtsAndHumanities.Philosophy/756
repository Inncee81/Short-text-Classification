what was kant's categorical imperative i was reading a philosophy text and it keeps refering to this what is it kant's categorical imperative was universalisability sorry the word looks made up but basically that is it kant argued that for an action to be morally valid we should be able to advocate that it becomes a universal law for instance the common example given is lying if one believes lying is a morally valid act one should be happy if everybody lied this however would mean that one would never be able to communicate effectively as their would one would always have to expect the other party ies to be lying this advocating lying defeats itself as communication becomes impossible the other example is broken promises if it is ok to break promises then one should be able to advocate breaking promises for all this obviously would be the end of the social institution of making promises thus self defeating and thus morally wrong or invalid this is the essence of the categorical imperative however kant's ethical philosophy is still quite a contentious issue many consider kant's reasoning flawed however there have been many attempts to modify kant's totally deontological approach to be more flexible and thus appealing to modern readers however kant believed the categorical imperative is an intrinsic part of moral philosophy there are some problems with this such if lying is wrong should you lie if you were hiding jews in the second world war and nazis came knocking asking if you were harbouring any jews the imperative on lying says no you should tell the truth however this clearly can not be morally right as you would be sending them to their deaths one answer could be to make lying to save a life a categorical imperative i personally don't see any problem if everybody lied if it was to save a life and i can't see how that undermines communication some do think the categorical imperative is dependent upon the individuals reasoning but kant woudl argue it is down to the logic of the assertion therefore lying if everybody is free to lie any time the feel like it communication would be pointless and so lying would be self defeating as no communication of either truth or lies would be possible Deontological ethics Objectivist philosophy Social justice Utilitarianism Bernard Williams Philosophy Moral objectivism Peter Singer Postmodernism Discourse ethics Religion Philosophy of science Anarcho-capitalism Philosophy of language Existence of God Friedrich Schleiermacher Liberalism Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism David Hume Fallacy Martin Heidegger Falsifiability Morality Moral relativism Age of Enlightenment R.
