why does kent state always get steriotyped its because our neighbor asked were my mom went to college and she said kent state and she said oh thats terrible leaving the spelling advice aside i don't think kent state is any more stereotyped than any other college which has had an involvement with history when it is mentioned some people remember the killing of four students by the ohio national guard and some don't remember anything distinctly the killings did occur so their remembrance is to be expected i don't know anyone who draws from the events of any generalizations about the current students or faculty Kent State shootings Theory of conduct Kent State University Non-native pronunciations of English Arizona State University College town Ohio National University of Singapore Zhao Yun Students' union Half-staff Sub-Zero University of Kent Education in the United States Little Britain Blackjack Social psychology Texas A&M University Otterbein College Science Bowl Pennsylvania State University Battle of Waterloo Cincinnati Bengals College House of M Treehouse of Horror V Ohio State University University of Michigan The Mansion Family The College of Wooster Joke Brigham Young University Doug Bosniaks Savannah College of Art and Design American Pie (song) San Diego State University United States Army Harvard University Allison Krause University of Szeged Princeton High School, Sharonville, Ohio Williams College Southwestern University Characters in the Southern Victory series Quizbowl Case Western Reserve University University of Connecticut United States National Guard Recurring South Park characters University of Houston Vlad III Dracula The Shining (film) University of San Francisco Monarchy in Canada Ohio Wesleyan University Anti-intellectualism Baylor University Romulus and Remus Trinity College, Dublin Cleveland State University Mineriad McMaster University Ken Livingstone Hunter College High School Columbia University University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of North Texas Beowulf The Butterfly Effect Baldwin-Wallace College Miami University History of Test cricket (to 1883) University of Texas at El Paso Prem Rawat Dalhousie University Boston Public Merrimack College The Fairly OddParents Government of Maryland University of Canterbury University of St. Michael's College StarCraft Secret Missions University of Notre Dame Social rule Medical school California State University, Long Beach Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ultimate Fighting Championship Weathermen University of Waterloo New York Jets Dublin City University YuYu Hakusho University at Albany Oberlin, Ohio College basketball Kyle Broflovski York University National Junior College
