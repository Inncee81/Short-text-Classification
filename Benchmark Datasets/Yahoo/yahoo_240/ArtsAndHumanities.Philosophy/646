is safety the most elusive of all creations safety is a societally created illusion one which bears its roots from man's primitive times is it the most elusive i believe that for us here in north america bronwen's reference to september strikes at the heart of our rapidly dissipating misconception about life and society on this side of the ocean during those days and weeks which followed our once collectively youthful glow turned darkly somber but we here are dubiously fortunate to have had this awakening so late in our culture's evolution it's unimaginable how obviously precarious life before us and our dawning here has been primitive man must have felt small indeed in his vast and dangerous environment miraculously mankind evolved sufficiently to rise above tremendous odds medieval man lived by the sword and either died by it or fell early on to any one of the many ravages of nature it is no wonder that religion and concepts of god held an iron tight grip on a fearful world the world has been historically one continuous battlefield and blood bath after another ominously dangerous threats to safety were not adequately tamed by man until perhaps as late as post world war ll where we witnessed a revolutionary whiplash to our profound lack of well being security life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the 's with it's proclamations of peace love and the freedom to indulge in self inflicted hallucinations threw out the welcome mat to the illusion of safety and mantras of never again yet we still did not evolve adequately from our reptilian brain to manifest tangible proof of these words and still the powerful opiate of the masses persisted then came september and a rude awakening to our self created sense of safety as the dark days from that tragedy fade into misty memories and the blood seeped crust of our earth heals itself so too do our memories fade and the mantra of never again evolves into a battle hymn of revenge we are an arrogant breed of warriors and combatants vying for the world's resources insatiable and oddly oblivious to the frailty of life that is until the next time when we will be reminded of our precarious grip on life again and again and again and as long as it takes for either our authentic awakening or our end the most elusive thing of all is our own concept of safety and our efforts to maintain a consistently healthy respect for safety life liberty and the pursuit of a peaceful existence God Religion Human Mantra Kain (Legacy of Kain) A Course In Miracles Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Reincarnation Supernatural Protoss Battles of Lexington and Concord Force (Star Wars) Martial art Immortality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) Creationism Religious pluralism Property (ownership right) Church of Christ, Scientist Meaning of life Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meme Theodicy Extraterrestrial life Social justice Origin belief Religious Society of Friends Intelligent design Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Anthroposophy Animism Eastern Orthodox Church Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Magic (paranormal) Hinduism Gnosticism Technological singularity Phaedo Macbeth Eldar (Warhammer 40,000) Jehovah's Witnesses Narcissism Blood (computer game) Duties of the Heart History of creationism Sant Mat Liberalism Link (Legend of Zelda) Psychology of religion Vishnu sahasranama Unidentified flying object MMORPG Sociocultural evolution Capitalism Friedrich Nietzsche Human nature Biodiversity Resurrection of Jesus Indigenous peoples Atomism Spiritual evolution Evil Determinism Arthur Schopenhauer Creation science Reinhold Niebuhr Plate tectonics The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Jiddu Krishnamurti Iron Fist Middle-earth Vishnu Ten Commandments Soul Sigmund Freud Protestantism Sith Brahmanism Franz Boas The Second Renaissance Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel End times Tamriel Oceanic trench Modernism Deluge (mythology) Predestination Brave New World Friedrich Schleiermacher Sub-Zero Shinto Beast Wars The Brothers Karamazov
