time travel what's the benefit i mean i'm always reading questions about whether time travel could ever be possible how it would be achieved and what the consequences would be but now i want someone to tell me how humankind would benefit for this you have to suspend disbelief so we're assuming that it is environmentally sustainable that it's possible to travel in both directions along the time line and that by visiting the past we don't impact on the present btw if you accept that last point then you have to concede that anybody who did visit the future then returned to the now could have no impact on that future already visited so let's go if you couldn't have an impact on the present then you would only be able to see and not act in that timezone i can think of a few benefits for this it would make a really cool holiday historians geologists paelontologists and the like would literally have a field day benefit to mankind well it would be down to the professionals mentioned above for instance what if it wasn't a meteorite or a massive volcano that killed the dinosaurs but a huuge monster that lives deep underground and only comes out when life is full on the planet we could find out where he came out from and kill that sucka before he had a chance to kill us another thought you could go back and see which politicans are lying to us and because you could do this they would have to stop lying that would be an incredible benefit for mankind Solar system Young Earth creationism End of civilization Geology of the Moon Impact crater Mars Flood geology Alien races from the Godzilla films Planetary habitability Permian-Triassic extinction event Dinosaur Asteroid Ecco the Dolphin Impact event Neo (The Matrix) Meteorite Abiogenic petroleum origin Scientology beliefs and practices Global cooling Geology Plate tectonics 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Extinction The Daleks' Master Plan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Global warming Tektite Bah__'__ Faith and Science Deluge (mythology) Exploration of Mars Meteor Crater Jean-Luc Picard Age of the Earth Volcano Origin belief Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Franz Boas Noah's Ark Terraforming Science fiction film Origin of life Chicxulub Crater George Galloway Sea level rise The Skeptical Environmentalist Free will Sustainability Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Creationism Tenshinhan Kain (Legacy of Kain) Annuity Colonization of the Moon Deus ex machina Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Renewable energy Rare Earth hypothesis Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Pikmin Theory of conduct The Dalek Invasion of Earth Moon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye Theodicy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Acts of the Apostles Astrobiology Black hole Tribulation Terminator 2: Judgment Day Charmed A Course In Miracles Bad Wolf Timeline of Star Trek Eutrophication Ecology Star Fox Adventures Jupiter Michael Crichton Tomb Raider Xenu Fermi paradox Waking the Dragons Time travel Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Famine Geology of Venus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bob and George Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion) Angel (vampire) Predestination paradox StarCraft: Uprising Shaggy dog story
