why do they call suicide taking your own life i heard this term on tv today not for the first time obviously and it suddenly struck me as very strange your life is yours to begin with no else's you can't take what's already yours to me its offensive it insinuates that from day one someone else owns your life i guess i didn't really consider it from a religious perspective i myself being an atheist but i can see how a religious person would see it as god's life rather than their own while do not condone suicide in any way ultimately your life should be your own and no elses not your family's friend's or community's that being said you are responsible for others but that doesn't mean they own a piece of your life you are yours ultimately and yours alone no one can take that away from you it's just another stupid social term that has absolutely no real meaning like 'innocent bystander' culture is full of the these buzz words and phrases that completely obscure what really is it would appear that the intent of this social word working is to create confusion about what really is in order to keep us looking to society for the answers the term life in this sense would only seem to refer to the thing that keeps your body animated and by stopping that thing you are some how 'taking your own life' life is only the process we see through our senses but the thing that is there is neither living or dead and is not contained solely within the parameters of birth and death God Goodness and value theory Evil Predestination Abortion debate Justification (theology) Property (ownership right) Atheism Religion Phaedo The Amber Spyglass Baptism Euphemism Creationism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Religious Society of Friends Fundamentalism Shit Roman Catholic Church Atomism Suicide Joke Friedrich Schleiermacher Deconstruction Teach the Controversy Objectivist philosophy God and gender Marriage Origin belief Alcoholics Anonymous Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The nature of God in Western theology Jacob Neusner Art Nihilism Evolutionism Sin God Emperor of Dune Simone Weil Meaning Philosophy of language Rudolf Steiner Evolutionary creationism Anthroposophy Existence of God Soul Infantilism Noam Chomsky Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Saint Pitaten Animism A Course In Miracles Euthanasia Wedge strategy Supernatural Meaning of life Kain (Legacy of Kain) Ten Commandments The Lovely Bones Family Feud Murder Nation of Islam Theodicy S__ren Kierkegaard Hey Jude Rei Ayanami Bene Gesserit Jewish principles of faith Social rule Evangelicalism Human nature Sacrifice Intelligent design Determinism Philosophical skepticism Grief Alignment (role-playing games) Piccolo Junior Saga Existentialism Sampling (music) Human Slavoj __i__ek Suicide bombing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social psychology Originalism Irony Columbine High School massacre Scenes from a Memory Summa Theologiae Gay Sola fide Satanism Science Kodocha
