the empiricism mathematics paradox i was querying if empiricism advocates that truth is solely to be taken from experimentation and sensory intake how can such a philosophy be so widely accepted in a scientific community that uses mathematics on a regular basis in other words a scientific community that constantely applies itself to innate logic and conceptual numbers is mathematics an exception to the empiricists consideration of truth yes and no yes because of the reasons you cited and the fact that math is initially accepted on the faith that addition is what it appears to be and that any process can be undone in only a finite number of ways and that we already know these ways subtraction is the undoing of addition and division is the undoing of multiplication however empiricism does believe that raw empirical data can confirm theories mathematics is almost definitely the best confirmed theory in the history of the world the few basic assumptions are so thoroughly believed and useful that they are necessary for the everyday activities that govern daily life beyond that mathematics is a theory that is completely proven the initial concessions that addition works and that processes can be undone have been proved every other aspect of mathematics so if these concessions verified by everyday evidence are correct all of the rest of mathematics is correct as well Theory Mathematics Philosophy of science Physics Philosophy of mathematics Science Scientific method G__del's incompleteness theorem Falsifiability Willard Van Orman Quine Intelligent design Postmodernism Epistemology Logic Existence of God Cognitive science History of science Second language acquisition Determinism Numerology A New Kind of Science Where Mathematics Comes From Laws of Form Objectivist philosophy Black hole Bertrand Russell Complexity classes P and NP Scientific revolution Donald Davidson (philosopher) Scientific skepticism Creation science Religion Causality Presuppositional apologetics Natural deduction George Lakoff Infinity Quantum mechanics Pseudoscience Axiomatic set theory Prices of production Reality Charles Peirce Creationism Cardinal number Complex number Western philosophy Supernatural Karl Popper Goodness and value theory Many-worlds interpretation Software engineering Forcing (mathematics) Propositional calculus Deconstruction Social sciences Model (abstract) Neuro-linguistic programming Axiom of choice Faster-than-light Belief revision Cosmological argument Interpretation of quantum mechanics Series (mathematics) Aristotle Henri Poincar__ Logical positivism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mathematician Halting problem Empiricism Doomsday argument The nature of God in Western theology Philosophical skepticism Lambda calculus Geometry Alexander Technique Occam's Razor Physical paradox Fuzzy logic Free will Computer science Epistemic theories of truth Mass Turing machine Group (mathematics) Scientific consensus Multiverse Atheism Reverse mathematics Computer
