how can i feel like a worthwhile human being i feel like a waste air i have tried many things over the years to feel a purpose in life but i always come back to emptiness i should have mentioned i have done plenty of volunteering work answers to this sort of question are so much more easily said than done about the simplest answer i can think to give you is that we are all technically worthless in the grand scheme of things none of us really matters to the universe at large yet we are the universe at large it's a paradox but the long of the short is that even those you see whom you think of as leading worthwhile lives they're every bit as worthless as you at their most fundamental level so learning to feel like a worthwhile human being involves learning to recognize that we're all equally worthless if that makes sense actually for me that was a very liberating realization it may sound negative on the face of it but if you think about it for awhile you will probably come to realize as i did that being worthless is the greatest gift the universe can give you think of it in terms of humility if that helps you but by being worthless that means that the universe has set no standards for us there is no cosmic measuring stick waiting to judge our souls when we die we decide what we are worth even if we decide that we are worth nothing so you look at your life and decide are there experiences i would like to have more of if so find out what those experiences and emotions are and just let yourself happen even if the things you value mean nothing to anyone else on the planet if they're truly meaningful to you and you work to fill your life with that which you value then you are living the life of a worthwhile human being a worthwhile human being you see is simply any human which defines itself as worthwhile you can do it it might not be easy it might take time but be patient and keep your mind open it will come to you in your own time Goodness and value theory Happiness A Course In Miracles Poker jargon Theory of conduct Meaning of life Science Dualism (philosophy of mind) Scientology beliefs and practices Nicomachean Ethics CPU cache G__del's incompleteness theorem Social rule Incarnations of Immortality Dark energy Ethics Sant Mat Quizbowl Ludwig Wittgenstein Friedrich Schleiermacher Numerology Rudolf Hermann Lotze Gravity Objectivist philosophy Socrates Mach kernel Contract Wealth Multiverse Simone Weil Philosophy of space and time Scenes from a Memory Utilitarianism Epistemology Cultural relativism Renormalization Current teachings of Prem Rawat Coming of Age (TNG episode) Evolutionary creationism The nature of God in Western theology Free will Halting problem Supernatural New Age Fermi paradox Four Quartets Abortion debate Psychology S__ren Kierkegaard God Philosophy of language Human God Emperor of Dune Summa Theologiae Mathematics Microeconomics Motivation Determinism Out-of-body experience Identity and change Sri Aurobindo Naive set theory Consciousness Entropy Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Urantia Bah__'__ Faith and Science Time Out of Mind Rei Ayanami Immortality Sikh religious philosophy Duties of the Heart Intelligent design Fundamentalism Turing test Moral objectivism Avenue Q Scientific method Coercion Jon Secada Cognitive science Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Storytelling Soul Characters in the Smurfs Computer numbering formats English grammar Dog training Big Bang Jiddu Krishnamurti Animal rights Patriotism Immanuel Kant W.
