do you like my poem dream cloud the dead reality sinks inside a painful weight in my head as i watch the worthless fall from their dream cloud and begin their walk to the dead their first years in a fictional world of bliss where they surely could survive but then came a darkness their cloud could not take then came one of their thousand lives thir strong souls then fade as they learn their place slaves of the god they could have been they follow a path to some distant land a heaven they shall never see i see an old man fall to his death and reborn as a slave the next day but i know that if i keep near dead dreams allive hear on this dream cloud i shall stay great idea but say it out loud to yourself there is no real flow by the way here's a tip don't put your poems on here someone might take them The Amber Spyglass Heaven Soul Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hell Christian eschatology Animism Paul Is Dead Reincarnation Kain (Legacy of Kain) Phaedo Ten Commandments Jon Secada The Pilgrim's Progress Jewish eschatology Philip K.
