what do u think a suicider is a brave or coward it really depends on the reason for them taking their own life i've been real close to committiing suicide and it takes alot for someone to actually go through with it so it is a strength that makes it possible but then it can also be the chicken way out too because that is in my opinion the worst sin you can do taking your life is like slapping god in the face and it is said thou shalt not kill so when you kill yourself you will be punished for that sin ultimately in the next life it will be worse then this one that you took the easy way out atleast you thought you did oh boy karma is alive and well and retribution is the law Religious views of suicide Original sin Ten Commandments Immortality Sin Merit Capital punishment Soul Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Sin City Reincarnation Karma in Hinduism Heaven Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prisoner's dilemma Hell Suicide Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Salvation Phaedo Justification (theology) Bible and reincarnation Bhagavad Gita Buddhism Theodicy Ethics in religion Theory of conduct Mary, the mother of Jesus Philipp Melanchthon Three Laws of Robotics Adam and Eve Eternal return Moral objectivism Summa Theologiae Holocaust theology Yusuf al-Qaradawi Matthew 5 Charles Grandison Finney Abortion debate Jewish ethics John Howard Yoder Seven deadly sins Karaite Judaism Wandering Jew Richard III (play) The Amber Spyglass Samurai Deeper Kyo History of Christianity and homosexuality Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Resurrection of Jesus God Emperor of Dune Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) Apostasy Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina History of suicide Tree of Knowledge Philosophical views of suicide Jewish principles of faith Criticisms of Christianity Creationism Beard Van Orden v.
