i love politically incorrect questions why do you think being racist is such a 'bad' thing especially the fact that we all tend to be more or less to a certain extent and it's not as if we choose to be racist and besides suppressing racism is just another way of lying if you don't like someone because of their color you should just admit it and imho nothing wrong with it besides all stereotpyes tend to be true to one form or another however i do feel that committing discriminating acts based on race is ethically wrong people should be able to embrace others and not be so selfish Racism Ethics Goodness and value theory Coercion Avenue Q Patriotism Speciesism Alignment (role-playing games) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Zionism and racism White nationalism Meme Racial segregation Theodicy John Howard Yoder Islam as a political movement Rastafari movement Black (people) Nadir of American race relations Arab-Israeli conflict Sexual orientation Atheism Evil Liberalism Skinhead Religion Jewish principles of faith Moral relativism Social rule Equal Protection Clause Scientific racism Polyamory Ethnic issues in Japan White Australia policy Reparations for slavery Economic inequality Moral Politics Nationalism Fallacy Punk ideology Race Pat Buchanan Objectivist philosophy Laura Schlessinger Bumiputra Eugenics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Freemasonry Altruism Nicomachean Ethics African American Lie Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Feminism Bernard Williams Jews as a chosen people Value system Scientology beliefs and practices Freedom of speech Validity of human races Bertrand Russell Public policy Urantia Religion and sexual orientation Confucius David Hume Affirmative action Franz Boas Abortion debate Robert A.
