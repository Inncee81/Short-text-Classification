what is the course of evolution no god answers plz evolution is only statistical it's like a slot machine you can calculate probabilities but it only works with large numbers since we only observe one evolution it's all chance and generalities Specified complexity Evolution Statistics Quantum computer Probability Intelligent design Many-worlds interpretation Normal distribution Molecular evolution Bayesian inference Bayes' theorem Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics) Copenhagen interpretation Slot machine Hardy-Weinberg principle Genetic algorithm Dynamical system Interpretation of quantum mechanics Astronomy Pascal's Wager Determinism Median ELO rating system Mathematics Confidence interval Pleiades (star cluster) Evolutionism Quantum mechanics Simulated annealing Randomness Genetic drift Doomsday argument Path integral formulation Philosophy of mathematics Bayesian network Teleological argument Wave packet Exponential family Emergence Randomized algorithm Identical particles Creation biology Maximum likelihood Occam's Razor Fermi paradox Creation-evolution controversy Induction (philosophy) Probability distribution Monty Hall problem Open cluster Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Ragnarok Online Prosecutor's fallacy Blackjack Sequence alignment History of creationism William A.
