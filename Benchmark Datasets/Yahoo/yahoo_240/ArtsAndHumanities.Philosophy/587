pro choice or pro life and why and stem cell research i don't want religious answers that don't provide a valid back up argument other than god says you shouldn't not a valid argument an early blastocyst fetus stage does not feel any pain as it does not have a nervous system hence you are not causing it any physical pain also it only has the beginning of a brain hence will not show any neurological activity making it for all sense and purpose brain dead its not thinking yet questions to think about what if the woman had been raped against her will what if carrying the child to term will have long lasting negative physical and mental effects on the 'mother' etc stem cells want a valid reason if you are against or for facts to think about again the phase that the embryo is in does not have any neural cells hence no brain and no pain over aborted fetuses blastocysts are flushed down the toilet they could be put to better use if you're gonna kill them any way i am forced to counter the it could have been argument by stating this yes every single aborted fetus could have had friends and contributed society however each of those also has the potential to be just as destructive a pointless statement that i will make because its not feasible is that if you could go back in time and 'abort hitler before he was born' would you its a question of morality and ethics of the now not of the what could be look no one knows with absolute certainty when life begins it's become a religious matter b c religious people believe you have a soul at conception since the constitution says we can't make laws regarding practices of religion abortion at an agreed upon time early term etc when we're pretty sure it's not a life is going to be legal forever unless the supreme court goes even crazier and tries to make it illegal but they haven't yet and they can't b c the constitution says it can't answer that question the const is kind of like a magic ball it answers yes no i can't answer that and ask again later when enough states agree that something should be changed it can change i wish people would stop using it as a form of birth control a child of rape can be just as beautiful a child as one from a loving couple it's hard and i will never have to deal with it but it's true it's possible stem cells let's use them responsibly we should not create embryos just for this purpose but you're right if they will be destroyed let's pull a few cells off of them first and save lives Religion and abortion Stem cell Roe v.
