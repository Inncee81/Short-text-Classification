relationship between work and plato's cave i recently read plato's republic and more specificaly the simily of the cave i reflected on what he was trying to say and i came up with this analogy for life using my experiance at mcdonalds during the day at mcdonalds the only thing that is important is making burgers quickly not running out of meat patties or fried products and keeping the kitchen clean at the end of the day when i go home i couldn't care less about being more efficient at work is this life wasted on things that we think is important to us now only to realise that reality lies outside of life itself if we are those tied to the posts looking only at this world and the pleasures of wealth are we not all guilty of being ignorant prisoners of ourselves work is just winding a handle until it's time to go that's it then trying to wind the handle quicker and more efficiently while the load increases and at the end of the day you drop the load and stop winding the handle and go home day done and the next day is the same an ever turning cog in a mechiene the analogy of plato's cave seems more like the foundation of the reality game second life so reality lies in freedom and freedom is being outside of the slavory of work and the best example is john bunion who created his own bars or at least for the prisoners of ourselves bit Socrates Plato Human nature Hamburger In-N-Out Burger Cyberspace Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Amber Spyglass Wind turbine RuneScape skills Blankets (graphic novel) Stoicism Burger King Plato's allegory of the cave Economy of the Republic of Ireland Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Electric motor Fast-food restaurant 1957 World Series Epistemology Philo Aristotle McDonald's Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Kitchen Blood (computer game) Apology (Plato) Ship Free trade Dairy Goodness and value theory Unreal Division of labour DVD Philosophy of mathematics Energy development Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Immanuel Kant Movie projector Solar cell Philosophy Death Comes to Time Economics Soap opera RISC Gorgias Free will 2000 Australian Grand Prix German student movement Sonic the Hedgehog 2 S__ren Kierkegaard Chicken Computer role-playing game Origin belief CPU cache Days of our Lives H.
