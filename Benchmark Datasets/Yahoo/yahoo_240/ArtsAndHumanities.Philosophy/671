who is jesus who is jesus is he crazy liar son of god i am wondering who is he really a friend of mine showed me that he can be only one of those things i have come to a somewhat strange conclusion in the bible jesus says that he came to die for sinners and if we believe that he died for our sins and ask for forgiveness we can miss hell and go to heaven if he is a crazy man who has led millions of people astray or a liar who has also led millions of people astray then nothing will happen to me after i die his claims mean nothing and i will cease to exist but if he really is the son of god then as of right now if i die i'm going to hell forever the same applies to you dear reader i'm really rather torn and can't decide on who he is i have a chance of him being who he said he claimed and also a of him not being who he claimed to be yet what do we have to lose by trusting him if hell is real why take the chance please give me your opinion but why you believe it there is only one way to figure it out and that you must do on your own we can all give you our ideas on what jesus was or who he is but who are we to direct your opinion do some research get a bible and read some of it you should probly start at the beginning with genisis talks about how the earth was created adam and eve and such then noah and moves along from there mathew mark luke and john in the new testiment talk about jesus the most from there if you are not content you could move on to science see if science matches up with the bible not just one scientist but in general i mean if eternity is at stake you might as well do some research into it what do you have to lose if you still havent come to a conclusion then look around you i wish you good luck Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hell Sin Paradise Lost Church of Christ, Scientist Merit Immortality Creationism Abrahamic religion Genesis A Course In Miracles Book of Mormon Divine grace Sola fide Biblical inerrancy Harrowing of Hell Original sin Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Heaven Urantia Devil Salvation Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trinity Noah Young Earth creationism Christianity Religion Historicity of Jesus Angel Eastern Orthodox Church Jesus The Pilgrim's Progress Reincarnation Sabbath Satan Emanuel Swedenborg Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John the Baptist God Book of Isaiah Summa Theologiae Mary Magdalene Adam and Eve Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Church of Christ Antichrist Dispensationalism Soul Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Fallen angel Indulgence Virgin Mary in Islam End times Gospel of Barnabas King James Version of the Bible Holy Spirit Priesthood (Mormonism) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Qiyamah Ten Commandments Jehovah's Witnesses John Wycliffe Demon Christian Identity Theodicy Apocalyptic literature Blacks and Mormonism Purgatory Baptism Adam-God theory Gospel of John Resurrection of Jesus Secret Gospel of Mark Binitarianism Mary, the mother of Jesus Apostle Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Nation of Islam Nontrinitarianism Repentance The Amber Spyglass Problem of Hell Christian demonology Tribulation John Wesley
