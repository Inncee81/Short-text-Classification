whats wrong with my logic what is wrong with my premises or logic my logic skills are a little rusty but im tryin to prove that life can not be destroyed it helps if you took a logic class here are my premises and my reason for them being true in paranthesis if something is alive then it has mass otherwise it wouldnt exist if something has mass then it has energy e mc if something has energy then it cant be destroyed law of conservation of energy something is alive otherwise i couldnt be typing on my computer thank you for your answers because i know something is alive i can use modus ponens m p and conclude i have mass if i have mass i can conclude i have energy m p if i have energy i know i cant be destroyed m p for all x if x is alive x has mass for all x if x has mass then x has energy for all x if x has energy then it cannot be destroyed premise seems to be the weak link energy cannot be destroyed but something that is composed of energy or has energy and given a name can be detroyed my computer is made of energy if i throw it into a volcano it will no longer be the composite we call a computer but the component energy will still persist in a different form life is the name we give to a certain set of biological conditions so by analogy life can be destroyed or decomposed but the component energy cannot again if i build a castle out of lego energy i would call the finished product a lego castle life if it gets dismantled the lego energy will still exist but the castle which was a composite would not Curry-Howard Rule of inference Deductive reasoning Contradiction Fallacy Falsifiability Natural deduction Lego Problem of evil Peter Singer Transposition (logic) Ontological argument Abortion debate Emergence Phaedo Biochemistry Logical argument Fermi paradox Default logic Creationism Intuitionistic logic Meaning of life Expert system Kripke semantics Object-oriented programming Intuitionistic Type Theory Axiom First-order logic Function (mathematics) Mass Philosophy of language Explosive material Energy Physics Model (abstract) G__del's incompleteness theorem Biodiversity Digital circuit Modal logic Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Atheism Logical conditional Energy development Big Bang Reductio ad absurdum Laws of Form Solar system Life Theodicy History of philosophy Nuclear fusion Mass spectrometry Transcendental argument for the existence of God Logic gate Chemistry Mathematical logic Cosmological argument Theory of conduct Halting problem Willard Van Orman Quine Nuclear proliferation George Boole Ad hominem General relativity Noah's Ark Technological singularity Circuit design Human cognition Prices of production Existence of God Johnston diagram Supernova Dirac equation Criticism of libertarianism Telephone exchange Induction (philosophy) Gaia theory (science) Logical fallacy Logic programming Gettier problem String (computer science) Central processing unit Gravitational radiation Computer virus Category theory Atom Navier-Stokes equations Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weapon Logo programming language Quantum mechanics Argument from ignorance Prime number Algorithm Sequent calculus Begging the question Model (economics)
