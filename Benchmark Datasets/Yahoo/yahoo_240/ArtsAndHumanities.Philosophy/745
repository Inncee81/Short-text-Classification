do you ever think that you were meant for something more in life but you don't know what it is yes i can still remember my teachers telling me all through school that i was so smart and so good that i just had to end up being one of the good ones one of the ones that would be an astronaut or would wind up becoming president and while i can see that the alternative to endlessly talking people up talking little kids down and not telling them they are worthy is a horrible thing still it does hurt to hit adulthood try so hard to get the education to get the job only to have a damn mood disorder and its social consequences grind everything to a halt and ruin every success nobody wanted to see how messed up my family was or how messed up i was for coming from that family i was the one who overcame seemingly through sheer force of will and sacrifice i was that kid in school i was the geek there to work and do the job i had no friends bullies went after me all the time and i had issues i was the fat kid with glasses and asthma i was the guy in high school that everyone lied to about the date of the prom because nobody had the courage to tell him you're too poor and your 'formal clothes' don't meet the dress code where we are going i was the guy who was cheated out of the valedictorian's position by way of a being considered too new to the school to count and b at the last minute by way of considering p e grades academic for that purpose and yeah all of this still hurts a little bit even now that i am but i digress point is everyone myself included had such high hopes for me i thought i was going to make it because all of the adults around me outside of my own family thought so too pity it didn't work really too bad i got stopped cold not just by my own issues but also by society's reactions to those issues oh well it isn't like anyone cares i'm just trailer trash huh i'm just a citizen here just a peon just disposable my life doesn't count as human i guess ok i'm sorry i went on so this one just got under my skin some after spending most of the day today working with bureaucrats and so called professionals who have less sense than i do trying to get help again for my problems yeah i'm irritated sorry thanks for your time Social rule Pitaten Theory of conduct Kyle Broflovski The Fairly OddParents Goodness and value theory True Crime: Streets of LA Boston Public Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Saved by the Bell The Ashlee Simpson Show Rich Mullins Teen Girl Squad Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Little Britain The Adventures of Pete & Pete She Loves You Jon Secada Characters in the Smurfs The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Great Teacher Onizuka Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Piccolo Junior Saga Trailer Park Boys Procrastination Education Recurring South Park characters Something Positive Vegeta Springfield Elementary School Blood on the Tracks My Life as a Teenage Robot Avenue Q About a Boy Azumanga Daioh Hey Jude Philosophical skepticism Can't Hardly Wait Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hey Arnold!
