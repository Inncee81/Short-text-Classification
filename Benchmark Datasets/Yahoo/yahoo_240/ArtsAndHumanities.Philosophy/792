why do people think god is real why not be not real why do people of religious faith beleive there religion is the only truth even if they can't back up there own beleifs with sufficient eidence and don't tell me stupid comments like look at the mirror its proof of god no its proof i exists not god i mean there is actually more evidence god does not exists in the idea of god itself the reason for this is because he is supposed to have created all be eternal and be all powerful so if he is eternal from the begining and created all then he should know all of all time and how things work break or fix he is all powerful but cannot manage his own work he should know how to and as creator should be able to create opportunities to overcome his obstacle and know how i mean if humans can create oppertunity why not god he should be able to overpower evil knowing he created evil i mean its only been a few thousand years right wow is so powerful god is all knowing because he created a imperfect world demanding a sinfreeworld wow o yea and god must really love his enemies when you know he kills them and goes to war with them don't worry terroists america loves you even if you send ied's on to us and we shoot you guys up makes good sense right yea because we have to love our neighbors including evil things like rapists pedofiles serial killers mass murders and racists as well as child abusers we love them too yep we love them by sending them to jail don't know about you but i don't love none of them and would not love them for anything so i guess if you love your neighbor you must love satan because he is your neighbor too so does this make you anti christ or hypicritical it's wrong when people commit murder but when god does it its right just because he's god wow yep that's some role model with those commandments you know just breaking them and not sticking to his principles and being careless about such serious stuff yep he somehow has a personal reationship with all you guys but he he doesn't save those who suffer or victims from oppression abuse and murder where was god when an christian american soldier lost his leg or died where was god when the priest molested the young boy was he he watching this he didn't do anything about it he has a personal relationship with the priest and witnissed this or knows about this and let it happened wow god must like pedofillia i mean he is only all powerful and all knowing you know i'd figure he know about this and over power it as creator he can create anything an oppertunity to stop it and perform it humans could have done that why not god how is it wrong to question other peoples beleifs if someone promised you that if you joined the nazi party that when you die you become a master apprentice angel or demi god of god himself would you beleive it but if i challange it its wrong if someone told you that having sex with young boys will make you immortal as long as you keep doing it once a week would you beleive it of course not you would challange there beleifs just as christians challange other peoples beleifs so how am i wrong for challanging others beleifs if we didn't challange other peoples beleifs fo you really think slavery would be ablolished in the united states nazism would be outcasted how the hell would science be like now if we didn't we would probably still be in huts with flint knives what makes christians wrong is that they try to argue and challange beleifs without rational logical and a good argument with sufficient evidence they also tend to break the own laws all the time and coming from such people how can i know that they really know what they are doing thinking or saying they also like to discredit much of our evidence but can't disprove it but when we do it to them they get very touchy about it and threaten me then tell me i am wrong even if i have good evidence that's proven and hell even use the very idea of god itself and show how irrational it is god can't be science god defined by christians is a entity not a method i saw that edpisode of futurama and he did not destroy it because he intervened he destroyed it because he wasn't careful about the way he tried to approach the problems they are proof of black holes though and my argument was that there is proof to disprove god and that there is no real proof god does exists they very idea of god is self contridiction a all knowing that does not know a all supreme that's not supreme if he cannot over power thats like saying there is a square with no sides it goes againts what a sqaure is supposed to be or mean yes i am wrong for generalizing religions as follwers of god but you are just as wrong for generalizing that all beleivers of god think he is loving and caring as well because in fact many jewish people don't beleive he is supposed to be loving and caring because when bad things happen they say it is god some jewish people even beleive that the genocide attempt by hitler was a messege of god that they were being bad jews and my jewish teacher told me this destroying evil does not make you evil because being evil is about following a set of immoral morals i do not beleive murder in itself is immoral but i do think it is immoral when you let others that beleive in you and warship you love you let them die suffer when they don't deserve to die or suffer also god knows all then he does constantly demand a sinfree world in a imperfect world i mean sure the person is better then the manacan then why is god always criticising and threatening the manacan i mean he loves the person but he would kill the person say he loves the person just because the person chooses not to follow in gods faith or footsetps what kind of god is that he should know the person is not perfect so why does he demand it to be sinfree it will not be sin free because because once it has commited sin its not sin free it would have to have not commited any sin at all and every person has lied cheated stolen bullied at some point in there life also the bible claims everyone inherit sins then demands you to be sin free thats like demanding a prostitue to be a virgin shes already had sex she can't be a virgin just as someone already had sin or inherited sin they cannot be sinfree the point im trying to make about god is that god demands sinfree society that requires perfection doesn't god know that having a sin free world is not possible especially if you create evil and flaws im not saying theres no buety in things with flaws im saying that he is constantly asking for something thats impossible for the world to become because sinfree world society must be perfect to acheive this and it would must likeley i agree be dull in regards to there being an overwhelming amount of evidence disproving god if evidence exists and it is beyond a reasonable doubt then why are there are so many educated millions suppressing inclinations due to a belief system clearly the juggernaut evidence to disprove god is not there also not all people believe in a god obviously so wouldn't it be destructive to your point if you class
