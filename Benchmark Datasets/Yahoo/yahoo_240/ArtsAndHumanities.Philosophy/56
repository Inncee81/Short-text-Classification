why did we humans make this world so complicated why did we create corporations corrupt governments countries magazines which tell us how to act dress etc useless movies cars pollution overpopulation drugs etc and countless of other things are we humans inherently bad or greedy or just very smart and what not i mean it takes brains to create all that is around us and it's not all bad by any means but it's very complicated and complex we've made ourselves insignificant the individual does not matter b c there are so many people doing so many things simultaneously we're in age of information overload and people generally become apathetic because everything is just so abundant and there we took our natural state and made the to mentallity take its place we have become slaves to our society and now decaying and troubled society sure it's booming for the rich and progressive in some spots but failing in others we could have built a utopia why didn't we i have to clear out a few ideas you present the world always was complicated every human past and present always took for granted what he received and wanted what he did not have the horizon is always beyond your reach we are to struggle and work for what we want as a species we have learned and we are better at it than before and will continue to improve in the future that said another way to get goods is to take them from the legitimate owners i do not mean here simple robbery there are more elaborate forms of taking away from others in part history deals with society learning how to avoid such parasites we are still learning the individual matters in a way that did not happen before centuries ago history was considered to include only who conquered who which king married and expanded his political domains for machiavelli the mass of people were considered inert irrelevant to what really matters society at present is better than it was a century ago of course there are problems i believe one century from now our descendants will be looking at us with the same air of superiority we look at people a century past us there is no such thing as a human natural state such talk is a variation of the supposed noble savage an illusion of how people were in other times for a realistic portrait of the people of those times look at how present people live in some third world countries you will find things you take for granted they consider luxuries and many of them risk their lives to get to the technologically advanced countries to mentality has always existed although in different forms a farmer may work from dawn to sunset as the fisherman or the hunter it takes work to produce food or to produce goods for which you get food utopia cannot exist a city where every need is satisfied economists say that humans are creatures of infinite ambition it means no matter what we have we will always want more such quality is not a bad thing progress was always made by those who were not happy by the present situation there will always be people who will not be happy with what they have and will long for what they do not have Microeconomics Human Capitalism Wealth Technology Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Summa Theologiae Civilization Property (ownership right) Overpopulation Supply and demand Evil Reality Brave New World Free will Ethics Energy development Scientific method Non-aggression principle Anarchism and capitalism Intellectual property Deconstruction Immortality Utopia Sociocultural evolution Abortion debate Republic (dialogue) Strategic management Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Artificial consciousness Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ecco the Dolphin School of Salamanca Scientology beliefs and practices The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Nicomachean Ethics Marvel Universe Meaning of life Franz Boas W.
