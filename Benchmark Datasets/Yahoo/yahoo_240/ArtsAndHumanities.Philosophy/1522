when one hold ethics and express it is one really justified by the fact that one posseses a soul which doesnt conform into this world theres an idea that inorder for you to express ethics one must forget about it is it possible how about the soul which has its own reallity other than the reality we create if we deny the reality of the soul then what we create is our reality as to this day but if we oath to have the soul as the reality then what we create now are just illussion i was conscious much of the expression of the soul which holds an infinite non ethical expression because it holds himself as the ethics and not an arbitrary based ethics it seems one must hold ethics as a reason based ethics which composed of a valid one but no one could reason out the expression of of the soul because it doen't belong to what we want to belong as in a group but the soul holds to be as you alone with in a group or in short tobe the individual this is where the greate person soul oath to say like einstein kierkegaard and others i believe that it is important for people to think about their philosophy of life or at least what philosophical principles they believe in and how such principles affect their lives in my view siddhartha gautama the buddha b c addressed this position very well do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many do not believe in anything because it is found written in your religious books do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations but after observation and analysis when you find anything that agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all then accept it and live up to it Friedrich Schleiermacher Reality Al-Ghazali Buddhism Ethics Victor Cousin Moral relativism Buddhist philosophy Morality Postmodernism Soul Jewish principles of faith Summa Theologiae Objectivist philosophy Atheism Aristotle Philo Dharma Moral objectivism Philosophy of science Philosophy Altruism Advaita Vedanta Hinduism Social justice Confucius Epistemology A Course In Miracles Jewish philosophy Ontological argument Simone Weil Michel Henry Meaning of life Coercion Subject (philosophy) Thomas Hill Green Peter Singer Logic Theory of conduct David Hume Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Rudolf Steiner Causality Falsifiability Supernatural Value system Scientific method Immanuel Kant Plato Hindu philosophy Church of Christ Utilitarianism Religious Society of Friends Islamic philosophy Phaedo Socrates Universal pragmatics Kuzari Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern philosophy Ludwig Wittgenstein Polyamory Duties of the Heart Rudolf Hermann Lotze Free will Human Reincarnation Merit Christian eschatology Abortion debate Spiritual evolution Ten Commandments Modernism Meme Solomon Ibn Gabirol Martin Heidegger Determinism Liberalism Philosophy of space and time Discordianism Philosophy of language God Christian philosophy Philosophy of mathematics
