is there any sense or truth in this statement i once heard someone say if you're not a socialist at you've got no heart and if you're not a capitalist at you're brainless personally i reckon it's a bit of a generalisation what would you say lol i guess it implies that when we're young we're more out spoken and passionate about sensitive issues while when we're older we're wiser because we realise that we can't defy the 'man' and have to conform with him i'm not too sure it means that socialism is for the naive and inexperienced as they do not yet understand the real problems and evils that it brings as it looks good on paper and from a superficial rational perspective but is completely contrary to the nature of man as free beings that are not merely to be reduced to a mechanism that is to be controlled by social engineering but capitalism is wrong as well as it is the opposite error its principle is simply personal profit without regard to justice to others and the greater good the just mean between them however is man working for a greater good in authentic freedom which socialism denies within the framework of just law where he finds his happiness Goodness and value theory Objectivist philosophy Social justice Summa Theologiae Simone Weil Anarcho-capitalism David Hume Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law of value Theodicy Capitalism Utilitarianism Political economy Original sin Exchange value Inflation Labor theory of value Postmodernism Atheism Bernard Williams Cultural relativism Philosophy of mathematics Economics Meaning of life Alignment (role-playing games) American individualist anarchism Jewish principles of faith Michel Henry Corporate governance Scientific method Property (ownership right) Human nature Immanuel Kant Religious Society of Friends Stoicism Contract Microeconomics Ten Commandments Freedom of the press Altruism Evil G__del's incompleteness theorem Coercion Philosophy of science Determinism Philosophy of language Falsifiability Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Al-Ghazali Friedrich Schleiermacher Sociocultural evolution Moral relativism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Existence of God Dharma Intellectual property Tonality Libertarianism Rudolf Steiner Truth Victor Cousin Democracy Economic anthropology Civil rights Morality Surplus value Apology (Plato) Nicomachean Ethics Two Treatises of Government Supernatural Logic Satanism Libertarian socialism Freedom of speech Transcendental argument for the existence of God Categorical imperative Prices of production Social contract Free market Predestination Church of Christ, Scientist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Estoppel Second language acquisition Economic inequality Jewish views of religious pluralism A Course In Miracles Password Paradox
