any quantity that can be measured is relative so there is no absolute anything just a weird concept i've been thinking about for eg you can't have a simply good person they'd be good compared to something else etc so everything quantifiable is relative to something else am i missing something i agree absolutely with your views everything is relative either to another thing or to itself in the past or in the future it is so because our cognitive experience is based on relative comparison of perceptions we treat it as equal when the difference is below the minimum cognitive margin in this universe there are no two things identical in all respects not even two blood cells in the same part of the same body not even two leaves of the same branch of the same tree hence any quantity beyond the single unit is not absolute that paradoxically also implies that everything is unique and hence absolute in itself well well that means no conclusion either can be absolute fabulous question thanks took me on a trip Philosophy of space and time Special relativity Psychology Microeconomics Goodness and value theory Friedrich Schleiermacher Time Objectivist philosophy Entropy Philosophy of mathematics Economics Science Inflation Decibel Infinity Mass Epistemology Cognitive science Abortion debate Quantum mechanics Species Moral relativism Physical paradox Economic inequality Law of value Free will Idealism Immanuel Kant The nature of God in Western theology EPR paradox Poverty line Equivalence principle Zeno's paradoxes Supply and demand Color Determinism Social psychology Gravity Philosophy of science God Biology and sexual orientation Transformation problem Prices of production Philosophical skepticism Decision making Maurice Merleau-Ponty Pressure Metaphor Human nature Intelligence (trait) Truth Many-worlds interpretation Planck units Welfare economics George Lakoff A Course In Miracles Predestination Black hole Theory of cognitive development Postmodernism Theodicy Cerebellum Critique of Pure Reason Nicolas Oresme Utilitarianism Anthroposophy Quantification Cultural relativism Ontological argument Faster-than-light Gross domestic product Anarchism and capitalism Problem of universals Luminiferous aether Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Second language acquisition English grammar Attention Race and intelligence Summa Theologiae Psychometrics Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Complex number Parallax Existence Explosive material Intelligent design Relativism Principal-agent problem Sense Person Ethics Modern geocentrism Term logic Capitalism
