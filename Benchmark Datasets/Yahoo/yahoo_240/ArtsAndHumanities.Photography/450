canon a unbeaten after asking a good amount of people in college they have said that some of the 'old school' mm slr's are still unbeaten by the newer models one of the models that is very popular is the canon a about people in college have one and shoot a hell of a lot on it can today's models beat it i agree with your classmates that old school manually controlled slr's are some of the best cameras to learn on they allow you to learn the nitty gritty technical stuff that goes into taking a correct exposure i've owned a few older canon yachica and pentax manual slr's and to me there's very little difference between their features and performance as long as they haven't been sitting in a closet unused for years they'll continue to work very nicely for a long time a manual slr provides you with the control you need to approach photography from a creative standpoint other features like autofocus and automatic flash control for instance can provide a faster workflow if you need to work quickly i've photographed a few weddings during the last one i shot for about hours and turned out about pictures that would've been a nightmare working fully manually i wouldn't have been able to position myself focus take a light reading adjust for it set my flash etc for every shot quickly enough to keep up with everything that's going on i recently got a nikon f s camera which is older than the n i was using but it has every feature i could ever want in a mm camera it's built like a tank and has manual and automatic controls my favorite feature is that it can use nearly any nikon lens ever made manual or autofocus to me it's like the best of both worlds Single-lens reflex camera Digital photography Konica Minolta Canon T90 Nikon Corporation Nikon FM2 Contax Nikon FE2 Leica Nikon FE Rangefinder camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon FM Camera Photography View camera Autofocus Pentax Photographic lens Macro photography Canon EF lens mount Cinematography Depth of field Nikon D70 Canon EOS-300D Advanced Photo System Camcorder Film Automatic transmission Full frame digital SLR Enlarger Canon PowerShot G Secure Digital card Twin-lens reflex camera Olympus (company) Street photography Binoculars Medium format Canon EOS-20Da Anamorphic widescreen Rebreather Floppy disk Canon T70 Exposure (photography) Amateur astronomy Technicolor Time-lapse M16 (rifle) Apollo 8 Panavision Computer Welding Metering mode Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 VHS Underwater photography GunZ The Duel Movie projector Pinhole camera Digital cinema Eye Zoom lens Shutter speed Praktica Aperture Firearm IPod Henri Cartier-Bresson Visual Basic Telescope Canon Inc.
