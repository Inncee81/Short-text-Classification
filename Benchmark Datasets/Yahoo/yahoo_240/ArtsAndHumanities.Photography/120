burning wedding pictures to a cd i recently shot a wedding last week i am trying to figure out how to burn all the images to a cd so that my clients can go to any store and print out photos as they please i don't know exactly what setting i need to use for each individual picture any help would be great maybe i should specify a bit further i understand the whole jpeg thing but where i am getting confused is that my camera takes pictures that print out at x i guess a default setting or something i use a nikon d if any of that matters in order for my clients to be able to print out a perfect x with the entire image i am having to add borders or crop down to an x i guess my question is should i resize all my photos before burning them to the cd or should i leave them as is and let the client set there preference when they go to make prints sorry i didnt make much sense with my first post its past my bedtime p if you arent going to edit the pics yourself just simply burn them as jpegs thats probably what they already are to your cd if they are raw files you will need to convert them to jpegs also known as jpg if you are using software that came with your camera and there is a setting for file size use the largest since that gives the best quality there are many classes for photography and postproduction many are affordable many camera stores offer them as well as your local community college in reference to the additional questionage first i am no pro but am working hard to be one part of what most photogs charge is not for just snapping a shutter but also for the post production and this is the real answer you are seeking to have a standard answer for all situations would be absurd or at the least dull i would look at each picture individually and asses any improvements i could make with the cropping tool theres a lot of work if you have pictures to edit but then again thats why people consider you a pro if you left it to a client to do they probably wont have as much of an eye for it as you do and therefore screw it up royally if you really wanted them to have the raw pics uneditted then thats your choice but i would edit at least a portion for different sizes some may not look as good x as they would x with cropping off of the sides you have to be the judge of what will look good and what wont i'm sure you have a few where one person was standing just a tad too close and you have their hand holding a drink in the reception or something you know what your doing now go do it Digital photography JPEG Image file formats Windows XP PlayStation Portable PNG Raw image format Digital image editing Stereoscopy Photography View camera Konica Minolta Digital camera Screenshot GIF Common Unix Printing System Enterprise content management Windows Vista Password Xbox 360 GED Apple Computer Bluetooth DVD CPU cache Leica Camcorder Mouse (computing) Windows 2000 PlayStation 3 ITunes Danger Hiptop Panoramic photography Redundant array of independent disks IPod Extreme Programming AmigaOS Windows Server 2003 PIC microcontroller Microeconomics Movie projector Opera (web browser) Microsoft Office Glen Jacobs Theory of conduct Quotation mark QuickTime Drill bit Widescreen Hash table Adobe Photoshop X Window System Handloading Macro photography NTFS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Java programming language Ebook Mozilla Application Suite Macromedia Flash Canon T90 Goatse.cx Photographic film Publishing IPhoto SAT Plame affair Blog Domain Name System H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Free will Dither Patricia Ford Discordianism Digital cinema Photojournalism Open source culture Modem Expert system JPEG 2000 Screenplay English grammar Electronic journalism Virtual memory Mac OS X Internet Explorer Oracle database Professional wrestling throws Geographic information system Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March XML
