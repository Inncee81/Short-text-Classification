a standard answer to the stupid b w and one colour question this question is about one in ten really its not even a photography question please join with me and use the standard answer below if a few of us do it it might get these time watsers to go ask in graphic arts or a computer section the answer is go ask in grafic arts im being precious i know but like other pros i know photoshop wont do anything for peoples photographic skills in fact it just keeps them swimming in the sea of retarded automatic image making how many times do we get a link to a professional image with lighting and good exposure and the question how do i do this the answer is study lighting and photography but the photoshopers give a long winded method to try and get the result which is impossible tell me how does that help people comments thanks will you join me in the answer go ask in graphic arts or is it the right thing to do so it wont happen a helene thanks for honouring us with your answer me i think the images look stupid and ametuer why do they do it no idea thats right they have no other ideas a thanks cabbie you on to it thanks evan i see your points but sort of disagree to me photohop is down time alot of my work i dont know what the final product will be and dont care as long as they pay i had one client insist i do the graphic work told him no he insisted so i charged him my normal rate and got a student to do the work at a nice profit i charge an hour for my skill experience and results why would i want an hour to do stuff that bores me to tears all our bizzos are different of course for me photoshop is a theif of time my work on trannie dont need any work because i spent hours setting up my light i earn well because im skilled lights etc thats where i charge the big photoshop is the theif of time and income for me id rather spend hours in the field than days in photoshop pays the same half a day making art or days in photoshop easy choise they are different skills to me i might retouch a little no more needed i hire a student it works me that selective desaturation look was the coolest thing ever the first hundred or so times it was used i would say that effects of that type can absolutely be the purview of a photographer or a graphic artist though the line between is becoming increasingly blurry of course photographers can remain pure shot makers leaving the digital dirty work to graphic artists and they will be less and less competitive against the photographers that are skilled in lighting composition exposure and digital wizardry sure some top photographers may not need those skills to survive but they will be farther and farther between as clients of all kinds expect design elements in their products why would i want to entrust my artistic efforts to a graphic artist that may not share my vision anyway Photography Adobe Photoshop Stereoscopy Digital photography Graphic design View camera Software engineering Drawing Macro photography Graphics Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Game programmer Computer graphics Scientology beliefs and practices Color Cinematography Depth of field Konica Minolta Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Microeconomics The Apprentice 2 Traditional animation Art Labor theory of value Education in the People's Republic of China Holography Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Martial art Socrates Ethics Call centre IBM PC compatible Film Digital camera Economic inequality Wheel of Fortune B3ta Copyleft Cheating in Counter-Strike Requirements analysis Color blindness Parachuting Photographic film Progressive tax Speed of light Database Quizbowl Labour economics CPU cache Modem Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows Vista Science Explosive material Digital circuit Economics Floppy disk Panoramic photography Scientific method Crop circle Transformation problem Good Times Mojave people Rendering (computer graphics) Plame affair Social rule Billboard Hot 100 Solar cell PNG Screenshot Pinball Windows 2000 3D computer graphics Extreme Programming Computer Luminiferous aether PlayStation Portable Graduate school Prices of production Time Out of Mind RISC Little Britain Geographic information system Welding Autostereogram Enterprise content management Education Seventh Sea (collectible card game)
