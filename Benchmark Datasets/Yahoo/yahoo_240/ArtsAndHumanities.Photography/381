what would be the best way to go about getting an internship with a local photographer education is no higher than highschool but yet want to get education in the area of photography you don't need a college education in my opinion it's best to learn on the job look in the phone book under professional commercial photographers and call each photog and ask if they are looking for photo assistants i'm a photog myself and worked as a photo assistant in boston for several years pay ranges from a day to depending on experience if you really don't have any experience tell them you will intern for a while but then expect to be paid your duties will include things like loading film that is if they are still using film in which case they are behind the times getting cameras ready using photoshop to retouch photos setting up lighting equipment lugging around equipment running errands packing up and putting away equipment buying props for shoots keeping the studio clean etc if you don't know adobe photoshop learn it you will learn alot by working for several different types of photographers good luck it's a fun profession Photography Digital photography Adobe Photoshop Photographic film Film Clapper loader Stereoscopy Surveillance Game programmer Panoramic photography Weekly newspaper Trademark Parachuting Photograph View camera Lightsaber Medium format Street photography Digital camera PNG Microsoft Office Social rule Professor IPod Konica Minolta Film crew Traditional animation Cinematographer Topps Physician Photojournalism IBM PC compatible Craps Intern Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cover girl Paintball Single-lens reflex camera Colorist Pornography Education in the People's Republic of China James Van Der Zee Cruising (maritime) Camera General practitioner Yearbook Architect Sound design Machinima Bluetooth Photo manipulation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Depth of field Education in Germany Edward S.
