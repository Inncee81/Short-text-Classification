ir compatibility i have a fuji s fd and i would like to order an infrared filter for it but i don't know if they are compatible i mean will i be able to take good quality ir pictures or do i have to modify the camera or should i let the ir photography go with this camera thanks you can test for the ir sensitivity in a dark room using a remote control from your tv or dvd player just open the shutter for a long exposure and aim the remote a the lens while holding down one of its keys the ir from the remote will expose the sensor if there is not hot filter in front of your cameras sensor a note on using ir filters they are opaque to visible light so you will not be able to see to compose if you try to mount the filter on the lens first the procedure is to compose the shot add the ir filter and then slightly de focus the lens ir focuses differently than visible light and then take the shot this changing of the focus will have to be done using the manual focus mode on your camera and by using a very small aperture like f or f here is a link to cameras that can be converted Photography Digital photography Canon T90 Charge-coupled device Camera Photographic lens Digital camera Stereoscopy Shutter speed Cinematography Macro photography Panoramic photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Depth of field Single-lens reflex camera Aperture Infrared Anamorphic widescreen Enlarger Konica Minolta Contax Movie projector Camcorder Exposure (photography) Film speed Cassini-Huygens Photographic film Clementine mission F-number Filter (optics) Canon EF lens mount Stage lighting Point and shoot camera Shutter (photography) Traffic light Pinhole camera Floppy disk Telescope Galileo spacecraft Canon PowerShot G Technicolor Sensor Time-lapse IMAX Light-emitting diode Rangefinder camera Television E85 NTSC STS-62 Ultraviolet Street photography Nikon FM2 Canon FD PlayStation Portable Nikon Corporation Infrared photography Nikon FE2 Amateur astronomy Parallax Surveyor 7 Shutter angle OC-135B Open Skies DVD Lighting Widescreen Sun Laser Medium format Surveyor 3 Film Thermographic camera Panavision Danger Hiptop Night vision Cinematographer Color blindness Mouse (computing) Motion picture terminology Pixel Federal Standard 1037C Zone system Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Polarization Computer vision Machine vision Filter (photography) Reflecting telescope Game controller Gamut
