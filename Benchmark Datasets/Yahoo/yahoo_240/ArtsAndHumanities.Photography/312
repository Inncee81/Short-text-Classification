what is the best flash for a nikon d i will be shooting for a magazine and need a flash what is the best to purchase i'd vote for the sb for the power and flexibility you would make out better with more than one flash and in the future the sb works very well with multiple light sources more output would be helpful since i'm guessing you will only have one light source with more light you can bounce the light off the wall or ceiling or use a diffuser so you don't have such a harsh look to your shots if the flash is not powerful enough you won't have enough light to do this adequately the sb kicks pretty good but the sb puts out about more light there are other features that will matter in the future but for your first job where you will only have one flash i think this is the most important consideration Counter-Strike Digital photography Bicycle lighting Flash (comics) Macromedia Flash Canon EOS Items in the Metroid series Table tennis Solar cell Konica Minolta Canon T90 Sonic the Hedgehog Phoebe Halliwell Tennis B-47 Stratojet GunZ The Duel Internal ballistics M16 (rifle) Lighting Bubble Bobble Shader Carbine Racquetball Single-lens reflex camera Password Wind power Game show Light-emitting diode Hybrid vehicle GunBound Red-eye effect Bomberman Game Boy The Bill Robot Master Incandescent light bulb Technology in the Stargate universe Super Metroid Theory of conduct Stage lighting Economic inequality Pinball $ale of the Century View camera Nikon FA Sega Saturn Kardashev scale Nikon FM2 Mario Field-programmable gate array Badminton Snooker Liquid crystal display Nikon FE Transformer Roy Jones Jr. Nikon FE2 Solar power Wayne Corporation Milton H.
