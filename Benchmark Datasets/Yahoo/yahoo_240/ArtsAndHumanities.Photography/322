which college for photography i want to know what college has a good reputation for their photography classes any college recommendations will be fine but if someone could tell me one that is in virginia i would appreciate it given that you are asking this question i am going to assume you are starting out with taking college level photography classes and that you are limited on your budget as well the suggestion here is to look towards your local community or jr college and their art department they will have digital imaging classes digital photography classes darkroom techniques etc all geared towards a progression to an associates degree in graphic arts which is the category of the degree i've attended personally the digital imaging website design and yes digital photography classes at my local community college fl and have found them to be fun creative and a joy to take and although you have to do a lot of work in the course and i had to submit a portfolio of selections plus we did work with the adobe professional creative suite of software products it was something i enjoyed tremendously i found my local newspaper was a great source of ideas on events local nearby that were either free or low cost so that all my submitted works were of different origins and all it meant was that my time was required to satify the course syllabus i now have that portfolio and i enjoy using my digital slr cameras and their lenses even more so than the mm slrs that were the only option when i was a young adult yes i am an empty nesting single retiree going back to college i've used this knowledge to build skills i never thought i had and for me arts is a long stretch from the sciences that i based my original ugrad and grad degrees as well as my careers on and have used the skills in designing websites for the family farm as well as others and marketing our products Digital photography Konica Minolta Adobe Photoshop Single-lens reflex camera Art Leica Canon EOS Digital camera Graduate school Community college Stereoscopy Product Lifecycle Management Nikon Corporation Education in the United States Contax GED Digital single-lens reflex cameras Panoramic photography Savannah College of Art and Design Digital art Computer Education in the People's Republic of China Emerson College Photojournalism Carnegie Mellon University Intellectual property Ebook Graphic design Canon T90 Digital audio workstation Rangefinder camera Traditional animation Strategic management View camera Open access Education in Japan Advanced Placement Program Film Trademark Cinematography Education Academia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Advertising College admissions Software engineering High-definition television Windows Vista Homeschooling Master's degree Secure Digital card Camera Parachuting IPod Advanced Photo System University of Massachusetts Amherst Scalable Vector Graphics Macro photography Game programmer Medium format Yearbook Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Digital video 2D computer graphics Extreme Programming Camcorder Cooper Union Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Motion picture rating system Bloodstain pattern analysis Bluetooth Massachusetts Institute of Technology Digital rights management 3D computer graphics Fair use California Polytechnic State University Enterprise content management Scientific method College IBM PC compatible Photographic lens Software testing Education in Australia Henri Cartier-Bresson Full frame digital SLR Scientology beliefs and practices Wi-Fi X Window System Princeton University DeviantART Copyright Karl Marx
