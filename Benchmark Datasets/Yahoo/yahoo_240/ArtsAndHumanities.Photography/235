aperature f number f stop question i have a high end sony digital p s camera that goes from f to f i'm getting ready to make the switch to digital slr but as i'm looking at lenses i'm concerned that most only go as small as f i use the smallest size f quite a bit such as taking shots of moving water with a slow shutter during the day light in fact there have been plenty of times when i really wished i could make the aperture even smaller is this something i'm going to have to give up if i go to slr in laymans terms when you are looking at a lens and it say something like mm f the actually refers to the maximum aperature widest open i e at mm it can open up to f but zoomed in to mm it can only open up to f the minimum aperature largest number is not usually printed on the lens itself and you must check the specs a little closer most lenses i have seen go down to f at least even when a lens only lists one aperature f they usually can still stop down quite a ways one exception is the mirror reflex lens its usually manual focus and will say fixed aperature right on the box mines a mm f fixed aperature it comes with darkenning filters to lessen the light for the times when f isn't dark enough Leica Digital photography View camera Single-lens reflex camera Aperture Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photographic lens Camera Camcorder Digital camera Macro photography Movie projector Panoramic photography Canon T90 Rangefinder camera Stage lighting Canon EF lens mount Pentax Point and shoot camera Shutter speed Nikon Corporation Cinematography Zoom lens Panavision F-number Twin-lens reflex camera Pinhole camera Anamorphic widescreen Aberration in optical systems Nikon FA Parallax Nikon FM2 Depth of field Eye Digital camera back Street photography Floppy disk Canon FD Eyepiece Nikon FE Nikon FE2 Clementine mission IMAX Betting (poker) Television Nikon FM Shutter (photography) Glasses Film Film speed Reflecting telescope Lighting Railway signal DVD CPU cache Advanced Photo System Exposure (photography) Full frame digital SLR Apollo 8 Technicolor Wood Schneider Kreuznach PlayStation Portable Movie camera Lens (optics) Vignetting Automatic number plate recognition Medium format Motion picture terminology Diffraction Canon EOS-20Da Photographic film Binoculars Solar power Circle of confusion Autostereogram Autofocus Angular resolution Oscilloscope Zeiss Memory Stick Secure Digital card Charge-coupled device 70 mm film Olympus (company) Bokeh System/34 DV Modem Nikon D70 Telephone numbering plan
