what is the best digital camera for taking pics in low light i e at a club taking pics of a band on stage i've bought a couple of digital cameras in the past ranging from but there's always either a problem with the auto focus delay or the low light delay pics coming out blurry etc any advice as to what i should look for in a camera where my main focus no pun intended will be taking pictures of bands playing in clubs where the lighting is mixed if you can get a digital slr with a fast lens your problems are solved if you can't spend upwards of though look into the fujifilm f series the current model that looks best to me is the f fd it has a reputation for good low light performance switch to a center weighted or better spot meter reading for the best exposure of the performers you'll have to forget about white balance and it probably won't matter anyway just leave it on auto wb and hope for the best low light performance you could tell us what type of camera p s dslr you are considering and we can recommend some models over others for low light performance you can't simply look at the iso available on a camera because you have no way of knowing simply by seeing a number like iso or iso if the camera is any good at that speed you only know that the camera functions in low light conditions but not how well it functions the same goes for image stabilization etc image stablization vibration reduction shake reduction lets you use longer exposures to let in more light while offsetting the tendancy for camera shake to blur the picture during longer exposures but this might be offset by digital noise or excessive noise reduction in the image processor that goes along with the extended shutter speeds there are two things to look for though as a general rule although not always you can expect better low light performance from a larger sensor in p s cameras this means that you should look for a sensor that is approx or a which is twice as big as the more commonly used sensor slr sensors are huge by comparison though the second thing to look for is a wide aperture on the lens aperture numbers work backwards so an f lens is wider than an f smaller numbers are generally better for low light the only real way to tell is to read reviews on the cameras that you are interested in you didn't mention your price range but most digital slr's are much better than most point and shoot cameras among the point and shoot cameras the fuji f series has probably got the best reputation for low light performance these would be specifically the f f f fd and f fd morey will have more to say about this if he sees this question the f fd is at b h photo for and they have the f fd for i don't see the f or f listed any longer but perhaps you can find them in stores they would be under if you can find one fujifilm f fd review http www dpreview com reviews fujifilmf fd fujifilm f fd preview http www dpreview com news fujifilmfinepixf fd asp Konica Minolta Canon T90 View camera Stereoscopy Aperture Macro photography Nikon Corporation Camera Photographic film Depth of field Panoramic photography Canon EOS Computer Contax Exposure (photography) Film speed Canon EF lens mount Mouse (computing) Movie projector Photographic lens Shutter speed Point and shoot camera Camcorder Eye Oscilloscope Medium format CPU design Sensor Digital camera back Wind turbine F-number Bluetooth Canon PowerShot G IMAX Lighting Canon EOS-20D Automatic number plate recognition Charge-coupled device Canon EOS-300D Amateur astronomy Astronomical seeing Rangefinder camera Secure Digital card MP3 Motion capture Galileo spacecraft CPU cache Eyepiece Jet engine B-47 Stratojet Federal Standard 1037C Transformer E85 Antenna (radio) Panavision Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Advanced Photo System Weight training Enlarger Telescope Full frame digital SLR Armored Core ISO 9000 Binoculars Explosive material Radar Computer vision Hard disk Rendering (computer graphics) Electrophysiology DVD Digital Musical Instrument Digital Interface Optical coherence tomography Film Gamut STS-62 C programming language Strategic management
