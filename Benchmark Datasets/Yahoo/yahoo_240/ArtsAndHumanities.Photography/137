shutter priority on nikon d x help ok so i was wondering if i could take pictures of stars by leaving the shutter open for seconds or so but the only time it takes pictures is when its able to focus on something i switched the lens switch to manual but nothing showed up if this is the case then does that mean i will have a hard time photographing lightning or is it because i had the polarizer filter on could i have the uv one on without it blocking out stars or lightning i am confused my last camera i could switch it to shutter priority and then star shooting but this one seems to want something to focus on instead of darkness you are switching the lens to manual focusing you need to rotate the control dial at the top to m for manual settings shutter priority is the s on the dial by the way here's a great d and d x users guide i suggest you print out and keep i did the same with the d and d guides from the same website http www kenrockwell com nikon d users guide index htm hope this is helpful if you have any more questions please ask Canon T90 Digital photography Leica Shutter speed Photography Nikon FM2 Canon EOS Nikon FE2 Stereoscopy View camera Konica Minolta Nikon FA Camera Nikon FE Nikon Corporation Single-lens reflex camera Panoramic photography Photographic lens Stage lighting F-number Nikon FM Federal Standard 1037C Amateur astronomy Enlarger Movie projector Depth of field Cinematography Mouse (computing) Shutter (photography) Pinhole camera Canon EF lens mount Cinerama Point and shoot camera Time-lapse Film Aperture Panavision Digital camera Twin-lens reflex camera Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lightsaber Film speed Apollo 8 Shutter angle Macro photography Television Street photography Canon PowerShot G Lens (optics) Camcorder Anamorphic widescreen Traffic light Digital camera back Lighting Charge-coupled device Eastman Kodak Gamma ray burst Binoculars Domain Name System Railway signal Parallax Embedded system Common Unix Printing System Redundant array of independent disks Apollo 15 Apollo Guidance Computer Telephone exchange Logo programming language World Wide Web Hard disk Polarization Secure Digital card ALGOL 68 Spyware Canon FD Exposure (photography) Wiki Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure GunBound IMAX Glasses Vertical service code Uniform Resource Locator Starfleet ranks and insignia B3ta Diablo II M-209 Technicolor Danger Hiptop BitTorrent Aurora (astronomy) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Autostereogram Web crawler
