when can the word 'that' be omitted i've been thinking about it for some time and i just can't figure out the answer is it permissible to omit the word 'that' in some cases e g which is more correct a one shouldn t make a promise they can t keep or b one shouldn t make a promise that they can t keep i feel like the first one is wrong but i hear it all the time so i'm confused i think this is the difference between formal language used in writing and informal or colloquial language used in speech of course there is also informal writing where leaving out the 'that' is acceptable this is like informal or formal clothing you have to judge what is best in any given situation and if you get it wrong then it looks wrong to others Singlish Theory of conduct Modal auxiliary verb Quebec French American and British English differences Social rule Gender-neutral language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus English plural Contract Non-native pronunciations of English Kanji African American Vernacular English Taiwanese (linguistics) Written Cantonese Chinese language Pronoun Finnish language Grammatical aspect Korean language Deconstruction Standard Cantonese Cantonese (linguistics) Appeal Spoken Finnish Redundant array of independent disks Asperger syndrome Liaison Indian English Arabic language Ethics Aphasia Stuttering English verbs Grammar Philosophy of language Halakha Originalism Quotation mark Translation 2004 Democratic National Convention Japanese honorifics Milton H.
