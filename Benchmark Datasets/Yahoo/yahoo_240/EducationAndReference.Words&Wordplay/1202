others of course he was older but that shouldn't matter after all wasn't her power over men absolute she devised a plan lady minerva was mad about her new paramour lord rochester but so far had not been able to bewitch him as she had all the others of course he was older but that shouldn't matter after all wasn't her power over men absolute she devised a plan she had learned that he did want a real relationship with someone when she had posed as a fortune teller to discover things about him now she just had to organize an event to make him see that she was the one her mom had always told lady minerva that a way to a man's heart is through his stomach so she invited lord rochester for a seven course dinner that she would personally prepare and present out in the terrace of her citadel first she had the entire place get decorated with beautiful plants that all carried little candles hanging out of their branches then she made sure that there were gardenias and hydrangeas all over the rails the statues the potted trees and in the center of the dinner table the gardenias gave out an intoxicating smell while they looked innocent and pretty arranged next to the hydrangeas needles to say she had her personal chef cook all seven courses but the lady did deserve some credit for putting so much time and thought into the decorations and deciding which dishes to be served she even had a gigantic pot of night blooming jasmine imported from the neighboring kingdom especially for the dinner event in the end it was all worth it when lord rochester stepped outside his carriage in front of lady minerva's citadel he smiled approvingly at the dancing lights of the dozens and dozens of candles that she had strategically placed all around the terrace lady minerva welcomed him with a little curtsy when her manservant led him to her terrace lord rochester respectfully bowed and kissed her extended hand while presenting her with a bunch of fresh tigerlillies as they both got seated and the servants started serving the appetizers the magic of the surroundings were starting to work their charm on both of them the flickering candle lights dancing to the romantic tunes that were being played in the background by the violinist that lady minerva had hired the intoxicating aroma that was cast into the night breeze by the gardenias the beautiful blue and white theme of the entire decorations the potted birch trees lining the terrace that carried tiny candles hanging from their little branches everything seemed to come together the overall effect in one word was magical right before their desert was served lord rochester got out of his chair and asked lady minerva for a dance under the stars as they were dancing to the rhythm of the slow sensual touching music played by the violinist lord rochester saw the candle lights casting different shades of colors into lady minerva's winter sky grey eyes he smiled contently as he twirled her they were moving in harmony and in complete sync when lady minerva felt as if the cool breeze of the night had suddenly stopped and somebody had turned on the heat as their eyes locked she was sure that he felt the same sparks flying there was only one way to be sure lady minerva parted her lips invitingly and a split second later lord rochester had locked lips with her in a sizzling kiss the next moment lady minerva's stiletto clad foot popped as she wrapped her arms around lord rocherster's neck in a never ending kiss while their passion mounted she smiled to herself apparently her mom was right about the path to a man's heart she made a mental note to listen to her advice more often in the future and pressed her body even closer to lord rochester's until she heard him groan in urgency the end Manual
