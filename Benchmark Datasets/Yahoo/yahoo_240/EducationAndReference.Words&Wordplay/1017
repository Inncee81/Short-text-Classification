i felt inspired what do you think of my poem when the music ceases when the lyrics disappear when the instruments break when musican can't hear when mediums are the same when the color is gone when the classics are burned when nothing can be drawn when the speeches are erased when there isn't a single word when all the people leave when the greats can't be heard when the space is filled when there's not a single thought when the dreamers can't dream when nothing can be taught when death valley freezes over when pigs begin to fly without freedom of expression everything would die i like it very much it has wonderful rich imagery it has a nice pace and flow it builds in emotional impact with the constant drumming of when when when but i also agree with many things heather has said although the repeating when are impactful i think they lose some of their impact after awhile and feel more repetitious you can still retain the beat beat beat of when when when without using it to start every line i also feel there may stronger ways to close with some changes to the last lines i don't always appreciate it when people mess with my writing so i hestitate to do it to others however in this case i think what you have is such a good piece i can't help but suggest ways that make it better from my personal perspective i hope you won't mind when the music ceases and the lyrics disappear when the instruments break if the musican can't hear when mediums are the same when the color is gone when the classics are burned and nothing can be drawn when the speeches are erased and there isn't a single word when all the people leave so the greats can't be heard when the space is filled if there's not a single thought when the dreamers can't dream and nothing can be taught when deserts turn to ice sheets when pigs begin to fly is when freedom of expression and all else would die Microsoft Word Word processor Spoken word Word play Portmanteau Word order Word (computer science) Word processing Loanword Word (linguistics) The L Word Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album Root (linguistics) Butterfly Muslim Hanja Hidden Words Etymology Morphology (linguistics) Neologism Time and a Word Measure word Profanity The Word is Live Latin Part of speech Vocabulary Code word Sacred text Word problem for groups Slang Act Without Words I Figure of speech Compound (linguistics) Rhyme Saturniidae In a Word: Yes (1969 - ) -onym London Microsoft Office Adverb Four-letter word Numerical prefix Allah Phoneme Gay Act Without Words II English language Georgian language Lisa's First Word Fuck Dictionary Fighting words Rafflesia Scrabble (game show) Clitic Sutro Tower Gentile Jehovah Abbreviation Transliteration Integer (computer science) Inherently funny word Arabic language Acronym and initialism Spell checker Written Cantonese Indonesian language Code word (figure of speech) Stress (linguistics) Eskimo Longest word in English Seven dirty words Acute accent Backronym Elohim Negro French language Torah American English Anglicisation Egyptian language Phrase Hungarian language Japanese language Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children Etymology of the word Jew Dutch language Transcription (linguistics) Scrabble R__maji Vowel harmony Inflection Word of faith Remora Arthur Schwartz Novella Furigana Pejorative Forth programming language
