festus festus continued matt you ve got me so mixed up take a deep breath and another good now miss kitty said what ka boom festus erupted frantic again after the two marshal prescribed deep breaths

reservation and a clear intent to figure out and do just whatever was right and necessary to deal with what could become a rather explosive situation but i am going to start by having a little conversation with miss kitty right now decided the marshal as he strapped on his peacemaker and headed over to the long branch festus jumped up excitedly from the corner of the desk where he had lighted after his imaginary cat fight matt motioned emphatically for him to stay put as he glided determinedly forward on his mission matt quickly reached the saloon home of miss kitty and entered without hesitation to find miss kitty languorously swaying on a staircase railing post slur werbling some unintelligible tune interspersed with little grunts and an occasional boisterous ha matt s instant impression was that miss kitty was as schnackered as a cowhand on his first day in town after a couple four months on the range and a pocketful of wages while he remained focused on miss kitty he registered in the corner of his eye an empty wiskey bottle lying prone on the bar but nothing else that invited possible trouble wuh welllll uh huh heh helllloooo buh buh bubba ha bubba thash a goo

that key offered miss kitty as she locked the cell door on her heart and threwwwwww the key cheerily realizing that being locked up in the jail with matt would keep her really close to her man well i think we could arrange that for you replied the marshal stoically intending a lone prisoner in his cell that would allow any planned ka booming to be forgotten in the pangs of what was sure to he a banging hangover yew mean that gasped a clueless miss kitty missing matt s intent and thinking there would be two inmates involved in her lock up hee haw i loooooove yew buh buh karoooooooo with a victorious yelp miss kitty rose with only a slight tipsy from the staircase and bolted headlong about one foot to the right of where matt was actually standing just as she reached her buckaroo she leapt her legs now parallel to the floor and spread wide to wrap around her matt s hulking torso her arm s reaching for his neck however in her jim beamish torpor she had attempted to make a piggyfront landing around mmm mmm mmm matt but had aimed her intentions at the figment of her inebriated eyesight she landed completely unmolested unfortunately and without the least degree of daintiness on her delicious petticoated derriere and promptly found the floor with the back of her head ka thunk no more ka boom when kitty had started her off target charge matt knew precisely what was happening and what was about to happen he decided in her loose state miss kitty stood little chance of actually hurting herself so he let the charging intoxicant follow her own course and mischievously anticipated the landing scene chuckling quietly to himself and figuring the impending shock might bring some sense back to her matt observed the floored form of his friend for a moment and then kindly stepped beside her as he leaned over to help the roused but no longer aroused miss kitty matt had underestimated the load of a limp lush lady he slightly tipped his balance over kitty for the briefest moment but at the same instant she roguishly reached her arms around his neck and matt fell haplessly in a full bodied pancake directly on top of his fortunate and definitely pleased newly found floormate matt wailed sunshine who had just walked over to the long branch with festus he had goaded her into a visit when she had gone to the jail to talk with matt about their plans for a quiet weekend together and she along with the scalawag were now peering over the saloon doors sunshine fixed in horror festus gleefully soaking in every possible source of his amusement from matt kitty sunshine kitty matt kitty sunshine matt the compromised marshal strained his neck in the direction of sunshine as miss kitty slipped into pretended unconsciousness and tightened her hold around matt s sturdy neck sunshine it s alright soothed matt if you have to just take a pill and put a little faith in me at the mention of sunshine kitty tightened her grip even more which matt began to delicately undue to which kitty tightened yet more firmly sunshine paused only for a moment she knew that tone matt was about his business not miss kitty s she realized festus culpability in the circumstance and took his hat off glared him in the eyes and whacked him on the head with his own hat she then strode on undisturbedly with her business calling back to matt see you at supper sugar as she dangled festus hat teasingly in her stride just out of the rascal s reach to lead him on a little chase for her merry repayment USS Tunny (SS-282) The Jim Rome Show Friends Syphon Filter Diving
