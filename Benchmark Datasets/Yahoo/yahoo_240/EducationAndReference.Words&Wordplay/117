help fix this paragraph please the problem is my transition into when the character looks around him i can't get the rhythm right but i wanted to say something like he took visage of the area in hopes of regaining his bearings or something but it doesn't sound or flow right am i missing a sentence somewhere i don't know why this isn't working i've been sitting at it for like an hour and i'm just stuck any help por favor the hunter kneaded his head in an attempt to shake the remnants of his bizarre hallucination then slowly raised himself to a sitting position as his hands pushed at the ground to lift his upper body they sank slightly fingers curling downward into soft loose sand transition into looking around him dark empty beachfront to either side of him dense forest behind him and infinite black ocean stretching forever deep into the horizon i also thought of something else if i didn't say he looked but just gave a description of the area would that work or be too distant from the character i think your trouble may be with the word visage since it usually is used in regards to a person's face or appearance and generally never as a verb as you are trying to use it vis age vzj n the face or facial expression of a person countenance appearance aspect the bleak visage of winter instead try to substitute the word with another word or phrase and then it'll work better for you try one of these instead scrutinized surveyed gazed assessed regarded considered there are so many Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Milton H.
