downtrod vs downtrodden i have a two part question about the words downtrod and downtrodden first of all is downtrod still a word acceptable in today's english language i know that downtrod is the alternate and old word for downtrodden but i was wondering if it still is considered modern language to use also can downtrodden be used to describe an object literally being beaten bent as in the downtrodden grass or can it only be used in the context of the oppressed for example the downtrodden people sorry for the bad examples but i've been wondering downtrodden is used for the oppressed tyrannized i'd say or write that 'the grass was trampled ' or look in the thesaurus for an alternate word regarding the grass i've never heard nor read the word downtrod also i thought your examples weren't bad Uniform Resource Locator Representational State Transfer Hyperventilation HyperText Transfer Protocol Cross site scripting Wiki World Wide Web Wat Phou Uniform Resource Identifier Apache HTTP Server Website Webster's Dictionary Angkor Wat Mozilla Firefox Ajax (programming) Web server Dictionary Cambodia Wat Phra Kaew Python programming language Digest access authentication Spyware Clause Character encodings in HTML Transmission Control Protocol Web browser 400 (number) Emphysema Panic attack Oxford English Dictionary Wat Tham Krabok Cloaking Hiberno-English Wat Tambor Apnea Google Web Accelerator Dutch language Wat Pho Wat Arun Dictionary of National Biography Afrikaans HTTP cookie Chiang Rai Luang Prabang Oxygen toxicity Angkor BitTorrent Intracranial pressure Tomb Raider Slash (punctuation) Bangkok Chiang Mai Electroencephalography Phnom Penh Welsh language Slashdot subculture Transport Layer Security Gnutella Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships Wat Phra That Doi Chom Thong Internet censorship in mainland China Hostos Community College Chaiya Vientiane Peasants' Revolt Wat Chedi Luang Legal research Nahuatl language Gopher protocol Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Proxy server Web service WebDAV Konqueror Web traffic Ephedra Internet Information Services Automatic number identification Jessadabodindra SAML File-sharing program XRI Samphanthawong A Greek-English Lexicon Domain name Radical (Chinese character) Phra Nakhon CPAN Flickr Mozilla Application Suite Z39.50 Squid cache Siem Reap Sathon JSON Web crawler Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Associative array Vim (text editor) Jabber
