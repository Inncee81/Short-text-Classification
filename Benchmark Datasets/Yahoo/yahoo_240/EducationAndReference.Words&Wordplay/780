to ever fall in love what does this mean im confused does it mean to never fall in love sing without a reason to ever fall in love how about a simpler answer please when i see these two lines without any additional context i'm still pretty sure what the author is trying to say both these thoughts seem similar and are probably among a longer list of suggested behaviors that seek to find joy in the real and simple pleasures of life we so often overlook to sing without reason gives a very carefree childlike impression my mother in law would sing without reason when we was occupied doing household chores or just walking along lost in thought she often would quietly sing some wordless tune that made her and you happy to ever fall in love is also a very open armed and open hearted approach to life it suggests you not worry about or be afraid of rejection instead it is an invitation to consciously embrace all of the good in people and in life so that you are always having the experience of being in love with everyone and everything in your life beautiful thoughts to ponder in a tough old world R__maji Hiccup Kanji Japanese writing system Kana Furigana Katakana Hiragana Japanese name Kuril Islands Okurigana Toyo kanji Japanese language and computers Learning kanji Ethnic issues in Japan Culture of Japan Pok__mon (anime) Hentaigana Nihon-shiki Otaku Gyaru-moji W__puro r__maji Kunrei-shiki Posthumous name Breath Kancho Hepburn romanization Onomatopoeia Ruby character Japan national rugby union team Transcribing English to Japanese Kanji kentei JSL Hanja Kookaburra Historical kana usage Chinese character Yen Inkan Olympic Flame Exiles (comics) Mahjong tiles Japanese language Japanese numerals 2channel Metal Gear (video game) Transliteration Tsukuba, Ibaraki Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Digimon Steel Jeeg Ideogram Myoclonus Daicon IV Japan The Fast Show Sento Categories The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Chu shogi Saitama, Saitama Yasukuni Shrine Japanese Wikipedia The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Korean language Japanese abbreviated and contracted words Invincible Super Man Zambot 3 Stroke order Tokyo Metro Antonio Inoki Ikiru Japanese Language Proficiency Test Iteration mark Occupied Japan Takijiro Onishi Japanese era name Tai shogi Japanese literature Chlorpromazine Whale shogi Ky__iku kanji Mount Fuji Hangul Japanese toilet Yomi Japanese Industrial Standard Cyrillization of Japanese Hand shogi Foreign branding Japanese garden Senseki Line Cannon shogi Mahou Sentai Magiranger History of Japan Paddy field Yokogaki and tategaki Samurai Shodown 64 Japanese dictionaries Final Fantasy X Prefectures of Japan
