how do i find someones phone number how do i find a phone number when i dont know the name of the person nor the postcode only part of the address i think there's an issue here with not knowing their name i don't think that directory enquiries any of them will give you the details if you do not know the name in case you are making a prank or nuisance call you may be able to find out the rest of their address though you could also try the electoral roll for that street it should be a matter of public record at your local council useful for when there is an election there used to be books called street directories years ago and they would give you the name of the person as well as the address unless it's a very recent move or a new build you could ask in your local library about street directories solicitors often have access to street directories as well you could bluff and say you are doing some research into the neighbourhood changes within a particular group of streets and ask if you can look at some street directories Telephone directory UK telephone numbering plan Postcode Liberal Democrats (UK) North American Numbering Plan Surveillance Emergency telephone number Toowoomba, Queensland Yellow Pages Solicitor Identity theft Five Dock, New South Wales Enhanced 911 Spring operating system Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Telephone number Plame affair Lawyer Directory assistance Library (computer science) Barrister Virgin Mobile FidoNet Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Summer Hill, New South Wales Municipality of Strathfield 9-1-1 Open access File system Legal research Open Directory Project Phreaking Mach kernel Telephone numbering plan Glasgow Virtual memory Vertical service code Files-11 Local government in the United Kingdom Database management system Sampling (statistics) Fathers' rights movement in the UK Password Newtown, New South Wales Tanzania Genealogy Democracy Sunspot Library United States House of Representatives University of Bristol Omagh RISC New Zealand Parliament Windows 2000 John Kerr United Kingdom corporation tax Directory service Mauritania Nuisance Library and information science Darlinghurst, New South Wales Computer Traditionalist Catholic Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Slovenia Suburbs of Johannesburg Government of France Roman Catholic Church French Directory Wi-Fi Telephone tapping Waramanga, Australian Capital Territory E.164 Payphone Perl Address (geography) Public key infrastructure Linked list Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Single Transferable Vote Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Cleveland, Ohio Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory British national identity card 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Ward (politics) AmigaOS Scots law Spam (electronic) AppleTalk Commune in France Postal code Revision control Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005 Address Book (software) Education Political campaign European Union U.S. presidential election, 2004
