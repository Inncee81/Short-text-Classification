is there a purpose for private calling just wondering people do not like to give out there phone number sometimes because people break the etiquette of caller id just because i called you with my number unblocked doesn't give you the right to write my number down and call me if i did not give you my number or tell you that you can take my number from the caller id i hate when people just assume it is ok for them to get my number from the caller id and call me back especially when i call a customers contact number to get access to there home or apartment and they are not home instead of calling the office they will call my cell phone back that they got the number from caller id and try to reschedule with me directly things dont work like that if people followed some etiquette and used discretion in taking peoples phone numbers from cid with out the persons permission then perhaps private calling would not be needed but until people learn some common decency then many people will continue to block there number whenever possible its like if i dont tell you my address but i tell you that i am going home and you follow me so you can find out where i live North American Numbering Plan Telephone tapping Telephone numbering plan Caller ID Call for help UK telephone numbering plan GSM services Emergency telephone number Cellular network Private branch exchange FidoNet Mach kernel Vertical service code Glossary of partner dance terms Telephone exchange Automatic number identification Surveillance 9-1-1 Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Telephone number Enhanced 911 Customs and etiquette of Japan Voice over IP Call centre Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Payphone Telephone booth Integrated Services Digital Network Sauna 555 telephone number Toll-free telephone number X.25 Telephone call Phone sex Pointer Identity theft Phone fraud Privacy Rush Limbaugh Linked list Ocean's Twelve Spring operating system Ethics Social rule Skype Friends United Airlines Flight 93 Speech recognition Code division multiple access CPU cache The Big Sleep Sin City Database management system Hiking The Inside Contredanse The Jim Rome Show Unconditional Love Data retention Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomic Kitten Extreme Programming Computer Caller (dance) Taxicab Telephone switchboard Funeral British national identity card 24 (television) C syntax Prank call Area code 905 Mail Japanese mobile phone culture Nordic Mobile Telephone Car Talk Mojave people Disability etiquette Whois Apollo Guidance Computer Survivor (novel) Matt Hardy Poker jargon Bluetooth Coding theory Wi-Fi Coast to Coast AM Betting (poker) Japanese titles IP Multimedia Subsystem AT&T Mobile phone spam Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Etiquette PDP-8 Direct marketing Human sexual behavior
