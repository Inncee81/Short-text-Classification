how to join two phone calls how do you join two separate phone calls that have already started i was talking to a friend of mine when another good friend beeped in is there any way i can connect the two i want to be able to talk to both at the same time any help if you are subscribed to your telco's call waiting conferencing service and your phone can support it then for sure you can join the second caller into the conversation firstly dig out the service manual for your phone to see if it supports phone conferencing if you don't have one check the phone itself there may be a button labeled 'conference' or 'call waiting' somewhere near the touchpad you may also have to dig around the program menu for your phone if it's digital to see if you can find a menu that indicates that the phone supports call waiting conferencing if you're phone can't support conference calls then there's no point subscribing to your telco's service for this until you get a replacement phone otherwise you may call your telco and ask them what they charge for the service my best guess would be about and this may include other feature such as call id cid and voice mail GSM services Telephone Vertical service code Integrated Services Digital Network Telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Private branch exchange UK telephone numbering plan Telephone exchange Gmail Virgin Mobile Bluetooth IP Multimedia Subsystem MSN Messenger Network Switching Subsystem Telephone number Telephone company Telephone call BlackBerry Danger Hiptop Taxicab Phreaking Mac OS X v10.4 Windows Mobile Teletext Telephone booth Global System for Mobile Communications Skype IPod 9-1-1 Broadband Internet access Short message service Instant messaging Podcasting Asynchronous Transfer Mode Digital Subscriber Line Internet Conference call Verizon Wireless Public Switched Telephone Network Embedded system Xbox 360 Mobile phone Toll-free telephone number Computer-supported collaboration US West (phone company) Collaborative software Push to talk Modem Object Desktop Enterprise content management Comparison of instant messengers ITunes Nintendo DS Telephone switchboard Internet service provider Musical Instrument Digital Interface FidoNet Mad Money Asterisk PBX Nordic Mobile Telephone Social rule Call centre Payphone Pocket PC Web conferencing Frame relay X Window System Domain Name System SaskTel VeriSign Digital camera Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Emacs Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PlayStation Portable E-mail spam Windows 2000 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act GPRS Core Network Emergency telephone number AT&T Enhanced 911 Common Unix Printing System Touchpad Mach kernel 555 telephone number Truck ISDN User Part I-mode Ron and Fez Oscilloscope Retronym Xbox Religious Society of Friends
