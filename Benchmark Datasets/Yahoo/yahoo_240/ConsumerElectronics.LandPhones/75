is it possible to hack into a multi line phone system to make a call look like it was tranferred internally a coworker of mine keeps getting harassed at work by an ex boyfriend at first he kept sending her e mails but she was able to block them so now he constantly calls her at work weird thing is when he calls he's somehow blocking his number on the caller id so that it says the call is being transfered from an inside line when he's actually calling from a line in a different state and no one in the office is transferring the call to her we do not have numbers to call our extensions directly the caller has to dial a main line and type in the extension but when you do this it doesn't normally show up as a transfered call it shows the number that is calling is he hacking into our phone system or something and how can we stop it or block his number when he's making it come from an internal line it is possible that he is going into someone's voicemail to leave a message and then backing out and going to her extension on some phone systems if you do this it will show as an internal transfer instead of calling straight in depending on how much of an issue this is and what kind of a relationship you have with your company you can contact the vendor that supports your phone system and speak with them about a solution there are a lot of different phone systems out there and they all have different programming and features i don't know what kind of system you have so i would contact the vendor that currently supports it any decent system will have the ability to block voicemail to extension transfers it is also possible that he is simply blocking his caller id which anyone can do and the phone system doesn't know how to interpret that signal it is then going to some kind of a default that may appear as an internal transfer your phone vendor can also block calls that are coming from people that are blocking their caller id i would also recommend that your co worker speak with someone in your hr department since this is company time and company property that he is dealing with they may want to take certain actions to stop him from a legal standpoint UK telephone numbering plan Telephone numbering plan Caller ID GSM services Telephone number Vertical service code Private branch exchange FidoNet Skype Mach kernel Telephone exchange Cellular network North American Numbering Plan Toll-free telephone number Modem Call for help Phreaking Gmail Emergency telephone number Voice over IP Glossary of partner dance terms Telephone tapping Spam (electronic) AmigaOS Pretty Good Privacy Universal Serial Bus C plus plus 9-1-1 Domain Name System Dual-tone multi-frequency United Airlines Flight 93 Speech recognition X Window System Automatic number identification Phone fraud Hacker Musical Instrument Digital Interface Virgin Mobile E-mail spam Telephone booth Presence information Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Blue box Enhanced 911 XML CPU cache IP Multimedia Subsystem Phone sex Computer virus C programming language Bluetooth Netfilter/iptables Internet fraud GunZ The Duel Verizon Wireless ITunes Pointer Mad Money Stopping e-mail abuse Telephone Session Initiation Protocol Public domain Customer relationship management Apple Open Collaboration Environment Surveillance OpenDocument Hard disk International Phonetic Alphabet Predictive dialer Beltway sniper attacks Virtual memory Enterprise content management Taxicab Opera (web browser) Ethernet Computer Common Unix Printing System Pocket PC Emacs Scrubs (TV show) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus BlackBerry Objective-C Morse Code Social rule Caller (dance) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Rent (musical) ITU-T Pirate decryption PostgreSQL Object-oriented programming Global System for Mobile Communications
