difference between professional 'tube' acrylic paint and cheaper 'bottle' acrylics paints apple barrel i see small tubes of 'professional' acrylic paint at michaels for to and then i see the same color in a bottle labled 'craft smart' or 'apple barrel' for around cents i am a beginning acrylic painter using pretreated stretched canvas what is the reason these paints are so expensive the colors seem identical held side by side to my eye is it more satisfying or perhaps more convenient is it worth purchasing if i am not painting as a means of income but instead as a means of expression i e does expensive paints just mean a higher price tag for completed painting thank you for any insight you may provide when you're learning to paint the smart thing is to use the cheaper paints you can buy why waste high quality paint on what will probably not be a masterpiece as to going to michael s my question is why try visiting a local real art supply store not only will they have a much better selection on artists' materials they will also sell liquitex basics basics is a cheaper brand of fairly good quality acrylic paint that comes in oz jars here's the thing about acrylic paints in tubes vs jars what if you squeeze out too much paint from a tube more than you can or will use at the time you can't exactly put it back in the tube can you so basically whatever you don't use instantly will be wasted because acrylics dry so quickly i haven't used tubes of paint for years simply for this reason also as you become a little more involved with painting you will probably want to start mixing and making your own colors after you blend the exact color you want you will learn to store it in an air tight jar these jars you can buy at most art supply stores and they are cheep they come in or oz sizes about the quality of paints cheaper paints will fade over time tend to be streakish and runny because they are not as full bodied as better quality paints you usually have to go over the same area more than once better quality paints will have a 'lightfastness' rating on the jar or tube that lets you know that they will endure a lifetime the best full bodied acrylic polymer paints on the market when you've reached the point where you think you want your art to last a lifetime are golden and m graham liquitex would be my third choice Plastic Bong Paint Digital photography Gross domestic product Mattress Solar cell Laserdisc Art CPU design Inflation Economics Carburetor Solar power Hamster Binoculars Circuit design Strap-on dildo Alcoholic beverage Painting Acrylic paint CPU cache Epoxy Floppy disk Airsoft M16 (rifle) Cider Mutual fund Internal ballistics Atari ST Wine Brewery Publicly funded medicine Gramophone record Bicycle lighting Computer RuneScape economy Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Wassily Kandinsky Slide rule Bulk vending Incandescent light bulb Illegal drug trade Mac OS X ITunes Impressionism Georges-Pierre Seurat Apple Computer Supply and demand Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Modem Casting Cable television Eyepiece Central processing unit Drawing Strategic management RISC ITunes Music Store Tax Commodore 64 Photography Polymethyl methacrylate Gasoline Rum Light-emitting diode Inkjet printer Lionel Corporation Gas metal arc welding Audiophile Bicycle frame Hydrogen economy Pastel United States dollar Money Scuba set Fluorescent lamp Tea Milk Tesco Dairy Filling station Tire Cannabis cultivation Single malt Scotch Cigar Transformer Commodity Oscilloscope Biodiesel Tag
