new to oil painting help i am new to oil painting and i am starting with m graham walnut oil paints i have never painted with oil before so not only am i new to all this but it seems to be a little hard to find anything online that can tell me how to use this brand of paint i am overwhelmed with all there is to know about oil painting so it has been a lot to take in and i am really nervous because i spent a ton of money on all my supplies so i dont want to screw this up in any way i am going to be taking classes but i know that the instructor will be busy helping other people out as well so i wanted to know a little bit about how to use the paint so that i dont go in there completely blind to all this i have painted with watercolour most of my life so i am not new to painting just oil i also wanted to know what you would recommend i paint for my first time i paint and draw figures but i think that may be too complicated for my first time what do any of you recommend i make my living selling my oil paintings and have used m graham walnut oil paints for over years they differ from other brands in that they are creamier than most not needing a thinning medium but very dense in color so the colors are bright and will not dull easily when white is added cheaper student paints have less actual color and more fillers use these paints as you would any other oil paint they mix with other brands if you find a color you want to try by another manufacturer the major difference between oils and watercolors is that you can correct or change oils over and over by just rubbing the wet paint off or painting over the dry paint and you have more control and rely less on those painterly accidents that give watercolor it's characteristic charm and frustrations to someone like me taking classes is an good idea just make sure you want to learn to paint the way the teacher paints because that is all he she will be able to teach i found the most valuable information in the videos by artist teacher helen van wyke i own many but they are rentable at www art video com and often played on public television stations start with the videos on the palette colors cast shadows and brush strokes shaping with paint helen teaches the basics with humor painting right in front of you so you can see how the paint and brushes behave once you know the basics you can paint anything painting an apple is like painting a person's head and vice versa so just begin with the subject you are most comfortable with or enjoy when in doubt remember there really are no mistakes in art look at monet's waterlily paintings sometimes the waterlilies are green sometimes purple sometimes red and all beautiful good luck i am sure you will have alot of fun exploring this medium Watercolor painting Paint Drawing Impressionism Color Wassily Kandinsky Japanese tea ceremony Color theory Georgia O'Keeffe Academic art Francis Bacon (painter) Atari 8-bit family Knife Pastel Carl Barks Traditional animation Photography Aesthetic Realism Tempera Typewriter Casting Brush Plastic El Lissitzky Mnemonic Pierre-Auguste Renoir Martial art Jan van Goyen Violin Dog training Microeconomics Frans Hals Fountain pen Drill bit Floppy disk Vincent van Gogh Leather United States dollar Painting Light-emitting diode Graduate school My Little Pony Wood carving Great Teacher Onizuka Hangul A Course In Miracles IPod Color Graphics Adapter Cascading Style Sheets Gamut Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Timpani Gross domestic product Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Avenue Q Peruvian cuisine Tag Education in the People's Republic of China Bob and George Jacques Maroger Color blindness Microsoft Paint M.C.
