how much should i charge for face painting i am doing face painting at a community event around how much should i charge i will do simple cheek art and full faces thanks the questions you have to ask are 'how long will it take to do a cheek and how long for a face ' now say you'd like to make dollars an hour for sitting around with the kids and give yourself minutes for each cheek painting and for the face sound about right that would make it for a cheek and for a face and that sounds pretty resonable for me as a customer however you know your audience so to speak and maybe they're the kind of people that are willing to pay or dollars for a cheek and for the face or even more consider the minimum wage in the area also so you are getting a price that's fair to you if it's for income for charity work lower prices always seem better because you'll get more customers in the long run Minimum wage Progressive tax Wal-Mart Tax Microeconomics Hyperinflation Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Supply and demand United Kingdom corporation tax Beard Welfare trap Labor-power Arbitrage The Price Is Right Price discrimination $ale of the Century Performance poetry The Apprentice 2 Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Taxation in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Economic inequality FairTax Education in the United States Health insurance Monopsony Inflation Enron Corporation Insurance Jeopardy!
