asthma medince someone told me that advair diskus can could cause heart problems that it can could cause someones heart to stop is that true why or why not why would she say such a thing that isn't true the person told me it made her have heart problems but if that was true i wouldn't think that the fda would approve of the drug doctors wouldn't prescribe it i'm so worried about taking it now i'm going to see if my psycharist will help me take it tonight just in case i have a serious side effect of the medince just in case i have a allergic reaction to the medince since my whole family doesn't take things seriously should i have my psycharist help me take it tonight why or why not why does she think advair diskus caused her heart problems advair can cause heart problems but i think there has to already be heart disease present first advair is serevent and flovent serevent is a beta selective bronchodilator it acts on a specific site in the lungs that causes the airways to open that same site causes your heart rate and strength of the heart beat to increase if someone is taking a drug in the class of beta blockers the serevent might cause the heart to race out of control potentially resulting in death unless you have a pre existing heart condition that is currently being treated with a beta blocker medication then i wouldn't worry about it beta blockers are only used with patient who have heart disease the issue of balancing the benefits with the potential side effects is something your doctor has to assess before prescribing you any medication your doctor must have known that your heart was in decent shape and that you were not on any beta blockers when he she prescribed advair using advair while also taking beta blockers could be done under a doctor's supervision and direction if the benefits of advair outweigh the risk of decreasing the effect of beta blockers then advair could be prescribed the fda approves drugs only after they have been studied extensively advair has been around for about fifteen years in that time if something horrible was happening to people using it that should be known by now i think that advair is generally safe in patients who are not contraindicated for it if you need the assistance of a medical professional to direct you on how to properly take your medication please do so advair is an incredibly powerful tool in the war against lung disease a psychiatrist is probably not the person to educate you on the use of an inhaled medication but if that works for you go for it your gp or pulmonologist would be more knowledgeable in the functioning and administration of advair Beta blocker Medicine Cancer Psoriasis Amiodarone Anxiety Myocardial infarction Aortic dissection Prostate cancer Lung cancer Bipolar disorder Migraine Folic acid Pharmaceutical company Antiretroviral drug Stroke Antiarrhythmic agent Adverse effect (medicine) Growth hormone treatment Psychiatry Pneumonia Insulin Food and Drug Administration Antidepressant Radiation therapy Traumatic brain injury COX-2 inhibitor Mesothelioma Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Parkinson's disease Allergy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes simplex virus Alzheimer's disease Medical cannabis Sildenafil Psychopharmacology Paroxetine Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Rofecoxib Emphysema Urinary incontinence Duesberg hypothesis Drowning Stomach cancer Addiction Hypertension Diabetes mellitus Schizophrenia Long QT syndrome Haloperidol Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lamotrigine Childbirth Gastroesophageal reflux disease Paracetamol Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Clinical depression Maprotiline First aid Controlled Substances Act Chronic fatigue syndrome Atrial fibrillation Omega-3 fatty acid Clomipramine Multiple sclerosis Psychosis Obesity Physical therapy Methamphetamine Shock Case-control Cystic fibrosis Traditional Chinese medicine Ethics Tuberculosis Atherosclerosis Aspartame Diazepam Neurofeedback Nurse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Epilepsy Medical prescription
