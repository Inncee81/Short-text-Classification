cystic fibrosis and lupus my boyfriend has cf and his last dr visit they tested him for lupus one of his test came back and its not looking too great we're waiting for the other one my question is with his cf how much more of a toll would lupus have on him i want to talk to him but he's a bit shooken up and trying to figure out how to tell his dad im just trying to stay strong for him and let him lean on me so anyone that can help me i appreciate it so much thanks i have cystic fibrosis but am not very familiar with lupus so my comments are based on some quick internet research since lupus is an auto immune disease and your boyfriend already has cf his body is going to attack areas of his body that are healthy in addition to those that may already be damaged or compromised by the cf one of the side effects is inflammation which could impact his pft results and breathing capabilities i wasn't able to find information on how severe the inflamation can be so i can't comment on how much impact it could potentially have and some of that would depend how much his lungs are damaged by the cf i'm sure the docs are probably on top of it but i did see that there is a type of lupus called systemic lupus erythematosus sle it's caused by hypersensitivity to a medication and causes the body to make antibodies that attack the body's own healthy cells medications commonly known for this are chlorpromazine hydralazine isoniazid methyldopa penicillamine procainamide quinidine sulfasalazine symptoms of the sle usually occur after months of the medication usage i'm not specifically familiar with any of these drugs and don't remember being treated with any of them but that doesn't mean they aren't used for something associated with cf best thing to do would be to talk further with the doctors get more tests including a second opinion from someone that specializes in lupus treatment and review your boyfriends medication history both current and past since he's probably known for years that he has cf likely since early childhood he's used to the idea of one disease and what it entails however when we're thrown a new and serious illness it tends to hit us just like it would a 'healthy' person when i found out i am diabetic a result of the cf i cried all the way home from the doctors office and was more worried about the diabetes than the cf he'll get used to it but may need some time and will need your support as far as telling his dad it may be better to wait until you have the confirmed results of the tests if he and his dad are close then it may be better to just flat tell him and get it over with since his dad may very well notice that something is bothering him above all try to keep a good sense of humor about the situation find something about it to laugh at it will help a lot i'm sure you have plenty of cf jokes so find ways to add jokes or humor into the lupus aspect contact a lupus support group and see how those individuals deal with it what impact it has to their lives etc sorry i can't give you specific information best wishes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Prostate cancer Allergy Medicine Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Asthma Cancer Psoriasis Rheumatoid arthritis Tuberculosis Immune system Autoimmune diseases Cirrhosis Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis HIV test Folic acid Stroke Cytomegalovirus Psychosis Ulcerative colitis Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Fibromyalgia Urinary incontinence Organ transplant Malaria AIDS Radiation therapy Hepatitis Social rule Insulin Immunosuppressive drug Immunology Apoptosis Duesberg hypothesis AIDS reappraisal Propranolol Fecal incontinence Atherosclerosis Chemotherapy Homeopathy Diarrhea Common cold Traumatic brain injury Crohn's disease Theory of conduct Chlorpromazine Tocopherol Decompression sickness Herpes simplex virus Pharmaceutical company Myocardial infarction Nutrition Arthritis Group A streptococcal infection Alzheimer's disease Amiodarone Mesothelioma Cholera Legionellosis Acne Addiction Bipolar disorder Sickle-cell disease Rabies Antiviral drug Anxiety Leukemia Alcoholism Schizophrenia Terri Schiavo Clinical depression Equine conformation Diffuse parenchymal lung disease Inclusion body myositis Cephalic disorder Genetic disorder Antiphospholipid syndrome Hay fever Cardiovascular disease Aortic dissection Antibody Aphasia
