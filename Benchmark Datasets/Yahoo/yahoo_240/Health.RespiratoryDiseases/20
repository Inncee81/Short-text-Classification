wtf is wrong in my lungs okay background first a cold has been going around in my office and in my family it is a cough some crap in the lungs a fever for about day and then done in a week or sometimes june i got the cough july i got the fever but it never went away around july my lungs started to seem as though they were clearing out but then my sinuses got all crappy and i could no longer breathe through my nose and had to blow it about times an hour with the sinus issue my lungs got all full of crap again on august i went to see my doctor he initially diagnosed bacterial pneumonia but later the x rays were negative for pneumonia he also put me on days of levaquin which is one of the hardest hitting antibiotics on the market i have been taking the levaquin for days i only have days left and there has been no improvement whatsoever none i see him again friday but i am getting paranoid sounds like a pretty good viral infection sometimes pneumonia can be present but may not appear on the x ray especially if your body was fighting it but was then overwhelmed again i would suggest consulting a pulmonologist most insurances allow specialist consults without references these days Pneumonia Common cold Group A streptococcal infection Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Lung cancer Asthma Streptococcus pneumoniae Chlamydophila pneumoniae Aspergillosis Infectious mononucleosis Influenza Legionellosis Lung Meningitis Urinary incontinence Tuberculosis AIDS Bacterial pneumonia Ebola Viral pneumonia Cystic fibrosis Poliomyelitis Psittacosis Bacteria Pulmonology Atrial septal defect Upper respiratory tract infection Spanish flu Nasal congestion Pertussis Prostate cancer Bronchiolitis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Jala neti Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia Drowning Rocky Mountain spotted fever Stomach cancer Babe Ruth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Virus Cancer 2001 anthrax attacks Medicine Craps Cytomegalovirus Sickle-cell disease Multidrug resistance Penicillin HIV test Tobacco smoking Avian influenza Diving Antibiotic Lyme disease Hypertension Hay fever Respiratory system Toilet humour Conjunctivitis Bubonic plague Biological warfare Clarithromycin Bacterial meningitis Anthrax Bioterrorism Ciprofloxacin Guinea pig Gonorrhoea Cellulitis Otitis media Lupus erythematosus Smallpox Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Cephalexin Swimming Coeliac disease Reflexology Herpes simplex virus Pneumothorax Antiretroviral drug Syphilis Measles Chlorpromazine Multiple sclerosis Lassa fever Dialysis Mesothelioma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Endocarditis Blastomycosis Pleural effusion Marathon (sport) First aid Asplenia H5N1
