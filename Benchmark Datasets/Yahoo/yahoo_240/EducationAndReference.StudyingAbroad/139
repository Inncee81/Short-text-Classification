how do you study i really want to study but im never able to study because of of my lazyness i need help majorly lol i want to go to uni no the reason is not just because your lazy there is a reason behind it and i had this challenge to in the past what changed for me to read many books and even write my own and have my own businesses can i be honest with you mate you see we all do things or don't do things because of a reason many don't understand the first which i will come upto is when i was having a challenge i began to sit down and think and realised i didn't know my real reason why i didn't know what i wanted out of life and couldn't see the future really of what i wanted imagine mate if you don't have a target then you might as well keep firing to find you've hit everything else but not what you wanted or nothing at all so the first thing i did is i took a step back and not to criticise myself but to reflect and write down exactly why i am studying where do i want to be in a couple of years and broke these down to how i am going to do it now i just didn't do that straight away i wanted too but something was holding me back and everytime i didn't do what i should be doing i kept getting into a mess work piles up and i am panicking and i knew deep inside the result would be crap so i wanted to find out why am i like this until you know about you how you tick you won't move on so i did just that and man i found out why i didn't do what i did and why everyone else was doing the same you see when you and i do something or not then this becomes a habit everytime you don't do what you do it becomes a stronger habit until it becomes part of you when that happens you are in trouble if that habit doesn't do anything positive imagine a glass of milk now imagine each time you don't study that habit is a like a drop of blue ink dropped into the milk each time you don't study another drop of blue ink hits that milk until so many actions make that glass of milk go dark blue now you got a major problem and if it isn't sorted out this habit of not studying not reading or not doing the other things too that will help you in life will because part of you the only way is to dilute it so imagine you start sitting down and before tomorrow comes you get a piece of paper and write down what you need to do for example maths assignment four pages to do english essay pages science pages and so forth and at the end of each task you put a box now you know what to do tomorrow you have to make a decision that no tv no music no mates nothing should get in the away you don't move also from task two if task one is not done your task one must be the most important if there are three most important task then break them down to a a etc look i have learnt the hard way and i know now why people mess up because i have been there and i meet so many people who mess their life up or they are so busy but i find they have not achieved jack nothing just looked very busy when you do what you need to do and plan a day or even like me a week ahead then you're going to be ahead of everyone of the population don't plan they don't also dilute all that black ink the negative habits by positive thoughts and saying to themselves i am in control i am not anything else and nor my whims i can do this you know when i planned my business turnover trippled in four months and its growing even more and faster all because i am doing what others don't do you can do it mate i know it be a little struggle because you will need to pushing against habits you have had for sometime and also your thoughts but your future is important your success may inspire someone your finances will help your family or neighbourhood oneday you can go on holiday and see the world oneday you can make a difference to your life and others too but most of all you do it for you so ask yourself what am i doing it for whenever you do anything ask yourself will this get me to where i really want to go and make me what i want to be always ask this question and deep inside you will know the answer the thing is i haven't really shared anything that you don't know you know all i have said and know it well there is a saying you cannot teach a person something he does not already know you can only bring what he does know to his awareness the best book for you and if you read this and apply then you won't have any problems or challenges you have now is a book by brain tracy called eat the frog i'll leave you a link read more books to develop yourself and leadership it will make you stand out of the crowd study and also maybe you can help others too who having same challenges but what you are facing has a name it is called procrastination good luck apply what i mentioned and see what happens and read that book you'd be amazed what happens next you can do it Georgetown University Johns Hopkins University Tuition Washington, D.C.
