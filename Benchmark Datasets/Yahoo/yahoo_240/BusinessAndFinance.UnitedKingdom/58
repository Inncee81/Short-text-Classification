i've been made redundant and i might be pregnant would this change my package am i entitled to more i'm due to leave the firm th august and have agreed a package i've been at the firm for just under years does the company have any duty to pay me anything if i'm pregnant and still employed by them any help or direction towards helpful websites hugely appreciated thanks its very unlikely that you would be able to i am assuming that you are in the uk it would be a completely different situation if you had informed them you were pregnant then were selected for redundancy but as you are saying you might be pregnant thats obviously not the case at the moment if you are pregnant the only thing that your company must do before you leave is to give you any time off for antenatal appointments do a risk assessment i am assuming that you are concerned about working for a new company then taking maternity leave in order to receive the statutory maternity pay from a company you will need to have worked for them continuously for weeks by the th week before you are due to give birth if you haven't been at the company long enough to receive maternity pay from them you are still able to claim maternity allowance which you do through the jobcentre this is based on your tax ni contributions for the months i think before you begin your claim so given that you worked for your current company for just under years you should qualify i can't think of any specific websites you could look at right now aside from maybe acas your best idea would be to search something like pregnancy redundancy on google see what comes up Pregnancy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Abortion United Kingdom corporation tax Abortion debate Copyright Roe v.
