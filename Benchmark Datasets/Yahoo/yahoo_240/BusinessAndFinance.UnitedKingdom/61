has anyone been asked to pay back tax credits they were'nt paid i my partner were hounded since for by ir they said they overpaid me by this much for the year in nov i finally looked at all my bank statements payslips that i luckily kept but had to search up the loft for them i found they were wrong so i photocopied everything i sent them letters faxes phone calls etc months later after alot of pestering i told them to take me to court that i would win because i had the evidence to prove them wrong they gave me a special direct number to ring and eventually they admitted on the phone that there are two systems i think a payment log and another one actual payments i think anyhow they admitted that it was put in the log in error and they can't change it because the system isnt designed to change after the year has gone or something they said not to worry they know now they gave me for costs for the distress and worry cheek now im told i owe for other years over i dont trust im so tired of it all thats ok they wanted me to pay back ten grands worth of payments that i was entitled to lol let just do the same again ring them and explain the issue you had last time and suggest they've done it again i wouldnt let it go most of the time they try it on and rely on the fact people dont keep payslips etc i know your tired of it but do you really want them to win Schabir Shaik Trial Bond James Hanratty Plame affair Surveillance The Contender (television series) Taxation in the United States Shaggy dog story Appeal Article One of the United States Constitution Social Security (United States) Rick Santorum SCO-Linux controversies 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Estoppel United Kingdom corporation tax The Inside Tom DeLay Annuity Knots Landing Sin City Ben Johnson (athlete) Password National Kidney Foundation Singapore Wheel of Fortune Timeline of the Enron scandal Octopus card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Student loan One Piece minor characters 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Internet fraud Warren Buffett FairTax Insurance Ocean's Twelve Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act National Insurance George Galloway London Congestion Charge Telephone numbering plan Newcastle United F.C.
