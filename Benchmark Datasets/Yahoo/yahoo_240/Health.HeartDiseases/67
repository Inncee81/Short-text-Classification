heart question when i stand up sometimes or move suddleny my heart beat will slow down and feel like it has a slow pounding pace but then go back to normal in like or seconds is this a normal thing to happen i have had an ekg done and it was normal but when it happenes i get freaked out and i feel like it is not going to go back to normal but it always does thanks for your help well i piad more attention and what it does is speeds up when i get up then it slows way down real quick that's when i feel the slow pounding beat then goes to normal pace would this considered normal no it's not normal and you should seek further advice from your doctor the correct auto response to sudden action standing up running shock stress etc is for the pulse rate to speed up quickly to increase cardiac output the flight or fight syndrome your brain's failure to react in this way could lead to fainting or temporary feelings of weakness due to the loss of mean arterial pressure reducing flow of blood to the brain the 'slow pounding pace' you describe is predictable because the brain increases the amount of blood ejected from the heart at each stroke and this increases the pressure felt as a pounding or strong pulse to compensate for the failure of the pulse rate to rise properly i can suggest a source to read this up if you wish it's not necessarily serious but for instance it would debar you from passing a medical physical such as for obtaining a pilot's licence or some other occupations the important thing is to find out the cause and extent of the situation and to monitor whether it's improving or deteriorating or is in fact just temporary best wishes i hope it's helped re' your added details yes that's much more like an absolutely normal response you have nothing to worry about from all you've written good luck Myocardial infarction Hypertension Cardiac arrhythmia Stroke Traumatic brain injury Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drowning Aortic valve stenosis Hypoglycemia Cardiac stress test Action potential Heart rate Aortic insufficiency Aortic dissection Atrial septal defect Autism Atrial fibrillation Shock First aid Angina Mitral regurgitation Ventricular fibrillation Jet engine Apoplexy Urinary incontinence Cardiac output Chronic fatigue syndrome Atheroma Heart Prostate cancer Unemployment Multiple sclerosis Artificial pacemaker Aphasia Inflation Turner syndrome Diabetes mellitus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Explosive material Circulatory system Obstetrics Insulin Stopping power Cardiac arrest Chlorpromazine Equine conformation Physical examination Pulse Combine (Half-Life 2) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Coronary heart disease Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Hypothermia Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Asthma Psoriasis Tobacco smoking Cardiac cycle Free trade Cardiovascular disease Electrocardiogram Carbon dioxide Tachycardia Epilepsy Magnetic resonance imaging Stomach cancer Pneumonia Ozone depletion Coma Intracranial pressure Weight training Decompression sickness Out-of-body experience Economy of Russia Propranolol Panic attack Second language acquisition Time dilation Artery Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Speed of light A Course In Miracles Triage Alcoholism Growth hormone treatment Hypnosis Dieting Internal ballistics Sea level rise Cancer
