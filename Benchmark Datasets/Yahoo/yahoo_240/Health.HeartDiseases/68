can i be a police officer if i have wpw i just found out that i have wpw wolf parkinson's white i have heard that people who have that are not permitted to play high school or professional sports which doesn't bother me because i was planning on playing pro football but i also heard that you can't join the army with it and that kind of upset me because i almost wanted to does that mean i can't join the police force either aaron unfortunately i can't speak to what the police department's policy is on wolff parkinson white wpw but i can give you a bit of insight into the military's policy and what cardiologists generally recommend in terms of competitive sports the important thing is to know that all wpw is not the same the term wpw is generally used in reference to a condition in which there are accessory pathways in the heart allowing for ventricular preexcitation so what the heck does that mean the heart is normally made up of two upper chambers the atria and two lower chambers the ventricles that are electrically separated by a single gateway the av node normally an electrical signal starts from the sa node your inborn pacemaker at the top of the heart causing the top chambers to contract the electrical signal gets to the av node where it pauses for about of a second before continuing on causing the bottom chambers to contract the accessory pathway that is characteristic of wpw is an extra muscle bundle that connects the top and bottom chambers this gives the electrical signal an alternate route to the bottom chambers because the muscle bundle does not create a normal pause the way the av node does this can sometimes be seen on an ekg as premature activation of the bottom chambers the presence of the accessory pathway can yield two main problems the first is that it can be a set up for a short circuit wherein the electrical signal goes from the top chambers through the av node down to the bottom chambers backwards up through the accessory pathway and through the av node again over and over again when this happens the person with wpw feels their heart suddenly take off at a rate of bpm or more this is uncomfortable of course but usually not life threatening the reason we are concerned about wpw in athletes and in military pilots is that the av node being that is a sort of gatekeeper only allows so many impulses to get down to the bottom chambers per minute the accessory pathway has no such properties if a person with wpw develops a rhythm called atrial fibrillation in which the top chambers start beating at a rate of bpm or more the accessory pathway can allow the bottom chambers to be barraged by electrical impulses leading to a fatal rhythm called ventricular fibrillation that causes sudden death that is the main issue the good news is that wpw is a condition that is potentially curable so you have an extra connection we now have ways of getting rid of that abnormal connection with a non surgical procedure this is called radiofrequency rf ablation and in experienced hands has a success rate well over if a person has the previously mentioned signs of premature excitation of the bottom chambers on ekg but has never had an episode of an abnormal rhythm like i described above the risk of sudden death is actually very low usually these people are allowed to participate fully in sports but competitive athletes such as professionals or olympic athletes are often taken for further testing before being cleared any athlete who has had a history of an abnormal fast heartbeat must get further testing before they are allowed to compete the air force will not take anyone with the above described ekg abnormalities unless further evaluation shows no history of abnormal heart rhythms further testing means a catheter based procedure in which we look to see how well the accessory pathway can conduct an electrical signal the better a conductor it is the higher the risk to the patient if there is a history of abnormal heart rhythms or the accessory pathway appears to be a very good conductor we can use catheters to perform rf ablation and eliminate the accessory pathway once this is done the person with wpw is generally allowed to participate fully in competitive sports and can join the military a few months after successful ablation i strongly urge you to talk to your doctor and ask for referral to a cardiologist trained in electrophysiology if you have not already seen one they can tell you whether you would be allowed to join the military or the police force and whether you should have further testing and or radiofrequency ablation whew that's a lot of information i hope you find it helpful Cardiac stress test Antiarrhythmic agent Tachycardia Traumatic brain injury Mitral regurgitation
