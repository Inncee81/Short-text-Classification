about coronary artery abnormality happens to adults with tof lately i accepted my cardiologist's suggestion to have a cath test it was simply a test at first while the procedure going doctors came over and told me that i might have to get angioplasity the result is unknown but one of my coronary arteries is almost invissible i often feel pain in my chest is it dangerous unfortunately my problem with coronary artery is also congenital which is invissible rather than blockage according to my cardiologist said there is only one coronary artery working don't know where is the other one it is difficult to answer your question without more information tetralogy of fallot was once a condition in which patients were rarely expected to reach adulthood now with the advances that have been made in the field of congenital heart disease individuals with tetralogy of fallot are living long enough to develop common adult problems including coronary artery disease just because someone has tof does not mean that they can't acquire coronary disease during their adult life i have had a couple of adult tof patients who have undergone coronary stenting for significant coronary disease blockages in your coronary artery could certainly result in chest pain but all chest pain is not necessarily due to coronary disease it is up to your cardiologist to determine whether the blockages they see are significant enough to warrant angioplasty also without knowing what your doctors saw on your cath it is difficult to say whether your condition is serious or not one thing that i would strongly advise you of is to make sure that you are followed by a cardiologist who is well informed about the care of adults with congenital heart disease adults with repaired or unrepaired tof can have many issues that are not typical of the usual cardiac patient who has heart failure or coronary disease good luck to you hope that helps Coronary heart disease Aortic dissection Coronary catheterization Angioplasty Atherosclerosis Angina Turner syndrome Cardiac stress test Folic acid Cardiovascular disease Stroke Heart Hypoglycemia Tocopherol Medicine Ventricular fibrillation Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Intravascular ultrasound Tetralogy of Fallot Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cholesterol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Blood pressure Emergency department Diabetes mellitus Cardiac arrhythmia Chest pain Ischaemic heart disease Obstetrics Stem cell Mitral regurgitation Hypertension Coronary circulation Asthma Prostate cancer Computed tomography Physical examination Congenital disorder Growth hormone treatment Stomach cancer Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Kawasaki disease Lung cancer Aortic valve stenosis Cytomegalovirus Ren__ Favaloro Congenital heart defect Multiple sclerosis Acupuncture Atkins Nutritional Approach Cardiac arrest Cerebral palsy Sickle-cell disease Mesothelioma Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Acne Autism Cystic fibrosis History of intersex surgery Clomipramine Intersex surgery Cardiac surgery Breast Kidney Abortion debate Pulmonary hypertension Cancer Heart rate Philips Cardiothoracic surgery Acute respiratory distress syndrome Circulatory system Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prayer Hearing impairment Infantilism Addiction Adult attention-deficit disorder Propranolol Growth hormone deficiency Crohn's disease Anorexia nervosa Contract Diabetic neuropathy Syringomyelia X-ray
