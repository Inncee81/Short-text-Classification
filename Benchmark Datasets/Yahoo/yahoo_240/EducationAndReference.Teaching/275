how can i get students to am band practise on time students are consistently at least minutes late losing up to of our total rehearsal time i can't punish them directly because it's mostly the parents' fault and numerous requests and notices in the newsletter haven't worked i would like to find a special reward for those who are there on time so the kids will try to talk the parents into it any ideas it is probably the parent's fault that kids are late especially if it's a zero hour class and buses don't run i guess i would be tempted to lock the door and then maybe the kids will put pressure on their parents to get them there on time or you could make a phone call to the child's home at like am and say to the parent that you are calling because susie has been tardy times during the quarter a reward might be a pizza party for anyone with no more than one tardy in a quarter tardiness is chronic in my school and so they have hired a truant office now who will be visiting anyones house who is tardy more than three times in a quarter TARDIS Boom Town (Doctor Who) Malcolm in the Middle Rose (Doctor Who) The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Keeper of Traken The Visitation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Ashlee Simpson Show Colony in Space Appeal The Empty Child The Daleks' Master Plan Doctor Who (Enemy Within) About a Boy Aliens of London The Five Doctors Time and the Rani The Brady Bunch The Curse of Peladon School choice Pizza Telephone exchange Bristol Grammar School The Parting of the Ways The Curse of Fenric Bad Wolf Street-Legal Eighth Doctor Adventures The Caves of Androzani Dalek (Doctor Who episode) Columbine High School massacre The Unquiet Dead The Doctor Dances Education Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Resurrection of the Daleks Carl Jung Education in the United States Muslim ibn Aqeel Mach kernel Hikikomori Electronic Arts The Amazing Race Fox Kids Identical particles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Toilet humour Doctor Who Trapped in the Closet Marching band Cleveland Browns Chinglish The Inside Transactional analysis Divorce The Magic School Bus Teachers (film) Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Little Britain Second language acquisition Hartford, Connecticut Vengeance on Varos The Lovely Bones Domain Name System Ben Johnson (athlete) Saved by the Bell Secondary education in France Education in Taiwan WNNX (FM) Labor theory of value Brian Lenihan Blonde on Blonde Child sexuality School bus Boston Public Homeschooling Dilbert Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Boarding school The Shining (film) Athenian democracy Hamburger The Evil of the Daleks Dick Cavett The Family from One End Street Clock Mohamed Atta al-Sayed United Airlines Flight 93 Equine conformation United States Naval Academy No Child Left Behind Act The Apprentice 3 Codename: Kids Next Door United States House of Representatives Frontier in Space 100,000 BC
