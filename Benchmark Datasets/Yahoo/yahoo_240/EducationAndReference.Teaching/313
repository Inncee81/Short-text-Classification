do school teachers get a pay check in the summer even if they don't teach summer school is their pay split up over the course of the year or do they just get paid during the school year just curious no i don't plan on being a teacher i am settled in my career i am just curious and i don't like when people down teachers and their job it is a huge job and i commend all teachers for the great work they do with our kids no one has it quite right yet the answer is it depends on the district you teach in one district i only got paid during the my contract the salary was divided up over or pay checks not sure i could opt to have the credit union pull out of my pay check each month so that i would essentially have a pay check through the summer another district paid us with yearly checks i e divided over months but they gave us all the summer checks at one time june's july's and aug 's you could deposit it as one lump sum or twice monthly to keep your budget it check and no teacher should go broke if they don't get paid over the summer it's called a budget you save each month to see you through the summer and you shouldn't need a credit union to do it for you Graduate school Social Security (United States) No Child Left Behind Act Credit card Education in Romania Annuity Unemployment benefit Daylight saving time Education in the United States School choice Education in the People's Republic of China Teacher Boston Public Education in Germany Education in Japan Marshall Plan Retirement plan 2004 Democratic National Convention Personal finance Professor Cheque Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Political subdivisions of New York State History of the United States (1918-1945) National Kidney Foundation Singapore Economy of Russia Mutual fund Mensal__o scandal Money supply Student loan New Deal Teaching English as a Foreign Language Good Times Member of the European Parliament Shaggy dog story Karl Rove The Adventures of Pete & Pete U.S. public debt Certificate of deposit Portland, Oregon Social Security debate (United States) The O.C.
