lab ideas for science classes does anyone have any cool suggestions for labs for a th grade biology class or an oceanography class mostly th and th graders i am beginning my teaching career and i want something interesting to do with them but also to show them that i know what i'm talking about i'm so i think teaching year olds will be awkward at first thanks i'm a chemistry physics teacher but i know a couple of ideas for biology something really cool that i've seen done is you take a green laser i think red works but not as well and you use it to make a projection you take an eyedropper and fill it with pondwater then hook up the eyedropper so that it is hanging by a clamp then take a second clamp and clamp partially on the squeeze part so that a drop of water is hanging from the eyedropper but doesn't fall that last part is hard to read but use clamps and have an eyedropper with pond water with drop of water about to fall then hook up the laser so that it shines through the drop the drop will act as a lens and it will project the drop of water in the drop of water will be all kinds of bacteria and paramecium and you can see them swimming around in it i don't know how to make it into a lab but there is a lot of good science in it if you teach photosynthesis then there is a great reverse photosynthesis demonstration called demise of a gummy bear you take potassium chlorate kclo and put it in a test tube then you heat it with a bunsen burner until it looks like a liquid then you drop a gummy bear in and get far away the potassium chlorate produces a bunch of oxygen gas which reacts with the sugar in the gummy bear to make water and carbon dioxide the reverse of photosynthesis also since photosysnthesis requires light the reverse reaction will produce a lot of light kind of like a minifirework if you do that one be careful of the potassium chlorate you don't want to get it on your hands it's something that won't burn right away but will eat through your skin slowly labs i've done we did a chromatography lab with chromatography paper you can separate inks out of differnet colored markers you can also use it with spinach leaves to separate out the pigments very simple to do just use a quarter to smash some pigment from a spinach leaf onto the paper then hang the paper in a container with the solvent i don't remember but probably ethyl acetate acetone would work then it will separate out the different colors we also took spinach leaves and this wasn't easy but you can removed the skin from them a clear layer by tearing them when you tear you'll see a little bit if you rip it correctly then we put those under a microscope and surveyed how many stomates there were if i were teaching oceanography i would show them how to distill seawater and talk about how cost effective it is and how difficult it is on a large scale Explosive material Water (molecule) Chlorine Sulfuric acid Laser Glass Chromatography Titanium Potassium Paint Electrophysiology Oxygen Stoma Fire extinguisher Acetic acid Solvent Carnivorous plant Tofu Helium Ecology Brewery Hand grenade Methanol Water Carbon dioxide sink Hydrogen economy Hydrogen Sun Welding Petroleum Tattoo Water purification Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Mnemonic Fountain pen Pebble bed reactor Rocket fuel Sulfur Haloalkane Alcohol Planetary habitability Ester Mass spectrometry Eye Acetone Leaf Cell (biology) Biodiesel Solar power Algae Insulin Chlorophyll Rebreather Renewable energy Bacteria Coffee Diving suit Casting Sewage treatment Chemistry Agar plate Concentration Fire Iron John Dalton Silicon Alternative biochemistry Extraterrestrial life Diode Disinfection Aluminium Ocean thermal energy conversion Lighting Japanese tea ceremony Vacuum tube Soldering Copper extraction Sodium Aniline Illegal drug trade Fire fighting Spectroscopy Earth's atmosphere Essential oil Poison Smoke-screen Miller-Urey experiment Pigment Uranium Sugar beet
