what to learn high german or low german hi i am starting to learn this language so what to start high german or low german guide me are low and high german two different dialects or two different languages finally what to choose why high german is standard german i e the official language of germany the language that most german speakers are able to speak even if it's not their native dialect and the language that is used for almost all german literature and media low german is a local dialect spoken by some people in the north of germany and it's unlikely that you would ever have to use it unless you have a special interest in traditions of northern germany my mother was raised in northern germany and is a native low german speaker but has not used it for decades as she has nobody to speak it with i also spent a part of my childhood in north germany and heard only old people speaking it and even that rarely i can understand it but not speak it my mother has almost never talked in low german to me but almost always in high german i like low german it has a nice sound and all and i appreciate it if people learn it to save it from vanishing but high german is definitely more useful it is also what is usually taught when german is taught as a foreign language Standard Mandarin English language Finnish language Dutch language Germanic languages Swiss German Danish language Standard Cantonese Chinese language Frisian language Urdu Russian language Hindi Swedish language Spanish language Irish language Mandarin (linguistics) Korean language Javanese language Non-native pronunciations of English Japanese language Italian language English as an additional language Tamil language Hebrew language Afrikaans Low German languages Greek language West Frisian language M__ori language Serbo-Croatian language Slovenian language Bengali language Languages of France Languages of Hong Kong Alemannic German Inuit language Arabic language Standard language Inuktitut International English Ulster Scots language Teochew (dialect) Taiwanese (linguistics) Languages in the United Kingdom High Germanic languages Multilingual Esperanto as an international language Occitan language French language Dialects of Mandarin Ukrainian language Thai language Welsh language Languages in the United States Tone (linguistics) Diglossia Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Guttural R Foreign language Wolof language Alsace Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics South Slavic languages Indonesian language Yiddish language Scots language Yoruba language Pinyin Italy Portuguese Creole West Country dialects Dialect Standard Swedish First language Czech language Alsace-Lorraine Austrian German Northern Low Saxon language Hungarian language Esperanto Low Saxon language American English Sami languages Written Cantonese Tagalog language Hong Kong English Finnish phonology Catalan language Cantonese (linguistics) Cornish language Languages in Star Wars West Germanic languages Chinese character Saterland Frisian language Austria Vowel
