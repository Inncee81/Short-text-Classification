september classroom idea what do you think this is my first year teaching th grade here in cali we don t have the usual seasons so instead of decorating my class in fall stuff for back to school i was thinking of doing a by the sea or underwater theme we are on the coast and our history for the year is about california so i was going to decorate my class and do some boards with a fish or beach or water theme is that a good idea or do you have any suggestions i think in october and november i will do the fall season stuff what do you think i think it's a great idea you could even make the name tags in the shape of the gray whale which is california's state marine mammal it would be great to start teaching them little facts about ca in the first day you could even do an ice breaker game like a scavenger hunt hide facts around the room and have the children say eureka i have found it when they find a fact state motto they will read it to the class introducing themselves their fact as well as giving them a chance to explore their area they will be able to get comfortable in their beautifully decorated classroom good luck sorry i got carried away back to your idea i love it Gray Whale Orca Whale Japanese tea ceremony Sperm Whale Dolphin Blue Whale Albatross Ecco the Dolphin United States Coast Guard Wheel of Fortune Whaling Fauna of Australia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Education in Germany USS Whale (SS-239) Marine biology Japanese calendar Seabird Shark Pilot Whale Hunting 1997 Pacific hurricane season Hopkins School Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Drama Education in Japan Cetacea Atlantic Ocean Second Battle of the Atlantic Neopets USS Narwhal (SS-167) USS Sands (DD-243) Kitzmiller v.
