educators what trends do see in education toward teaching learning climates etc what types of things are your higher level adminstrators asking of you what is the focus of your professional development how do you see things changing how do you feel this influences learning this is a good question teachers are bogged down with so many demands from administrators to teach this add that keep a folder for that work too much there is not enough time in a day to teach all the mandates that the district thinks need to be included in a school day you are also expected to serve on committees and come to school on evenings when you don't get paid most teachers i know spend at least one weekend day doing school work besides working a couple of hours every evening or they go in two hours early or stay two hours late my district has phenomenal professional development opportunities they provide workshops during the school day and will get a substitute teacher for you some classes are offered right after school too our state mandates that you get so many professional development hours every four years to be recertified these can be through district classes or college classes it is essential that teachers keep up on new trends and different strategies in teaching in order to do a good job how are things changing well i think a lot of kids are going through school without learning much eventually i think things will go back to the three r's without all the fluff or we'll have a lot of uneducated kids running the planet Education Education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong Graduate school Education in Germany Teacher Academia Charter school College Higher education Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Romania Economic inequality Alexander Technique Extreme Programming Teach the Controversy Experiential education Secondary education in Japan Intelligent design movement The College of New Jersey City and Guilds of London Institute Grade (education) Homeschooling Professor Tuition Milton H.
