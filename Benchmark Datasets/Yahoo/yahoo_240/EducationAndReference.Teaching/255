what is the nqt i am graduated from the faculty of commerce accounting dept so i was not really qualified as a teacher but i worked for years in an international school as a ta now i travelled to doha and will start my new job as a teacher for y my tas friends all started doing the montessori to be more qualified i heard of the nqt but i really don't understand is it a certificate that i can take on line like the montessori or is it something i had to study in uk at college and which is better for me to study first the montessori or the nqt if i can study it on line sorry if my question sounds silly but i really need an answer thank you hiya as already said nqt stands for 'newly qualified teacher' after studying to become a teacher in other words after doing a degree course or other access course the teacher is in their first year of teaching and is called a nqt or newly qualified teacher during this first year the teacher will undergo further training receive support from the school and will be assessed after the first year of teaching the teacher will be assessed to see if they meet teaching standards if they do they continue teaching into their second year i hope this makes sense so nqt isn't a course it is the term given to a teacher in their first year of teaching you also mentioned montessori montessori is an alternative education system which operates outside of the governed state education systems montessori is normally pre school education to teach in another education system e g steiner montessori it is common to have to go additional training to understand their philosophy of education and their teaching methods doing a certificate in montessori education will only benefit those wanting to work in montessori schools it doesn't really make you more qualified just allows you to work in their schools the certificate wouldn't be recognised in other education systems so montessori is an education system nqt is the first year that teachers go through after completing the degree course i'll just like to make it clear that by undertaking a montessori course that diploma will only allow you teach in their schools not all schools i don't know where in the world you are based so you will have to think what education system you want to work in state private independent i hope this of help to you Teacher Education in Hong Kong Education Education in Germany Montessori method Education in Australia Physician College Medical school No Child Left Behind Act City and Guilds of London Institute Education in the People's Republic of China Academic degree Graduate school High school Postgraduate Certificate in Education IB Diploma Programme Education in Japan General practitioner Philosophy of education Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Romania Doctor of Philosophy A-level Community college Australian Qualifications Framework Education in the United States College admissions Juris Doctor Apprenticeship Tai Chi Chuan Master's degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nurse National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in Singapore Law school Intelligent design movement Charter school Homeschooling New York State Department of Education SAT UCAS Standardized testing Waldorf Education Paralegal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Sweden Education in Malaysia Literacy Barrister GED Maria Montessori Lawyer Rabbi Intelligent design School counselor Associate's degree Academia Distance education Professor Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Ludwig Wittgenstein Lyceum of the Philippines Trinity College, Dublin Rudolf Steiner Medical College Calcutta Tripartite System Higher Commercial Examination Programme Education reform Philosophical skepticism Bah__'__ Faith and Education Physical therapy Education in the Netherlands Reiki Gymnasium (Denmark) University of Szeged Seneca College King City, Ontario Victorian Certificate of Education Software engineering Public education General Certificate of Secondary Education Past teachings of Prem Rawat Anglo-Chinese School Martial art Institute for Christian Studies Columbia University Secondary education in Japan
