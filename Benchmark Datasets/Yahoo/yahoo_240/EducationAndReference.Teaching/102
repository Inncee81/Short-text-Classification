same teacher i will be retaking a class with the same teacher again the teacher was really cool when i first took the class with him unfortunately i was looking for a higher grade than i got so the same teacher is lecturing the class again i am afraid of taking his class eventhough he was one of the best teachers i had my fear of taking his class is i am afraid he might frown upon me or look at me as an idiot do you think my fear is justified your fear is justified i'd be afraid too however you shouldn't have shame for taking the class again it's awesome you're willing to re do it in order to get a better grade power to you my suggestion is that you talk to the teacher tell him that you wanted to take the class again in order to do better and perhaps learn something new ask for any suggestions on how to do better on their tests and assignments if he's really cool he should be more than happy to help you talk to other students who did well in the class too ask what they did in particular that helped them do so well Grade (education) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education Alexander Technique The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hogwarts subjects Murdock-Portal Elementary School GED Martial art Teachers (film) Gifted Aikido Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania A-level Education in Hong Kong Azumanga Daioh Prostate cancer Boston Public Waldorf Education Propaedeutic value of Esperanto School violence YuYu Hakusho College Education in Germany Homeschooling Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Teacher's Pet (Disney) Bart vs. Lisa vs. The Third Grade Education in Portugal Kodocha Code: Lyoko The Sims 2: University SAT Primary education Education in Malaysia Secondary education in France Grade inflation Teacher Negima Education in Taiwan Singlish Irish syntax Phoebe Halliwell Education in South Korea Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Secondary education in the United States Hogwarts Noam Chomsky Philosophical skepticism Standardized testing Miami-Dade County Public Schools African American contemporary issues Education in Japan Milton H.
