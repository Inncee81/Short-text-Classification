hi i have a project about the home education i want c ur opinions as soon as possible me i prefer the schools but it seems that marie curie didn't so i will b happy c ur oppinions and what do u think about the advantages disadvantages of the home school education i had both growing up i was home schooled from th grades it was good and bad just as is public schools with homeschool it was hard for me since i liked sports and when you are homeschooled your not able to play for the school sports teams also you miss out on the interaction with all the other students the good thing about it was that i was able to spend good quality time with my parents and brother and sister i also got to wear whatever the heck i wanted and was able to do school work around life situations that come up the good thing about public school is it teaches you more about interaction with others you are also more disciplined i think because you have to abide by the same rules as thousands of other of students also you get to participate in the sports in each you have field trips and activities but with home school these field trips are your only interaction with other homeschooled children i think the education you get is about the same but with home school you do more school work than public school Education in the United States Waldorf Education Education Graduate school Education in Australia Autodidacticism School choice Marie Curie Education in Germany No Child Left Behind Act Pitaten Education in Portugal Patrick Henry College Experiential education GED A.
