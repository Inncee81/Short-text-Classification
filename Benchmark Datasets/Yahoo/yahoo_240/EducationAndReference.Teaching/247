i do not like some things going on in education i am a substitute teacher i am called upon to teach various subjects but if i am called upon to teach about sexual relations i refuse to teach that homosexuality is natural and not a lifestyle choice i refuse to teach that it is an acceptable alternative to heterosexuality i refuse to do that to our children i love to teach but political correctness is making it harder and harder neniaf wrong these are children whatever we teach them is instilled in them shapes their future their choices in life i refuse to be a part of the liberal agenda i will not teach that such behavior is natural however thank you for your input i believe what the asker is talking about is curriculum that tells children who are too young to debate it and reason it out that homosexuality is one or the other quite frankly i don't want my son being taught about sexual orientation in school that's my job and i talk openly with him about it it's one thing to teach that families come in all shapes and sizes and to teach that we all have to make our decisions in life it's another to stand in front of a class and teach mandated curriculum that just plain tells them this is ok it goes a lot deeper than that and while i may not agree with some people's choices it's not the school's job to override me in teaching him moral values it's also not the school's job to override me in discussing this openly with my son for the school to tell him what he should believe i'm his mother it's my and my husband's job to discuss and reason that through with him honestly my advice to you is to stick to your guns there is absolutely nothing wrong with teaching according to your convictions and refusing to teach classes that go against those convictions there may be times that you are under fire for that the bible even says you will be because apparently freedom of speech of action and of thought applies to everyone except for christians everyone else can be adamant in what they think and even call others intolerant for not seeing things just like they do but when christians stand by their convictions it's called being small minded and intolerant funny that even if you come under fire for it your actions will cause others to think and they might just effect change in the end you are responsible for what you teach and not just to the school board you are responsible to the kids and parents teaching is important but what you teach is even more important don't bend on your core beliefs hope that helps Teach the Controversy Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Homophobia Intelligent design movement Theory of conduct Infantilism Separation of church and state Education in Japan Theodicy Democracy Church of Christ Evil Sexual abstinence Religion and sexual orientation Social justice Polyamory Ex-gay Original sin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Determinism Laura Schlessinger Transsexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Liberalism Christian right Wedge strategy The nature of God in Western theology Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Feminism Confucius Free will A Course In Miracles Homosexuality and Judaism Creationism Religion and sexuality Ethics Moral Politics Homosexuality Coercion Domestic violence Jehovah's Witnesses Gender role Bah__'__ Faith and Education Education reform Center for Science and Culture French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Homeschooling Boston Public 2004 Republican National Convention Aesthetic Realism Political correctness Zoophilia Objectivist philosophy Religious Society of Friends Human nature Predestination Rick Santorum Philosophy Gay rights Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticism of libertarianism Cultural relativism Creation and evolution in public education Biology and sexual orientation Heteronormativity Bisexuality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Plame affair Summa Theologiae Goodness and value theory Same-sex marriage in Canada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social psychology Family First Party Hate speech Education in Germany Choice and sexual orientation Reparative therapy Education in the People's Republic of China Excommunication Freedom of speech Supply and demand Microeconomics Franz Boas The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex
