would you say that learning the abc's is different from learning other preschool skills i'm a teacher and i've been thinking a lot about learning in the preschool years it seems when children learn to walk talk use a spoon explore how flowers look and feel etc it is all motivated by their natural curiosity about what they are seeing in the world around them but when it comes to learning their letters or numbers although they may still be curious about these symbols we place in front of them it seems that this is the first time that they are learning simply because it is necessary and not because they are mimicing or exploring what do you think i don't think of any of these as 'preschool skills' they are all 'life skills' if we didn't know these basic skills it would probably be difficult to function on a day to day basis however learning comes from curiosity we are curious about how things work we are curious about political ideas we are curious about the next step in things etc since we are curious about all of this we naturally learn from it there is an exception to this in my opinion there are some things that we are forced to learn like algebra we aren't really curious about it when our th grade math teacher tells us about it it isn't something that most teens have a natural curiosity about however some of that curiosity does kick in when we are looking for the answer we are curious sometimes as to whether we got the right answer or not we are curious what will happen when we complete the list of instructions that accompanies the lab our science teacher gives us we are curious in language arts how the novel ends that we are forced to read and we are curious as to what our classmates thought of it during the discussion at age students may not admit that but it is happening Education in the United States Asperger syndrome Education in Taiwan Dyslexia Mathematics Theory of conduct Kindergarten GED Kender Motivation Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Education Richard Feynman JumpStart Education in Romania Philosophical skepticism Plame affair Milton H.
