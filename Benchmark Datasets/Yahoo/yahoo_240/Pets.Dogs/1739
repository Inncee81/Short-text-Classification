what in your opinion is the best way to teach a puppy not to pull on the leash i haven't tried breaking this habit much yet but it is fast becoming a problem yes i will ask my obedience instructor but i thought i would see what you know when puppy gets to the end of the leash and is tugging or pulling then turn around quickly and walk in the opposite direction don't worry you will only pull him off his feet one time he will run to you and when he gets to you praise him and pet him and tell him good boy what he is learning is the end of the leash is a dangerous place to be next to my alpha is always a safe good and happy place to be in his mind the leash is giving him the correction not you as you will not say one word when you turn in the opposite direction in teaching this i walk in a square and stop after about steps and see if my dog goes to the end of the leash if so i turn and walk one session is all it takes hon good luck h o t dog handler owner trainer of gsd's member u s a a w d f Dog training Obedience training Dog agility Kitesurfing Leash Schutzhund Aerial (dance move) Dog Housebreaking German Shepherd Dog Musical Canine Freestyle Dog collar Milton H.
