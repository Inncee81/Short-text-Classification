needing tips on how to house train inside outside puppy me and my boyfriend just recenting got a new puppy we have an older dog and she is already house trained and is use to being an inside outside dog the new puppy was doing good for the first week about barking or wining when needing to go outside to potty the girls stay outside from about when we are at work other than that they are inside and in their kennels at night this morning i found that the puppy had use the restroom alot during that night last night and she has been peeing in the house we take her outside at least every to hours what is wrong i need some good house training tips please help the puppy will goes to the bathroom in her kennel and we do not use the ac while we are not home so it would get too hot for the dogs they are just fine outside and they have plenty of water two huge bottles and plenty of shady as for going home at lunch we only get mins lunches are live mins away from town first of all it is not a good idea to leave your dogs outside while you are at work they can run out of water or their water can become contaminated by bugs the best bet is to crate train your puppy leave her in the crate while you are at work with just enough room for her to lay down a puppy will not go to the bathroom in the crate if they have to lay in it when they are finished someone should try to stop home around lunch to let her out as soon as you get home take her right out side try to stop at the door and scratch her paw on it first she will soon start to associate that with going out side take her out right after she eats or wakes up for a nap put her in the crate again at night still blocking off part of the crate so she does not have room to mess she may cry in the night to go out that means you need to get up with her i did this with my irish terrier he is not just over months old and potty trained hope this helps Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Dog Toilet humour Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet Nintendogs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Greyhound racing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Brady Bunch Japanese toilet The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shetland Sheepdog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dog show RuneScape quests Lady and the Tramp Social rule Dog agility Cuisine of Denmark Obedience training Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga English cricket team Sick Puppy Skinny Puppy Garfield American Kennel Club Ron Weasley Richard Chase Ben Johnson (athlete) Poker jargon One Tree Hill (TV series) Schutzhund Golden Retriever Basset Hound Abigail Folger Mnemonic Socialization American Pit Bull Terrier The Shining (film) Bull Terrier Chinglish Border Collie Kitchen Alaskan husky Fox hunting Marathon (sport) The Inside Beethoven (film) Drive-Thru Records Avenue Q Manos: The Hands of Fate Miniature Fox Terrier History of Test cricket (to 1883) Thermal power station Pet skunk Dialysis Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Fancy rat Blood Simple Dutch Schultz Boston Terrier Rose (Doctor Who) United Kennel Club Sin City Sumo Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier The X-Files (season 1) Columbine High School massacre Fire fighting Today I am A Clown The Time Machine Balto (film) Big Brother (Australian TV series) Neighbours EastEnders Charles Bukowski The Death Gate Cycle Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Good Morning, Vietnam Pulp Fiction Breed registry Hamster Fecal incontinence 2005 Iditarod German Shepherd Dog Belgian Shepherd Dog Babe Ruth Iditarod Saw II Border Terrier
