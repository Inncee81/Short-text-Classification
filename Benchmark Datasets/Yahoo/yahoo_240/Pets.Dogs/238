is it harmful to let my dog run alongside me for long periods of time i have recently started to find a more fun activity for me and my dog to do together what i do is fit a good harness over him and a leash then get on my skateboard and let him pull me faster than most cars no friggin joke anyways every evening i let him pull me like a husky sled dog around my city for sometimes up to hours it is so much fun and he seems to love it also i know that this is a very good excersize and way to let out his energy but could it possibly be harmful to his joints and hips knees my dog is a german shepard labradore which both have genetic problems with thier joints as they get older do you guys think that this could over time be a detrement to his internal structure or maybe it even strengthens it because of mucle protection around these joints i really just want him to be healthy and entertained and have fun on a daily basis someone please comment i think that since you are on a skateboard and he enjoys it there should be nothing wrong with it i wouldn't do it so often though because of the breed mix if you insist on doing it everyday maybe try to keep it down to to minutes or try doing it for to minutes a couple days a week i am glad you are concerned about his health though alot of people don't good luck Dog Labrador Retriever Mixed-breed dog Sled dog Equine conformation Alaskan Malamute German Shepherd Dog Iditarod 2005 Iditarod Breastfeeding Siberian Husky Weight training Working animal Skateboard Dogsled racing Inuit 1925 serum run to Nome Fancy rat Social rule Late Night with Conan O'Brien Eugenics Alaskan husky Dobermann 24 Hours of Le Mans Shaggy dog story Steven Wright Have I Got News For You Mushing Strap-on dildo Nintendogs Hip dysplasia Keeshond Reservoir Dogs The Fairly OddParents Basset Hound Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding Dog agility Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Spitz Ferret Gliding Ravi Shastri Pit bull Jam (TV series) Togo (dog) Time Out of Mind Domestic rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Border Terrier Kitesurfing Tai Chi Chuan The Ashlee Simpson Show Garfield MTV2 Bicycle Urinary incontinence Paragliding Soap opera Osteoarthritis The X-Files (season 1) Eric Bischoff Horse Good Times Back to the Future Obesity The Den (television) Pioneer Zephyr Health insurance Swingout Jennifer Lopez AIDS Havanese Family Guy Jackass (TV series) Belgian Shepherd Dog The Contender (television series) Working dog I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Avenue Q Ben Johnson (athlete) Swimming Energy development Alcoholics Anonymous Massage Guinea pig Samoyed (dog) East Germany Economy of the United States Sonic the Hedgehog Zoophilia Clown Diving Daylight saving time Dorama The Amazing Race Captain Thunderbolt Firefighter
