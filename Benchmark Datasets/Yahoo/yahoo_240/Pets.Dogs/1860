why do people always suggest obedience classes do they really think that everyone in the world is next to an obedience training classes for dogs well not everyone you do not have to go to an obedience class with your dog if you do not want to there are other ways to train your dog however understand that animals do not think like humans and that if you want good results you are probably better off getting the dog trained by a professional who understands how dogs think and react to you as their owner dog trainers are usually very well informed about what makes a dog tick so to speak they can assess why the dog is not doing what you command him to do and show you how to get the results you want yes you can probably get much of this information in books online etc however you will be spending countless hours getting yourself up to speed on the information before you can even begin applying what you have learned with the dog i run accross many people who say my dog wont listen or my dog won't keep quiet or my dog won't do his duty where i want him to let me just say this it is all in the training you only get what you put into it yes you may have to drive minutes to a class once or twice a week for a few months but do you honestly want to be stressed out for the rest of your dogs life because he she is not doing what you want them to do you need to train dogs from the beginning to obey you you need to become the alpha to your dog otherwise that dog will run your life and it will not be a rewarding experience for you as a pet owner many people think all you need to do is train your dog to ask to go outside or to spin and do a few other tricks for a biscuit it does not work like that if you want an obedient dog dogs will learn from the good habits you teach them or from the bad habbits you allow it's all up to you Obedience training Working dog Dog agility Dog Schutzhund Housebreaking Dog intelligence German Shepherd Dog John Howard Yoder Obedience Scientology beliefs and practices Musical Canine Freestyle Jewish principles of faith Keeshond Socialization Horse breaking Alfred Korzybski Great Ape language Alexander Technique USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Opus Dei Sola fide Simone Weil Ethics Clicker training Hearing impairment Animal Farm Second language acquisition Philosophy of language Chesapeake Bay Retriever Rule of St Benedict Domestic rabbit Milgram experiment Culture Dobermann Police dog Marathon (sport) Nintendogs Horse Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha Equilibrium (2002 film) Garfield Stuttering Fox hunting Guide dog Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Psychoanalysis Social psychology Shetland Sheepdog Aphasia Speed reading Ben Johnson (athlete) Evil Charles Grandison Finney Divine grace Scouting Aztec Havanese Australian Cattle Dog Goodness and value theory Crate training Religious Society of Friends Education Happiness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Moral objectivism Reiki Social justice Zoophilia Sermon on the Mount Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Jean-Jacques Rousseau Tooth enamel Brian Griffin Team Rocket Medieval hunting Neuro-linguistic programming Articles of Religion (Methodist) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Iditarod Animated television series Aesthetic Realism Justification (theology) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rabies Air Education and Training Command Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Aikido Tick Gun dog Golden Retriever Stress (medicine) Fancy rat
