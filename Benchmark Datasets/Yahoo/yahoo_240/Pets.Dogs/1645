my chihuahua goes pee outside but prefers the carpet better what to do for one thing if it's a really small dog there's less pee so that works in your favor you have to think of a way to get your dog to go to the bathroom outside do you take him out what does he do when he goes out you could buy a small plastic kennel and keep him in there when you can't keep a close eye on him and when you take him out get him outside so he can go and then give him lots of praise when he goes in the place you want one thing i wanted to add in my experience taking the dog outside when it has just peed inside doesn't do any good it might make you feel better because the little pee factory is outside where it should be peeing anyway but i have found the dogs do not really learn anything from this the dog has just gone to the bathroom and when you take it out it has no clue why and think it means you want to play outside or something it has just gone inside and has finished so you miss the chance to teach it to go outside thing to do is to get him outside before he pees inside Dog agility Toilet humour Poker jargon Dog training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aladdin (1992 film) Pee Wee Russell Hamster The Amazing Race Philosophy of language Chihuahua (dog) Extreme Programming Kender Toy dog Social rule Jon Secada RuneScape quests Obedience training Dog Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Good Times Fecal incontinence Ron Weasley Toilet Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Characters of Lost Nintendogs Syphon Filter Jack Russell Terrier Friends Euphemism Tag Prayer Storytelling The Lovely Bones Saw II Kitchen German Shepherd Dog K' Pitaten Bart chalkboard gags The Death Gate Cycle Tenchi Muyo!
