how to put husband off getting a dog first off i'm nervous about dogs and he insists i will get used to them if we get a puppy secondly we work full time the both of us we live in rented accomodation with two cats i'm at my wits end trying to get him to see reason i've went on countless websites i've told him about the hundreds of dogs in shelters because people didn't think it through he honestly believes a puppy can be trained to keep it in for hours help men eh you are right in not wanting to bring a puppy into the house but he wont believe me either i think you cannot leave a puppy on its own for over hours a day it will become withdrawn isolated and maybe destructive through boredom it is cruel to leave a pup for that length of time and it will certainly bark continuously while alone thus annoying your neighbours if your neighbours complain to your landlord your in trouble does your landlord allow pets as you are in rented accommodation you will have to replace carpets and furniture when the pup through being left alone goes to the toilet on them you are right when you point out that the shelters are full of dogs whose owners have got them on a whim without really considering the responsibility of getting a dog who is going to look after it when he wants to go on holiday pet accommodation can be expensive while you are away for a fortnight is he going to pay for its medical treatment how will your cats react to a strange puppy they might leave home mine did when i got my yorkie he was missing for two months with cats you can leave them a litter tray and plenty of food and go off for a romantic night away you cant with a dog there are a million and one reasons why you shouldn't get a puppy and tell him that a million and one people are on your side on this one tell him to wait until you've got a place of your own and one of you is at home all day now there's an idea if he's willing to work extra hours to make up your wages each week you'll gladly stay at home to look after his new pup see how that one goes down ha ha good luck to you and stand your ground Dog training Housebreaking Golden Retriever Fancy rat Hamster EastEnders Shaggy dog story Socialization RuneScape quests Neighbours Social rule Gray Wolf 101 Dalmatians: The Series Cat Rabies Beethoven (film) Dobermann Toilet Poker jargon Dilbert Billboard Hot 100 Joseph Chamberlain The Apprentice 2 One Tree Hill (TV series) The Family from One End Street Ferret Lady and the Tramp Manx (cat) Nintendogs Sick Puppy Charles Peace Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Scooby-Doo Crate training Maison Ikkoku Ron and Fez Dog agility Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Greyhound Humphrey Bogart Leasehold estate Rais massacre Skinny Puppy Charles Darwin's education Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten First day on the Somme Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Domestic rabbit Oasis (band) Animal euthanasia Animal Crossing Pit bull Emergency preparedness USS Wasp (CV-18) Ranma __ characters Friends Continuation War Korea Jindo Dog Big Brother (USA TV series) One Piece minor characters Abigail Folger Our Gang Knots Landing Animal Farm American Eskimo Dog Richard Chase Sheikh Abdullah Yorkshire Terrier Miss Saigon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labrador Retriever Babylonian law L.
