buying a shiba inu i'm going to get a dog sometime in the future i am considering a miniature pinscher or a shiba inu min pins are easy to find unlike shiba's i would really like to adopt one preferably a puppy or young dog the thing is i don't want to spend a ton of money i don't care if it's a pure bred i will spend maximum on it i'm not sure which breed i am going to get yet so feel free to tell me stories if you have one of them i will get an adult min pin but i want a puppy if i get a shiba are there any rescue groups that are not too expensive and will either transport the dog or allow it to be picked up from another state i've been searching and there really are none around where i live i've tried petfinder but they don't have many and they're not around where i live either i am a huge fan of the shiba i purchased a puppy at the end of april and she is the best i could not find any in my area when i was looking so i ended up purchasing from a breeder in ok i spent including shipping it was more than i thought i would ever spend on a dog but it was the right decision they are very intelligent dogs and can be stubborn but if you are up for the challenge they are a joy to have as my vet so eloquently put it some dogs will ask once in a lifetime who is the boss and what do you want me to do other dogs ask ever day she asks everyday but now does things before being asked ie sitting and waiting at doors before going through she is adorable and knows it i may get bad ratings from other members because of this but i purchased her through puppyfind com i did a lot of research and checked refrences before purchasing i am now a refrence for my breeder good luck with your decision and feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my experience Nintendogs Dog Shiba Inu Puppy mill Dobermann American Pit Bull Terrier Rave Master Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Golden Retriever Internet fraud Dog breeding Housebreaking Dog training Social rule Domestic rabbit Galactic Civilizations Shaggy dog story Miniature Pinscher Pitaten Tautology Game show Dog show Livestock One Tree Hill (TV series) Docking Labrador Retriever German Shepherd Dog Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kodocha Australian Cattle Dog Pet skunk RuneScape quests American Kennel Club Discus (fish) American Eskimo Dog Rottweiler Philip J.
