help my month old kelpie pup keeps peeing everywhere we got her from the vets after she had a paralysis tick and needed a home she is my responsibility but whenever she gets excited scared or is just normal she pees why does she do this is it because of the tick my mum's threatening to get rid of her but apparently there was one stage when she was brought into the vets that she almost died can you please tell me why she keeps peeing you don't say how old you are but it's not fair for your mum to just pass you all the responsibility this is a creature with complex needs any animal has these but a puppy who has been very sick and suddenly finds itself in a new environment has it in spades so she is upset and no wonder the weeing is either because she's just nervous or she's marking her new territory yes females can do this even desexed females or both you're actually lucky it's only weeing believe me it could be a lot worse i've just moved house and am going through the same with my eight month old housetrained desexed female puppy ugh you don't want to know the details let's just say that i have a lot of cleaning up to do every morning and that's after we've been here almost a month give her time to settle in and give her lots of attention praise and treats for weeing in the right place in the meantime never ever shout at her or punish her for weeing indoors or she will be scared of you or mum and get even worse the other thing you can do is consult a dog trainer your vet will know one who will at least persuade your mum that this is normal behaviour and the poor puppy should be given a fair go and they will be able to tell you how to go about dealing with this problem if you don't just want to wait and see how things settle good luck Housebreaking Dog training Dog Social rule Ron and Fez Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Scooby-Doo Sick Puppy EastEnders About a Boy Theory of conduct Little Britain 101 Dalmatians: The Series Tick Humphrey Bogart Fancy rat Weebl and Bob Milton H.
