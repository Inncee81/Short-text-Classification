which is better a german shepherd or a siberian husky and why i cant decide between the ive read that huskies actually are temperament and that they arent really good guard dogs and i dont need my dog trying to run away whenever possible i live in denver colorado huskies look more cooler but german shepherds are more intelligent thanks for that insignificant answer john kudos on that one and i need facts on which is better im not just going for looks ya know in response to dog judge i live in denver colorado which is ideal for the husky but again temper is a problem and also shedding umm i am an outside person and dog weight has no problem at all yes and huskies tend to run away as all dogs but thats their instince right outdoors and in the summer it gets hot round f any given day and in the winter it snows like no tomorrow and temps get low roughly bout f you could get a list a foot long here put up more information where do you live what do you like to do inside or outside person dog weight issues we don't need to convince you you need to decide what you're looking for update i had two huskies and i've had lots of german shepherds in obedience classes for a lot of reasons huskies are healthier smaller dog fewer structural problems either dog could tolerate the denver climate both dogs shed and although huskies shed more i don't think that it's really a make or break issue huskies are renown for running when loose because they are sled dogs with proper training you can overcome this but it's an issue that will need to be addressed gsds are more trainable for a novice i would lean toward the husky because of the health issues hips in particular that being said if you decide to go after a gsd make sure that you do all of your homework about hips both parents and as many other relatives as possible must be ofa certified if not find another breeder hips are not that much of an issue with huskies for a lot of reasons Siberian Husky Mixed-breed dog Dog Alaskan husky Schutzhund Obedience training Dobermann Belgian Shepherd Dog Dog agility 1925 serum run to Nome Alaskan Malamute Sled dog Keeshond Mushing Havanese Horse Equine conformation Spitz Domestic rabbit Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Basset Hound Denver, Colorado Manx (cat) 2005 Iditarod American Eskimo Dog Rose American Pit Bull Terrier Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Western United States CPU cache Border Terrier Smooth Collie Roald Amundsen English Springer Spaniel Shetland Sheepdog Free will Boxing Working dog Norwegian Campaign Australian Shepherd Livestock E85 Tobacco smoking Nintendogs Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knife Bernese Mountain Dog Philosophy of language Legal research Chinook (dog) Great Dane Pekingese Battle of Kursk First aid Border Collie K__ppen climate classification Togo (dog) Inuit Docking Roof Swimming Brown Bear Atkins Nutritional Approach Jet engine Hard disk Yosemite National Park Tibetan Terrier Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pomeranian (dog) Allied invasion of Sicily GED Social rule California Motorcycle Saved by the Bell Mixed martial arts Discordianism Australian Cattle Dog Spanking M16 (rifle) Columbine High School massacre Vitamin C Weight training Hamster Sampling (music) Scientology beliefs and practices Carburetor Operation Mincemeat Domestic goat Pyrenean Shepherd Colorado Narrow gauge
