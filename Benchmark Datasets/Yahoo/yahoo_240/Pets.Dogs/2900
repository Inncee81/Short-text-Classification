at what age does an akita get a more protective personality my akita pup is almost months old he's neutered up to date on all shots healthy and well cared for my only real question is his friendliness toward strangers right now he runs up to everyone and wants attention and would probably welcome any intruder into the house i know that can change as he gets older so i'm wondering when he will become more protective and less social with strangers i don't want to make him aggressive or anything but i got an akita because i like their loyalty toward family and standoffish nature toward outsiders so i'm hoping he will get that personality soon what is your experience with this my boy was exactly the same at that age and i thought that i was not going to end up with a guard dog after all but at about mth he slowly started changing and when walking where he would have gone up to anyone tail wagging he started to become more aloof and would ignore the strangers oohhhing and ahhhing at him he now at months is icredibly protective of home and family and has a certain i really dont care and i really dont want to know you attitude when he meets strangers now you should see this aloofness starting to come out in your boy over the coming months oh he is actually an akita too sorry i just said my boy could have been any breed Cat Skye Terrier Hachiko Narcissism Akita Inu Domestication Dobermann Social rule Pit bull Rottweiler Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Akita Prefecture Abortion debate Shaggy dog story __u Main Line Theory of conduct Punk ideology Hamster Internet troll Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomic Kitten Dog fighting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.
