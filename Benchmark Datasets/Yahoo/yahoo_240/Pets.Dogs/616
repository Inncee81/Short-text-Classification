how do i get my chihuahua to stop attacking me when my chihuahua is with my dad she becomes extremly violent attacking anyone that comes near her she only started to do this a few months ago is it possible to get her to be nice again i had the same problem my chi was a sweet as could be but then at times she'd turn wicked in an instant and attack me the trick to extinguishing this behavior is to make her know that you are the boss not her begin by pinning her down on her back and gently holding her down for a few seconds if she resists just keep her pinned down until she relaxes do this once or twice a day the next time she attacks you immediately flip her and pin her down in the same manner but on her side keep one hand thumb near her head to prevent her from biting you tell her a very firm no keep her pinned until she relaxes a trainer suggested this method to me and it has worked as the trainer said you have to make the dog think you are capable of killing it not that we ever would but the dog has to have that fear respect of you be firm and consistent it may take time good luck Dog training Professional wrestling holds Suplex Chess strategy and tactics Dog agility Screw Gesture Dog Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Eddie Guerrero Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling aerial techniques Clown Obedience training Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story GunZ The Duel Chess terminology Aikido Aerial (dance move) Guilty Gear Leon White Gray Wolf Rocko's Modern Life Table tennis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shen Gong Wu Clicker training Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 5) Housebreaking The McGuire Sisters Vampire Powerbomb Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild ARMs 2 Bubble Bobble Breastfeeding Mattress Western concert flute Indianapolis 500 Pok__mon Live!
