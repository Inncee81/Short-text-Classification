is is possible to own a dog hubby and i live in an apartment condo which means no grass loads of walkways and areas in immediate area outside of building we are gone to work from is that too much pressure to put on a dog no children we are quiet people we are both loving responsible and financially able to have a pet now might be the time i'm concerned about housetraining and leaving the pet alone that long i'm allergic to cats i'd like to thank everyone who gave intelligent and polite answers i had pretty much decided that a pet is not for us at this time childless and pet free it is it is possible to own a dog with the living circumstances you have described how do all you people who think that hours a day is too long for a dog to not have their people around earn enough money to care for a dog especially if one of you could come home during lunch to let the dog out or hire a dog walker to take the dog out a couple days a week for some exercise while you are at work for your situation though i would strongly recommend getting an adult dog rather than a puppy puppies take a lot of time to raise properly they really should be pottied every hours at least and it is extremely difficult to do so if you are gone for most of the day adult dogs are usually already housetrained are physically capable of holding it for longer periods of time if no one is available to come by and let the dog out in the middle of the day not having a yard shouldn't be a concern as long as you walk the dog every day at least once preferably two or three times a day often dogs that live in apartments or other housing arrangements with no yard area better off than those with a large fenced yard because their owners spend more time exercising walking training them Dog training Housebreaking Fancy rat Socialization Korea Jindo Dog Shaggy dog story Obedience training Social rule Japanese Chin Infantilism Hamster Pet American Eskimo Dog Divorce Mixed-breed dog Crate training German Shepherd Dog Cat Rabies Golden Retriever Dobermann Tick Australian Cattle Dog Pit bull Garfield Bill Clinton Dead Like Me Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Keeshond Skye Terrier Pet store The Sims Pet skunk Maison Ikkoku Labrador Retriever The Fairly OddParents Ferret Havanese Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Microeconomics Aphasia Diabetes mellitus Baseball Freeters 101 Dalmatians: The Series New York Giants The Brady Bunch Abigail Folger Whippet Friends Stuttering Community emergency response team Education in the People's Republic of China Swimming B-side Poker jargon Tattoo Hyperinflation Yom Kippur War Dog agility Grief Border Collie Zoophilia USS Wallace L.
