how can i find out where this dog lives i have a dog roaming my neighborhood it's a very friendly dog but no collar no tags i offered it food water and love but i don't know where it lives animal control is closed and since i also have a dog i cannot keep it here especially since there were no tags on the dog i want this dog to find it's home but i can't just a note to all dog owners please leave information on your dogs tag so that if they are lost they can be found again micro chip would not help in this case but owner information on the tag would i also live in a tiny town and have not seen this dog before it was very friendly and seemed quite obedient to commands but needed a good grooming i can't keep it here because i also have a dog and i don't want to risk having another dog without tags i just hope that it finds it's home poor thing the right thing to do is get it off the street you need to take it to the animal shelter that services that area so the owner can have a chance of finding it hopefully the dog is micro chipped with current owner info chipping is only as good as the owner is in keeping the info updated tags should always be on the dog and more that one tag with the same info my dog got out one time he had tags on his collar with my contact info along with his rabies tag etc when i got the call and went to get him all his tags were torn loose of his collar except for the one i put on a different ring on the other side Dog training Microchip implant (animal) Obedience training Dog Cat Dog agility CPU cache Dog collar Working dog Golden Retriever Professional wrestling match types Atari 8-bit family Microcontroller Rabies Oliver and Company Greg Valentine Ferret AMD Maison Ikkoku Poker jargon Floppy disk Order of the Bath Acorn Computers Betting (poker) Dobermann AmigaOS Philip J.
