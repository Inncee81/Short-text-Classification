my dog was maced any vet techs online hi guys ok today when i got home from work my son told me that our jack russell had been maced i found out it was the electric companys' meter reader that did it my dog was on my side and meter is outside the fence so he only maced her for fun because she was no threat to him anyways my son bathed her trying to get it out of her eyes and off her skin are there any long term effects should i be looking out for anything in particular he washed her with dog shampoo but maybe dawn and baking soda would be better like a skunk spray yes i filed a complaint but i doubt it will do any good thanks for any advice it just breaks my heart thinking what would have happened if she was home alone all day made to suffer frigging asshats buterfly did you even read my question don't be so sure about that ok the meter is at least feet outside the back yard not inside the back yard the meter is in the front yard not back yard my dogs are confined to the back yard keep up with me now there was no danger to him he was outside the gate ten feet away from her he had to walk up to her and spray her thru the wrought iron fence that seperates him from her got it now control my dog that's rich stfu there won't be any long term effects just the normal stinging and burning some vaseline in the eyes might soothe them i would rent a bear suit and scare the crap out of the meter man and spray him with mace the next time he comes to read the meter loll sorry about your puppy though that wasn't very nice of the meter guy to do and totally unnecessary i would find out if he has done this to other dogs on his route that are also no threat to him and file a collective complaint there is strength in numbers Swimming Pepper spray Happy Tree Friends Psoriasis Diving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marching band Reservoir Dogs Craps Avenue Q Spidey Super Stories Shaggy dog story Skunk Ecco the Dolphin Lechaina Dean Koontz RuneScape quests Tag Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling match types Rabies Equine conformation Social rule Garfield Japanese mythology Milton H.
