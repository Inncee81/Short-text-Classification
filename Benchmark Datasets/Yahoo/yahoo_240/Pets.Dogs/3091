how is cesar millan abusive i've seen his shows and never once has he abused those dogs so what is considered abuse to you if you think he's abusive i don't understand what people's problem with him is either he always claims that he is not a dog trainer so i don't know why everyone keeps harping on his training methods the dogs that he works with on the show are usually dogs that have their owners so scared frustrated that they are ready to give them up to a shelter or have them put down i don't have to show dominance to my dogs as much as he does because i worked with them correctly since we got them using the exercise then discipline then affection model he goes on and on about he has to be firm with the dogs because their owners have raised them wrong and fostered the bad behaviors most people that adopt dogs are completely ignorant about how to take care of them this is evident in half of the questions that are posted on here my dog is still going to the bathroom in the house after months what do i do put in the time to crate potty train my dog hasn't been eating for days and is throwing up what should i do hello get off the computer and ask your vet what do i do my dog jumps on everyone and eats my shoes try training it my dog is so cute should i breed her come on cesar's dogs are all healthy well exercised and balanced they are not aggressive to other people or dogs and have a great life you can tell by watching them on the show that his pack is not scared of him he does not abuse them he always is talking about the importance of spaying neutering adopting from rescue organizations exercising etc maybe to some people his methods seem harsh but they get the job done and keep people from putting their dog to sleep for bad behavior edit also i would like to point out that he uses different methods with different dogs many times he just has to show the owner how to stay calm and hold the leash and teaches them how to master the walk and that solves all their problems exercised dogs are happy dogs and he does not use pinch and choke collars on every dog only the dogs who's owners are already using them usually he uses those cent leashes they give you at the vets office Housebreaking Dog training Dog Obedience training Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Guinea pig Cat Theory of conduct Ferret Crate training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog agility Garfield Pit bull Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 1957 World Series Schutzhund Traumatic incident reduction Rescue group Randomness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Docking The Sims Poker jargon The Smoking Room Working dog Psychology Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Anger management Basset Hound Tai Chi Chuan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Infantilism Manx (cat) Havanese Plame affair Futurama (TV series - season 5) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Autism Friends Animal euthanasia Insulin Kodocha Nintendogs Aikido Tooth enamel Golden Retriever Richard Feynman Brian Griffin Humphrey Bogart Labrador Retriever Economic inequality Past teachings of Prem Rawat EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Socrates Economics Dog collar Fecal incontinence German Shepherd Dog The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Horse Great Dane Psychoanalysis Quake III Arena Urinary incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Goodness and value theory Discordianism Peter Singer Stomach cancer David Hume Surveillance Philosophy of language Nicomachean Ethics Social rule Abortion debate Hamster Greyhound Babe Ruth Falconry Utilitarianism Iditarod
