what the best type of dry dog food i have a chi she is yrs old with the whole dogs dieing scare i'm paranoid since i live for her the top foods are foods like solid gold merrick innova canidae wellness natural balance and natures variety there are many more but this is a good start i prefer solid gold they tell you right on the back no by products salt grains corn etc they even have a wee bits style made specifically for small dogs like a chihuahua which is what i have the bites are extra small all the foods mentioned above are top notch foods if you want to stay on more of a budget you can try diamond naturals not diamond but diamond naturals it is not the best by all means but it is cheap and it at least gets you away from the by products and corn those are the main two things to stay away from the main thing you can do is just read the ingredients of foods stay away from anything that can be bought in a grocery store more than likely they are no good iams pedigree purina purina pro plan science diet eukanuba and nutro are all foods to stay away from they may be advertised as being the best but they are no good they don't even compare to the foods i listed above they are all packed with corn and by products and all other kinds of fillers vets might recomend them but most vets dont take any nutrition classes it is an elective most of those food companies pay for some of the vets education so they think its the best just get on the good foods and stay on them they might be more expensive but pay for it now or pay for it later besides you'll be surprised to see that most better foods aren't all that more expensive ok i had to edit this but some of you are recommending beneful pedigree happy tails purina and iams sorry but these are all garbage foods they are all packed with fillers corn grains by products and a whole bunch of other messes that you don't want to get involved with don't believe what is on the tv also one person mentioned science diet sorry again but this is another over rated food if i believe right the first ingredient is chicken which is good but then it gets into corn and by products and grains just stay away form it one person mentioned eagle pack and yes this is another great food Dog food Cat food Hamster Vegetarianism Fancy rat Ramen Cereal Microeconomics Dog Maize Cat Food Nestl__ Organic food Agriculture Nutrition Bread Chocolate Domestication Cantonese cuisine Veganism Flour Peanut Cuisine of Malaysia Ferret Ralston Purina Company Food and Drug Administration Tofu Ice cream Organic farming Omega-3 fatty acid Cajun cuisine Folic acid Cuisine of Africa Bulk vending Chicken Cheese Genetically modified food Healthy eating Jewish cuisine Trans fat Hot dog Milk Sorghum Dairy Drill bit Food preservation Pedigree pet food Food storage Hamburger Pizza Explosive material Cuisine of the Southern United States Economy of the United States Shaggy dog story Alcoholic beverage Pasta Potato Peruvian cuisine Chili con carne Economics Economy of Africa Illegal drug trade Wal-Mart Gross domestic product Alcohol fuel Atkins Nutritional Approach Aztec Contract Tesco Free trade Local food Rice Raw food diet Synthetic diamond Starch Miso Discus (fish) Soul food Plastic Genetic engineering Livestock Sushi Commodity markets Bengali cuisine Domesticated turkey Casting
