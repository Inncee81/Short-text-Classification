new puppy from a breeder a gal that we take to the dog park just got a new puppy i can't remember the breed but it is papered akc the lady that she got the dog from told her that there were conditions the dog must stay intact she must show the dog least times a year is this normal for a breeder to ask when selling their pups of course i don't have all the info but i thought this was kind of odd to ask of someone paying for one of your pups sounds like she bought a show quality puppy and yes that is normal contract stipulations i imagine she asked for a puppy to show and had to go through the ringer before she got the pup as most breeders are very very picky about who gets there best puppies there are probably a lot more stipulations in that contract too i have even been told not to put a regular collar on my dog until after he finished his ch i had to prove i had him micro chipped and tattooed though if the pup did not pass his pre breeding testing and at least his cgc i would have had to get him neutered his breeder also required that i pre approve any breeding's with her sometimes it felt like i was a being treated like a criminal but that dog was so worth it plus with that well known breeder as a reference i can now get a pup from a good breeder and not have to go through all that if you want a purebred puppy that is the way to go not just show quality pups get that treatment by the way pet quality do too i can still call that breeder and ask questions she will gladly share her knowledge and that dog died of old age years ago she still sends pictures of my grand puppies i see post like the one about my breeder disappeared and i have not got my papers and i know that everything i went through was worth it no strings sounds nice until you realize there really are no strings obiviosly tom's world is not very familiar with the dog show world prize money hahaha money from a litter if you want to pay of my expenses i'll share all the profit expect about back again you don't get a show puppy from a breeder unless you go looking for it if a breeder offers you a show puppy and you didn't ask or have a good show record you are dealing with byb at best if you want a puppy with no contract they are out there and most will be very fine dogs but don't expect to show them Dog Dog breeding American Kennel Club Dog breed Labrador Retriever Puppy mill Breed registry Golden Retriever Dog training Shaggy dog story Mixed-breed dog Docking Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Obedience training Poker jargon Dog show German Shepherd Dog Contract Scooby-Doo Pet skunk Havanese Border Collie Meat Loaf Dog agility Skinny Puppy Major League Baseball television contracts Dobermann Housebreaking Ferret Make money fast God Emperor of Dune Our Gang Hamster Equilibrium (2002 film) Discus (fish) Greyhound Microeconomics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Life insurance Hip dysplasia Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Game show Livestock Theory of conduct Inflation Craps Smooth Collie Sick Puppy Breeders' Cup Enron Corporation Universal Studios Atari 8-bit family Gray Wolf The Ashlee Simpson Show Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Great Dane English Springer Spaniel Sears Holdings Corporation Knots Landing Australian Shepherd The Amazing Race Beethoven (film) Jack Russell Terrier The Price Is Right The Apprentice 2 Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Plame affair Internet fraud Pet store Insurance Care Bears Whippet Keeshond Alaskan husky The Origin of Species American Cocker Spaniel Graduate school Hypnosis Annuity The Death Gate Cycle Belgian Shepherd Dog Intellectual property United States Postal Service Health insurance The Critic Advance fee fraud Neighbours Brian Griffin Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Money
