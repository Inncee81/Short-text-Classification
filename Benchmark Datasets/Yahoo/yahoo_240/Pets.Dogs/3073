any ideas on how to cure diarria for my minature schnauzer this past saturday my dog was sick with vomiting and diarria plus he mainly layed around all day then on sunday he was back to normal but still had the diarria then on monday still doing good but still having the diarria when all this first started it was like water now it isn't that way but it's still considered diarria he is still very playful eating and drinking great and he is also up to date on all his shots hi there i am a veterinarian technician and hope to help i am sorry to hear about your sick pup unfortunately at one time or another every dog will have diarrhea what i would recommend is to collect a same of the diarrhea and bring it into your vet tomorrow for a fecal exam for parasites and a giardia snap test this should cost you about and only takes about minutes a normal solid fecal takes minutes any loose stool should be run for that way you can rule out any intestinal parasites or giardia most likely even if your dog does not have any parasites your vet will prescribe metronidazole which will help to get rid of the diarrhea in the mean time i would advise you to fast your dog for a full hours your dog needs a full hours of no food to rid the body of the diarrhea no food no bones no treats no toys from which pieces can be swallowed however offer plenty of cold water frequently to keep your dog hydrated once you have fasted your dog for the full hours then you should feed a bland diet you can either purchase i d prescription food from your vet or if you don't mind cooking you can boil either chicken and rice or hamberg and rice it is very important that you rinse off all the fat before boiling and please do not add seasoning or anything extra that will cause diarrhea you want to keep it as bland as possible trust me i have seen everything you are going to feed small frequent meals of the bland diet about of a cup times daily again make sure your baby is drinking plenty of water i still would limit any bones especially rawhides or anything similar so you give your dogs stomach a little rest feed the bland diet until your dog has a solid stool if you are feeding the bland diet while giving your dog metronidazole do not expect any bowel movements for days so don't panic if your dog does not poop for several days that is to be expected on the prescription if you are still seeing diarrhea on the bland diet then it is even more important to bring a fecal sample into the vet if you haven't done so already here are some questions your vet is going to want to know when did the diarrhea start did you change anything in his her diet ie new food new bone new treats etc did he she get into something he she should not have on heartworm prevention year round any vomiting eating drinking acting like normal and of course they are going to want to see the fecal sample hope this helps let me know how he is doing and if i can help you more Stomach cancer Diarrhea Ulcerative colitis Fancy rat Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Pet skunk Coeliac disease Vomiting Guinea pig Human feces Cuisine of Denmark Fasting Dietary fiber Food Cancer Hypoglycemia Crohn's disease Medical prescription Veganism Dog Domestic rabbit Hamster Garfield Giardia lamblia Breastfeeding Dairy Irritable bowel syndrome Escherichia coli O157:H7 Folic acid Colorectal cancer Tocopherol Gastroparesis Cantonese cuisine Egg (food) Ascariasis Ramen Entamoeba histolytica Chicken Japanese tea ceremony Cat First aid Pneumonia Adjustable gastric band Schistosomiasis Marathon (sport) Dieting Jewish cuisine Feces Milk Nutrition Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dehydration Super Size Me Comanche Heartworm Halitosis Gastroenteritis Poker jargon Taboo food and drink Constipation Cuisine of the Southern United States Botulism Customs and etiquette of Japan Rice pudding Cuisine of Brazil Vampire Iditarod Diabetes mellitus Trichinosis Flatulence Obesity 2005 Iditarod Anorexia nervosa Peruvian cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fugu Radiation poisoning Terri Schiavo Breakfast Chronic fatigue syndrome Clostridium difficile Glycogen storage disease type I Cuisine of Malaysia Giardiasis Ferret
