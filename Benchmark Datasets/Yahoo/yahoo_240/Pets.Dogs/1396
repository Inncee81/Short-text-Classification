my dog peed on his own bed i always heard that dogs dont like to soil they're own sleeping place i was playing with my dog the other day and put him in his bed when i felt something wet on my hand i looked at his bed and there was a big pile of pee on it i could not believe it it looked like it had been there for a few days but i have no idea why he did it then again he peed a few times on the floor last time which is not like him maybe because i didnt take him down early enough and he got in trouble for it so he didnt want to soil the floor again so he peed in his own bed logical explanation i dont know what do u think thing is he is toilet trained and he is only yr and a half so he's still young i think i might have left him without taking him down for too long there are no other dogs around and he hasnt done it since so i think its a once off thing you can expect dogs to do odd things such as pee in their bed while they are being house trained if he peed in his bed then it probably means he thinks the act of peeing is what he is being punished for and not the act of peeing in the house but you're right normally a dog won't soil the bed he has to sleep on Housebreaking Toilet humour Humphrey Bogart Mattress Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Dog training Slow Train Coming EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) El Chavo del Ocho Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blankets (graphic novel) Relative clause Dean Koontz Montgomery Burns Social rule Jackass: The Movie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Sin City The Catcher in the Rye Hey Jude Euphemism Opportunity rover Professional wrestling match types Philosophy of language The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Dog Norway national football team Out-of-body experience Big Brother UK series 6 Fox hunting Hamster 1957 World Series Daylight saving time The Big Sleep Los Angeles Dodgers Apollo 8 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Boom Crash Opera Pee Wee Russell The Death Gate Cycle Bon Jovi Milton H.
