puppy bites ankle alot my female gsd weeks keep wanting to bite my ankle like mouth it i know shes growing new teeth but when she can't find her chew toys she comes to me and bite me ankle i think she wants to play but i give her big long walks each day atleast times i hit her but then she barks at me i spray her with a spray bottle she barks too when your dog does something like that give her a little pinch on the back of the neck and hiss at her this is the behavior that a pack leader of dogs would display to signify to a junior pack member that it's behavior is inappropriate and as the owner of the dog you are her pack leader then ignore her as though it was that behavior that got you disinterested in her dogs pick up on so many different kinds of energy that we don't even realize we are putting out she'll know that it was her inappropriate nipping behavior that caused your reaction and since dogs love to please she'll learn to stop biting your ankles to get your attention but please don't hit your dog i know it's frustrating and it may be a natural reaction to swat the dog away just resist the temptation or else the dog may learn from her pack leader that violent aggressive behavior is okay Dog training Housebreaking German Shepherd Dog Dog Cat Hamster Kim Possible Milton H.
