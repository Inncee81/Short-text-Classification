my dog has a rash my dog has had a rash on his stomach and his penis area it doesn't bother him he's had it for years since i've had him i never worried about it because he's in perfect health and it never itches or anything but it has been bugging me lately i was thinking maybe it was the corn in the dog food he was eating so i bought him holistic dog food and treats etc the rash is still there so i got dog food specially formulated for skin irritations etc it's still there the vet said it was from fleas but he has never had fleas i've tried giving him omega caplets doesn't work and he has this medicine i put in soft food daily and the rash is still there should i just stop all there efforts since the rash isn't hurting him what should i do my dog has always had revolution and like i said he has never had fleas i no longer go to that vet she had no idea what she was doing she told me my dog was years old he's only years and months i walked out of there and went some where else the new vet recommend the omega caplets and holistic dog food etc and that did work for a while but never went away and it came back just as bad as it was i guess i should of specified he was on frontline when i first got him that is what he came with when i adopted him then when they was all gone i put him on revolution he eats lamb and rice dog food and occasionally venison or beef dog food only it looks me if thats your dog in the little picture that its semi white and white dogs get sunburned i experienced the same thing it was oner stomach and inside legs and stuff and i thought it was a rash and then i came up with the conclusion that it was sunburn because she likes to sunbathe but even if she doesn't sunbathe she can still get sunburned from reflection from the ground but regular sunscreen or dog sunscreen on when your dog is outside and then put aloe or aloe gell to help it heal at night Sunburn Sunscreen Sunlight Stomach cancer Garfield Fancy rat Ultraviolet Homeopathy Cat Fecal incontinence Characters of Naruto Kodocha Aloe Dog Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atkins Nutritional Approach Flea Omega-3 fatty acid Zinc Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sulfasalazine Vegetarianism Psoriasis Rash Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hamster Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Russian joke Food Punisher Naruto jutsu Chocolate Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jewish cuisine Coeliac disease Swimming Tocopherol Vampire Lyme disease Reservoir Dogs Cuisine of Denmark Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Futurama (TV series - season 4) Livestock Piccolo Junior Saga Hamburger The Smoking Room Invader Zim The X-Files (season 1) Marilyn Monroe RuneScape quests Insulin The Shining (film) Taboo food and drink Diarrhea Pig Rocko's Modern Life Soul food Salad Fingers Aquatic ape hypothesis Slayers Breastfeeding Inception of Darwin's theory Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Kakapo Little Britain Kim Possible Domestic rabbit Comanche MRE Cheese Herpes simplex virus EastEnders Charles Darwin's illness Rosacea Alternative medicine FoxTrot Garlic Year 2000 problem Adjustable gastric band Malignant melanoma Eczema God Emperor of Dune Folic acid Humphrey Bogart Tofu The Death Gate Cycle Reiki The Inside Japanese cuisine Jackass: The Movie Allergy YuYu Hakusho Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Scabies
