owners of american staffordshire terriers are you experienced with whelping puppies i would like to know if anyone has delivered this breed of pups if you are familiar with any common complications associated with this breed my female is starting stage of labor the vet says she is okay but i'd like input from anyone who owns this breed has first hand experience with whelping the pups if any assistance was needed she is approx yrs old this is her first litter she is in excellent health the ultrasound we had early in her pregnancy indicated approx pups i have been familiar with all the emergency signs am prepared to take her to the vet if needed but just looking for comments from people who have gone through this experience we had dachshunds not staffies sorry but still small dogs with litters about the same size sounds like you're doing everything right so far esp keeping your vet informed you probably have a nice sized litter box for her in a quiet location offer her water but not food during delivery be sure she tears off the birthing sac around each puppy after they're delivered if she doesn't then you need to do it for her since this is her first litter she'll be inexperienced but her instincts should kick in she will want to eat each pup's afterbirth and that's ok let her let her lick and clean each puppy then take it from her to weigh it and maybe put an identifying tag on it if they're similarly marked etc replace the puppy in the whelping box so it stays warm and help it find a teat as the birthing progresses she may not want to eat any more afterbirths or grow tired and not tear of any more birthing sacs so you'll have to help her by tearing the thin membrane away or the pup will not be able to breathe good luck and congratulations Dog Childbirth Hamster Cat Pet skunk Dog training Labrador Retriever Mixed-breed dog Breastfeeding Gray Wolf Fancy rat Pregnancy Obstetrics Domestic rabbit Breech birth Dobermann Golden Retriever Pit bull Ferret Abortion Spider Skinny Puppy Shetland Sheepdog Red Fox Amniotic sac Pete the Pup Nintendogs Housebreaking Urinary incontinence Dachshund Diabetes mellitus West Highland White Terrier Boston Terrier Insulin House Mouse Staffordshire Bull Terrier Docking American Kennel Club Miscarriage Equine conformation Dog breeding Placenta Garfield Dairy Birth weight Shark B-47 Stratojet Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) German Shepherd Dog Oral sex Rottweiler Nest box Liger Havanese Socialization Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Premature birth Sea Otter Border Terrier Elephant Cephalic disorder Great Dane Crate training Democratic Party (United States) Australian Silky Terrier Kakapo Comanche Prenatal diagnosis Anemia Baseball Rabies Red Squirrel Traumatic brain injury Characters of Naruto Tenterfield Terrier Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog agility Breed registry Bull Terrier Domestication Drowning Bulldog Jack Russell Terrier Working dog Yorkshire Terrier Brian Griffin Dialysis Animal testing Foodborne illness Coyote Maine Coon Beethoven (film) Greyhound Tigon
