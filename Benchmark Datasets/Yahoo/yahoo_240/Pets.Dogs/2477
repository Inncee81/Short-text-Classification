i'm just curious my friend has a little female beagle dog she's a pretty small little doggy one day my friend told me her dog opal wanted puppies rele badly because she had a faulse pregnancy there's this really big german sheperd dog that lives on their street and my friend was afraid that opal would try to have puppies with it she says the puppies would be too big for her stomach because the dog was a german sheperd if a little beagle and a german sheperd did have puppies the mom being the beagle would the puppies be too big for the mom's stomach and hurt her i don't think so but my friend does sooo i'm just curious letting the beagle have puppies with the german shepherd would most likely kill her i suggest getting her spayed so she never gets pregnant for her own good it will also save her from pyometra cancers and other deadly problems call a shelter near you and they can usually give you numbers for places that will spay her very inexpensively Cat Snoopy Nintendogs Mixed-breed dog Socialization Shaggy dog story Clifford's Puppy Days Marilyn Monroe German Shepherd Dog Kodocha Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Puppy mill Tag Guinea pig Dobermann The Voyage of the Beagle Tupac Shakur Gerald Durrell Snoop Dogg RuneScape quests Pet skunk Kim Possible Sterilization (surgical procedure) Kurt Cobain Dog training Recurring South Park characters Belgian Shepherd Dog Stomach cancer Rocko's Modern Life Charles Darwin's illness Great Dane Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eddie Guerrero Paranoia Agent Beagle Labrador Retriever The Ashlee Simpson Show Publication of Darwin's theory Charles Darwin Sex and the City Reservoir Dogs Lady and the Tramp Brian Griffin Vegeta Daz Dillinger Clancy Wiggum One Life to Live Ferret Domestic rabbit Pet store Black Pete Joke Woodstock (Peanuts) Jam (TV series) Homerpalooza 101 Dalmatians: The Series The Time Machine Development of Darwin's theory Skinny Puppy The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Girly Friends Tocopherol Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Pregnancy The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Docking Animal testing Dog breed The Fox and the Hound One Tree Hill (TV series) Treehouse of Horror V Charmed Night (book) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Porthos (Star Trek) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Inside The Fairly OddParents Clifford the Big Red Dog Shrek 2 Tobacco smoking Ayyavazhi mythology Abe Reles Garfield The Smoking Room Leo Wyatt Beagle 2 Charles Manson Breastfeeding The Catcher in the Rye Futurama (TV series - season 1) Darwin from Orchids to Variation Lauren Bacall Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)
