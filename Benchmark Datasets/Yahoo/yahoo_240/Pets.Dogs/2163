if an unleashed dog attacks a leashed dog how could the owner of the leashed dog be held responsible my cousin was out walking her year old pitbull on a leash when out of nowhere this dalmatian comes flying at them from across the street unleashed the owner of the dalmatian was out there and was trying to call the dog back but it kept coming at my cousin and her pit well needless to say the pitbull went into fight protection mode and took a chunk out of the dalmatian while my cousin was still holding him on the leash now this nitwit dalmatian owner has the gall to want my cousin to pay for her dog's vet bill and is talking about suing her if she doesn't is she insane why should my cousin be responsible for another person's dog getting injured trying to attack her and her leashed dog does this woman really have a case against my cousin or is she the complete nut i think she is she hasn't got a legal leg to stand on and she's lucky your cousin doesn't sue her the owner of an unleashed dog who attacks a person or another leashed animal will certainly be held liable i don't think your cousin has anything to worry about as long as all her dogs shots are up to date and she has a license for the dog she will be fine the pitbull was just protecting your cousin and that's what he is supposed to do in a situation like that i read anne b's answer down below and she is totally wrong how can the pit be out of control if it's walking down the street on a leash with it's owner and another dog tries to attack them the pit had the right to defend itself and it's owner just like if you were walking down the street and a mugger ran up to you and tried to rob you and beat you up you have a right to defend yourself from that mugger should you be held responsible if you happen to break that mugger's arm of course not by all accounts she didn't let the pitbull go and they didn't meet in the middle of the street the dalmation ran up to them and tried to attack them so what is the pit supposed to do stand there and do nothing while it's owner is getting bit that's highly unlikely for a dog like a pit rott german shepherd doberman etc these dogs have very protective instincts and he did exactly what he should've done remember this whole thing would have never happened if the dalmation had been on a leash anne b is way off base in my opinion i think people tend to side with the dalmation just because of the pitbulls bad rep and that's totally wrong i can tell just by the sarcasm used when she is describing the crazy as she put it dalmation that she is biased and blames the pitbull just because it's a dalmation doesn't mean it's not capable of biting or attacking any dog is when it's not raised or socialized properly Dog training Dog Theory of conduct Pit bull Obedience training Social rule Dobermann Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Plame affair Public domain Little Britain German Shepherd Dog Aerial (dance move) ECW One Night Stand Volleyball Futurama (TV series - season 5) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Vegeta Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Marshall Mathers LP Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Hip hop rivalries Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling throws True Crime: Streets of LA Friends American Pit Bull Terrier Contract Battle of the Bulge Tenshinhan Pitaten Nintendogs Pet skunk Insanity defense Milton H.
