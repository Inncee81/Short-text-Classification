any suggestions on how to regulate a week old puppy's bowel movements she seems to be having too many she eats wellness puppy super mix according to directions on the product package she is fed twice a day early morning and late afternoon no other food i take her in the backyard often to potty she has bowel movements frequently during the day i'm not sure whether the problem is that i am taking her outside too frequently or whether this is not a good food for her how often should a five month old puppy need to eliminate another concern is that she has always been able to hold her bladder a very long time she has water available at all times it could be a few things if a dog is fed a good quality easily digestible food they will eliminate minimally i mean like you feed them once in the morning and about half an hour later they will poop then you feed them once in the afternoon and about half an hour later they will poop it could also be that your dog metabolizes food slowly therefore only eliminating bits at a time frequent exercise and a healthy diet could help this it could also be a territorial thing she keeps bits in to drop on each visit out to place her scent with each trip i can't imagine that taking her out frequently would be a bad thing at all but it may be confusing her and making her think that she is expected to eliminate on each venture out i have no experience with the food you are using so i can't tell you much about that you could always phone your vet and ask what they think you can never ask too many questions and there are no dumb questions Housebreaking Guinea pig Dog Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Ron and Fez Nutrition Television in the United States Fecal incontinence Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Domestic rabbit Crohn's disease Diarrhea Dietary fiber Famine Hamster Bread Thermoregulation Coeliac disease Socialization Super Size Me Coprophagia Vitamin C Chocolate Stomach cancer Little Britain The Wack Pack Livestock Glycogen storage disease type I Medical prescription Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol Ferret Obesity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2005 Atlantic hurricane season South Beach diet Ulcerative colitis WEWS-TV Sugar substitute 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Garfield Irritable bowel syndrome Gastroparesis Water Organic farming Colorectal cancer Raw food diet Ekadasi Agriculture Social rule Capercaillie Flatulence Mountaineering Dairy USS America (CV-66) Cat Shit Food Veganism STS-62 Animal communication Anorexia nervosa Fasting Mixed-breed dog Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Soap opera Multiple sclerosis Shaggy dog story Chicken Basset Hound Shark Pig (zodiac) Alcoholic beverage Human height Alcohol fuel Infantilism Dehydration Dog food Diseases of the honeybee 101 Dalmatians: The Series Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Animal testing DDT Orca USS Waters (DD-115) Sewage treatment Chlorpromazine Feces Local food
