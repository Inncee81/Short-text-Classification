would getting a fourth dog make me the 'dog' lady my husband and i currently have three boys one is a weimaraner named cash and we have two chihuahua's named teddy and rocco my husband is deployed and i am seriously thinking about adding a female addition to the family i'm way outnumbered in my house our breeders say that female weims get along really well with males as long as they are all spayed and neutered well all three of my boys are already fixed so i think it will work out is four dogs too many we have a large fenced in back yard and a large home but does four just sound insane i love these dogs like they are my kids please do not respond with hurtful hateful comments i know four is a lot i am looking for responses from people who know or who have that many pets please keep the negative comments to a minimum thank ya'll answers to some questions asked i work hours a day and i pay the neighborhood kids to play with the boys during the day when my husband isn't deployed we tag team when he's working i'm home and vice versa i want to say thank you to everyone for their honest and positive responses and havin dogs makes you the ultimate animal lover nothing wrong with that thank ya'll again ah i love you people all these answers are just perfect and yes my chihuahua's are snobs sometimes but they try to play with the weimaraner he is just getting so big and he thinks he's as small as they are and he can't play under the couch so he gets frustrated sometimes i really want to get him an 'equal' so he can rough house with someone other than me and i'm handling three boys alone while my husband is deployed so i don't think adding another would be that difficult thank you all for your opinions any suggestions on a name for a girl thanks it took getting the fifth dog to earn me the title dog lady usually prefaced with crazy seriously it sounds like you are a responsible pet owner and could easily handle another one dogs are pack animals and most like having friends around to play with i think cash would love having a friend i don't know about your chihuahuas but mine are snobs they prefer their own kind that's why i had to get another shih tzu the chis ignored the first one and hurt her feelings something awful good luck and blessings to you your husband and all the fur kids Dog Ferret Shaggy dog story Cat Domestic rabbit Kodocha Pet Sounds Poker jargon Microeconomics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Pitaten Ed, Edd n Eddy Game show Hamster Weimaraner The Price Is Right Plame affair Pet skunk EastEnders Care Bears Housebreaking Eddie Guerrero Blonde on Blonde The Adventures of Pete & Pete Treehouse of Horror V Ren and Stimpy Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Fairly OddParents Nintendogs Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Rent (musical) Dog training Good Morning, Vietnam The Joker's Wild The Catcher in the Rye AFI 100 Years series Little Britain Maison Ikkoku The Shining (film) Peanuts Jon Secada Trailer Park Boys Jeopardy!
