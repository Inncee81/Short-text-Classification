how do you interpret teasing a dog examples recently i came across an advice saying teasing a dog is no good since i am a native chinese speaker and my english is improving i don t know for sure what it means could you please give me some examples to help understand so i make sure to do everything right when playing with my golden and pom thanks deliberately doing things that are going to make the dog agitated or upset most teasing involves frustrating the dog making him mad when he's not in a position to do anything about it making them bark from the other side of their fence offering a toy but then snatching it away poking them throwing pebbles at them even making barking growling noises in their faces all count some dogs are more mellow than others a golden will put up with a lot most poms no they're edgier to begin with and it might not take much to get them yelling and lunging at the sides of their pen it is also almost impossible for a dog's owner to actually tease him unless he has a sadistic owner your dogs understand you and are used to your body language sounds and style of play they are much less likely to take offense at anything you do just don't try the same things around a strange dog Dog training Dog Reservoir Dogs Koan Shit English grammar New Zealand English Shaggy dog story Chinglish Obedience training Non-native pronunciations of English Stuttering Housebreaking Hungarian language Japanese tea ceremony RuneScape quests Morphology (linguistics) Pomeranian (dog) Philosophy of language Social rule Hiberno-English Hearing impairment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Euphemism Cat Toilet humour Tag Humphrey Bogart Chinese language Bark (dog) Dog agility Mad Money The Apprentice 2 German grammar Carl Barks Discordianism Theory of conduct Backward message Goodness and value theory Kim Possible Tai shogi Bart chalkboard gags Milton H.
