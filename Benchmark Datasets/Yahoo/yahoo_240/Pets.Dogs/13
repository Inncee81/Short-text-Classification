how long is a stsffordshire bull terrier pregnant for and when do you know she in early stage's of labour she is month's old and a small short legged type of the breed the stud a family friend's dog is quite alot bigger than her and come's from the cassinova blood line so is a very good example of the true stafford breed they are a match in body shape but no where near in size i know stafford's have trouble giving birth due to the large head's and small pevis's what sign's do i need to look out for to say that she's having trouble i've cheeked her tempurature and it keep's fluctuating between 'c and 'c she's had small amount's of a thick creamy coloured discharge and the puppie's look to have droped i know she's expecting puppie's min because she had a scan the dog's spent a week together but i only witnesed the mating on the last day of them being together which if that's the only time they did it would make her about day's early at the least i think should i be worried can any one give me some advice she also is restless and keep's taking herself in the dinning room i am not stupid she is well nown at my vet's and was given a full bill of helth before hand the perfect time for staffordshire bull terries to have there first litter is after month's of age my family has breed them for many year's i have been told read book's and resurched lot's of different thing's and all the answer's i get are conflicting the vet's say she should be fine and know the shire as well so before you judge me make sure you know the breed yourself the member's of my family who breed stafford's arn't avlable to help me at the mo due to the fact that my five year old brother has cancer they fore meaning they've got more important thing's on thier mind's i was asking for a bit of friendly advice as back up or conformation of what i already knew thank you to those of you who were polite enough to offer advice and not just insult me or say people like me don't deserve animal's i get so many complement's on how nice she is and how well behaved she is the average gestational period for a dog is days what you need to watch for is a lot of panting pacing no appetite she has probably chosen the dining room as the place she feels the most compfortable and wants to have her pups there get her a box of some sort and line it with a blanket or a couple of towels if you notice her in labor and no puppies yet for longer than hours i would suggest getting her to a vet cause she may be in trouble just because the male is bigger than her doesn't mean the puppies will be too big to deliver after all they are the same breed on a side note to all of you who answered already i think that you are all very rude whats done is done what she needs now is advice on how to handle the situation not to be picked on from a bunch of people who think they know it all advice not torture Dog Guinea pig Social rule Breastfeeding Dog training Hamster Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Gray Wolf Staffordshire Bull Terrier Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy American Pit Bull Terrier Kender Kodocha Dobermann Garfield Humphrey Bogart Breed standard Pit bull Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eddie Guerrero Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Elephant Jack Russell Terrier Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma God Emperor of Dune The Catcher in the Rye Stomach cancer Childbirth Breed registry Fancy rat Havanese Cat Norway national football team South Park Docking Beavis and Butt-head The Inside 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Mattress John Kerr Little Britain Friends The Contender (television series) Characters in the Smurfs One Tree Hill (TV series) Dog breeding RuneScape quests Kurt Cobain Shark Abortion debate Craps Textile manufacturing Dog breed Married... with Children Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Skye Terrier Joke Big Brother UK series 6 Ferret The nature of God in Western theology Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Chinglish Extreme Programming Griffon Bruxellois Dairy cattle Ocean's Twelve Singlish Goofy Professional wrestling match types Sharon Tate Jumpstart 3rd Grade Puberty Bull Terrier Mad Money Menstrual cycle Socialization Ron and Fez Milton H.
