my month old schnoodle schnauzer poodle has a lump on his side any idea what i should do it feels like a muscle or a lump of fat it does not seem to bother him if i touch it or squeeze it i will be going to the vet in three weeks anyway for a few shots but i don't want to wait that long if it is something serious has anyone had a pet with something similar my suggestion is for you to call your vet if they think it needs be seen about then you should schedule an appointment before then most likely it won't be anything but it is best that it is seen about well i hope that your dog has a good report when it comes home form the vet d Ferret Miniature Schnauzer Nintendogs Garfield Pet skunk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Guinea pig Breast cancer Dog training Dog Urinary incontinence Poodle Fancy rat Poodle hybrids Weight training Housebreaking Veterinarian Microchip implant (animal) Journey (band) Pet Sounds Blue Peter Game show The Far Side Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Saturday Night Live Socialization Jennifer Lopez Obesity Puberty Philadelphia Eagles Prostate cancer Soham murders Vietnam Veterans Against the War Tina Turner Crew Exploration Vehicle Gulf War syndrome Trigeminal nerve Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Doris Day Sin City Robert Falcon Scott Tocopherol Philadelphia Phillies Rabies 1957 World Series EastEnders Traumatic incident reduction Hamster Lung cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Squeeze Obedience training The Pet Sounds Sessions Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Avril Lavigne Milton H.
