what to do with a biting protective and dominant dog i have a rottwieler lab mix that is about years old who i have had since he was a pup he is always very loving and obedient to me we have tried having room mates live with us but have found that this dog pepe will constantly watch the room mates and will bark and sometimes bite if he is approached we had hoped that he would get to know the roommates and settle down no luck here after months this dog has not changed one bit this situation is particularly aggravated when the room mates try to walk to the bathroom which is right next to my door this is where biting episodes are most likely to occur pepe's behavior also seems to get my other dogs excited and barking as well pepe has recently also began to disobey and bite my girlfriend when she corrects him pepe is a sweet dog to me but to very few others i hate to bring him to the pound as i am sure they will put him down is there anything i can do to fix this could he be trained as someone's guard dog if he's not neutered get it done i would sign up for obedience lessons and i highly recommend nilif nothing in life is free i'll add links do not take his paws flip him grab his throat and stare like someone mentioned he's already acting out when he feels threatened you'll only be giving him reason to protect and assert himself more nilif http k deb com nilif htm http www hsus org pets pet care our pets for life program dog behavior tip sheets basic training techniques html other good links http www k aggression com aggression aggression main html http www caninechronicle com features misc agression html http www gsdhelpline com alpha htm http www gentleguidance dogs com dominance vs leadership htm Dog Dog training Cat Gray Wolf Garfield Hamster Guinea pig HyperText Transfer Protocol Obedience training Pet skunk Ferret Housebreaking German Shepherd Dog Keeshond Wget World Wide Web Dog agility Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) HTML Common Unix Printing System Shaggy dog story Schutzhund Pep__ Le Pew Bah__'__ divisions Friends XHTML Kim Possible American Pit Bull Terrier Babe Ruth Haven (TNG episode) Brown Bear RuneScape quests Mozilla Firefox The Shining (film) Undergrads Cross site scripting Socialization Dobermann Care Bears Philip J.
