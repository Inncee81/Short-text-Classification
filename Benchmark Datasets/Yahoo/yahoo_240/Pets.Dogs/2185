do any california beaches allow dogs to walk on the beach i want to take my dog to the beach when i go down to la next week but i've heard that some places like the santa monica beach and pier don't allow dogs to walk on the beach are there any beaches that do allow dogs to walk around i'm obviously not from the area so i want some info thanks yes there's an off leash dog beach in huntington and in long beach both in orange county there is also a dog beach in san diego this one is even farther but i think it's better because the beach itself is farther from the highway therefore it's safer for off leash dogs most beaches allow dogs on the boardwalk but not on the sand surf there are a few beaches that don't really enforce any policy on dogs but i don't frequent beaches enough to remember which ones they're mostly small local beaches that only the locals know about Southern California Huntington Beach, California Los Angeles County, California California State Route 1 Orange County, California Interstate 405 (California) Seal Beach, California Venice, Los Angeles, California Santa Cruz, California Greater Los Angeles Area Santa Monica, California Pier Surfing Smoking ban Newport Beach, California Long Beach, California San Clemente, California San Luis Obispo County, California Santa Ana Freeway Orange, California Transportation of Los Angeles Ocean Beach, New York Music of California Southern California freeways Inland Empire (California) Pacific Electric Railway San Diego, California Redondo Beach, California Laguna Beach, California Manhattan Beach, California California State Route 22 Santa Monica Mountains Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk Dog training Boardwalk Beach California Atlantic City, New Jersey Goleta, California Oxnard, California Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority San Francisco, California Obedience training The Beach Boys Beaches of Hong Kong San Diego County, California San Andreas (state) USS Woodbury (DD-309) Coney Island California State Route 91 USS Sands (DD-243) Burning Man Little Saigon Oceanside, California Sonoma County, California Santa Monica Freeway Los Angeles Times Bude Beach volleyball Bradley Nowell Gaviota State Park U.S. Highway 6 Los Angeles, California Disney's California Adventure Interstate 605 Saks Fifth Avenue Rowland Heights, California USS Alamo San Bernardino Freeway Interstate 710 Santa Barbara, California Nudism Pacific Beach USS Walke (DD-723) Virginia Beach, Virginia U.S. Highway 66 Interstate 105 (California) Pensacola, Florida San Gabriel Valley Robinsons-May Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005) California State Route 39 Kitesurfing Metro Detroit Florida State Road A1A Mission Beach, California Interstate 5 Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys History of Santa Monica, California Rio de Janeiro U.S. Highway 91 South Hampton Roads Signal Hill, California Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Dorset West Los Angeles (region) Port of Los Angeles U.S. Highway 101
