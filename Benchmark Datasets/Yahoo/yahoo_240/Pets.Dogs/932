new puppy and a jealous older dog hi everybody i just brought home a new blue merle pomeranian puppy who is only two months old i currently have an year old lab named honey honey is okay around other dogs and that's about it we never considered buying a another dog until one day we found an abandoned yorkie in the back yard that we decided to keep unfortunately we found the yorkie too late and she died shortly after anyways honey was just fine and didn't seem to mind her after she died that's when we decided we'd buy a puppy the puppy is all about play play play and sometimes when he messes with honey too much she'll grunt or growel at him honey doesn't like him or hate him she just tolerates him i'm really disappointed because i thought everything would work out better i'm hoping this is just a phase for honey because she's not used to living with a puppy and when the puppy gets older she'll get used to him and everything will be okay what do you think and or suggest i should do i think that they will eventually get along i would try to take them to a neutral territory and see if they will play better in a neutral area before placing them back in the hous where the lab has been the established master i am having a hard time with a mamma dog doing the same way to her month old puppy she is getting better but the puppy keeps chewing on her ear i had to take them to a neutral area and show them how to play right before she would accept the puppy in the outside pen with her good luck Skinny Puppy Dog training Dog Housebreaking Shetland Sheepdog Labrador Retriever Characters in the Smurfs Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Beethoven (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Docking Mixed-breed dog Vegeta The Critic Futurama (TV series - season 5) Golden Retriever Honey and Clover Claude L__vi-Strauss Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Nintendogs Neighbours The Death Gate Cycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule EastEnders Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde Pitaten Fancy rat German Shepherd Dog Yorkshire Terrier Bob and George Eddie Guerrero Reservoir Dogs Breed standard Viva La Bam Ranma __ characters Philip J.
