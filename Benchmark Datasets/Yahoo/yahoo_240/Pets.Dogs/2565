otc de wormoer pitbull puppy hi i just bought a new puppy she is a pit bull and is weeks old i know this is young but i am such a sucker for abused animals i think the guys i bought it from fights his dogs because one of the adult dogs had a big scar on the side of his cheek and there were flies all over it but thats a whole different story well i've just had her since yesterday and she was infested in fleas i went and bought some frontline she seems to be losing most of the fleas but one thing that concerns me is that she draggs her but on the ground and she cant seem to get comfortable anywhere she sits im thinking this is worms well i just called the vets office and they told me he wasnt there and wont be back until monday will she be okay to wait this long before she goes to the vet or should i go and buy some otc de wormer from wal mart or something i havnt seen anything in her poop either it looks pretty normal to me are otc de wormers safe for puppies oh and also i live in a small town and he is the only vet here but we are going to a bigger town today to wal mart and i was wondering if i should buy some deworming stuff there do not use otc flea products or otc dewormers these aren't effective and they can also be very very dangerous it will be fine to wait until monday to see the vet and get the proper dewormer take in a stool sample so they can do a fecal test on it and determine what if any type s of worms he has also do not use a flea product on a puppy this young wait until she is older frontline is safe for puppies weeks and older weeks is too young and is against the law in most states however i do understand your reasons for taking him this young make sure he does not get any vaccinations until he is weeks old Pet skunk Dog training Socialization Housebreaking Wal-Mart Docking Garfield Rabies Prostate cancer Tobacco Mercury (element) Ascariasis Shaggy dog story Cancer AFI 100 Years series Coprophagia Time Out of Mind American Pit Bull Terrier Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Insulin Feces Red Hot Chili Peppers Sin City Flea Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog collar Mixed-breed dog Ferret Spidey Super Stories Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Livestock Blood on the Tracks Aerial (dance move) Skinny Puppy Animal testing Buttocks Tiny Toon Adventures Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 101 Dalmatians: The Series Baylisascaris Futurama (TV series - season 5) Family Guy The Inside Public health The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pit bull Humphrey Bogart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fair use Stomach cancer Lady and the Tramp StarCraft Secret Missions Randomness Ocean's Twelve Ben Johnson (athlete) Girly Futurama (TV series - season 3) Tooth enamel Lisa the Vegetarian Hamster Bull Terrier Pneumonia Syphon Filter 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Philadelphia Eagles Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Crate training Anchor I Want to Hold Your Hand Bike lane debate National Lampoon's Animal House Professional wrestling throws Infantilism Hey Jude Killian documents Tag The Apprentice 2 Homestar Runner German Shepherd Dog Rugrats Professional wrestling attacks Soap opera GunBound Guinea pig Sailing Bat Boy Autism Dracunculiasis John F.
