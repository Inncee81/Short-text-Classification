what larger breed dog would my schnauzer get along with best my wife and i have a mo old schnauzer she is a very sweet puppy but has had a tough time adjusting around other dogs she seems to respond best to larger dogs with larger dogs she is not so aggressive we'd like to get her a companion and friend but we are unsure which breed would be best any suggestions like the bernese mt dog and the st bernard the great pyrenees is a wonderful large breed dog that is calm and could be an excellent mate to your dog another good idea is the newfoundland schnauzers are wired high energy dogs if you want two high energy dogs you might try a lab but two wired dogs might be a bit too much for your family the calmness of the others can be a good offset to the energy of the schnauzer the dogs will play fight and all the breeds above are large dogs since your current dog is female get a male for your nd dog neuter both dogs she will be alpha till the large breed dog outgrows her and they will work this all out it's very entertaining as well as great for the dog to have a doggie playmate in the home Dog Labrador Retriever Newfoundland (dog) Nintendogs Dog breed Ferret Dog training American Pit Bull Terrier Working dog Domestic rabbit Pit bull Hamster St. Bernard (dog) Standard Schnauzer Golden Retriever Gray Wolf Terrier Fancy rat Lion Mastiff Cat Housebreaking Great Dane Pyrenean Mountain Dog Artificial selection Rottweiler German Shepherd Dog Dog agility God Emperor of Dune Shetland Sheepdog Komondor Pet skunk Livestock West Highland White Terrier Border Collie Loudspeaker Spitz Breed registry Border Terrier Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Chesapeake Bay Retriever Havanese Dog breeding Australian Shepherd Keeshond American Eskimo Dog Alaskan husky American Kennel Club Dingo Dog show Rat Terrier Irish Wolfhound Mixed-breed dog Companion dog Basset Hound Transformer Dobermann Socialization Argentine Dogo American Staghound Akita Inu Pack (canine) Circuit breaker Korea Jindo Dog Bernese Mountain Dog Crufts Breed standard Fox hunting American lobster Yorkshire Terrier Schutzhund Platypus Puma Spider Selective breeding Nuclear fusion Dog fighting Jack Russell Terrier Puppy mill Working animal Smooth Collie Reservoir Dogs Docking Colonization of the Moon Breed-specific legislation Tasmanian Devil Horse Skye Terrier Solar cell Resident Evil (video game) Equine conformation Kakapo Guinea pig Tosa (dog) Weimaraner German Shorthaired Pointer Shar Pei Late Night with Conan O'Brien
