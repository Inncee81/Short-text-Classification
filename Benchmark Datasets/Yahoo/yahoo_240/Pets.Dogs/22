dog breeding question cockerdoodle so if a cocker spaniel and poodle breed you have a cockerdoodle now if a cockerdoodle and a cockerdoodle breed do we no longer need the cocker spaniel and poodle or do only cockerdoodles come from the original mix of the two spaniel and poodle i'm not breeding cockerdoodles or cockerpoos or whatever i'm just curious if a cockerdoodle and a cockerdoodle breed you get a cockerdoodle if you breed a poodle and a cocker you get a cockerdoodle any dog is a mix of his parents no matter what you call them some kennel clubs name some breeds or families of dogs a certain name and choose to recognize them some don't it is irrelevant whether they do or not all of the breeds we see today came from just mixing different dog families you can call it whatever you want and it is just as valid as any other dog dog dna is dog dna not a one is really better than any other or more valid than any other a breed is just a specific family of dogs bred together over and over and over through many years until they establish a certain set of characteristics it isn't a great idea to mix a cocker spaniel and a poodle both breeds are high energy and nippy it would be a cute dog but the temperament would be very active and prone to nippiness you try to mix calm dog with a breed that is extremely active over the last years the cockerspaniel breed has really suffered from poor breeding and temperament problems i would never mix that with a high energy poodle Mixed-breed dog Dog Poodle Cockapoo American Cocker Spaniel Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Toy dog Spaniel English Springer Spaniel Golden Retriever German Shepherd Dog Dachshund Welsh Springer Spaniel Poodle hybrids Maltese (dog) Basset Hound Beagle Selective breeding Irish Water Spaniel Shetland Sheepdog American Pit Bull Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Dog show Keeshond Dog breed Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever Labrador Retriever Pekingese Pit bull Breed registry American Kennel Club Great Dane Havanese Tibetan Spaniel American Eskimo Dog Akita Inu Rat Terrier Airedale Terrier Greyhound Dog breeding Staffordshire Bull Terrier Pug Newfoundland (dog) English Setter Whippet Border Terrier Alaskan husky United Kennel Club Siberian Husky Species Ferret Bulldog Cat Australian Cattle Dog Boston Terrier Docking German Shorthaired Pointer Schutzhund Alaskan Malamute Domestication Irish Setter Shih Tzu Brittany (dog) Medieval hunting Weimaraner Australian Kelpie Appaloosa Breed standard Chihuahua (dog) Smooth Collie Dog agility Japanese Chin Breed club Chow Chow Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Dingo Lady and the Tramp Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Australian Shepherd Fancy rat Companion dog Shiba Inu Eugenics Iditarod Portuguese Water Dog Griffon Bruxellois Guide dog Pomeranian (dog) Livestock Pudelpointer
