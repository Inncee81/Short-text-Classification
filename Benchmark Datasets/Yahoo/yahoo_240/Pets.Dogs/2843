yes or no to getting a dog if you worked hours a week went to school two nights of the week lived in a bedroom apartment with a x backyard lived down the street from a park right across the street from a college with a big open grass field was willing to spend all your free time with the dog walk it when you went running it ran with you if money was tight but you could afford it i'm thinking about getting a german shepherd i want a best friend with four legs and a tail a dog thats loyal and will never leave my side not to mention good with people thanks to you guys and gals who responed with an excellent and thought out answer d i like what you said about owners who have got in over their heads i've been known to do that from time to time opened my eyes a little bit with that one and now that i think about how busy i am right now i know that i am only going to get busier this time next year with the police academy coming up i'll wait til i'm done with school and have entered my career field before getting a dog thanks again to those who answered trish i would love to be in the k unit and that's what i'm shooting for now that i think about it thanks that's a pretty small place for a german shepherd you also are gone a lot why not spend all that free time you mention volunteering at the animal shelter first walk those dogs every night except class night then you can see how much 'free time' you really have and how much is required to care for a dog not to mention how much it costs try out your self discipline first before using it on a live being you want a dog that will never leave my side but you won't be around him you work hours a week and do class as well just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should this may not be the right time for you to adopt a dog finances play a big part as well can you afford office visits to the vet teeth cleanings and immunizations what if something happens dogs can get hit by cars and remember the recent pet food scare many people had to rush their dog to the vet for hospitalization just days approx and the animals still died what if your dog comes down with kidney failure or cancer it can happen not all dogs that get ill are old dogs will you be going back to school full time getting married getting a roommate potential allergies having a baby getting a new job losing your current job getting new furniture having a problem with your landlord because of the noise and barking etc there are many people who use these excuses to dump dogs that they no longer want to make the effort for because they got in over their head all this has to be taken into consideration if you are a responsible person remember your first concern should be what is in the best interest of the dog he or she has no voice to speak on his her behalf so it needs to be a good 'fit' for all concerned Dog German Shepherd Dog Garfield Cat EastEnders Avenue Q Fancy rat Social rule Kodocha Sin City Time Out of Mind Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Francis Bacon (painter) Philip J.
