what is the best way to train my week old bull dog puppy i would like to keep him from peeing on the rug but not putting him in a cage you can utilize a crate or kennel cab getting one with a divider so it is smaller while your dog is a put but then allows for growth by removing the divider the cab space should be not much bigger than just enough room to stand up in and turn around in don't put anything on the bottom of it no pee pads blankets towels etc that will encourage him to pee in there very important don't overuse the kennel or your dog will just go in there and it will be a bad experience for your dog realize that at this age the pup needs to go out at least every two hrs then right before you go to bed probably once or twice in the night and first thing in the morning if you want to train him successfully a pup can only hold their bladder for about an hr per month of age but they won't even hold it an hr without training be as consistent as possible with feeding playing kenneling playing and more playing potty breaks as soon as coming out of the kennel and just before going back in when you have the pup out playing and he starts to sniff the carpet and or circle pick him up quick and take him out to an area in your yard or outside where you want him to go and say take a break take him on a leash and circle him until he goes then praise him when he does go where he is supposed to you can get some little training treats to reward him with too if you are consistent with this he will train quickly but it wouldn't be unusual to have a few accidents after he seems to have learned just redirect and take him right outside even if he has gone and tell him to take a break then praise when he squeezes out a few drops or acts like it you can clean the soiled area by pouring warm water mixed with distilled vinegar from center of soiled spot until it goes just beyond then tamp that up real good after it sits a few minutes follow this treatment by spraying some resolve tough stain carpet cleaner on the same area brushing it in then after a few minutes tamping it up with paper towerls or rags puppies take time to train expect a few months of consisten training before the pup will be potty trained and expect a few accidents up until five mos old as a possibility kenneling is not caging if you use it appropriately and the kennel will feel safe and den like to the pup i used a kennel cab to train all three of my dogs and i keep it open for my dogs one of them has claimed it as her personal den to nap in sometimes all three are great to leave at home access to the whole house and i don't have to worry about anything being destroyed or any accidents Dog training Obedience training Housebreaking Crate training Scooby-Doo Dog agility Toilet humour Dog 1957 World Series Hamster Guinea pig Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Ron and Fez Urinary incontinence Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Menstrual cup Shark Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Customs and etiquette of Japan Social rule Saturday Night Live Dog show Gray Wolf Sin City Eddie Guerrero Shetland Sheepdog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an American Pit Bull Terrier Humphrey Bogart Mixed martial arts Utilitarianism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist New York Giants Mattress Our Gang Milton H.
