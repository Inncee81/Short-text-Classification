the vet convinced me not to neuter my puppy is he right i made an appointment for my six month old male chihuahua to get neutered while i was in the waiting room the vet gave me a copy of an article about the pros and cons of neutering a small breed dog the article focused more on the cons i didn't understand why the vet was trying to tell me i thought that neutering was a must the vet then tells me that it's up to me if i want to get him neutered but that the health benifits are not significant he said that there is only a very small chance that my dog could get prostate cancer later in life if he is not neutered on the other hand the vet said that it is a very good idea to spay a female dog due to avoiding major health problems like breast cancer he said that the probability of my dog getting another dog pregnant is very small as well my major concern was that my dog didn't father any puppies he gave a few reasons for this so i left without neutering my dog and the vet didn't charge me for the visit he is totally wrong get your dog nuetered it's only responible i you are not going to breed or show get him fixed it's the right thing to do Dog Ferret Housebreaking Domestic rabbit Prostate cancer Pet skunk Spanish pronouns God and gender Cancer Socialization Guinea pig Castration EastEnders Dog breed Sterilization (surgical procedure) Cat Garfield Great Dane The Price Is Right Mixed-breed dog Docking Randomness Dog training Manx (cat) Neighbours Abortion Dobermann Pretty Good Privacy Fancy rat Philosophy of language Extreme Programming Originalism One Tree Hill (TV series) Labrador Retriever Gender Puppy mill Nintendogs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Dog breeding Killian documents Brian Griffin Abortion debate Theory of conduct Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ethics Vulgar Latin Debugging Chihuahua (dog) Dog show Spanish nouns Logic German Shepherd Dog English Springer Spaniel Gender-neutral language U.S. Electoral College Kodocha Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Psychology Shrek 2 Knots Landing Pit bull Hillary Rodham Clinton Poker jargon Social rule Humphrey Bogart Lisp programming language Lazarus Long Ionizing radiation Denis Law Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Tobacco smoking The Apprentice 2 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Past teachings of Prem Rawat Days of our Lives Publicly funded medicine Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Economics Skye Terrier Catalan grammar God Emperor of Dune Aristotle Vegetarianism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Kommissar Rex Ontological argument Skinny Puppy Ocean's Twelve Sick Puppy Animal shelter Breastfeeding Brahman German grammar Wal-Mart
