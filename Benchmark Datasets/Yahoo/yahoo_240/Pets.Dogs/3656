chow chow owners i live in a condo with my mother and we are both looking for a dog since i go to college and my mother works it has to be capable of being alone for a bit after searching we both took fond of the chow chow is this dog obedient aggressive playful my first dog after moving out of my parents house was a chow mix he was a rescue and had been abandoned and left on a city street in the middle of january everybody warned me how aggressive their breed was how they were one person dogs and not all that friendly fortunately i wasn't working for probably the first year year and a half of his life so i had a lot of time to work with him he went everywhere with me and was socialized from day one with all kinds of people and different dogs and he ended up being one of the most loving friendly dogs and loved everybody he met he would step aside from his food bowel and let the other dog the cat and the birds outside finish before he would eat himself he was just that docile before anyone has a fit over letting the birds eat his food we did not let him eat what they had been in it was just funny seeing him step back from the dish for birds but when the other dog was a puppy and was jumping on him constantly and tormenting him he'd finally get to the point where he had enough and would let the other dog know he did it without getting rough with him and it didn't happen very often either for the most part he just ignored the puppy when he started acting up like that i think he just had an unbelievable amount of love and tolerance for every living thing he ever met everyone was right though chows definitely need a lot of work and training but with that training mine ended up being one of the best dogs i've ever had Dog Garfield Piccolo Junior Saga Dog training German Shepherd Dog Domestic rabbit American Pit Bull Terrier Socialization Nestl__ Fancy rat Hamster Maison Ikkoku Working dog Obedience training Cat Taboo food and drink Golden Retriever Taikyoku shogi Trailer Park Boys Dog agility Ferret Dai dai shogi Shaggy dog story Kakapo The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Havanese Kodocha Irish Wolfhound Pet skunk Little Britain Mixed-breed dog Guinea pig 101 Dalmatians: The Series Maka dai dai shogi Basset Hound Rocko's Modern Life Stephen Chow Mahjong "Weird Al" Yankovic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pit bull Rottweiler Swingout RuneScape quests Girly Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
