complications from neutering surgery i adopted a year old cocker spaniel from a local shelter who had a strange complication from his neutering surgery blood drained back into the scrotal area and he had a baseball sized mass hanging between his legs the vet said that this occurs occassionally and that the blood would be reabsorbed back into the body in about days however even with an e collar the dog managed to irritate the area enough to cause it to open up and drain he spent days at the vet on antibiotics and painkillers until he healed the vet could not have been more kind he was very apologetic and charged me only for the meds i'd already paid for the initial surgery innoculations etc and a visit to the er vet in the middle of the night i've shared my journey with some amazing pets over the years all of them altered of course but have never heard of this type of complication i was wondering if anyone here has heard of this before vet techs is this common yup it is common not so much in younger dogs but in older mature dogs most of the time it reabsorbs on it's own but sometimes like in your situation a dog does need treatment from a vet Dog Pneumonia Ferret Domestic rabbit Intersex surgery Traumatic brain injury Cryptorchidism Castration Hip fracture Pet skunk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Mixed-breed dog Cancer Rabies Bone fracture Urinary incontinence Common cold Medicine Multiple sclerosis Varicocele Scar Microchip implant (animal) Cat Stomach cancer Guinea pig Darryl Strawberry Chronic fatigue syndrome Mastoiditis Socialization Local anesthesia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kommissar Rex Prostate cancer Malaria Housebreaking Group A streptococcal infection Stroke Acute respiratory distress syndrome Glaucoma Doctor Emmett Brown Needle aspiration biopsy Nutrition Paget's disease of bone Female genital cutting Penis English Cocker Spaniel Mesothelioma Kidney Punisher Pitaten Animal shelter Veterinarian Abscess Aphasia Chemotherapy Intravenous therapy Acne Phimosis Lung cancer Hypoglycemia Crohn's disease Tooth enamel Malignant melanoma American Cocker Spaniel Professional wrestling match types Equine conformation Gangrene Skin graft Docking Tuberculosis Wound healing phases Fistula Kodocha Babe Ruth Peter Griffin Catholicism Garfield Characters of Naruto Cirrhosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fancy rat Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Sin City Psoriasis History of intersex surgery Radiation therapy Glycogen storage disease type I Bulldog Earring Migraine Hearing impairment Acromegaly Veterans Stadium Otitis externa Metabolic acidosis Menstrual cycle
