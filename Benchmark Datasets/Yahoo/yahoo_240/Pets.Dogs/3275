my chihuahua keeps pushing over his puppy pad my chihuahua months just started this he goes potty on a puppy pad when he can't go outside and he just started to push the pad over with his nose like when animals kick back after using the bathroom but in reverse using his snout to push the pad over is he covering it up or what is he trying to accomplish he usually does go outside to use the bathroom but i still want to train him to use the potty pad because when winter comes he's too small and will get cold really easy i have a coat and a shirt i bought that my vet recomended for the winter but i still would rather not take him out in the winter incase he gets sick those puppy pads sure get roughed up a bit if not shredded by determined pups they have these things at petsmart or petco that you put the pad in so you avoid some pee running off or it getting flipped over etc you lift up the frame put the pad in it and then close the frame again they couldn't be too terribly expensive good luck Dog Dog training Aerial (dance move) Housebreaking Mattress Guinea pig Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Table tennis Professional wrestling holds Gray Wolf Toilet humour Socialization Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nintendogs Crate training Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Skinny Puppy Pittsburgh Steelers Eddie Guerrero Breaststroke Professional wrestling throws Glossary of American football Professional wrestling aerial techniques Electric motor Hamster Upholstery Fancy rat Butterfly stroke Japanese toilet Toilet Bicycle brake systems Piccolo Junior Saga Mouse (computing) Labrador Retriever Shark Swingout Sick Puppy Lindy Basic Equine conformation Rugby union positions American football Ron and Fez Skateboarding trick DDT (professional wrestling) Characters in the Smurfs Customs and etiquette of Japan Euphemism Lawn mower Cruising (maritime) 101 Dalmatians: The Series Tag Powel Crosley Jr. Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Indianapolis 500 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Jackass: The Movie Front crawl Drowning Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Powerbomb Guilty Gear Chair Sailing Winter Bryan Robson The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Drill bit Backstroke Chihuahua (dog) Time Out of Mind Mixed martial arts Car handling Amateur telescope making Comanche Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Gia Carangi Charlie Brown German Shepherd Dog DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Disc brake Gesture Rugby union Tenshinhan StarCraft: Uprising Suplex Endgame Today I am A Clown Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Beethoven (film) Stoat DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Sin City Undergarment Top-bar hive Figure skating Mountain bike Thermoregulation Mars Exploration Rover Satchel Paige
