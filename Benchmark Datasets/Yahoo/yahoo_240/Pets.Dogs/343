ever been in this situation with your dog i need some help tonight i was out in my backyard in the dark with my dogs we live on a golf course but of course it was after dark course is closed dogs are hanging out on patio with me suddenly in the dark a teenage boy goes running by i don't see him but the dogs do i have collies they are the sweetest dogs on earth well they are young dogs so they ran out there barking jumping around not touching the runner i ran after them didn't have time to catch them first cuz it was dark i didn't see him coming anyway the kid started running fast and i called out as i was running if you please stop i can catch them he keeps running then trips on falls apparently scratching himself on the concrete of the cart path minutes later he shows up at my front door with his mom saying my dogs attacked bit him they never touched him my neighbor was out there with me the kid even called me a b tch when i tried to catch the dogs the lady said that they were going to the hospital to get the kid stitches were going to the sheriffs cuz my dogs attacked him i apologized said that my dogs never touched him his shorts were ripped from the fall but i still gave him money to pay for the shorts i am so scared that she is still gonna call the sheriff my dogs are gonna get taken away they never even touched him i am so scared ugh sorry to keep going on on i'm just so sick about this situation do you think that i will get in trouble can they not see that the boy had scratches on his knees from falling not dog bites i have never been in this situation before will they impound my dogs without proof as i said my neighbor was outside with me can verify that my dogs never touched the boy i also show them they are champions so they are very used to being handled by strangers would never hurt anyone thank you all for your support i am literally sick over this whole thing believe me my dogs would never bite anyone they were just bouncing around being excited cuz they thought he wanted to play with them i understand the teen was scared then he tripped on the yardage marker on the cart path that probably hurt cuz i've fallen on concrete myself he his mother were so mean i don't even know why they came to my house i guess to scream at me in person before calling the sheriff i am pretty close to tears here but my husband says that since nothing has ever happened before ie they have never ever gone after or bitten anyone in the past then they don't have a case and we have homeowners insurance in case they try to sue us i just don't want to deal with this i am a responsible dog owner who happened to be out back in the dark with my non biting dogs never thinking a jogger would be on the closed golf course i'm sad to those who mentioned the dr finding bite marks i hope you are right my dogs didn't make any contact with him whatsoever they were just jumping around barking running so there are no bite marks of course i mean i really feel bad wish it hadn't happened that he fell but gosh they didn't push him down he fell and i don't mean to sound mean by saying that but they didn't hurt him or touch him at all he fell thank you all so much for your responses i am still up waiting for the sheriff to show up i have to work tomorrow i will be working from home though so that will give me some time to get their shot records stuff just in case we live in a pretty nice area so i doubt that this lady would want to sue me i am not too concerned about that since i have insurance i am just really concerned about my dogs i will be hysterical if they are taken away it's scary to even own dogs these days cuz even if you have them in your own back yard someone trespasses says that they were bit it is the dog owner's fault everyone please pray for me if you are the praying type i just don't want to be involved in this situation the lady was so enraged i could say nothing to make her happy thanks punk rawk girl obviously you are angry like most punk rockers and you nothing about show dogs because they must be trained to be show dogs my dogs are trained that is what being champions has to do with it i trained them to be socialized obey commands behave stand stay let strangers handle them etc most dogs whether they are trained or not if they like people like mine do they will go toward people my concern was that the mother son are lying saying that my dogs attacked him when they never touched him thanks for your angry words though have a good one from personal experience i know that the doctors can tell a dog bite from some other type of injury a few years ago my chocolate lab lbs jumped on my niece she was and about lbs when he jumped down her face was bleeding profusely we thought he had bitten her but she wasn't talking lots of crying and screaming and no one saw it happen we took her to the emergency room and the doctor stitched her up and said it was probably from his claws when he jumped it was not a bite mark bite marks leave puncture wounds my guess is that kids was doing something he wasn't supposed to and when he got caught he had to tell his mother something just as an after thought you might want to think about leashes or fences try an electric fence if your hoa doesn't allow privacy fences if they are trained on the fence properly the dogs won't leave the yard even when someone is running
