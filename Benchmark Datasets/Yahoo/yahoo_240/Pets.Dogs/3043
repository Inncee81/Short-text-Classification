my puppy loves this nasty chair help i have a month old terrier shi tzu mix she's been sleeping in the fold up camping chair with a mexican blanket piled up in it the chair stinks to high heaven we put it outside and hosed it down but it still reeks poor pup keeps pacing around whining and scratching at the door to get at the nasty chair she's so distressed am i supposed to wean her off the chair or will she eventually forget about it thanks in advance i don't think its the blanket it's been washed and now she's not very interested wouldn't a new chair also carry the same smell is it her smell it didn't smell like pee it just stunk i don't know hopefully i figure something out try weening her out of the chair into a dog pillow beside the chair fold it up and let her get use to her new bed then throw out the camping chair you need to take some time to do this she has found her little nesting bed and she is probably attached but you can get her to change her bedding good luck Kurt Cobain Dog Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
