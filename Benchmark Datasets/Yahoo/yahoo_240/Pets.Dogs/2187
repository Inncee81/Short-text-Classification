my puppy hates wet grass my month old shih tzu x bichon will not go poo on wet grass he will go pee but reluctantly is there any way to get him to go on wet grass he will go when it is dry and yes it is obvious that if you train him he will go but the question is how should i approach this some dogs hate wet grass and others love it or don't mind i have one of each my lab mix loves wet stuff if it's not too wet while my bull mix would rather not get his paws wet we call him mr prissy your dog seems to be one of the kind that doesn't care for wet feet i would suggest waiting for him to do his business before allowing him back inside some dogs will learn quickly to do their potty if they want to avoid getting too wet like my mr prissy he will run out do his thing and then hurry back in especially if it's raining you almost have to force then to do their business before you let them back in i know this sounds cold but it's usually the only way they will brave the wet grass and get their feet wet otherwise they will either hold it until the grass dries or use your floor once he does do his duty outside in the wet grass make sure you praise him for being such a good baby and tell him how happy you are that he is so brave dogs love to please their people you will have to be tough though and stand firm he will get the idea soon enough Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Ron and Fez Melanie Wilkes Shit Hamster Toilet humour Cat Time Out of Mind Infidels AFI 100 Years series Hay Care Bears Philosophy of language The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Lake District Weather lore Love and Theft Havanese Characters in the Smurfs Diving The Fairly OddParents Crate training Diving suit Volleyball Drowning Sauna Shih Tzu Iditarod Empire Burlesque Domestic rabbit 2003 United States Grand Prix Flood geology Goodness and value theory Guinea pig Fire extinguisher Vegeta The Smoking Room Dilbert American Psycho EastEnders Mattress Professional wrestling aerial techniques Nine Inch Nails Blonde on Blonde Nintendogs Labrador Retriever Morphology (linguistics) The Death Gate Cycle Theory of conduct Fancy rat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland W.
