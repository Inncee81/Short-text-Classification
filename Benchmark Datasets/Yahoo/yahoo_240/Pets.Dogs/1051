i have a small mixed breed dog that is months old and not neutered i just got him today and he has been peeing on my floor any tips on getting him to stop you have to house train him but it should be fairly easy with the right method watch him carefully and if he sniffs a lot or justs to turn then take him outside if you let him out of your sight he may have an accident in the house house training don't use ammonia to clean up any messes because it smells like urine to the dog use vinegar or the special pet stain cleaners instead watch him very carefully when you are home and take him outside after he drinks eats or sniffs around keep him outside for minutes then come back in but keep careful watch always take him to the exact same spot outside for his toilet and clean up solid waste every few days when you can't watch him put him in a crate you want to try to let him out about every four hours but he is old enough that he can handle hours if you are diligent in walking him before and after meals and before and after leaving for work school if you don't use a crate then confine him in a room like the bathroom or kitchen that you can cover with newspaper put food water toys and bedding in one corner when you come back after a few hours take him outside for a walk then clean up soiled newspaper clean the floor underneath with vinegar and save a small piece for the smell place some clean newspaper in another corner of the room away from her food and place the smelly piece of newspaper in the corner keep newspaper on the rest of the floor the next day he should have tried to go to the bathroom close to the smelly corner repeat the process from above clean the floor use new paper place a new smelly piece of paper in the corner opposite her food you are trying to teach him where his toilet is by placing a large blinking sign that says bathroom since your dog can't read you are using a small piece of paper for the same purpose your dog has a good sense of smell so the smelly paper doesn't have to be very large or disgusting just a few inches keep doing this for a few days until your dog goes to the bathroom consistently in the same ' x ' area if you are patient and loving then he may learn to go in an area less than ' x ' in less than days but don't push it if things are on track after or days then remove all of the paper except a ' x ' area in the corner with a small smelly piece of paper advanced if he is a small dog then you might slowly reduce the area to about ' x ' then you can train him to use a kitty litter box inside but that may be pushing things when he is consistent then remove all the paper and move the smelly piece of paper to the outside to show him where his bathroom is he may have a few accidents so try to understand what happened and why he had the accident but this method should work for most puppies and dogs things to remember a you can remove the paper when you are home and watching him you only need the paper during the training period of about two weeks and only when no one is home to watch him while he is confined in the kitchen bathroom b always clean up the floor under any mess or mistake with lots of vinegar to remove the smell c remember that the smell to a dog is like a large red blinking sign to people d always get rid of soiled newspaper except for a tiny piece with smell replace the soiled newspaper with clean newspaper for the first few days also walk him pet him and talk to him softly so that he will learn that he has a loving home Hamster Housebreaking Kitchen Dog training Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Japanese tea ceremony The Shining (film) Fecal incontinence Social rule Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Menstrual cup Pet skunk Dog Toilet Guinea pig Toilet humour Sewage treatment Sin City Socialization RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Toilet paper Crate training Ron Weasley Obedience training Fire fighting Dairy Euphemism Textile manufacturing Milton H.
