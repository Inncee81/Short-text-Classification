nipping dog i have an old english sheepdog he is years old now on the way back in from going potty he walked up to the mail lady sniffed her and as she reached out to pet him he nipped her finger he did not growl or show any signs of aggression and when he was told no he simply walked away he has a really annoying habit of nipping when he wants attention and i think it is part of his instict as a sheepdog in our household we have overlooked the nipping problem but now that it has affected someone else it is a big slap in the face my husband loves him to pieces but is serious about putting him down i on the other hand cant imagine doing that especially before we try to fix the problem he is such a good dog of the time and i am affraid it is our fault as bad owners because we have let him get away with nipping for three years now any advice would be great especially a way to get rid of the nipping habit my reasoning for the nipping as an old english sheepdog is that it seems they would do that to get the attention of straglers in a herd so as for him nipping at us it has never hurt just annoying like he is trying to say hello im over here and this is such a problem because he weighs pounds hes not little i dont want to have the liability of something more serious happening one day so i would like the problem to be fixed asap nipping while at home with us is no blood no teeth marks etc but when he came in contact with the mail lady he drew blood i say nipping as what i believed happened when she reached out to pet him he tried to grab her hand which he does with us if he wants to play i am not sure but assume she jerked her hand away because she is not familiar with his tendencies to do that that is when the skin was broken she had a bandaid on her finger when returning to work as for finding a new home i have been looking but would much rather solve this problem and keep him with us because we know his history and know that he is treated very well even spoiled which i believe is part of the problem we let him get away with it for too long let us first discuss terminology nipping is where there is no aggression and no teeth marks right no sign of blood and it is like the behavior of dogs playing with each other no aggression is the key part you still have to 'nip' this behavior but it is not as serious as biting biting is a put down offense i personally do not like hitting dogs i do not want them to associate my hand with pain i suggest that you either walk around with spray bottles of water and spray in face each time he nips or time outs placing in another room for a while it may take time keep him away from non family members until behavior improves it is like a kiss in their eyes Cat Dog training Dog Pet skunk Garfield German Shepherd Dog Babe Ruth Milton H.
