i need serious help with my dog its about to be am please help the german shepherd is about months it doesnt go to sleep if i put it to sleep it will be awoken by the central air system and thus start yelping please everyone in my house is sleepin except me the dog has had accidents today and i took him outside for more than hours and he didnt go to the bathroom he was neutered yesterday and the anesthesia is just wearing off i cant put him in another room because of fear of another accident and because there is no other available room and he wont quit trying to bite my fingers on my hand hes being so much trouble right now i just need any type of help fast thank you so much i have no crate i know big mistake yes i have medications and i gave it to him hours ago months is not to soon to be away from dam litter gsd are good to go at to weeks of age months is too early to be neutered i can't imagine why anyone would advise neutering until all mental and physical maturity took place since gsd are a bit slow my vet would not neuter until months old hormones would help stabilize his hips and other joints as well as other considerations it is too late to undue the surgery give benadryl mg cuddle and stroke give him a benadryl no tylenol plus just the benadryl or equate benadryl while a fairly safe drug does have potential adverse effects and is not for every pet benadryl is to be used with extreme caution in patients with glaucoma prostatic disease cardiovascular disease and hyperthyroid among other conditions it may also interact with drugs that your pet is taking so be sure to discuss use of any drugs for your pet with your vet first the dosage for benadryl for a dog is to mg per pound of body weight up to times a day reduced dosages recommended for dogs with reduced kidney or liver function so for a pound dog that would be mg to mg up to times daily i think the benadryl capsules are mg so you aren't really giving enough to do anything anyhow drug dosages for dogs should never be guessed by the human dosage because they are usually nowhere's similiar due to different metabolism and chemistry benadryl is a known safe drug for dogs some are not however i know that benadryl can have an adverse reaction of hyperactivity in a few humans usually the elderly and dogs suggestion for your pup i would give one mg tablet and see if this will help in about mintues along with throwing a sheet over him and cuddling him sometimes benadryl will increase urine output so hussle him outside when he wakes up chalk this up to a bad night i am surprised though you didn't get any advice on this by the vet tech or dvm before you left however this is also someone who suggested you neuter a baby yes you can research this and tell him research from many not just a few veterinarians do no recommend the neutering of such an extremely young dog and a person with animal husbandry degree told you so i stick to research and up to date information besides common sense if anyone understands physiological anatomy i would have had a strong disagreement with your dr right to her face make a mat on the floor or put pup in the bed and cuddle and stroke him continue to correct the nipping sometimes a soft stroke head to past the shoulders will help him relax i am betting he is very tired and it won't take long nipping not the same as biting one of the biggest tools puppies have to learn with is their mouth not only for vocalization but to touch and feel and explore and test their limits think about a litter of puppies playing they are rough and tumble they bite nibble and bark if one puppy bites another too hard the bitten puppy lets out a screech which usually is successful in getting the hard nipper to temper his bites this is how they learn and a big part of learning is doing it wrong this is how anyone including a puppy can learn to do it right if a puppy isn t doing something wrong he cannot be shown what right is puppies will test their limits with you too nipping and mouthing is a big part of that testing they mouth and grab hands pant legs skirts etc part of how you teach a puppy to temper their biting lies back with how his litter mates taught him a shrill shriek ow to let him know he s gone too far even if it didn t hurt that much one thing that you are responsible for training this puppy that should start early is that under no circumstances should that puppy s teeth touch your bare skin now i know lab owners are going to say my puppy enjoys taking my hand into his mouth sometimes dogs understand always or never yes or no they do not understand sometimes and maybe you will be giving your dog too much human reasoning by letting him decide when it is appropriate to take your hand in his mouth or to nibble your hand ways to teach nice or easy i like the word nice or easy when i teach a dog to respect my skin if my puppy gets wild and nippy i will take his collar after i let out a big ow for nipping too hard and give it a little tug and offer my hand back to the puppy and tell him in a firm voice no nice if the puppy nips again i repeat the command and tug a little firmer i said no nice if the puppy licks your hand sniffs it or turns his head away i tell him good nice and make sure my voice sounds pleased each time the puppy gets away with a nip without working your nice command means he has learned that he can in fact get away with nipping and he will continue to do it you can also set up teaching nice or easy to your dog as opposed to waiting for it to happen i get a bunch of small soft treats small and soft means that the puppy will not forget why he got the treat if all he has to do is swallow it he will forget if you give him a biscuit and it takes him minutes to chew it up and hold one in the fingers of one hand in the other hand i have the puppy s collar and he is sitting close to me i offer the treat to the puppy and remind him that we are being easy if he lunges for the treat i give him a tug on his collar and remind him no easy the same goes if he grabs the treat and any part of my hand or fingers note the hand that is holding the treat remains stationary it is the hand holding the puppy that will move and tug the puppy away from the food if you move your food hand you will encourage the puppy to chase the treat dogs like moving objects with this exercise the puppy will eventually learn to take the treat without even touching your skin with his teeth heading off trouble ' no no's ' now after all this some big no nos that will undermine your attempts to have what we call bite inhibition in other words what you were just taught to teach your puppy never play hand games that will rile up your puppy and encourage him to lunge for your hand or any other part of your body that is not part of teaching always or never chase games especially for herding dogs german shepherds bouviers collies shelties border collies corgis etc will also encourage them to nip and bite at legs and heels not good the best games to play are games involving fetch and toys one trainer says that any time you play with your dog make sure you have a toy between you and the puppy never play tug of war with your puppy that will only make your puppy think of himself as your equal the only time i will play tug of war is when i have a wimpy unconfident puppy but i always start the game and i always finish it too i also make sure i have taught my puppy a firm out release or drop it command to make sure i don t have a problem or confrontation when i want the toy back Rabies Tenshinhan
