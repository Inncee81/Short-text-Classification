remote trainer help this is the second day were using it but he seems so confused and scared its on a low level and i tested it and it doesnt hurt its more of a squeezing feeling will he get the training process eventually pounds months here's the deal with remote trainers the majority of dogs will only be traumatized by the use of them if you are going to use it only use the beep not the shock i only ever recommend the use of a shock on very dominant stubborn strong or possibly dangerous dogs and even in those cases i never recommend people use them unless they have been shown how to properly use them by a trainer a shock collar is a wonderful tool for very stubborn dogs but if your dog is acting so severely she is not one of those cases like i said i would just use the beep as a mild correction or switch to using a spray bottle Electroshock gun First aid Explosive material Weight training Dog training Dog Breastfeeding Housebreaking Post-traumatic stress disorder American Pit Bull Terrier Avalanche Motion picture rating system Anorexia nervosa Pit bull Fecal incontinence Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Bleeding Insulin Cessna T-37 Menstrual cup Cystic fibrosis Ben Johnson (athlete) Paragliding Combine (Half-Life 2) Bipolar disorder Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Intelligence quotient Neuro-linguistic programming Keeshond Carpal tunnel syndrome Dieting Maison Ikkoku Working dog Shock Psoriasis Mercury 4 M16 (rifle) Urinary incontinence Pet skunk Tourniquet Chesapeake Bay Retriever Canadian Armed Forces Shetland Sheepdog Myocardial infarction Combat stress reaction Hypoglycemia Childbirth Vitamin C Airbag Abortion Intracranial pressure Socialization XML Stockholm syndrome Cairn Terrier World War Three (Doctor Who) Atkins Nutritional Approach Obedience training Embedded system Sex assignment Kim Possible Dog collar Malaria STS-114 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anthrax Airedale Terrier Schutzhund Rape Milton H.
