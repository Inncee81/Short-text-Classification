pit bull puppies and fleas my dog had puppies they are days old and are starting to get fleas i was wondering if there is anything i can do to get rid of the fleas and whats safe for them you need to treat the mom and any other adult dog in your house for the fleas both frontline and advantage are safe for pregnant and nursing females if you treat mom any fleas that are on the puppies will be killed because the puppies are constantly up against mom i use frontline personally because if you don't have a large flea infestation it will usually last months of killing the fleas i treat my females while they are in heat and then again after the puppies are born when needed you can reapply after days if needed the puppies themselves can be treated once the are weeks old Flea Dog Socialization Dog training Red Hot Chili Peppers Heartworm Bull Terrier Housebreaking Dracunculiasis 101 Dalmatians: The Series Cat Tag RuneScape quests Diseases of the honeybee Skinny Puppy Pet skunk Scooby-Doo American Pit Bull Terrier Kurt Cobain Kakapo Mixed-breed dog The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tiny Toon Adventures Puppy mill Ron and Fez Bubonic plague Shetland Sheepdog Rabies Guinea pig Mange Beethoven (film) Fancy rat Linked list Border Terrier Sick Puppy Donald Rumsfeld Lion Crate training Nintendogs Robert De Niro Brian Griffin Livestock Clifford's Puppy Days Lady and the Tramp Folic acid Marilyn Monroe Eddie Guerrero German Shepherd Dog John Frusciante Acne Ren and Stimpy Ministry of Mayhem Shark AFI 100 Years series Heracles InuYasha Mom and Pop Art One Tree Hill (TV series) Pigface Pregnancy United Kennel Club Docking Tungiasis Pok__mon Live!
