how often should puppies eat be fed we just got an week old jack russell puppy i've read that puppies should be fed times a day our little one however only eats a very small amount and she wants to eat or times a day is that okay i also worry that having no set feeding schedule will make her more unpredictable about having to move her bowels any advice would be appreciated at weeks old puppies don't have much control over their bowels anyway they don't really start getting that control until about weeks the important thing about feeding is that they get enough to grow and be healthy at weeks you can feed times a day and at weeks cut down to times a day your puppy hasn't learned yet that if he doesn't eat that it won't be there feeding times a day may make him pick at it thinking there will always be a fresh supply of food follow the amount that you are feeding based on the weight guidlines you can get stricter with your schedule as your puppy grows and learns control Diarrhea Dog training Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Dog Housebreaking Bread Guinea pig Dietary fiber Irritable bowel syndrome Hamster Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Little Shop of Horrors Chicken Fancy rat Nutrition Sea-Monkey Vitamin C The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Tooth Domestic rabbit Overpopulation Certified Nursing Assistant Socialization Organic farming Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escherichia coli O157:H7 Coprophagia Biological pest control Atkins Nutritional Approach Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an National Football League Dairy Arthur Laffer Dieting Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Albatross Radiation therapy Battles of Lexington and Concord Folic acid Carburetor 613 mitzvot Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Welding Livestock Insulin Binge eating disorder Local food Raw food diet Gastroparesis Super Size Me Spider The Sims Foie gras The Ashlee Simpson Show Goldfish Shark Nintendogs Healthy eating Feeder (fetish) The Lovely Bones Hydroponics FoxTrot Taboo food and drink Fight Club Blonde on Blonde Cheese Domesticated turkey Ron and Fez Randomness Bird migration Discworld gods Anorexia nervosa Richard Feynman Crate training Capercaillie The Amber Spyglass Hunting John the Baptist Inflation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Economy of Russia Genetically modified food Medical prescription Garfield Pyramid (game show) Alcoholics Anonymous Adjustable gastric band Hypoglycemia Wheel of Fortune Metaphysics DDT Snake Girly Crohn's disease Fertility awareness
