hep yr old labrador loves company howls and cries when left on her own how to stop this just got her days ago previous owners had her and a dalmation in small garden and gave her to us as they couldn't care for of them not getting enough exercise overweight so v lazy sons are gutted as they want to play ball etc with her but all she does is lie down weight not an issue we're bringing her for walks a day so that will sort her out the problem is she used to be with another dog all the time and now she howls if let on her own day or night proving a big problem as we're keeping all the neighbours awake getting another dog for her is not an option do we just hope she'll stop get used to being on her own help please it's night time is the big problem buy her a kong and stuff it full of goodies to keep her busy at night or while you're out also plenty of toys aswell our lab did it for the first nights we had her before leaving her on her own give her the kong stuffed with broken gravy bones peanut butter etc to keep her mind off the seperation issue so she associates being on her own with yummy treats also you could give her penty of excersise before bedtimes so shes just to tired to cry and howl you can also train her not to do it by leaving her on her own for a few mins then if she doesnt cry or howl give her a treat and plenty of praise as labs love to please then slowly increase the seperation time till she associates not crying and howling with praise and treats we also bought our lab a soft bone shaped cushion toy that makes a grunting noise when bitten which she adores these can be bought from ultimateanimals website for around which is cheap for a good nights sleep a lonely bored lab will resort to chewing and bad behaviour so the more chew toys she has and interesting things to play with the less likely she is to get into trouble or cry at night the worst thing you could do is shout at her for crying as this just strengthens the behaviour of crying howling for attention i hope this helps with your labby problem it helped us good luck and get some sleep Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Social rule Dog Poker jargon Care Bears Babe Ruth Sin City Ferret Insomnia Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Snooker Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Sydney Riot of 1879 EastEnders Plastic Tire Sleep apnea Labrador Retriever Customs and etiquette of Japan Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix About a Boy Charlie Brown The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fecal incontinence Toilet humour Le Malade imaginaire Gray Wolf Sinfest Housebreaking Piccolo Junior Saga Beat generation Satchel Paige Charles Goodyear The Time Machine The Care Bears (television series) One Tree Hill (TV series) FoxTrot Time Out of Mind Garfield Kim Possible 1957 World Series RuneScape quests Street-Legal YuYu Hakusho Oasis (band) The Fairly OddParents The Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Prostate cancer One Piece minor characters Gregg Alexander Atomic Kitten Scientology beliefs and practices The Death Gate Cycle Futurama (TV series - season 5) Bruce Lee Kakapo Dinosaur Philip J.
