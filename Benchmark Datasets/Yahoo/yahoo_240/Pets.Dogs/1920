what should i do with my shedding dog i have a year old rottie shepherd mix that i have had since he was months old he is pretty much like my child my new husband just told me yesterday that he can't stand the amount of hair that romeo sheds and i have to find him a new home or else we've discussed shaving or grooming and the hubby won't even examine these options his view is that he feels it's gross to have any dog hair in the house i love this dog like my child but this may have a huge impact on the hubby and i's relationship in a really negative way i also feel it's cruel to find new owners for this dog that i love so much and it was a bad ultimatum what do i do if the dog were mine i would take him to a professional or call a mobile groomer to your home and have him clipped down with a blade or a blade head and all which will leave his coat like a smooth coated dog say a dalmatian you can expect to pay anything from to for this type of grooming depending on where you live and what type of service you get mobile grooming is more expensive but is sometimes a little better because in mobile the dog has to be hand dried which will blow out all of the little undercoat that would be left after a good clip while the dog is being groomed i would have the carpets shampooed and there are some carpet cleaning companies that even do your hard floors i would also have the furniture done by the company while they are there i wouldn't discuss any of this with the husband i would just get it done while he is at work i have no idea what all of that will cost wash all the dog's bedding if you have to go to a laundromat to do it then i would leave it all at that if your husband continues his ranting about you getting rid of the dog then you can get rid of your husband because if you take these steps to eliminate the fur problem and he is still complaining then you know he is going to try to control your every move for the rest of the time you are stuck with him if the husband stops his complaining and you decide to keep him then next april you would want to have the dog shaved again with one of those two blade lengths i mentioned above because this will curb the big spring shed then one more shave down at around this time of year july early august next i would put your dog on a schedule of being groomed at the very least once every months it's in the best interest of the dog as well as your husband in the fall and winter grooms just have a bath and brush out done again mobile service normally can get more fur out with the hand blow drying rather than cage drying that is done in grooming shops another thing to keep in mind is the age of your dog once dogs begin to go into the older stages the fur isn't as great quality as when they were younger and they have a harder time keeping themselves groomed so it seems like they shed even more when they are older it's only natural that at this stage of his life he would require help in his grooming needs finally depending on your financial situation to keep shedding at it's lowest you could get him professionally groomed bathed as often as every days weeks or weeks if he is hand dried this will keep a lot of dead coat removed but again no longer than months and i would still do the clip downs twice a year Keeshond Dog Dog training Sento Domestic rabbit EastEnders American Eskimo Dog Havanese Dial M for Murder Shetland Sheepdog Hamster Textile manufacturing Guinea pig Knife Dairy Social rule Fancy rat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bulk vending Poker jargon Poodle Professional wrestling match types Livestock Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Drug test Big Brother UK series 6 Textile manufacturing terminology Airedale Terrier Knots Landing Garfield Upholstery 2000 Australian Grand Prix Roomba Shot of Love Carpet Woodworking Japanese toilet Continuation War Gray Wolf Microeconomics Ron and Fez About a Boy Professional wrestling slang Drill bit Equine conformation Ferret Siberian Husky The Ashlee Simpson Show Shampoo Humphrey Bogart Wind turbine Road Rovers Plame affair Capitalism Mattress Downing Street memo Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Animal Crossing Gross domestic product Photography Fur Mixed martial arts Newcastle United F.C.
