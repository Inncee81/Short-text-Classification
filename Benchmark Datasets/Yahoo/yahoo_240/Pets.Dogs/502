does anyone own does anyone own a yorkshire terrior what are the good and bad points i'm getting one for a pet but not for show yorkshire terriers what's good about 'em what's bad about 'em there are energetic yorkies and placid yorkies hard headed yorkies and sweet natured yorkies serious yorkies and good natured goofballs introverted yorkies and yorkies who love everyone if you acquire a yorkshire terrier puppy you can't know for sure what he or she will grow up to be like because a good number of purebred puppies do not grow up to conform to the norm now let's look at some common characteristics for this breed if you want a dog who is small fine boned elegant easy to carry and doesn't take up much space has a lovely flowing coat that doesn't shed one of the best breeds for allergy sufferers is lively and inquisitive and moves swiftly with light footed grace doesn't need a lot of exercise makes a keen watchdog won't fail to announce strangers is peaceful with other pets a yorkshire terrier may be right for you if you don't want to deal with the fragility of toy breeds see below separation anxiety destructiveness and barking when left alone too much suspiciousness shrillness and highstrung temperaments in some lines or when babied and spoiled or when not socialized enough excitable chasing instincts frequent brushing and combing notorious housebreaking difficulties barking a yorkshire terrier may not be right for you if i were considering a yorkshire terrier my major concerns would be fragility too many people acquire a toy breed puppy without understanding how incredibly fragile a toy breed is you can seriously injure or kill a yorkshire terrier by stepping on him or by sitting on him when he's curled under a blanket or pillow where he frequently likes to sleep and yorkshire terriers can seriously injure or kill themselves by leaping from your arms or off the back of your sofa a larger dog can grab a yorkshire terrier and break his neck with one quick shake owning a toy breed means constant supervision and surveillance of what's going on around your tiny dog yorkshire terriers must always be kept on leash they are just too easy to injure when not under your complete control and many yorkies with their terrier heritage have strong chasing instincts they will take off after anything that runs yorkshire terriers are not suited to children no matter how well meaning the child children cannot help being clumsy and that a child meant well is little solace to a yorkshire terrier who has been accidentally stepped on sat on rolled on squeezed or dropped onto the patio most yorkshire terriers feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making and stress and fearfulness even defensive biting may be the result separation anxiety more than most other breeds yorkshire terriers need a great deal of companionship and do not like being left alone for more than a few hours they tend to express their unhappiness through destructive chewing and barking if you work all day this is not the breed for you providing enough socialization standoffish by nature yorkshire terriers need extensive exposure to people and to unusual sights and sounds otherwise their natural caution could become suspiciousness or shyness which are difficult to live with and can even lead to snapping and biting grooming without frequent brushing and combing yorkshire terriers become a matted mess if you can't commit to the brushing you have to commit to frequent trimming to keep the coat short neat and healthy housebreaking problems as a behavioral consultant i would put the yorkshire terriers on my top five list of hard to housebreak consistent crate training is mandatory sometimes a doggy door is necessary and some owners never do get their yorkshire terriers fully housebroken barking yorkshire terriers are often too quick to sound the alarm at every new sight and sound you have to be equally quick to stop them to teach your yorkie to listen to you respect training is mandatory my yorkshire terrier training page discusses the program you need avoiding the hype have you heard these phrases teacup yorkies tiny toy yorkies extreme tinies some breeders use these cutesy phrases as marketing terms for the different weights that yorkies come in all of these phrases are made up yes certainly yorkies come in different weights but they do not come in different weight varieties whether they weigh pounds or pounds or pounds they are called simply yorkshire terriers some are simply smaller or larger than others the larger individuals are sturdier so don't dismiss them as good pets in fact i do not recommend a yorkshire terrier under pounds these individuals are great risks in the health department their bones are extremely fragile there is not enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth their internal organs are often weak and can fail suddenly they tend to have great difficulty regulating their blood sugar and can suddenly fall into hypoglycemic comas responsible yorkshire terrier breeders never try to produce these tiny high risk creatures if a tiny one pops up in one of their litters they do their best to find the best home that can keep it alive yes but they try hard not to produce them in the first place because it's not fair to the poor little creature on the other hand some breeders deliberately breed tiny high risk yorkies because they can sell them for high prices to unsuspecting owners or to owners who selfishly demand that they want one because it's adorable or to satisfy their mothering instincts don't be one of these people if you reward these irresponsible breeders by giving them your money you are encouraging them to keep producing tiny sickly short lived creatures no be a responsible buyer and stick with yorkshire terriers who will mature at pounds and up who have the best chance of living a normal healthy life in this way breeders will be motivated to produce these sizes these individuals by the way will weigh at least pounds at weeks old if you're considering an adult yorkshire terriers there are plenty of adult yorkies who have already proven themselves not to have negative characteristics if you find such an adult don't let typical breed negatives worry you when you acquire a puppy you're acquiring potential what he one day will be so typical breed characteristics are very important but when you acquire an adult you're acquiring what he already is Dobermann Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
