serious question about apbt education i have never in my life met a pitbull i didn't like somewhere along the way their beauty and loyalty touched my heart unlike any other breed and i would love to take one into my home i recognize that any dog can become aggressive or violent due to sub par training and environment i have heard that pitbulls are animal aggressive though and i do have a beagle and cats which is the only thing that holds me back from adopting a pit i really want to know how accurate that is i'd like a site or list of sites or a book anything that i can further educate myself on the risks and rewards of owning a pitbull should i be worried about my cats or is it just hype about untrained and abused dogs that has lead to another misconception yes they can be animal aggressive however so can many breeds herders hounds etc it doesn't mean it can't work out it depends on the dog and what you do or don't do all of the dogs i have are known for having strong prey drive but my small animals are safe and sound here's some info on what to expect w them http www pitbulllovers com about the american pit bull terrier html http www understand a bull com eta please don't make the mistake of thinking it's all in how you raise or train a dog that helps a lot but you can't stop traits that have been bred in for hundreds to thousands of years that's like saying 'if i raise my sighthounds right they won't chase small animals' i can socialize train and take precautions for it work out but that doesn't mean i can let them play at the petting zoo unsupervised here's more info myth if a pit bull was never trained to fight it will be safe with other dogs pit bulls can live peacefully with other dogs and animals however the pit bull has historically been bred to take down large animals early and continual socialization can help a pit bull be more animal friendly genetics however play an important role in how the dog will respond to other dogs and animals a pit bull that will fight another dog if unattended is a normal pit bull even if a pit bull does not start the fight it has the potential to seriously injure or kill a dog once in the fight the pit bull has been bred to not back down and withstand pain until the goal is met this quality does not carry true in all pit bulls but it is safe to assume it is a potential in any pit bull in order to avoid unnecessary problems pit bulls have a late maturity and a pit bull that was dog friendly at months old may suddenly show signs of intolerance of unfamiliar dogs around two years old spaying and neutering the dog may help to prevent turning on the genetic urge to fight another dog all dog fights are preventable however socialize a pit bull slowly with new dogs and never let them play unattended remove items such as toys and food bowls to avoid stress pit bulls can live happily with other pets if not left unattended even the best of friends can fight and the outcome may be tragic this can be true for dogs that have been together for years often after the first serious fight relations between the dogs are never the same keeping that first fight from happening is a great way to ensure peaceful relations for the long run if there is a multiple dog household it is important to separate the dogs when there is no one home many people use crates for short times put dogs into separate rooms use kennels or have outdoor areas set up for separation that are safe and secure pit bulls can get along wonderfully with animals like cats rabbits and ferrets but for safety s sake never leave them alone together Pit bull Domestic rabbit Ferret German Shepherd Dog Dog training Pet skunk Guinea pig Housebreaking Fancy rat Livestock Hamster Domestication God Emperor of Dune Jack Russell Terrier Border Terrier Gray Wolf Shaggy dog story One Piece minor characters Crate training Kodocha Beagle Socialization Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fox hunting Horse Coeliac disease Obedience training Basset Hound Elephant Cancer Animal testing Zoophilia Medieval hunting Manx (cat) Rabbit Abortion debate EastEnders Equine conformation The Death Gate Cycle Animal Liberation Front Iditarod Kakapo Rabies Garfield Greyhound Bull Terrier Infantilism Transsexuality Pitaten Urinary incontinence The Origin of Species Poker jargon Baseball Cockfight Border Collie Cheetah Inception of Darwin's theory Feral cat Castration Abortion Our Gang Surveillance Terrier Nuclear power Internet phenomenon Columbine High School massacre Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog show Kim Possible Addiction Characters of Naruto Bullfighting The Amazing Race Taboo food and drink Hunting Theory of conduct Tooth enamel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fast bowling Borderline personality disorder Factory farming Alaga__sia Autism Human sexual behavior Indianapolis 500
