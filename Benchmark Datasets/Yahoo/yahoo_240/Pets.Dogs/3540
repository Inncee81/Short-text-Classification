why does the dog i found keep biting my feet i have a stray dog that i am keeping with me at my home until i can find her owner i believe that she is a terrier mix around years old she had been sprayed by a skunk so right now i'm keeping her outdoors until i can remove the smell she is basically a good dog but i cannot keep her from nipping at my feet and ankles i am unsure if it's play or if it is because she is upset i truly do not know much about dogs so i appreciate any advice i can get for those who are concerned that i am keeping someone's pet i'd like to add that i have made a report to the local shelters and have informed the county sheriff that i have found a lost dog i have also called the neighbors a couple vets and my husband put up a notice at the grocery store i also am planning on having her taken in to see if she has a microchip but only after she has been bathed which i am planning on doing shortly as much as i'm sure her family misses her i would rather not have the interior of my vehicle smelling of skunk by the looks of her and by how thin she is i have a feeling that she doesn't have anyone looking for her although i live in the country in a secluded area she is the third dog i have found since may the other two doggies have been reunited with their families so i am not the type of person who simply keeps other people's pets she must have some herding dog in her also they can be toe feet and ankle biters i have a sheltie also a herding breed and when she starts nipping at my heels or ankles or even touches them with her teeth i immediately stop push her down onto the ground and tell her no i hold her there until she goes limp or relaxed you don't have to be rough about it just firm she is trying to show her dominance over you not a good thing do this a few times and she will get the message and stop about the skunk there are products at pet stores that you can put on your dog to eliminate the skunk smell they work very well and your girl won't have to stay outside anymore go talk with the people at the store and they can help you out Pet skunk Skunk Cat Dog training Dog Working dog Shoe Rabies Obedience training Guinea pig Garfield German Shepherd Dog Herding dog Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Horse Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Aerial (dance move) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fancy rat American Pit Bull Terrier Hamster Social rule Kurt Angle Professional wrestling holds Sento Pet Tag Companion dog Australian Cattle Dog Traumatic incident reduction Neighbours Spotted Skunk Iditarod Friends Jack Russell Terrier Marching band Mixed-breed dog Kodocha The Lovely Bones American Eskimo Dog Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling match types Maison Ikkoku Swingout Glossary of partner dance terms Skateboarding trick Dog agility Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Manual transmission Fast bowling Professional wrestling slang Customs and etiquette of Japan Skye Terrier Labrador Retriever Fire fighting Canary Poker jargon Airedale Terrier Four square Strap-on dildo The Fairly OddParents Tasmanian Devil Urinary incontinence Past teachings of Prem Rawat Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Terrier Brian Griffin The Inside Keeshond Woodworking Ferret Border Collie Flyball Kim Possible Krypto the Superdog Avenue Q Dobermann Pok__mon Live!
