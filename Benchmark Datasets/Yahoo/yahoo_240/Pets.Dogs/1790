how can i teach my dog these tricks i want to teach my dog these tricks can anyone help roll over sneeze speak they already know down sit leave it heal drop it down on carpet and dance does anyone have any websites that could help too dog trick teaching roll over start by having your dog lay down on his belly kneel down beside him and gently roll him over on his side calmly talk to him and say roll over lift his legs so his belly shows take your time and carefully use your hands to roll him over the rest of the way saying his name and roll over then praise your dog with an enthusiastic and excited good boy as your dog starts to get the idea you may help your dog roll over when he attempts to roll over on his own give lots of praise and a treat as soon as he rolls over to the other side only roll your dog on soft surfaces like carpet or grass so he doesn't hurt his back some dogs don't like to roll over because it's scary for them to put their belly up try it a few times and if it's not fun for your dog choose another trick sneezing with careful and patient training most dogs can be taught to sneeze this is accomplished by tickling the nose with a feather at first he will snap at it and under normal circumstances most dogs will start to sneeze he will not like the feather very well and in course of time his imagination will foreshadow its effects and he will begin to sneeze as soon as it is pointed in close proximity to his nose when he sneezes use a command like sneeze to associate with this trick as usual praise and treat when he gets it right by repeating this operation at odd times the dog can be taught to sneeze very creditably when you point your finger at his nose and give him the word sneeze and finally will do so simply at command this trick can be fun and entertaining but not easily achievable especially with dominant dogs if your dog gets irritated and turns aggressive toward you when you tickle his nose you should stop training immediately teaching the speak command i believe it is important to teach your dog a quiet command to do this you must teach a speak command first find something your dog wants treats food toy entice the dog with the object increasing the dog's desire for it hold it above the dog's head and ask the dog to speak in the beginning an exasperated exhale squeak grumble or noise should be considered good behavior reward that exhale or other vocalization with treats petting and praise repeat until the dog shows enthusiasm and barks when the dog barks give a big reward treats or play session if there are occasions where your dog barks regularly use these situations in your training by asking the dog to speak for example if your dog barks when the doorbell rings say speak and then ring the doorbell when the dog barks reward by giving praise and a treat repeat until you can phase out the doorbell or other stimuli behaviors like speak are easier to train because it's something your dog already does naturally Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Dog Shaggy dog story Obedience training Milton H.
