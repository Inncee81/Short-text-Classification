how do i teach her how to i teach my puppy her name and to sit hey there use rewards to help your dog learn if this were my puppy she would not get fed in a bowl the normal way she would earn all of her food from interacting with me i would keep the pup on a long line all the time and call her to me whenever i thought of it and then reward her with her food many many times a day once she gets used to the idea of hanging out with you and that you are a great person to hang out with you can start shaping her to sit she knows that you are the source of food so it will be natural to her to pay more attention to you be in a boring place when you first shape her to sit what this will look like is the dog will be dancing around you waiting for you to give her something yummy then she'll slow down and eventually she will sit bingo say yes and jackpot she'll get up to vacuum up all the treats and then she will sit again yay yes again and treat toss the treat so that she has to get up this is a fun game that will make your dog think i recommend playing this game several times a day when you are in environments where she can concentrate when she has a longer history of being rewarded for this behavior you can start to move to more challenging places to do it notice that you are not calling this behavior anything yet the idea is that you are not chanting sit sit sit at your poor dog but that she's learning herself that she can do things to make you give her treats this will make a very strong impression on her mind and will improve your relationship the more you play it good luck i highly recommend that you join start puppy training group on yahoo for more training info Dog training Dog agility Dog Housebreaking Socialization Reinforcement Obedience training Game show Poker jargon Autism Wheel of Fortune Scooby-Doo Guinea pig Social psychology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Japanese tea ceremony Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pinball Carburetor Taikyoku shogi Bingo A Course In Miracles Sea-Monkey Falconry Contredanse Tag Piccolo Junior Saga Cat Anorexia nervosa Upholstery Pittsburgh Steelers Adult attention-deficit disorder Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Philip J.
