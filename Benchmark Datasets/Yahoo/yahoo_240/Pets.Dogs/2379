dog owner responsibility my good neighbour's daughter has owned a jack russell since it was months it is now yrs old she has taken care of the dog by herself with her mother helping with some payments of food etc she took it to the vet for its first three shots which she paid most of and she worms it every months and gives it heartworm tablets she take it for a walk immediately after school as she has to leave it in a crate while she's at school she trained it to obey her and her biggest success was training her dog to come to her she has also taught him cute tricks to perform her mother has full time work and cannot do much to help out she takes it to the park every weekend for an hour or more and feeds it everyday plays with it and gives it attention yet she can still fit in homework time her own time tv time and school and this girl is only her mother was telling me this yesterday and i found it remarkable that such a young girl could demonstrate such responsiblity how about u to reveal something that girl is me i dont enjoy bragging so i usually say its something else but eventually i tell them thank u so much for all your responses it encourages me to continue what i'm doing for my dog your a rare year old that takes that kind of time and care with her pet and does it all alone with little adult help most kids want dogs beg for them even then parents have to do all the work so i commend you for your care and attention to your little friend and i hope that your parents realize what a gem of a daughter they have keep up the good work little one Dog training Garfield Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Dog Housebreaking Neighbours Shaggy dog story Trailer Park Boys Pitaten About a Boy Azumanga Daioh Kylie Minogue Heartworm The Family from One End Street Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ranma __ characters Incarnations of Immortality EastEnders Xiaolin Showdown Our Gang Dog agility W.I.T.C.H.
