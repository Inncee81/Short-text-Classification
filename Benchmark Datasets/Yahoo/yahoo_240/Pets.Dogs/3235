i have a chihuahua puppy what is the best way to teach her to be alone while i am gone also crying she is about weeks old and has a personality of her own i love her and i'm glad i decided on getting this breed it's my first puppy so i am still learning and asking for any advice i agree totally i just got a chihuahua for christmas this past year and she has such a great personality she literally lights up a room when you walk in as for the getting used to you not being around use a crate mine stays in an x and cover it with a blanket this will become her home and after awhile she will see it as such and actually like it for the security it provides while you are gone introduce her to it a few minutes at a time while you are still home to start she may cry and possibly howl to start but be vigilant she will very quickly realize within a few days that she is supposed to be there and she will not see it as separation because she will know you will come back to retrieve her soon after a while you will be able to leave her in there when you go out for longer periods of time and as she ages you can slowly give her freedom to stay out of the crate when you are gone however i dont suggest that for the first year or so puppies tend to get into trouble too easily at first as for the crying the crate training will help tremendously with that just be prepared she will be just as persistent as you don't give into her crying and she will soon learn that just like a baby it won't always work my puppy still whines a lot but she has certainly matured over the last months enjoy her and train her well she will be your little shadow who only wants to please you for years to come Crate training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mixed-breed dog Breastfeeding John Sheridan (Babylon 5) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Beatles discography Vegeta Social rule Worms weapons and tools The Catcher in the Rye The Shining (film) The Death Gate Cycle Combine (Half-Life 2) Apollo 8 Avenue Q Golden Retriever Pok__mon Live!
