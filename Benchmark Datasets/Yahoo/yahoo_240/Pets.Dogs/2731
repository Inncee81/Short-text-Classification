how do you break a defiant dog from urinating after being corrected my dog is a cairn terrior and is more like a terror she pees on the floor right in front of me after i correct her for bad behavior how do i win this fight for good i really don't want to get rid of her but i may have to it's ruining my carpet the problem with her peeing on the floor is her extensive time outside when she had more than enough time to urinate outside and won't then comes in the house and immediately pees on the carpet i do scold her but never hit i use the dissapointed tones with her to correct her behavior and tell her no and move on she is very defiant and was so with her family before me they had the exact same problem of her not listening very well when she does something and gets a negative response she urinates and not because she has to go out but because she is upset for getting scolded i do use positive responses when she does actually mind she is a good dog when she wants to be but it is these moments of defiance that i don't know if i can break the bad habit she is fully grown and has had these bad behaviors already ingrained into her patterns of life you'll want to stop correcting her this instant your corrections are clearly making your dog scared of you please remember that the greatest good can be accomplished by rewarding for good behavior not 'disciplining' for bad many things have changed about the way we train dogs positive is the way to go there are many classes that you can take to learn just a little bit about the way that your dog learns http www inch com dogs cratetraining html and http pets groups yahoo com group spt Dog training Housebreaking Milton H.
