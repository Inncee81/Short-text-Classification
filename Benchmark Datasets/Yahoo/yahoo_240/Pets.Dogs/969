what can i do to get my dog to be more friendly towards me my dog is a dachsund cocker spaniel mix that we adopted for my birthday last year she is really whiny and gets upset if you don't pay enough attention to her whenever i try to pick her up or even get within or feet of her she either growls or runs away she always follows my mom around the house wherever she goes i don't know why but i want her to like me because she's supposed to be my dog i'm trying to make an effort to be nice to her but she's an emotional wreck what can i do to win her trust and have her like me first of all when ever your around her try being more quiet and also try not to pick her up or approach her too fast give her a little more space and some time to let her be able to approach you rather than you approaching her let her find her comfort zone with you she may just be afraid and if you push at her with it that may be what is scaring her off to some degree she may have had a bad experience with a younger person and she may just need some time to work through it but with love and patience from you she will over come it get some small dog treats when ever she does some thing good give her one and tell her good girl in a soft voice no matter what do not raise your voice or get angry with her the key to winning her over is lots of love and understanding try sitting on the floor and calling her to you in a very soft voice hold out the treat to her and when she comes to you reward her with the treat and tell her in a soft voice that she is a good girl but again keep you voice soft and you movements slower animals can pick up on emotions so that if you get worked up angry or up set she will be able to sense that from you take your time with her let her get to really know you so that she'll trust you i know you said that she was adopted maybe she was abused by the last owner they may have had a small child young person in the home that frightened the dog so that she is now some what afraid of younger people just be gental and quiet when dealing with her take your time with her and you may see her start to warm up to you she just needs to learn to trust you once she knows that she can trust you she will be just fine god bless i'm sure that every thing is going to work out just fine one other thing kind of watch to see how your mom acts around her and see if you can some what copy her and see if that also helps you with her best of luck to you and you dog i know that the two of you are going to be the best of friends before you know it i really hope that this help you best wishes to you Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Kim Possible Kodocha Dog Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Pok__mon Live!
