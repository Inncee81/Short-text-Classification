my dog has a case of nipping my dog has these random moments where he makes this horrible vicious growling noise when he is eating or just random and looks as if he is attacking you just brushing his teeth across your hand its very scary and once did nip me he is such a sweet dog though and does everything fine i just dont know how to stop these random attacks please help i think you have a big problem on your hands check on some books on dog aggression do exercises that establish you dominance over him for example have you and your family eat dinner before you feed him make him sit stay when you put his dinner down before him so he understands that your command releases him to eat you can do other things like roll him over onto his back and gently pin him to the ground make sure you release him with a command look him in the eye until he looks away obedience classes can help the dog understand the rank and order of things as well if there are situations when he is known to nip get some bitterapple sold in pet stores and put it on your hand he'll remember the god awful taste of it the next time he thinks of taking a chomp out of you these bouts of temper of his aren't purely random pay attention to what's going on around him the next time he does this is his space being disturbed is he overly protective over toys you need to act on this fast it's only going to take one misdirected attack on his part and he'll have to be put down maybe you don't mind if he nips you but a neighbor won't tolerate it if it's their kid neither will a strange person walking by your house or the deliveryman coming to your door i speak with experience on this i had a very loving and obedient dog who once nipped a neighborhood friend of mine when she was swinging a stick at me it didn't even draw blood but my family had to fight with animal control to keep him alive her family wanted him destroyed needless to say our families were no longer friends after that Dog training Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Milton H.
