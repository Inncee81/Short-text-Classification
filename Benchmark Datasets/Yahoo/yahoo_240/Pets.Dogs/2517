ban pits the only way to end dogfighting i think that the only way to end illegal dog fighting cruelty is to ban the pit bull fighting dogs are we unwittingly promoting animal cruelty by allowing people to own fighting dogs please be objective i dont want to hear about the bad owners because that is the problem bad people are attracted to pits like flies to sh but there is no way to ban bad people or owners under current law so that is a copout this is leaving out the danger of pit bulls which is another serious problem entirely and all the more reason for their banning the only reason the pit had been invented for was killing of fellow dogs and other small animals this is a fact perhaps castrating the bastards who keep the fighting sport alive would resolve the problem this is wishful thinking Pit bull Bullfighting American Pit Bull Terrier Cockfight Breed-specific legislation Cattle Fox hunting Formula One regulations Dog Livestock Docking Ferret 2005 United States Grand Prix Dobermann Zoophilia Video game controversy Professional wrestling match types Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Hunting Taboo food and drink Fatality Whaling Animal testing Indianapolis 500 Profanity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin City Public domain Animal rights Castration Divorce Censorship in Australia American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) German Shepherd Dog Capital punishment Contract Cat Bastard!! 2000 Australian Grand Prix Partial-birth abortion 24 Hours of Le Mans People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Bear-baiting Cremation Billboard (advertising) Blackjack Smoking ban Cruelty to animals Professional wrestling slang Black Sitting Bull Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Abortion debate Quentin Tarantino Gun politics 613 mitzvot Ownership Breaker Morant Montgomery Burns The Death Gate Cycle Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Formula One Samurai Deeper Kyo Shark Cannibal Holocaust Margaret Sanger Barry Bonds Working dog Burial Drag racing Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Kill Bill Same-sex marriage Tenshinhan Iditarod Logic Halo 2 Pet skunk Wario Gun politics in the United States Foie gras French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Sport utility vehicle Tobacco advertising Roe v.
