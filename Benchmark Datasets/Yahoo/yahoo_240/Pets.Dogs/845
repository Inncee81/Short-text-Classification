im going to the dog adoption center tomorrow what should i look for in a dog i mean i want a good dog but you cant always tell if they have a dog that you like there and i live in denver colorado if that helps at all lol edit and whats a good name for a male dog edit and yes i want a big dog not a puny one lol edit and is there anyway to see if a dog is great for you because at an adoption center every dog is going to jump at you i would think so edit and are adopted dogs better than breed ones i mean i want to adopt one to not think about the fact that if they arent adopted they put them to sleep ' so are adopted ones better what you want to look for in a dog for you is the way the dog interacts with you if you pick a dog that doesn't come to you it won't work out as a wise breeder once told me watch for the dog that comes to you if you like it and it won't come to you then it's not the right dog for you no chemistry equals both parties being unhappy make sure you find out all you can about each dog you like before you decide think it over and make the right pick before you decide good luck Reservoir Dogs Dog training Dog show Teen Girl Squad RuneScape quests American Pit Bull Terrier Shaggy dog story Australian Cattle Dog Greyhound Italian Greyhound German Shepherd Dog Pittsburgh Steelers Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Into the West (miniseries) The Cure Nintendogs The Critic Contract Girls Aloud Everwood Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Extreme Programming Cat Dobermann Argentine Dogo Jack Russell Terrier Rocko's Modern Life Game show Dog breed German Shorthaired Pointer Breed registry Pitaten Futurama (TV series - season 5) Golden Retriever Escape from New York Dachshund EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Blur C.
