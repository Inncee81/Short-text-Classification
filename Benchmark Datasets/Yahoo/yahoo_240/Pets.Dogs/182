why is my dog suddenly peeing where he knows not to my year old cockapoo bailey is starting to pee on my bed and i dont mean just a sprinkle he pees through the blankets sheets and even makes it onto my pillows he has never done this before he is trained to pee outside so why the sudden change his diet is the same he has allergies so he is on medication but its the same meds as always we don't have any other animals so i don't see how it could be a dominance issue this is just really odd behavior why is it happening and how can i stop it could he be angry with something that you did lately dogs act out when they are not happy with certain issue e g if you have someone sleeping over with you that is taking up his space some things to do make sure your dog emptied his bladder b bedtime punish him consistency each time he does it alternatively close the door so he cant get to the bedroom from now all the best hope u find the real cause soon Housebreaking Dog Urinary incontinence First aid Shaggy dog story Cat Toilet humour Blankets (graphic novel) Insomnia Milton H.
