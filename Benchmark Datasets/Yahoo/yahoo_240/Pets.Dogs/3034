crate training where to keep the crates whew made it through the first night of crate training two puppies originally we planned to keep the crates one for each puppy in the family room where we would spend most of the day after some thought we decided instead to put their crates in our bedroom so that we would hear them wake up and be able to take them out to potty right away in the family room we have an extra large crate more like an exercise pen to contain them when not being watched while the crates in the bedroom seem to be a good idea they woke up twice during the night to potty the family room crate may not be so good while they are only just beginning house training any thoughts we have trained several puppies in crates and by my experience the only way to do it is to have the crates somwhere nearby but preferably not in your room because when they get trained if you do want to move them out of the room they will lose their comfort zone of being with you and they can sometimes start to pee in there cages again if they are that attached to you but ive heard and we have usually taken the dogs out every hours at night i know it is hard but its the best thing to do they also say not to have your puppy in a crate too big because then they might feel like they can go in the corner and if they can lay down and not have to lay in it they might get comfortable doing that i read in a book the dog should be able to lay down and not be cramped but not have too much space my dogs love there cages now because everytime i took them out to pee when they came back there was a treat in there crate and now they go in there during the day and sleep when they want to if they like there crate they wont pee in it it is instincts animals dont go to the bathroom in there home Housebreaking Crate training Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends Skinny Puppy Hamster The Catcher in the Rye The Shining (film) Balto (film) John Cage Toilet Scooby-Doo Sin City Sleeping Murder Scenes from a Memory Toilet humour Daylight saving time Out-of-body experience The Apprentice 2 Dog Fancy Crane Planet of the Daleks Fancy rat One Tree Hill (TV series) Animal Farm Ron and Fez Domestic rabbit Socialization Avenue Q Crash Bandicoot Columbine High School massacre Shaggy dog story Blankets (graphic novel) Magic (illusion) Kitchen Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Beethoven (film) Atomic Kitten Dean Koontz Sleeping car Futurama (TV series - season 5) Skinny Dip The Brady Bunch Milton H.
