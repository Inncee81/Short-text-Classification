how to walk a pulling dog i have a year old male and a month old female maltese my male is deaf don't feel sorry he doesn't need hearing lol he's great well we walk you dogs early morn together i walk the male because my wife can't keep him from trying to run away the female will walk on the side of us or behind and i love it but our male will always try to get out in front and pull from side to side i can't verbaly tell him to stop so i try doing the quick jerk that ceasur milon does well that doesn't work he won't even budge when i do it what can i do to make him listen to me no pun intended the male is a deaf maltese what do you mean that he tries to run away from your wife you should train your dog to walk nicely just with you before trying to walk him with another dog or person pick a place with no distractions use a flat nylon collar and a regular six foot nylon leash get some little tidbits like cheese or dried liver and make sure he is hungry when he is pulling he is not paying attention to you it may be more difficult because he cannot hear you so have extra patience when he surges forward turn around and go in another direction when he follows give him a tidbit and praise him repeat until he is paying attention to you to get the tidbit and praise when he is thoroughly accustomed to this routine take him to different places with increasing numbers of distractions until he is used to paying attention to you when you think he is really solid with you try taking him for a walk with your wife and your other dog dogs are easily distracted and it is too hard to expect them to lean a new behavior and ignore distractions at the same time it would be like having to study while other people are having a party in the room physical restraints like head halters choke collars etc can cause permanent damage if you do not know how to use them properly i think that cesar milan says a dog that is walking in front of you thinks that it is the leader of the pack i don't see how that is true since many dogs run ahead of people in an open area and still come when called dogs don't realize that you don't want them tugging on a leash or zigzagging in front of you it does not come naturally to them so they have to be taught Dog training Aerial (dance move) Dog collar Shaggy dog story Obedience training Hearing impairment Dog Milton H.
