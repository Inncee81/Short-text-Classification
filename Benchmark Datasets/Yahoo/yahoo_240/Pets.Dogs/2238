my pup is a cross between a king shepard and an austrian white shepard is he still considered a pure breed both parents are regestered could he be papered king shepherds were created as a result of mixing over sized german shepherds with malamutes and great pyrenees most king shepherd breeders are willing to breed just about any dog that looks like a king shepherd regardless or it's ancestry or genetic background the only reputable organization that recognizes the breed is the american rare breed association the other organizations recognizing the breed are either registries clubs invented for the purpose of recognizing made up breeds or those invented by the breeders to legitimize the breed in all fairness some of the breeders may honestly be trying to create a new breed and that does start with forming a breed club and writing a written standard white german shepherds aren't usually called austrian white shepherds usually they are called white swiss shepherds berger blanc suisse because they were first recognized as a seperate breed in switzerland since king shepherds are not purebred to begin with and one of your dog's parents is a king shepherd then no your dog is not considered a purebred and can not be papered through any of the reputable breed registries he could be papered through one of the many scam registries that will register a pet rock just so long as you send them their money and if you are interested in showing him in akc performance events you can have him neutered and apply for an ilp number that would allow you to enter him in obedience agility tracking and herding events as a german shepherd ilp dogs must be spayed or neutered though in order to recieve a registration number American Kennel Club Dog breed Dog Dog agility Australian Shepherd Jack Russell Terrier Breed registry Horse Obedience training Domestic rabbit Selective breeding Docking Dog breeding Golden Retriever Cat United Kennel Club Working dog Dog show Belgian Shepherd Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Smooth Collie Labrador Retriever Arabian horse Manx (cat) Akita Inu Chinook (dog) Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Great Dane Schutzhund Breed club Guinea pig Keeshond Pit bull Toy dog Whippet Dobermann Thoroughbred Shetland Sheepdog Rat Terrier Havanese Australian Kelpie Pyrenean Shepherd Airedale Terrier Alaskan Malamute Australian Cattle Dog Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show American Cocker Spaniel Breed standard Domestic goat Puppy mill Animal husbandry Greyhound German Shorthaired Pointer Ferret Anatolian Shepherd Dog Newfoundland (dog) Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Domestication Basset Hound Gray Wolf Boston Terrier Intellectual property Chihuahua (dog) Show cat Pet skunk Herding dog Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Dachshund Appaloosa Yorkshire Terrier Plant breeding Tibetan Mastiff Crufts Toy Fox Terrier Spitz Papillon (dog) Domestic sheep Cockapoo Mastiff Beagle Boxer (dog) British nationality law Terrier Chocobo Housebreaking Dalmatian American Eskimo Dog Rhodesian Ridgeback Nintendogs Civil union Fault (dog) Species Primate
