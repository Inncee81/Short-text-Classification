hi guys i need your opinion on this details are located below ok so yesterday i was walking my cocker spaniel around my block then we founded a puppy with a broken foot and no collar so we took that puppy to the vet and he just had a broken foot so we cured him took care of him yesterday and we gave him food cold fresh water and a roof to sleep in my room with my cocker spaniel so my sister decided to keep the puppy till it's owner claims him and if the owner doesn't want him then we will keep it or my sister more likely so have i been doing well with the puppy so far thanks bye david thanks guys for the advice but we inserted fliers already yes you are doing great only thing you might want to do is contact shelters and the local police to see if anyone has reported the pup missing if someone calls ask them to describe the lost puppy to you and don't give them any hints such as color sex or markings that will help you prevent the puppy going home with someone who isn't it's owner if an owner claims the pup they are obligated to pay you for the vet bills but you are really wonderful for taking in the pup and giving him a safe place to sleep good job Dog Dog training Guinea pig Golden Retriever Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina English Springer Spaniel Ranma __ characters Sin City Hamster American Cocker Spaniel Shark Skinny Puppy Scooby-Doo Karl Rove Lady and the Tramp Paul Is Dead Mixed-breed dog Fancy rat English Cocker Spaniel Garfield Skinny Dip Satchel Paige Pet skunk Beethoven (film) Avenue Q 101 Dalmatians: The Series Procrastination CPU cache Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Crate training Ocean's Twelve Sleeping Murder Jam (TV series) Firefighter The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Great Teacher Onizuka The X-Files (season 1) Married... with Children Housebreaking Microchip implant (animal) The Star Wars Holiday Special USS Flier (SS-250) Anderson Cooper Saki Theory of conduct Saints and Soldiers Spaniel The Lovely Bones Dog show The Catcher in the Rye Spot the Dog Baseball Professional wrestling slang Common cold Pittsburgh Steelers Equilibrium (2002 film) Domestic rabbit Abduction Phenomenon Socialization Singlish Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Columbine High School massacre Nintendogs Milton H.
