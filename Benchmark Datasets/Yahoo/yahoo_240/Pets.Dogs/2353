not a question hopefully this will save at least puppy before i bred my lab i thought i had did all my research and was prepared for anything that could happen well how wrong was i at wks old all of the sudden the litter didn't eat a meal then a nd meal then within no time at all i had a few of them not responding i could see them breathing but could not get them aroused i made the calls to my vet and emergency animal hosiptal i stayed up all night doing what they had told me to do then the next day exhausted and emtionally drained loaded up pups and mom and of to the vets i found out they had worms now i had read about worms and had even talked with my vet about what to do on a number of occasions i was told we did nothing till their wk shots luckily my story has a happy ending within hours everyone was feeling better and i did not lose a pup but my point to sharing this story is this a phone call is free i overreact a lot but i'm glad i did please always remember these little ones count on you the call is free info for tentimesdaily my dog was tested was healthy and i am not cheap trust me from all the money i have put in from the time my dog got pregnant to the time this pups can leave with their new owners i probably won't even break even and i do take care of my animals my point was to let everyone know not just to blow things off at least make a call because you don't know how serious it can be you should never assume that just because someone asked a question or makes a comment on here that they are stupid they might be trying to get other people to give their opnions who have been thru the same things well said redrock good luck to you and the puppies to all the people who are novice breeders think about these remarks and always worm your puppies from the age of two weeks and every two weeks thereafter until they go to their new owners when their vet will put them on a worming regime for their new puppy this will save you from going through the trauma that redrock has been through always worm the dam week after worming the puppies each time because she will probably have ingested the worms when she cleaned up after her pups do this until they are completely weaned don't buy otc worming preparations they don't work and can make the puppies very sick always ask your vet for a prescription Dog Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Theory of conduct Pet skunk Kodocha God Emperor of Dune Housebreaking The Ashlee Simpson Show Hamster EastEnders Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Dog training The Amber Spyglass Gray Wolf Breed registry Big Brother UK series 6 The Apprentice 2 Cat Characters in the Smurfs Cindy Sheehan Golden Retriever Insulin 613 mitzvot Dobermann Pitaten Ron and Fez First aid Syphon Filter Rent (musical) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Philip J.
