i clicker trained my dog to fear obeying commands and treats help i have a month old papillon and he's extremely intelligent i taught him the few commands that he knows in one training session each he's very bright and learns quickly i recently got a clicker to train him further however after only using it about times meaning clicks he got scared of the sound and therefore the treat that followed now if i tell him to sit or do anything he's hesitant because he is scared that a loud sound will follow i've never used treats as a reward for him before only toys the toys have worked very well is there hope for clicker training him i know it's a very effective training method so i'd like to make it work why is it because you heard about it and you figured you should try it the dog was doing well before the clicker what made you get one why switch from the toy to food you had something that worked for you and had to go mess with it now you will have to go back and start again from the beginning good luck Dog training Obedience training Schutzhund Housebreaking Horse breaking Reinforcement Dog agility Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Hearing impairment Stuttering Papillon (dog) Remote control RuneScape cheats Shaggy dog story MapleStory Tenshinhan Kodocha Socialization Great Ape language 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piano Care Bears USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Social rule Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde Blood on the Tracks Dog intelligence Falconry Quotation mark Traumatic incident reduction Bart chalkboard gags John Bright Strap-on dildo Toy Story 2 Cetacean intelligence English grammar Snake charming Scouting Great Teacher Onizuka Psychoanalysis The Time Machine Fancy rat The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Maison Ikkoku Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Syberia Battle of the Somme (1916) Klik Aphasia Chesapeake Bay Retriever Comanche Toy Border Terrier Tears for Fears The Death Gate Cycle Scarlet Witch Archery Sola fide Chinese New Year Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Toy dog Fox hunting Everwood Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Romulus and Remus Psychology Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Catechism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus John Wesley Alan Arnett McLeod Angel One (TNG episode) Autism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Urinary incontinence Spitz X10 (industry standard) Reiki Pitaten Cognitive science Royal Assent Pug Twelve Swords of Power Toy train Late Night with Conan O'Brien Avenue Q Logic Lionel Corporation M16 (rifle) Pinball Kakapo Computer and video game genres Charles Grandison Finney Serialism
