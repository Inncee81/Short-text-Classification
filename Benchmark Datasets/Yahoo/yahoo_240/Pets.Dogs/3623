my male dog growls at our puppy we got a female puppy about a month ago and our yr old male dog still growls at her and will have nothing to do with her what can i do to show him that she is here for good and can potentially be his companion i failed to add that my older dog recently lost his companion she was hit by a car but seems to have resumed his position in the house and i am pretty sure that he is done grieving but he is used to having another dog around and still growls at our week old puppy he hasn't gone much furture then nipping her hello i have went threw this many times with puppy's what i did is sat down on the floor and petted my older dog to relax him then i brought the puppy over and layed it on the other side of my lap or in front depending on if u have a big lap dog you can also hold the puppy and do this too to let them associate with each other then ever time the older dog started to growl i would tell them no you be nice to the puppy and try and pet them together and talk to them like you always do don't change your tone just a little sterner when you tell the older dog no i would give this a few days the older dog will take some time to come around you need to show the older dog that it is not being replaced do the same routine every day but bring the puppy along you will need a lot of paitions and be firm keep the same routine and rules to help reinforce that nothing is going to change and this will help the puppy also learn what you want it to do you also have to remember their is a pack ranking and the older dog will also growl at the puppy at some time it is like they are telling them no or leave me alone this will be expected but you will be able to tell the different between no and i don't except you sooner or later they will start to be pals games i found help reinforce play and excepting is fetch and tug of war depending how big your puppy is i hope this helps good luck Dog training Obedience training Housebreaking Dog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Beethoven (film) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Aerial (dance move) Norway national football team Dog agility Eddie Guerrero Nintendogs The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Ron and Fez Blonde on Blonde Socialization Late Night with Conan O'Brien Dog show Gerald Durrell Skinny Puppy Sick Puppy Indianapolis 500 Game show Scooby-Doo Tai shogi Garfield Reservoir Dogs Poker jargon Badminton German Shepherd Dog Shetland Sheepdog President (game) RuneScape quests Kakapo Baseball Ayrton Senna Volleyball Billboard Hot 100 Sydney Riot of 1879 Into the West (miniseries) Milton H.
