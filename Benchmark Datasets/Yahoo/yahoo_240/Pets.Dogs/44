new puppy and older dog i recently got a month old rescue raccoon hound to add to my househould i currently have a year old male unneutered american staffordshire terrier the issue is that the puppy growls bites and barks at the pit is this puppy just being overly aggressive in play or does it have an aggression issue with other dogs the pit keeps play biting her and pinning her down to the ground and she whelps and growls and bites at his face but keeps coming back for more i can't determine if this is an aggression issue or merely rough play or a vocal hound dog ughh dogs can be pretty rough for what they only consider playing we might see it differently it sounds like your older staffie doesn't have much of a problem with the pup but you have to socialize your puppy to what's acceptable playing growling although they might just be playing is an unacceptable form of play as it can be a warning for aggression if anything you should make the puppy stop growling as this dominant trait should not be a desired one if the rest of what she's doing is getting a little out of hand then separate them with a command enough or sit usually works well give them a few minutes to settle down and if you allow them they can play again my dogs especially the bigger ones the rottie shepherd mix my pit and husky are pretty rough with each other but it's all in fun and i've never had to separate them from playing they had to learn how to be more gentle when i got my yorkie Dog Dog training Skinny Puppy American Pit Bull Terrier Mixed-breed dog German Shepherd Dog Pit bull Shetland Sheepdog Guinea pig Housebreaking Dog show Gray Wolf Jack Russell Terrier Labrador Retriever Scooby-Doo Vegeta Staffordshire Bull Terrier Breed standard Fox hunting West Highland White Terrier Rottweiler Pete the Pup Brian Griffin Schutzhund Obedience training Socialization Beethoven (film) Basset Hound Volleyball Fast bowling Whippet Bull Terrier Alaskan husky Our Gang Boston Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Smooth Collie Great Dane Docking Havanese Puppy mill Cat Rabies Krypto the Superdog Border Terrier Irish Wolfhound Blood (computer game) Golden Retriever English Cocker Spaniel Yorkshire Terrier Iditarod The Amazing Race Pet skunk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Death metal American Kennel Club Fair use Mange Golf Feminism Skye Terrier Tag Green Day Compact disc Kim Possible Social rule Textile manufacturing Siberian Husky Shaggy dog story Road Rovers Microphone Taikyoku shogi The Ashlee Simpson Show Spot the Dog American Eskimo Dog Mastiff Death grunt Terrier Ron and Fez Music of Albania Working dog Fox Terrier (Wire) MP3 Scent hound Professional wrestling aerial techniques Extraordinary Machine Komondor Equine conformation Animal communication Tenshinhan Zoophilia Poker jargon The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Into the West (miniseries) Physical attractiveness Tom Waits Hamster
