how old does i puppy have to be to take a flea bath help i would advise you to not give any pup a flea bath because of the harsh chemicals try a dawn bath instead go out and get some dawn detergent and bathe the little guy as long as he is over weeks of age this can be done safely if he is over weeks you can also use the frontline spray remember if your little one has fleas you need to not only rid him of fleas but you also have to rid the environment of fleas or he will keep getting them once he is weeks you can start him on the topical flea tick preventative frontline Guinea pig Red Hot Chili Peppers Dog Hyperthermia Flea Shampoo Dog training Pepper spray Tungiasis Hamster Urticaria Swimming pool 101 Dalmatians: The Series Sewage treatment Tick Dracunculiasis Lyme disease Dishwasher Heartworm Eczema Dry cleaning Sulfur Hair Bathing Breastfeeding Washing machine Soap Malaria Meriones unguiculatus USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Cat Jade Emperor Savage Dawn Fire fighting Mother's Milk Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Borax Bhajan Unit 731 Sunscreen Plagues of Egypt Continuation War Acne Hydrogen peroxide The Tick DDT Chronic fatigue syndrome Pesticide Sauna Flea market Captain Beefheart Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh Army Group Centre Common cold __Mucha Lucha!
