is there a way to at bedtime i let the dog in the crate he likes the crate but wants to go outside to eliminate and if i leave the room he'd whimper and bark his breed has a deep loud bark my question is i'm in a habit of responding to dogs if they make noise as sweet and calm but firm as possible how to get him to stay in his crate alone until i go to bed his crate is next to my bed i want to get to the point where he won't whine if i leave the room i know dogs are pack animals also i live with some people who wake up easily and is annoyed by barking some of my dogs sleep in crates and some don't but i don't crate anyone till bedtime we have a nighttime ritual that makes that all fairly easy treats and crates if you must crate him before bedtime then start practicing relaxing in the crate in the daytime put him in his crate for short periods of time during the day ignore the barking and let him out only after he relaxes and is quiet Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Insomnia Sleep Urinary incontinence Sleep debt Shaggy dog story Cat Narcolepsy Dog Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Gray Wolf Diazepam Dog intelligence Bruxism Noise pollution RuneScape quests The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pok__mon Live!
