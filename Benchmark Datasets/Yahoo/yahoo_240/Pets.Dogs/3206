how do i stop my dog being aggressive to people who come to me house my year old basenji who i adopted off the street when she was is rather aggressive to people who come to my house she has never bitten anyone but she does bare her teeth and snarl we live overseas and for some reason she also barks at motorbikes too but not all of them usually just ones with males or old people on them and i am worried that people will accidently hurt her please help thanks dp i have tried to train her this was my last resort dog trainers are out of the question as i said i live overseas and they arent around here thanks for your answer anyway though firstly it is your dogs job to alert the pack leader to a possible danger so say thank you then calmly tell the dog enough if you raise your voice telling the dog to shut up you are reinforcing to it that there is a problem or danger your body language must leave the dog in no doubt that you have the situation under control and that there is no threat Dog Social rule Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Police dog God Emperor of Dune Working dog Plame affair Time Crisis 3 Tobacco smoking Basenji Manual transmission Wolverine (comics) The Apprentice 2 Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Rocko's Modern Life Pok__mon Live!
