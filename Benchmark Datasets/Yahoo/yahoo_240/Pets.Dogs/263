how much does surgery on average cost to repair a puppy's broken leg hello everyone i have a week old pug puppy who last night jumped off the sofa and broke his leg we immediately took him to an emergency animal hospital where they were able to x ray him and determine that his front left leg is fractured in two different areas we had the vet send the x rays to a radiologist who recommends surgery but who also thinks that casting will have a chance of working we ended up going with the casting due to financial reasons we have already paid about for last night's expenses we'll be waiting another two weeks to determine if his leg is healing correctly in the meantime have any of you had a young dog with a broken leg if so did you do surgery and how much did it cost you we were not expecting this huge expense to come up and will definitely have the surgery done if it is not healing correctly but any cost info would be greatly appreciated before i get an actual estimate thanks oh no i'm not saying that i don't want to have the surgery done in fact i'm planning to if the casting doesn't show healing within the first two weeks no matter what the costs are i'm just interested to see what your opinions or experiences are for this situation especially any costs that you incurred for a similar situation so i have an idea before getting the surgery estimate if need be thank you to everyone in advance it really depends on what surgical technique is appropriate for his injuries as this will determine what sort of equipment is needed fractures in animals this young can come with their own set of problems e g if the growth plates of the bones are involved which requres specialist surgery to give the dog a good outcome from the way the vet was talking is the surgery something that they can do themselves or something that needs to be done by an orthopaedic surgeon at a guess i would say that you'd be up for a minimum of maybe around but that could stretch a lot further maybe if the procedure is going to be a complicated one the cost covers things like the general anaesthetic pain medication the equipement used in surgery etc and unfortunately it all adds up very quickly especially when you're then paying for the skills of a good surgeon on top of that i'd also suggest that if you haven't already you get the emergency vets to send the details back to your own vet emergency vets can be very very expensive to deal with good luck and i hope that the casting works for him if it's a relatively straightforward fracture he should be fine young pups heal amazingly well with just a little bit of assistance o Orthopedic surgery Hip fracture Medicine Bone fracture Dog training Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight training Triage Equine conformation Childbirth History of intersex surgery Microeconomics Dog Traditional Chinese medicine Carpal tunnel syndrome Theory of conduct Penis Guinea pig Scientology beliefs and practices Stroke Stomach cancer Insurance Anesthesia Scar Health insurance Inflation Surgery Phimosis Cryonics Transsexuality Cancer Docking Ferret Adjustable gastric band Extreme Programming Urinary incontinence Colorectal cancer Dentistry Law of value Emergency department Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Kodocha Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Cholecystectomy Organ transplant Publicly funded medicine Veterinarian Dog agility Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus LASIK Pneumonia Lung cancer GED Myocardial infarction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Physician Final Fantasy XI Supply and demand Plastic surgery Wound healing phases Malignant melanoma Scientific method CPU cache Education in the People's Republic of China Legal aspects of transsexualism Chiropractic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Radiosurgery Pet skunk Keynesian economics Paget's disease of bone Hypnosis Radiation therapy Stress fracture Unemployment National Health Service Renal cell carcinoma Aortic dissection Babe Ruth Sex assignment Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Abortion History of male circumcision Parachuting Emergency preparedness Fluoroscopy Anterior cruciate ligament Lethal injection Cardiothoracic surgery Welding Randomness Cryptorchidism
