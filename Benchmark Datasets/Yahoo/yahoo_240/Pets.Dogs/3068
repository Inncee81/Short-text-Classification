dog shows i read somewhere that there are other alternatives to cesar millan's techniques as some believe he's abusive and making them fear you which i don't believe but i'm inexperienced there was one person that said he's out of date and there are ways to teach new behaviours how are there shows like that i think cesar milan is an awesome behaviorist you know what i like about caesar milan he doesnt buy into trend or gimmick training this positive reinforcement training is bs what happens when the resource is sweeter than the reward people buy into what sounds nice whether it is effective or not there is a market for pure positive reinforcement and you have petsmart training that sells this because they cant teach correction if someone abused thier dog they could blame the training classes and sue positive reinforcement is good for a pack driven low prey drive dog but these are not the people who need his help i see so many people that need real help with thier dogs and they are not getting real answers dogs need correction it is a part of training and a natural part of how they communicate with eachother cesar milan does not hurt the dogs in any way he is comunicating to them in a way they understand and he is saving thier lives do you know how many dogs are surrendered to shelters because they think the dogs cannot be trained a poorly timed reward can be just as harmful if not more than a poorly times correction cesar milan specializes in aggression and serious behavioral issues as you have heard him say on his show that these dogs are not happy they are in a stressful state when there is a leader they can be comfortable and happy they do not fear him they respect him they are happy that someone is in control i do motivational training what motivates drives your dog is verbal praise enough food favorite toy teach your dog that when he gives you the desired response he will be rewarded food is used to teach your dog you should not be carrying treats around for his entire life after the learning phase there is a phase where you introduce correction correction is not abuse and it should not hurt or scare your dog i would use a prong collar like cesar on a dog that has a high drive and is difficult for the owner to control it does add some discomfort but it does not hurt the dog if a herding dog had thier paw stepped on and they backed off they would not be a very good working dog they are bred to work through discomfort and sometimes you need a tool to get thier attention but this is completely different than what cesar is doing he is working with behavioral issue i train people to prevent the issues or for thier dogs to understand commands unless you are dealing with an issue like aggression excessive barking separation anxiety etc you probably only need a group class never sign up before you watch the class i would suggest going to an advanced class to see the end results of the training if you do have a behavioral issue i suggest you find yourself someone like cesar and not waste your money on others Dog Second language acquisition Motivation Scientology beliefs and practices Obedience training Autism Cat Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Housebreaking Happiness Psychoanalysis Social psychology Drug addiction Theory of conduct Dog agility Narcissism Anxiety The Apprentice 2 Alcoholics Anonymous Contract Anger management German Shepherd Dog Urinary incontinence Alexander Technique Infantilism Divorce Clinical depression Simone Weil Nicomachean Ethics Rape Fox hunting Working dog Behaviorism Strategic management Schutzhund Self-harm Aikido Evil Unemployment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Spanking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Logic Bipolar disorder Annuity Surveillance Gray Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
