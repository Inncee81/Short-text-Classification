best food for a shih tzu puppy he's about months old what about when he gets older should he have different food then how often should i feed him this will be my first puppy and i'm a little nervous wow i can't believe no one answered this question yet a day old question about food with no answers wow food is usually one of the hot button issues around here okay anyway on to your question a lot of it depends on you and what you believe about what dogs should eat there are three main feeding regimes that people use commercial dog food raw food sometimes referred to as barf which stands for bones and raw food or biologically appropriate raw food depending on who you ask and home cooked food commercial dog food is by far the easiest and most popular method a raw diet has never been proven to be any better or worse than a high quality commercial diet of kibble dry food but it is a huge point of debate often with very passionate arguments in both directions if you are interested in feeding raw you should read both sides of the issue and decide for yourself a popular pro raw website is http www rawmeatybones com a popular anti raw website is http www secondchanceranch com training raw meat index html the main reason people feed raw is that they don't feel that commercial diets are safe and healthy for their pet the main reason people are against it is that raw meat can harbor parasites and make your dog very sick for people who like the idea of controlling everything that goes into their dog's food but don't like the idea of feeding raw you get the home cooked diet here's a website with some good reading about that method http www petdiets com ok now let's say that like most people you prefer the convenience and price of feeding a commercial diet it's good to be concerned about the recent pet food recall and knowing what kinds of garbage go into a lot of pet food you have to educate yourself as to what the ingredients mean and then make the best choice that fits your thoughts beliefs addresses your concerns and is within your budget of course the healthier foods are more expensive but even the really expensive stuff is cheap in comparison especially for a small dog that doesn't eat much now that being said here's the main thing you should know about ingredients in pet food corn and wheat are generally considered fillers that are not very nutritious for a dog and just add bulk to make them feel full meat comes in various grades chicken is chicken meat only chicken meal is meat that has been ground up and dehydrated before arriving at the factory chicken by product meal is everything but the feathers it contains organs including lungs stomach and intestines feet heads etc it's pretty disgusting stuff also you should know that the standards for ingredients in pet food are much lower than that for humans and farmers will just meet those standards for instance i am making up numbers but let's say a grain in pet food is allowed to have contaminants and mold if a farmer has a silo full of moldy grain he doesn't dump it out he mixes it into the good grain until the whole thing is right at nasty so if you get a food that uses human grade ingredients they are held to the high standards of the food you eat with that in mind most of the foods you get at the big chain pet stores even the premium foods like science diet and pro plan use a lot of low grade ingredients and by products and basically all of them were subject to the recall a better choice would be one of the many companies that refuse to use by products use human grade ingredients and use grains like rice and barley instead of corn and wheat some of the most popular and easiest to find are wellness http www oldmotherhubbard com wellness dog index html solid gold http www solidgoldhealth com products showcat php cat and innova http www innovapet com products i personally recommend one of these three search on their websites for stores near you that sell them then look at the ingredients on the puppy food or just look around their website in general and decide which one you like best also you may find other excellent brands at the stores that carry these so feel free to look at the ingredients and make your own decision he should eat puppy food until he's stopped growing which for most dogs is about year old but for a small dog like a shih tzu may be only months just watch for when his appetite decreases and he is past the gangly puppy stage then start switching him over to the adult food by mixing it in with the puppy food a little at a time and slowly increasing the amount of the adult food and decreasing the amount of the puppy food until you are feeding almost completely adult food and you run out of puppy food best of luck with your puppy i'm glad you are taking an interest in learning about the best things for him Microeconomics Nutrition Dog food Chocolate Hamburger Milk Japanese cuisine Egg (food) Dairy Bread Cat Sugar
