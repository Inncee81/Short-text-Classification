how do i get my dog to like water he's a golden retriever and he dosent like water we put him in the pool once but he swam out and didnt want to come back in i just want him to like the water i'm sorry but i don't think you can change the fears of dog just like you can't change the fears of people some people are afraid of water their whole life that could be the same with dogs my advice would to be to keep working with him let him in for a few minutes at a time then take him out until he gets used to it if he is still afraid don't make him get back in if you were afraid you wouldn't want to be forced into water just have patience with your dog and accept that he's not meant for the water something could have happened when he was a puppy that makes him hate the water find another activity for him to do and keep showing him that you love him Golden Retriever Dog Mixed-breed dog Paranoia Agent Diving Snoopy Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Ecco the Dolphin Dobermann Real Love (song) Labrador Retriever Steven Wright Triathlon Working dog The Death Gate Cycle Kim Possible Nintendogs Dave Lister Swimming pool Socialization Obedience training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) German Shepherd Dog Swimming English grammar Reservoir Dogs Dog training Cliff Richard Jon Secada Discordianism Honey and Clover The Pet Sounds Sessions Dean Koontz Sheikh Abdullah 613 mitzvot Time Out of Mind Housebreaking Portuguese Water Dog Ayyavazhi mythology Guide dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Brian Griffin Australian Cattle Dog Breaststroke RuneScape quests Drowning Neighbours Dog show Graham Kennedy Teacher's Pet (Disney) German commando frogmen Philip J.
