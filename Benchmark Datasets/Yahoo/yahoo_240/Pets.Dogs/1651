aaarrghhh my puppy wont stop digging in our bathroom trashcan i have an month old shihtzu and every day we find her in the bathroom eating toilet paper we even bought those with lids but that doesn't stop her she just knocks it over and the lid falls right off help here are two possible solutions put the trashcan somewhere where you will pass it frequently during the day every time you pass by give it a little kick and tell it it's bad i know it sounds crazy but if you get really mad at the trash can and call it bad frequently enough most dogs won't want to be associated with it we did this with our kitchen trash can and our puppy walks way around it now if that doesn't work you can try this but make sure you are there to supervise and have a lot of water on hand take a wrapper from a stick of butter and put cayenne pepper powder all over it all over it just layer it on really thick then put it on the top of the trash can the butter will be irresistible to the dog but when they go to get it they'll get the pepper instead make sure there is plenty of water available Fecal incontinence Japanese toilet Toilet Cajun cuisine Dustbin Shaggy dog story Euphemism Hot dog Toilet humour Housebreaking Skinny Puppy Dog Dairy Menstrual cup Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jackass: The Movie Ramen Paul Is Dead Bread Futurama (TV series - season 5) Textile manufacturing RuneScape quests Richard Chase Russian joke Sushi Internet phenomenon Inspector Gadget Crate training Fire extinguisher In-N-Out Burger Ron and Fez Invader Zim Japanese tea ceremony Pottery Animal Crossing Garfield Toilet paper Social rule Kodocha Knots Landing EastEnders Socialization Kitchen MAD Magazine Hey Jude Hamster Poker jargon Joke Philip J.
