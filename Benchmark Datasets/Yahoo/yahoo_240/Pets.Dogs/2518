what puppy should i get i want a little puupy that has a lot of energy all puppies are little and when they are awake they have lots of energy what you probably want is a 'puppy' that will grow into a 'full grown small dog' that has lots of energy guess what you may get any purebred or any 'small sized mutt' and you'll get a dog with lots of energy for some 'odd reason' it's the 'really large dogs' that make the best 'apartment dogs' because they love to rest even in an apartment when they are all alone i don't know you and don't know if you have any 'other requirement' but i can tell you the best way to get 'the right puppy for you ' go to a place where you can 'sit down' with all of the puppies around you awake some will sniff you and walk away some may not even want to sniff you wait and be very quiet and very patient if no puppy tries to 'climb into your lap' or 'licks you everywhere' your puppy is not in that bunch but when that does happen that is your puppy i've had many dogs and helped many people pick the 'right dog' for them and the 'best fit' was always when the puppy chose the person and 'just couldn't go away' and maybe even 'cried' when the person got up to leave it may have been the cutest dog or it may have been the 'ugliest mutt alive' but once that person took their puppy home and spent some time with it they knew one thing that was their puppy and it would be their dog until the day it died good luck and let your 'puppy' choose you and have a 'good long life together ' Dog training Mixed-breed dog Housebreaking Time Out of Mind Philip J.
