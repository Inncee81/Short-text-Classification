if my puppy gets parvo disease can my other dogs catch this disease do they all need to go to the vet and is this a neurological disease parvo is a virus that attacks the lining of the digestive system it causes dogs and puppies to not be able to absorb nutrients or liquids puppies are especially prone to it because they have an immature immune system when dogs and puppies contract parvo they often have diarrhea vomiting and lethargy usually they stop eating and develop a bloody foul smelling liquid stool symptoms usually begin with a high fever lethargy depression and loss of appetite secondary symptoms appear as severe gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting and bloody diarrhea in many cases dehydration shock and death follow parvovirus is characterized by severe bloody diarrhea and vomiting high fever and lethargy the diarrhea is particularly foul smelling and is sometimes yellow in color parvo can also attack a dog's heart causing congestive heart failure this complication can occur months or years after an apparent recovery from the intestinal form of the disease puppies who survive parvo infection usually remain somewhat un healthy and weak for life canine parvovirus is carried by dogs dogs with the typical diarrhea that parvovirus causes shed the virus as well it can last a long time in the environment perhaps as long as months or longer generally it takes days from the time of exposure for dogs and puppies to start showing symptoms and to test positive for parvo parvo is highly contagious to unprotected dogs and the virus can remain infectious in ground contaminated with fecal material for five months or more if conditions are favorable extremely hardy most disinfectants cannot kill the virus however chlorine bleach is the most effective and inexpensive agent that works and is commonly used by veterinarians the ease with which infection with parvo can occur in any unvaccinated dog must be stressed the virus is extremely hardy in the environment parvo can be brought home to your dog on shoes hands and even car tires it can live for many months outside the animal any areas that are thought to be contaminated with parvo should be thoroughly washed with chlorine bleach diluted ounce per quart of water dogs and puppies can contract parvo even if they never leave their yards parvo virus despite what you might hear is not an airborne virus it is excreted in the feces of infected dogs and if someone human dog bird etc steps in or otherwise comes in contact with the excrement the possibility for contamination is great if you come in contact with parvovirus a strong solution of bleach and water does kill the virus so you can wash your shoes and clothes even your hands with it to reduce the risk of infecting your dog rest assured that parvovirus is specific to dogs alone and cannot be transmitted to humans or other pets of a different species such as cats without intense treatment the victims of parvo die of dehydration treatment generally consists of iv or sub cutaneous fluids and antibiotics there is no cure veterinarians can only treat the symptoms palliatively and try to keep the dog alive by preventing dehydration and loss of proteins as there is no cure for any virus treatment for parvo is mostly that of supporting the different systems in the body during the course of the disease this includes giving fluids regulating electrolyte levels controlling body temperature and giving blood transfusions when necessary dogs who have survived parvo can get it again in the case of some puppies a puppy testing negative for parvo one day could succumb to the virus within a matter of days it strikes fast and without mercy i have treated and saved many dogs from this deadly disease at home with pepto bismol and electolytes gatorade or pedialyte you must give them this combination every minutes i used a syringe w o needle to give the puppies these fluids i have had very very good luck with this because i couldn't afford the treatment from the vet most people will tell you to take them to the vet keep a very close eye on your other dogs if they show any symptoms start that immediately and hopefully it will save their lives we will be praying for you and your dogs Biological warfare Leukemia Myocardial infarction Gout Breastfeeding Campylobacteriosis
