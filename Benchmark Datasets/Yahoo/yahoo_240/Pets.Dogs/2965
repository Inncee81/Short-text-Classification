how can i convince my mom i have a dog already but we get kinda busy sometimes and i feel sorry for my dog so i got the idea to get another dog to keep him company my dad agreed but my mom doesn't so we're kinda stuck i want to convince my mom to agree to having a nd dog i would love to have a nd dog or even foster one my dad is on a business trip so i can't get any help from him what should i do please give me your best answers thanks by being busy i mean going to school and things like that that doesn't mean that i don't play with my dog i just don't get to play with him as much as i want this may sound harsh but if you say your to busy for one dog already isn't asking for a second one a bit bad maybe taking more time for the first dog will help prove to your mother that you are responsible enough for a second dog also you could check around at local shelters to see what sort of foster programs they have i think the best thing you can do is to educate yourself on the fostering of dogs and the programs nearest you things you may need to know are things like will they provide food do you need to pay for the dogs medical needs etc that way when you sit down with your mother she will know you are serious and she will take you seriously Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete Grandview, U.S.A.
