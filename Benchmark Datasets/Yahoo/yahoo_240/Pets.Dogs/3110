how do newfoundlands rescue people out of water i've heard newfoundlands are hard to go swimming with because they will try to drag you out of the water how do they do that do they bite you or nudge or push i think it sounds like a funny site to see and i have heard stories of real rescues from newfoundlands they sound like amazing animals the newfoundland is exceptionally well built for water work he has a water resistant double coat a strong muscled tail which is used as a rudder webbed feet ears that cling close to the head and a strong swimming style resembling a breast stroke it is a riot if you ever see a newfie in action the newf takes his life guarding responsibilities very seriously quite often circling around and herding his family to shore they have an uncanny ability to sense when someone in the water needs help whether a family member or stranger an will immediately swim out to assist some dogs circle around the victim until they feel the person grab onto them then head to shore others will take the person's arm in their mouth and proceed to tow them to safety that way my newfs will rescue drowning insects in their pool very cute they have also been known to pull my nephews out of their in ground pool at pool parties p s newfoundlands are still used today to help patrol the beaches in britain france and italy Swimming Drowning Diving Dog Breaststroke Working dog Backstroke Air Florida Flight 90 Lifeguard Front crawl Arland D.
