why are my boston terriers eating grass roots have had mom yrs and male pup weeks for about weeks now everytime they go outside they tear the grass up and eat the roots at the dirt level i thought maybe it was because they were raised with a breeder and didnt have much grass time but now i'm getting concerned that they are missing a supplement of course cute as pie pup might just be doing it cuz mom is they're going back to the vet for a check up soon but thought someone out there could satisfy my concern curiosity keep in mind they are eating the root part right above the dirt dogs who come from breeder or puppy mills often have odd behaviors my dogs eat grass from time to time too if they are going it all the time you might want to call the vet and explain it while dogs who run wild eat grass and who knows what else all the time it probably is not hurting them but it would be best if you could get them to stop as you never know what other animal has been in your yard also make sure they are up to date on vaccinations in case something with parvo or something else would come in your yard you sound like a pet owner who cares about their pets and takes them to the vet so i am sure they are up to date Guinea pig Dog Pet skunk Garfield Ferret Domestic rabbit Dog training Docking Gray Wolf Microchip implant (animal) Kodocha Labrador Retriever Cat Pet store Dog show American Pit Bull Terrier Socialization Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fancy rat Dog breeding Coprophagia Kangaroo Housebreaking Rabies Elephant Coyote Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mixed-breed dog Domestication Border Terrier New York Giants German Shepherd Dog Pet Animal euthanasia Shaggy dog story Excel Saga Livestock Internet phenomenon Beethoven (film) Jon Secada Golden Retriever Nintendogs Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dobermann Pit bull Ron and Fez The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Canary Brian Griffin Breed registry Whippet Jack Russell Terrier Chicken Shark 101 Dalmatians: The Series Havanese Obedience training American Eskimo Dog Dog agility Dachshund Breeders' Cup English Springer Spaniel Characters in the Smurfs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Veterinarian Our Gang Shetland Sheepdog Welsh Terrier Alaskan husky Homer Simpson Rabbit Road Rovers Hip dysplasia The Time Machine Krypto the Superdog Tenterfield Terrier Boston Terrier Rat Characters of Naruto Sheep husbandry Kitten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tag Dog breed Neighbours Best of Breed Calvin and Hobbes Australian Cattle Dog Pack (canine) Sin City The Fairly OddParents Animal shelter Discus (fish) Bull Terrier Skunk Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pete the Pup
