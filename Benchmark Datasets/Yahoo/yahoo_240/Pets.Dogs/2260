whats an easy way to teach disobedient dogs tricks without having to pay for an expensive trainer i'm willing to train them myself though i have great dane boxer mix and bichon shitzu spell mix ok i can not go to any websites or places to teach my dogs because i am only and have about in change lol get their attention with a treat sit put one hand on his back towards his butt and one hand have a hold of his collar as you say sit pull up on the collar and push down on his back do this about ten times a day and give him affection after he does it then after you do it try making him do it its easy only took my puppy ten minutes to learn how to sit down teach this to him after sit get him in sitting position put one hand on his back and grab a hold of both of his front paws as you say down push his butt down and lift his paws out from under him and lay them flat on the ground repeat this is harder for the dog to learn than sit sit stay get him to sit then put your hand in front of his face and say sternly stay keep it in front of him as you place a treat a couple feet in front of him keep telling him to stay and keep your hand in front of his face if he trys to leap forward say no and get him back in his sitting position when he finally stays give him the treat practice daily occaisonally use toys speak what i did was barked sounds weird but just bark at him and say speak soon he will bark after you do when he does give him a treat very easy command for dog to follow on the leash when training a dog on the leash use a leash that does not give the dog the ability to go as far as he pleases wrap leash around hand atleast twice make so the leash is only short enough for him to walk without choking him make sure when he's walking to keep him behind you it shows him that you are the dominant leader dog psychology once he does as you want him too let the leash looser and looser this technique will keep your dog from becoming one of the dogs that pull their owner i have a perfectly trained month old puppy using these techniques i really hope i helped oh and i have a bichon toy poodle mix just remember use treats or chew toys to get their attention when they do it give them affection but keep telling him to do the trick daily so he wont forget best answer peez really need the points signed your freshman friend Aerial (dance move) Obedience training Dog Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Dog agility Professional wrestling throws Powerbomb Shaggy dog story Dog collar Nintendogs Suplex Swingout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breaststroke Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling aerial techniques Kitesurfing Housebreaking Volleyball Parade (military) Professional wrestling match types Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Backstroke Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Boxing Crate training Havanese Glossary of climbing terms Equine conformation Trapping Strap-on dildo RuneScape quests The Apprentice 2 Fancy rat Hazing Tenshinhan Professional wrestling attacks Figure skating Canoe DDT (professional wrestling) Skinny Puppy Internal ballistics Teen Girl Squad Leash Swimming Alexander Technique The Time Machine Drowning Social rule Clicker training Muslim ibn Aqeel Aikido The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Labrador Retriever Montreal Screwjob Mojave people Piledriver (professional wrestling) Lindy Basic Charleston (dance move) World War Three (Doctor Who) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Contender (television series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sail-plan Professional wrestling slang Japanese tea ceremony Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga Basset Hound Paranoia Agent Marching band Ferret Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Amber Spyglass Ocean's Twelve Battle of the Somme (1916) Milton H.
