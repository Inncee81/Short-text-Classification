disobedient lab i have a two year old choclate lab her personality changes alot sometimes she will fetch a ball and return with it everytime sometimes she wil get a ball and run as far away as possiable how do i get her to return the ball everytime also sometimes she gets away how do i get her to come back also also i cant aford obediance school yet also also also thanks for the help i had a golden retriever dog which is the same as a labrador retreiver yes their personality changes a lot but that is the fun of the dog in other words that's what makes the dog so much fun to have is that playful manner that they have we used to throw the ball at it outside in the yard and sometimes the dog would come back to give it to us and other times the dog would run to and away form us as if to make us chase it and and we would then chase it and the dog would have fun zigzaging through the yard palying with us why not try playing with the dog in a similiar fashion the dog does not need to be trained to be an automatic robot to fetch the ball and constantly return it to you as if he were a machine that type of dog has intelligence and personality they like to paly so play with the dog on a regular basis because that is what the dog would do if he had other dog playmates my married sister now has her own family and they have dogs that all paly with each other in the back yard and in the evenings they come inside and go to sleep inside the house all your dog wants is to be played with in a social setting and labs are some fo the best dogs for social interaction with people as long as the dog behave properly to other people and does not destroy anything in the house and you take it outside for it's bodily functions then you should not worry about having to train a dog to to constantly return the ball all the time as i said i will emphasize the point again labs are social dogs and really enjoy playing and running around well spend time palying with the dog run around with the ball and the dog may run after you also and then you can throw the ball and try and chase the dog to retrieve the ball yourself from the dog doing all this in a playful manner will help form and cement a loving bond between human and pet i hope by reading this you many get a different perspective thank you for reading this from a pet lover to another pet lover dogs really are mans best friend as the saying oges Obedience training Labrador Retriever The Fairly OddParents Cray-1 Nintendogs Tag Garfield American football Vegeta Bob and George Philip J.
