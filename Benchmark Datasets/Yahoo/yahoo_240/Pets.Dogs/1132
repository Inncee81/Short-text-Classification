what can or should i do about this i was on vacation until yesterday and left a 'friend' to feed my dog and turtles for me i came home yesterday to find my blinds shredded my window broken my dog missing and his food bowl in the exact place i left it before i went on vacation my neighbors were watching my house for me and said the 'friend' that was supposed to feed my pets never once showed up my other neighbors say that they heard my dog break my window the day before i returned so he was without any food or water for at least a week what can i do i found my dog and he is doing okay and my turtles made it but anything could have happened to them what should i do should i talk to him or give him the cold shoulder or what i at least have to talk to him once to get my house key back but i do not want to have anything more to do with this person any help will be appreciated thanks i am still in a kind of state of shock because i had feelings for this guy and trusted him implicitly i know him well and he can have no possible excuse or reason that could even come close to justifying any of this is there any legal action i can take i am almost certain it was my dog for several reasons the glass was broken from the inside there was lots of galss outside and very little in the house it was a realtively small window and there was nothing missing from my house except my poor dog i even called the 'friend' and asked how my pets were the day before i came back and he told me a blatant lie i feel so awful because i should have known something was wrong when he said my dog was growling at him my dog loved him like he was a part of my family he would never ever growl at him unless he was physically hurting me or my family do just what you said talk to him once get the key back and then tell him where to go he's a cruel heartless person and someone should lock him in a room with no food or water for a week Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dog training Theory of conduct Big Brother UK series 6 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Fancy Crane Nico Robin Friends Social rule The Death Gate Cycle RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jon Secada Garfield Good Times Hamster Meat Loaf Neighbours W.I.T.C.H.
