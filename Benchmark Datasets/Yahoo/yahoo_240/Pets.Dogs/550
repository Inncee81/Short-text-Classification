chi owners i might get a chihuahua do they bark a lot are they really hard to potty train did you ltter box train yours could you tell me about yours thnxxx i used to have a chihuahua when i was younger his name was chico i got him when he was weeks old and he was a very very very smart dog almost to smart for his own good chihuahua's can be very hard to train on anything one mistake that we made with chico was trying to litter train him one day my grandpa came in the house and started to train him to go outside he got confused and just peed wherever he felt like going my suggestion to you is if your going to get a chihuahua then you should start out by potty traing them outside not on newspaper or the litter box because it's very easy for a dog to become confused he wasn't very yappy infact he didn't really bark unless he was playing i hope i answered your questions good luck Housebreaking Dog Shetland Sheepdog Nintendogs Piccolo Junior Saga Dog agility Domestic rabbit The Apprentice 2 Ren and Stimpy Crate training SpongeBob SquarePants Jeopardy! in culture 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dog training Toilet humour Carl Barks Social rule Havanese Xiaolin Showdown Hamster The Contender (television series) Rocko's Modern Life Poker jargon Keeshond Chihuahua (dog) The Body (Short Story) Pitaten Philosophy of language Artificial selection Game show 1957 World Series Kurt Cobain Labrador Retriever Toy dog Sub-Zero Garfield Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Scrooge McDuck The Ashlee Simpson Show Mad Money The Pet Sounds Sessions Ice hockey Don Rosa Chobits characters Fox hunting Ferret The Monkees Frogman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ronald D.
