my dog's fur smells so bad every day after doggie day care why is this and what can i do he is a mini australian shepherd i was told i shouldn't bathe him more than once per month so as to not dry out his skin also the other dogs don't seem to get this putrid smell on them i've got a german shepherd x and he goes to doggy day care sometimes too and also gets a bad odour i'm thinking is it something in the shepherd coats germans are the same bathe sparingly to preserve the oils in their coats is your dog's coat stripped or clippered since i got my boys coat stripped he has been a lot better odour wise also try a brushing each day with a little baby power it stimulates the oils at the roots of the coat and helps prevent the bacteria from old oils from building up good luck edit to all the people bagging out doggy daycare i have a german shepherd x border collie they are about the two most intelligent breeds and they are working dogs a dog this intelligent and requiring that much stimulation can't be left alone every day for long periods of time they trash the house the asker has a shepherd too also a working dog jeez don't assume you know someone elses dog better than they do German Shepherd Dog American Eskimo Dog Border Collie Fancy rat Halitosis Livestock Obedience training Tasmanian Devil Herding dog Shetland Sheepdog Basset Hound German Shorthaired Pointer Social rule Working dog Airedale Terrier Police dog Belgian Shepherd Dog Havanese Poodle Customs and etiquette of Japan Australian Shepherd 21 July 2005 London bombings Smooth Collie Pyrenean Shepherd Guinea pig Dobermann Hemp Psoriasis Cat Coat (dog) Hamster Urinary incontinence Joke Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Dog show Tofu Strap-on dildo Dog training Day care Comanche Akita Inu Skye Terrier Eczema The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Water purification Perfume Tooth Philip J.
