i have a neighbor and they have a dog they never play with him and he's always laying in the same spot it's on the porch and i never see his owners around should i just let him be or do something about it one time i tried playing with him he's really friendly but they told me not to and they don't even play with him that's what made me mad so should i just leave him alone or call somebody they've had him for about years amanda you sound like you are caring to animals if the owners are doing something wrong such as abusing their dog then you can report it if they are just ignoring it you should probably let him be try offering to dog sit the dog when the owners travel or would like a day off take care amanda Dog training Dog Obedience training Dog agility Reservoir Dogs Housebreaking Taikyoku shogi Humphrey Bogart Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Garfield Married... with Children Neighbours The Catherine Tate Show Rottweiler Everwood Social rule Saw II Kodocha Can't Hardly Wait Tai shogi Shaggy dog story Fancy rat StarCraft: Hybrid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Melrose Place The Butterfly Effect Morphology (linguistics) Basset Hound Canadian Football League Ren and Stimpy Wa shogi Knots Landing Pit bull Noel Coward MTV2 Pet Maka dai dai shogi Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Chuck Cunningham syndrome Vivian Solon Music video Animal Crossing Zoophilia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe American Pit Bull Terrier Animal shelter Rabies Chinese astrology Cat Teacher's Pet (Disney) Border Terrier Pet store Hot dog Golden Retriever Discordianism Dai dai shogi Animal Farm Animal rights Guinea pig Lisa the Vegetarian Cornelia Rau Ferret Amanda Bynes Havanese Doctor Emmett Brown Labrador Retriever Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Infidels Whose Line Is It Anyway?
