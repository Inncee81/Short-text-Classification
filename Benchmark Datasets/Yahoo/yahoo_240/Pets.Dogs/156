there is a wounded dog in our area in mumbai can anyone help first call the humane society if you have choices chose one that is a no kill call a couple of vet's offices if a humane society does not exist vets get calls like this all the time and most should know who to call call the police department as a second or third choice sometimes the police department may have reason to shoot dogs especially if they are wounded and pose a threat there are many police officers that are not dog savvy therefore they have their own perception of a dog's behavior and being wounded the police officer has the public as his priortiy not the dog did you hear about the police officer that shot the harmless pot bellied pig because it grunted this happened in fl this was somebodies pet in any case see if you yourself can catch the dog and maybe bring it the vet usually vets will take on such animals at no cost to yourself and then the vet will proceed with animal control if you don't feel comfortable doing that that's okay too don't get yourself hurt you didn't mention if the dog is layed down and unable to move or running around if the dog is down and you want to help you can slip a sheet underneath the dog to dupe as a stretcher you will need two people for this you can also tie a hanky or something around the dogs muzzle to keep his mouth closed so you will not get accidently bitten most dogs don't mean to bite but when they are pain better safe than sorry although i have taken many chances myself at this if you can see the dog now and it is on the move at least try to keep tabs on the dog until help arrives if there is a fenced yard nearby that you might be able to contain the dog in that would be really helpful too since the dog is wounded he will need immediate care and if he becomes lost or unseen again the dog will not recieve the help he needs it's is very possible somebody is looking for this dog hope i helped out good luck Rabies Cat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Poker jargon Sin City Dog Battles of Lexington and Concord Reservoir Dogs Dog training Donald Neilson The Death Gate Cycle John F.
