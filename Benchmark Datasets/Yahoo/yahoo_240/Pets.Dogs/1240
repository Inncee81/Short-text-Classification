i need suggestions on how to handle my dog this morning both dogs started barking because they heard another dog or my neighbor outside the little dog who is wanted to go out the front door and i didn't want to let him because i knew he would just bark like crazy outside normally if they are barking in the morning i take them both to the bathroom with me and they stop barking well this morning the little one was refusing he is a lhasa so when i say little i don't mean tiny he is a biter when it comes to things that he doesn't want to do like take a bath so you have to be careful when he lays down and refuses to move i said fine so i just took the big dog golden retriever in the bathroom with me which made the lhasa want in and he started growling at the door well minutes later when i walked out he had peed on the carpet when we had our son he was so jealous of him that he peed in his room so many times we finally just got rid of the carpet like i said he is old and i need advice on how to handle him i do love him and he is my baby but man he makes me mad i agree dp but i have also been bitten by him before and i swear to god he attacks like a pit bull within seconds he is all over your arm and although he isn't a pit bull it is scarry and it hurts first you need to establish dominance in your little pack your lhasa has taken the lead because you have not i do not mean beat up your dog just the fact that he feels you are not the boss you have become his follower letting him get his way proves this he is a dog i love my dogs and play and scratch them however just like children they need rules boundaries and limitations exercise discipline and affection come in that order when you lack the first two you spell disaster only giving him affection you create a monster that now needs to be rehabilitated establish your dominance by first learning to give him the rules boundaries and limitations walk him first thing walk him and your other dog for minutes to an hour daily exercise causes the mind to move forward and like people they have pent up frustration they need to let it out and to do this in a positive manner will help otherwise he will take it out on you by biting peeing etc when i mean walking the dog i mean walking the dog do not stop by every bush not allowing him to stop you by sitting down walk him if he needs to do his business all the better for you cause he's not doing it in the house but walking him regularly consistently and establishing your dominance will help him to give you the lead role and he will then relax please remember to always be calm and assertive during all walking and training never yell or hit the dog a good suggestion may be to take an obedience class couldn't hurt a good tip is to watch cesar milan on the national geographic channel or visit his website for more tips good luck Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet humour Humphrey Bogart Obedience training Piccolo Junior Saga The Shining (film) Knots Landing Tenshinhan Theory of conduct Good Morning, Vietnam Sharon Tate Kim Possible Sin City The Contender (television series) 24 Hours of Le Mans Episodes of Lost (Season 2) RuneScape quests The Death Gate Cycle The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dog agility Milton H.
