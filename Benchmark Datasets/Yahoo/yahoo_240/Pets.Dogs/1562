which is the best way to bring up a dog i have a german shepherd x rottweiler and i was just wondering how the best way to bring up a dog like this is to be really nice gentle and no hitting or bad words or to bring it up so it knows where it stands if it is naughty give it a smack or yell at it or a mix of and how about a combination of both i would say start out with teaching him the rules and regulations and what you expect teaching with love and affection no hitting no helling no smacking at all basically i think if you from day one show a puppy what is acceptable praise when you see that they are getting it and then offer love and affection when you are together teaching training loving and you have a dog that loves you respects you and knows where he stands what is expected and he knows that you love him a well rounded and happy dog dogs really do like routine and they like rules a dog that has no rules and is wild and out of control while he seems like he is happy and having fun he knows that he isn't loved like the dog who has rules he is messed up cause he has no one to respect dogs need and want a leader if they aren't going to lead themselves dogs aren't equipped to lead your household they are equipped to lead a dog pack and that's it so you have to be the strong respected leader and with that you have to correct properly and never hit be someone who should be respected and trusted Dog training Theory of conduct Dog Social rule Martial art German Shepherd Dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Housebreaking Dog agility Rottweiler Avenue Q Ron and Fez Humphrey Bogart Ranma __ characters Parachuting Schutzhund Road Rovers Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shetland Sheepdog Obedience training Dobermann Shaggy dog story Negima Bon Jovi Mixed-breed dog Spanking Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fox hunting Tag Paintball Blackjack Cliff Richard Tom Waits Pitaten Golden Retriever AFI 100 Years series Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gerald Durrell Keeshond Code: Lyoko Brian Griffin Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guilty Gear Capoeira Vernon Schillinger 2000 Australian Grand Prix Christian-Jewish reconciliation Past teachings of Prem Rawat Mixed martial arts Dean Koontz Care Bears The Ashlee Simpson Show Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Sailing Poker jargon Buttocks Golf Docking The Death Gate Cycle Scouting Invader Zim Livestock Cowboy Frankie Laine Nintendogs Dragon Booster A Course In Miracles Profanity Leslie Cheung Ten Commandments Indianapolis 500 Skinny Puppy Hip hop collaborations Reservoir Dogs Eastern Orthodox Church Time Out of Mind Working dog 2005 Iditarod The Beach Boys Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wild Honey Shot of Love Rocko's Modern Life Polyamory Police dog Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Wiggles Christian eschatology USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Advanced Squad Leader Appeal Objectivist philosophy German grammar Pok__mon Chronicles Corporate governance Craps Milton H.
