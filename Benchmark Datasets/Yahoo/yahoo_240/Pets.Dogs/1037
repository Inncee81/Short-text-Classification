k advantix can u put it on to repel bugs only and how much does it cost is it better then advantage and frontline i prefer k advantix over frontline plus i have used both both are for ticks and fleas advantix is also for mosquitos as well i have also noticed it helps keep those pesty little black flies away from my dogs ears as well both products kill ticks but advantix does it faster the ticks usually don't even attach with advantix however with fronline i have found one or two ticks on my dogs one or two ticks is enough to transmit tick born diseases there is also a myth going around that is advantix doesn't hold up in water my dog goes swimming every day and still has great protection ticks are the bug of main concern for me as far as cost goes it varies on size of dog number of vials and vet ps even though advantix helps repel mosquitos it is no substitute for heartworm preventative while advantix is in it's drying phase it can be toxic to cats so if you have a dog that snuggles with cats i would use caution but after working for vets for several years i have not heard of any cats becoming ill from being around treated dogs Tick Rocky Mountain spotted fever Mosquito Lyme disease Malaria Dog Pesticide Cat Rabies DDT 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Veterinarian Hematophagy Hearing impairment Chocolate Livestock Ehrlichiosis Bat Black Death Anopheles Tooth enamel Swimming Fancy rat DEET Hamster Beagle Dairy Chagas disease The Tick Tularemia Global warming Sonic the Hedgehog Vampire Gray Wolf Flea Haloalkane Pet skunk Microprogram Guinea pig Typhus Mattress Abortion debate Deluge (mythology) AIDS Chronic fatigue syndrome Decibel Quake III Arena Bipolar disorder Fauna of Australia Common cold English grammar RuneScape quests Sniper Siphon Animal testing Taikyoku shogi Biological pest control Bubonic plague Pixar Diving German Shepherd Dog Shaggy dog story Chicken Domestic rabbit Extinction Computer virus Vector (biology) Shark Fecal incontinence Sidekick Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tai shogi Characters of Naruto The X-Files (season 1) Maine Coon Foodborne illness Minor Harry Potter Beasts Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Moore's law Diabetes mellitus Explosive material Shetland Sheepdog Menstrual cycle Insect Schistosomiasis Asian tiger mosquito Psoriasis Bladderwort Pok__mon types Multiple sclerosis Condom Factory farming Sickle-cell disease Carnivorous plant Polish September Campaign Randomness Tsetse fly
