is it good to get another yorkie i have a female yorkie who's almost years old we haven't really tried putting her with other dogs but we did with my cousin's and she was afraid and shaking i want to get another yorkie puppy but i don't want my other yorkie not to like her i know that i should give the same amount of attention to both so she doesn't get jealous but do you think it would be a good idea to get another there are many yorkie breeders out there that would be quite happy for you to take your older dog along to check out some puppies her reaction to the puppy will tell you everything you need to know if she looks like she wants to run away then its suggestable she will not enjoy the puppy if she lets the puppy sniff her and if she sniffs the puppy and seems interested then she should be fine with the pup in the end its really all up to you to decide if she will be okay with the pup as far as jealousy goes if you pay attention to them both and treat them equally it should be fine but just make sure she remains top dog try feeding her first instead of the pup good luck Dog training Scooby-Doo Dog Beethoven (film) Yorkshire Terrier Labrador Retriever Golden Retriever Guinea pig Dog show Lady and the Tramp Hamster Theory of conduct Dog breeding Jealousy Gray Wolf Dobermann Skinny Puppy Taikyoku shogi Care Bears Hip dysplasia Crate training Shaggy dog story 101 Dalmatians: The Series Poker jargon Housebreaking Ron Weasley Avenue Q Clifford's Puppy Days Mixed-breed dog Pet skunk Puppy mill Docking Pete the Pup Snoopy American Pit Bull Terrier Milton H.
