dogs and a baby in an apartment how am i going to manage me and my husband our expecting our first baby we live in an apartment with dogs im really worried about how im going to manage walking the dogs enough when i have a baby the dogs need to go out to use the bathroom about every hours and need two long walks a day how am i going to take the dogs to the bathroom i cant leave the baby inside alone while i walk the dogs and the baby will be born this december so i dont think i can take the baby with me everytime they have to go when my husband is home it wont be a problem but he is gone about hours a day has anyone else had dogs and a baby in an apartment how did you manage any advice will really help thanks i would never get rid of my dogs so please dont suggest it before getting each dog i made a commitment to keep them for their whole lives i knew eventually some day while they were still alive i would have children i love my dogs and this is no reason to give them away i read your post and i thought ohhh awww i remember worrying about everything a few months before i had my son too i didnt have dogs but i had other concerns and everything seemed so difficult to imagine since you truly cannot imagine what a baby will add to the mix until he she makes her appearance not to worry though you will will be able to do all of the things you normally have to it will be a modified version in some cases but everything will get done good as gold in the end depending on the size of your pups i think the bjorn is a must for you i didnt just use it to take walks though i used it to do dishes put in laundry talk on the phone you name it my son loved that thing and was one of those babies that needed it because he had to be swaddled or up against you or he cried for a few months if the dogs are small and walk well on a lead you could try a stroller if they arent great on a leash now would be a good time to reign them in and brush up on those skills with them you can take the baby out even in december after they are a few weeks old up until then have family with you to help out some companies even offer paternity leave now so see what you can manage you will need that help in the very beginning but at two weeks i took my newborn on a cartrip and to the beach in the end of august bundled up a baby can do just fine in the winter remember this when you start to worry most babies love to go for walks they like the motion of it and they like being close to you in one of those snuggly things your dogs need to be walked you will probably just fall into the pattern of doing these things together and find yourself walking the dogs more not less unless it is sleeting or storming outside btw i live in an br apartment in the city with my son an english mastiff and a bf who is moving in come next year it might feel a little panicky right now but you will be fine what a great mom you are going to be just for worrying now about it Friends Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Social rule The Lovely Bones Breastfeeding Infantilism Kodocha Dog training Atomic Kitten Jon Secada Characters of Lost Philip J.
