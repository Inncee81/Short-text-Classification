if my dog has been bread and she is on her rd week what happens if another dog gets her can she have its pu my dog started her heat bred with a dog of her own kind we think she might have bred with another dog will she be having both breeds or will she reject the first breed my concern is that she will have mixed pups concerned she can have pups to both dogs the pups that were conceived as a result of the planned mating will be pure bred and the pups conceived as a result of the second mating with a dog of another breed will be cross breeds the fact that she was mated by a dog of a different breed will not affect the appearance of the planned pups but if the kennel club was made aware of the misalliance you might have difficulty registering your 'pure bred' pups because it could throw doubts on which dog was the sire for the kc registration and the pedigree for example one of the cross breed pups might look just like its mother so you might assume it is a pure breed but as it matures it might become obvious that it was a cross breed i knew someone who bought a kc registered shetland sheepdog b ch but by the time the pup was a year old it was obvious that she was was not a pure bred sheltie her breeder refused to accept this and was sued under the consumer protection act after many months of legal arguments and court appearances she eventually admitted that another dog had also mated her b ch but that the pups all looked like shelties so she had registered and sold them all as pure bred nowadays a dna test would save a lot of time and money she was given a hefty fine and banned as a breeder and exhibitor Shetland Sheepdog Mixed-breed dog Breed registry American Kennel Club Gray Wolf Border Collie Dog breed Horse Selective breeding Guinea pig Docking Hamster American Pit Bull Terrier Domestic rabbit United Kennel Club Contract Plant breeding Genetically modified organism German Shepherd Dog Labrador Retriever Breed standard Siberian Husky Nintendogs God Emperor of Dune Fox hunting Keeshond Trademark Pit bull Bearded Collie Species Domestic goat Obedience training Havanese Collie Greyhound British national identity card Elections in the United States Pack (canine) Australian Kelpie Harp Seal Manx (cat) Chinook (dog) Icelandic Sheepdog Dachshund Organic food Hybrid Shark Liger Kakapo Cat Domestication Estrus cycle George W.
