my whippet was put to sleep tuesday yrs dying of heart failure wonder where her soul has gone as much as i loved the life we had and all the times we played i was so very tired and knew my time on earth would fade i saw a wondrous image then of a place that's trouble free where all of us can meet again to spend eternity i saw the most beautiful rainbow and on the other side were meadows rich and beautiful lush and green and wide and running through the meadows as far as the eye could see were animals of every sort as healthy as could be my own tired failing body was fresh and healed and new and i wanted to go run with them but i had something left to do i needed to reach out to you to tell you i'm alright that this place is truly wonderful then a bright glow pierced the night 'twas the glow of many candles shining bright and strong and bold and i knew then that it held your love in its brilliant shades of gold for although we may not be together in the way we used to be we are still connected by a cord no eye can see so whenever you need to find me we're never far apart if you look beyond the rainbow and listen with your heart xxxxxxxxxxxxfresh red roses xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx W.I.T.C.H.
