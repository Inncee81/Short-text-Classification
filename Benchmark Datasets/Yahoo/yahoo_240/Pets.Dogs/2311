my puppy pees in his crate my puppy is not house broken yet he's only two months old and we've only had him for about a week when we put him in his crate he pees in it and then cries i can only assume it's because he doesn't like wafting in his own pee lol does this have anything to do with him not being housebroken yet or will he always and forever pee in his crate and are there alternatives so that he doesn't have to sit in his crate i cant exactly let him wander the house all day he'll pee everywhere will putting him in a room the kitchen for example help instead of the crate doesn't putting food and water in his crate with him defeat the purpose i mean won't food and water make him hafta pee and poo more inside of his crate as for potty training do not use pee pads this teaches your dog that it is ok to go in the house and confuses him always keep him in the same room as you so you can keep an eye on him if he wanders too much get a leash and tie him near you so you can watch as soon as he starts to go tell him no no no no and run him outside when you goes outside praise him as he becomes more trustable you can let him have rooms at a time and eventually you won't need to watch him at all if you can't watch him or are gone put him in a crate make sure the crate is only bid enough for him to lay down turn around and stand up in also don't put any blankets or stuff like that in there untill he learns otherwise the pee gets soakes up and he dosn't care that he messed his crate most dogs will not go where they sleep this will also set your dog up for success since he can't go in the house because he is in a crate or being watched and corrected then he won't have a chance to get away with and think well if mommy's not home i can pee on the carpet and it will take much longer to re train the more often he goes do not leave his water or food out after he eats or drinks find out how long it will take for him to have to go then get him outside when he'll need to go and reward him for going potty outside take him out before bed and before going in his crate and don't give him food or water hours before bed or being in a crate for a few hours good luck Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Obedience training Shaggy dog story Toilet humour RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ron and Fez Piccolo Junior Saga The Shining (film) Fancy rat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Richard Chase Ben Johnson (athlete) Kitchen Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Mattress Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Customs and etiquette of Japan Los Angeles Dodgers Vegeta Pitaten EastEnders Toilet Big Brother UK series 6 Homer's Enemy Donkey Kong's Animal Buddies Professional wrestling match types Textile manufacturing Dairy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Lisa the Vegetarian The Doctor Dances Hamster The Amber Spyglass Kodocha Muslim ibn Aqeel The Cure Firefighter The Catcher in the Rye Urinary incontinence Time Out of Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Japanese tea ceremony Breath of Fire III Apollo 8 Balto (film) Dog agility Fecal incontinence The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Milton H.
