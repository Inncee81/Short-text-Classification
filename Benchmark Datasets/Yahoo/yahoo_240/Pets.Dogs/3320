why are so many people against crates i think as long as you use a properly sized crate to house train your dog and to keep him her safe when you're not around and never use it as punishment a crate is a wonderful thing a dog will see his crate as a special safe place for him to retreat just like a den in the wild providing you don't abuse him with it i don't leave my dog in his crate for hours on end i never use it as a punishment and it was invaluable for house training where all other methods failed us i think too many people see a crate as a cage and they anthropomorphise the dog too much what do you all think and if you're against crates how did you house train your dog and keep him her safe and out of mischief when you went out this could be a potentially heated debate so do try to be respectful of what others have to say we are all entitled to our opinions i'm so interested to see that the only people answering are those of us who have actually used a crate no answers yet from anyone who's used one and hated it well said firekeeper c'mon all you crate haters out there what do you have to say now i'm also curious as to why you've all disappeared nanookadenord that is a sad story indeed thankfully those horror stories are rare if you have the time i'd be interested to hear about your technique for training a dog without a crate it's going to be hard to choose a best answer i've given my favourite answers a thumbs up don't you get points that way and am deciding yikes i think people that are against crates are just uneducated about them and don't understand the den instinct i had someone tell me it was mean to keep them in a crate because they get bored i asked them when the last time was that they saw a dog reading a book or watching tv dogs sit there that's what they do and they do the same thing in the crate that they do out of it right now my dogs are out of their crates but they are lying on the floor sleeping just like they would in their crates i think that a crate is a wonderful tool and i think it is actually less cruel than not using it because how many dogs get dumped at shelters for not being potty trained or tearing up the house using a crate prevents bad behavior and keeps the relationship between you and your dog better Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Magic (illusion) RuneScape quests Obedience training Garfield Scientology beliefs and practices Fox hunting The Lovely Bones God Emperor of Dune Firefighter Theodicy Human sexual behavior Milton H.
