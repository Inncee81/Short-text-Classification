dog breeding what is a good dog to breed i want to start breeding dogs and would like to get more info on it oh yeah before you hippies bash me for trying to be a backyard breeder i care for dogs very much please save your comments they won't effect me at all well i do have a few in mind english bulldogs and pugs how many registered dogs are in kennels people who take time to breed quality dogs shouldn't worry about this especially if you screen people who buy the dogs i am interested in breeding for the money ok if you want to breed dogs i won't tell you you're a bad person there are some great breeders out there be prepared for a huge upfront investment for quality breeding stock a male and a female expect to spend at least add to that years of feeding and vet bills before you can breed your first litter but you'll be busy those first two years trying to prove your animals expect daily grooming and training for the every weekend you'll spend traveling to dog shows or field trials people want dogs of quality this is where you'll prove they are worth the money you are asking for them so i walk into your kennel wanting to see your puppies i'll expect to see their tests for their hips eyes and genetic screenings to show that i am not throwing my money away on an inferior dog i'll expect that you'll also have the test results for the parents as well i'll want to meet both of the parents to see that they are well behaved and meet the breed's standards i'll probably ask to talk to your vet as well i'll want to see where they live how they're treated and if they are clean and healthy i'll ask to see a bag of what they are eating because i know that if a breeder is feeding inferior food they don't care about breeding inferior dogs be prepared to take care of the costs for all of the shots testing deworming and microchipping too because if i'm paying xxx dollars for a dog i don't want to pay for that stuff too and be ready to take care of these puppies for at least weeks because i won't accept a dog younger than that for i know how much they need to socialize with their littermates and mother i'll expect to see evidence that your dogs are living inside your very clean house have started potty and obedience training and that they have plenty of toys and human attention i'll expect you to be an expert on your breed it's pros and cons it's health problems and be able to answer all of my questions about potty and obedience training nutrition etc i'll expect you to talk to me about your dog's lineage and it's performance at trials or shows be prepared to spend most of an afternoon with me because i'll not take a dog that i am not sure of i'll also expect you to have references of people who have purchased from you in the past be involved in breed clubs and rescues offer a solid health guarantee and be willing to take back any dog for any reason i would ask you about the dogs that you have already taken back and where they are now i'm not trying to be mean or smart here this is seriously what i'd expect from a breeder and this is what good breeders deliver i hope this gives you a little insight into what you are getting into if you're prepared to spend the time learning and invest the money to do it right i say go ahead and breed dogs and good luck to you Pet skunk Mixed-breed dog Docking German Shepherd Dog Havanese Fancy rat American Pit Bull Terrier Dog breeding Hamster Labrador Retriever Breed registry Guinea pig American Kennel Club Whippet Puppy mill Dog agility Golden Retriever American Eskimo Dog Dobermann Basset Hound Obedience training Social rule Dog show Selective breeding Health insurance Great Dane Horse Belgian Shepherd Dog Contract Border Collie Livestock Keeshond Border Terrier Animal testing Gray Wolf Shetland Sheepdog Ferret Dog breed The Amazing Race Fox hunting Working dog Australian Cattle Dog Housebreaking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breed standard Pit bull Discus (fish) Game show Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show English Springer Spaniel The Fairly OddParents Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Inflation Apple Canadian and American health care systems compared Breastfeeding Gross domestic product Socialization Stomach cancer Jack Russell Terrier Nintendogs Terri Schiavo MMORPG World Championship Wrestling Scientology beliefs and practices Smooth Collie Publicly funded medicine Garfield Prostate cancer Agriculture Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microeconomics Mutual fund FairTax Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Life insurance United Kennel Club Plame affair Iditarod The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Cancer Education in the United States Sydney Riot of 1879 Little Britain Microchip implant (animal) Nuclear power Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insulin
