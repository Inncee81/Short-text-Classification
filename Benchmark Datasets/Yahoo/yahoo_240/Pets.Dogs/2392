does anyone know a type of dog breed that is great with kids and super sweet i'm thinking of a cavalier king charles spaniel what do you think labrador retrievers and golden retrievers especially the females for their sweetness and tenderness or a male if you want rambunctious energy their loyalness even keelness and willingness to please are all the right qualities for kids they can be mouthy but they are soft mouthed they are fine being couch not literally unless you want hair everywhere you sit potatoes but most importantly they are willing to take the submissive role in any relationship this is good for children who will not know how to take the proper dominant role in the pack when adults are not around and most most importantly they are big and tough enough to handle rough housing and enjoy it their big muscular necks are made for kids to hang on to their strong otter like tails will stand up to a tug or two there is a reason you see these breeds most often as service dogs and if some stranger is approaching your house that deep bass bark from a to pound dog will make them think twice only you will know that she he is all show they are at home walking down the street running through the woods swimmiing in summer or winter riding in the car laying at your feet or any activity where they can be with their humans i've taken my two labs camping in the backwoods and to posh hotels the trick is to crate train them at an early age after that they consider their crate as their home i will warn you to not make them dimensional animals bed couch etc when they are puppies it is only cute when they are the size of a cat and they will not stay that way for long mine have their own beds on the floor Dog Dog training Hamster Housebreaking Equine conformation Gray Wolf German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Cat Shetland Sheepdog Golden Retriever Obedience training Dobermann Fancy rat RuneScape quests Horse Guinea pig Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American Pit Bull Terrier Ed, Edd n Eddy Griffon Bruxellois SpongeBob SquarePants Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Skye Terrier Azumanga Daioh Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling match types Diving Mountain Gorilla Comanche House Mouse Garfield Havanese Border Terrier Ron and Fez Guide dog Japanese tea ceremony Kangaroo Humphrey Bogart Smooth Collie Australian Shepherd Korea Jindo Dog Poodle Livestock Mattress Iditarod Spot the Dog Cheetah Lady and the Tramp The Fairly OddParents Dean Koontz Customs and etiquette of Japan Double bass Alaskan husky About a Boy Finnish Spitz Papillon (dog) Tooth enamel Happy Tree Friends Kakapo American Eskimo Dog Aerial (dance move) Care Bears Greyhound Australian Cattle Dog Chair Transformers: Cybertron Brian Griffin Physical attractiveness Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Basset Hound Our Gang Brown Bear Ren and Stimpy House music English Cocker Spaniel Naval mine Skateboarding trick Red Squirrel Puma Richard Chase The Brady Bunch Mickey Mouse Socialization American Black Bear Yorkshire Terrier Working dog Domination & submission (BDSM) Working animal Koopa Kid Conker's Bad Fur Day Wood
