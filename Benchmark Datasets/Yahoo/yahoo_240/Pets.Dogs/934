dog hates my puppy i got a puppy yesterday and my older dog hates him thay r both males my older dog snips at him and bit his ear a lil bit is there any ways to keep them from fight like to muzzle both of them and let them run around for a wile each day or any othere ideas i thank my older dog is just domanant and dosent what any dog here we have got stray cats he has gottn used to thow both of the dog are also the same size should i let them go at it or muzzle or any other ideas please post thank you you need to introduce them slowly they shouldn't have any physical contact or even really see each other for at least a week let them smell and hear each other in various ways give them both blankets to sleep on and then have each eat their meals over the other's blanket this gets them used to each other's scents you should have a friend help when you introduce them on neutral territory like a park or a street that your first dog has never been on before they need to be introduced very slowly i know this isn't an appropriate way of going about it but when i introduced my dog to my husband's family's dog we tied them both up outside at my husband's family's house they couldn't reach each other they barked and growled at each other for about minutes and then we let them go near each other and they tolerated each other neither dog likes strange dogs so we thought this was a great success now my dog completely ignores the other dog which is better than fighting Dog Cat Lady and the Tramp Shaggy dog story Dog show Housebreaking The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Garfield Dog training American Eskimo Dog Lion Characters in the Smurfs Kakapo Rottweiler Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Basset Hound Ranma __ characters Clifford's Puppy Days Ron and Fez Gray Wolf Beethoven (film) Brian Griffin Rabies Peanuts Coyote Elephant Zoophilia Fox hunting Lisa the Vegetarian Kim Possible Dean Koontz Vegeta Recurring South Park characters Futurama (TV series - season 5) Neighbours Dingo Shetland Sheepdog Dr. Seuss Fancy rat Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mixed-breed dog The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Social rule Into the West (miniseries) Tasmanian Devil Billboard Hot 100 Places in the Wheel of Time series Honey and Clover Beagle The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Scent hound 101 Dalmatians: The Series EastEnders Socialization Snake Golden Retriever The Smoking Room Doraemon Dilbert Skunk Puma Characters of Naruto Skinny Puppy Little Britain Felis sapiens Nintendogs Avenue Q Scooby-Doo Girly Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Happy Tree Friends Iditarod Sinfest Obedience training Timeline of alternative rock Russian space dogs The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy Invader Zim KaBlam!
