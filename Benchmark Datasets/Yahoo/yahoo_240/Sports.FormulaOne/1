what are aerodynamics on an f car whats g force aeordynamics in the case of f refers to the air flow over the car and this air flow is manipulated by the wings and of course all the undulations in the shape of the car as well as the little canards they use here and there on the cars it is all about maximizing grip g forces are the relative force a driver feels when cornering so if they take a corner at g they are feeling the effect of three times the force of gravity on their body to the outside of the corner rp Downforce Aerodynamics Car handling Formula One cars Stall (flight) Colin Chapman Wing Lift (force) Aircraft Ground effect Drag coefficient Tide Canard Fixed-wing aircraft Professional wrestling throws Fuel injection History of Formula One Gravity Fictitious force Sports car Carburetor Helicopter Trajectory Steering wheel Fluid dynamics Center of mass Fuel efficiency Magnus effect Weightlessness Terminal ballistics Formula One SR-71 Blackbird Mitsubishi 3000GT Glider Automobile Whitcomb area rule Dodge Neon Airbag Lagrangian point Coriolis effect Toyota MR2 Traffic light Sprint cars Radio controlled airplane Supersonic transport Aviation history Tire Drifting (motorsport) Subwoofer Stock car racing Drowning Headlight General relativity Mass Motorcycle Porsche 993 Manual transmission External ballistics Frame of reference Swept wing McLaren F1 Future of Formula One Volkswagen Type 2 NASCAR World Geodetic System Boundary layer Solar car Wheelbase Turbocharger Mazda Miata Anti-gravity Supply and demand Luminiferous aether Mazda RX-7 Grand Prix Legends Lamborghini Countach Golf ball Open wheel car Gravitomagnetism Force 2005 European Grand Prix Flying car Loudspeaker Mach number Planetary orbit Jet engine Propeller Flight controls Initial D Nuclear fusion Geodesy Unidentified flying object Black hole Waverider Equivalence principle Tidal force Speed limit Sport utility vehicle John F.
