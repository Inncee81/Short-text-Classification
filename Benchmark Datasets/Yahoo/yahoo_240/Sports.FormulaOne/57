how well will sebastien bourdais do in f next season he's been the dominant force in champ car for seasons now how do you think he'll fare in f vs the likes of alonso and hamilton will his driving skill improve toro rosso or is the machinery disparity so great in f that he'll never overcome it to get close to the mcclarens and ferraris i think bourdais is a very good driver what will limit him and he may find this very frustrating is the capabilities of the toro rosso car while i have no doubt we will see some very big improvements from str and rbr next season i also firmly expect the team will do no better than to maybe eke out th or th in the constructor's standings that said they will improve any team that has had adrian newey involved has done well don't expect the red bull or toro rosso teams to go winning races or grabbing regular podiums though i expect that str is a foot in the door for bourdais and if he stays with it we will see that he's moved on to perhaps a better drive in a couple of years rp Red Bull Racing Formula One Team McLaren S__bastien Bourdais Champ Car Michael Schumacher History of Formula One Jacques Villeneuve Scuderia Ferrari Cosworth 2004 Formula One season WilliamsF1 Adrian Newey Fernando Alonso Minardi Kimi R__ikk__nen 24 Hours of Le Mans Ayrton Senna Squadra Toro Rosso Mika H__kkinen Giancarlo Fisichella Future of Formula One Ron Dennis British American Racing Renault F1 Carlos Reutemann 2005 Formula One season Ivan Capelli Rory Byrne Penske Racing Jacky Ickx Christian Horner Juan Pablo Montoya David Coulthard 2003 United States Grand Prix American Championship Car Racing Martin Brundle Patrick Head 2005 European Grand Prix Nigel Mansell Hendrick Motorsports Jarno Trulli 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Riccardo Patrese 2005 French Grand Prix Heinz-Harald Frentzen 2005 British Grand Prix July 2005 in sports 2002 Formula One season Chris Amon Masten Gregory Eddie Cheever 2001 Formula One season Team Lotus Chip Ganassi Racing 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Ferrari Honda International League Roush Racing July 2004 in sports Cleveland Browns 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Dan Gurney Valentino Rossi Narain Karthikeyan St. Louis Cardinals Jaguar Racing Niki Lauda Mark Webber Justin Wilson Surtees Tiago Monteiro Emerson Fittipaldi 2005 Australian Grand Prix 2005 United States Grand Prix Damon Hill Enzo Ferrari 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Red Bull Jyrki J__rvilehto Jody Scheckter Gerhard Berger New York Knicks Formula One regulations Vanwall Nick Heidfeld Prost (racing team) Vitantonio Liuzzi Indianapolis 500 September 2005 in sports NBA Finals Paul Tracy
