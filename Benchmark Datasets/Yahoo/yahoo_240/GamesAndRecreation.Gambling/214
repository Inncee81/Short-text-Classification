what wouldbe the minimum hand you would call or raise on in texas holdem pretend the cards are not paired or of the same suit what would be the minimum hand you would call or raise on also what would be the minimum pair you would call on such as a pair of s thanks a lot okay this really depends whether this is preflop flop turn or river i assume preflop because postflop its pretty self explanatory even though you said not to talk about paired cards pocket pairs ima still talk about them because they make up a huge range of your starting hands when you first start okay minumum hand time it really depends on whether you are a beginner or have been playing for like months and are just curious of what other people think if you are a beginner its quite simple just play aa kk qq jj ak aq raise with them in any position if the pot is already opened somone in front of you already bet re raise times their bet if you get reraised or pushed allin after you reraised fold jj aq and ak call the allin with all other hands with the pocket pairs two of the same cards like jj you want to flop an overpair or hit a set trips if you dont just check fold with ak or aq you want top pair after the flop otherwise just check fold eventually you will want to continuation bet but for now just play it straightforwardly okay do this for at least like weeks until you get the feel of the game then start loosening up play more hands now position becomes much much more important preflop and postflop let me give you an example you are playing in a bb stack and you are covered by your oppenent you have kj utg first to act preflop you raise it to x the bb is a normal raise preflop now you get reraised by someone in middle position to do you call you are beaten by almost all hands that would reraise in the first place like kq kk aj aq ak and aa lets say you call you are also first to act on the flop the blinds are the last to act preflop but first to act on all other betting rounds but they folded this time the flop comes out k q you have top pair with a crappy kicker the pot is and you bet he reraised you to you are forced to fold because you can hardly beat anything that would have reraised preflop and reraised on the flop you should have folded preflop btw however if you were on the button to last person to act preflop and last to act on all other betting rounds you could have more information and if faced with a raise preflop could just fold or call if facing a loose player you could also open the pot if no one else has and theres a way smaller chance that any one else is going to call you or raise you even if you are called you have more information after preflop anways heres a reallly goood chart for you to use in a limit or no limit texas holdem game it says limit but dont worry about it http www pokerjesusonline com starting hand chart htm the only thing i disagree with with the starting hand requirements is of suited connectors and pocket pairs suited connectors down to you should call if they have a stack as big as yours or bigger and if you have at least bb only call times the bb at most in middle position and late position with small pocket pairs from same amount of bb but you can call up to times the bb in any position its really informative but after you used it for months dont keep using it its only a guide and they can read you like a book if they are observant and notice you do what that so and so website or book says anways remember play really tight first and loosen up gradually until you are not comfortable anymore gl with poker Community card poker Stud poker Seven-card stud Blackjack Poker Five-card stud Poker tournament Cheating in poker Hand (poker) Craps Sandbagging (poker) Bluff (poker) Poker strategy Draw (poker) Contract bridge Strap-on dildo President (game) Sheepshead Wheel of Fortune Slot machine Pai gow poker Mahjong Aerial (dance move) Online poker Pai Gow Snooker Clarinet American football strategy Harmonica Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Contender (television series) Card game Video poker New York Giants Gambling Star Trek Customizable Card Game Baseball National Football League Caribbean stud poker Violin Volleyball Floppy disk Winning Streak Let's Make a Deal Mattress Timpani Textile manufacturing Cheating in Counter-Strike Fischer Random Chess Badminton Social rule Skat Chess strategy and tactics Canasta Japanese tea ceremony Norway national football team Spades T.
