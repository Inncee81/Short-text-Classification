what is the best limit to play at nl you get a lot of loose players which i know will i still find some loose players playing but not as many as the reason i ask is that i just played at a casino in detroit everyone at the table was loose didn't raise strong hands like aa or kk even aq i ended up only loosing bucks from my initial investment although i was up a hundred which i should have walked away since i really wasn't getting any cards the entire day i basically won with a little luck with bad cards and maximized my profit when my cards hit because i was called right to the last card no matter wait i play occasionally at this casino and more often then not i will double my money money is not an issue and i feel that i can move up another level obviously since is the lowest limit spread in casinos the worst players are at people often like to say that you should work up a bankroll and start at because the level of play is distinctly different from and therefore you can bluff and get away with more while that is true it is wrong because the game where everyone calls no matter what is more profitable even if you can't bluff Poker jargon Betting (poker) Craps Blackjack Poker Stud poker Omaha hold 'em Draw poker Texas hold 'em Gambling Backgammon Slot machine Community card poker Baccarat Roulette Sheepshead Cheating in poker National Football League Bluff (poker) Poker tournament Online poker Game show Press Your Luck Contract bridge Video poker Bingo President (game) World Series Winning Streak Yu-Gi-Oh!
