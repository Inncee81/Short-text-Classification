i'm getting a tattoo of my new babies name would it be weird to put the baby's date of birth or should i put just there name baby foot prints i don't have a name yet i don't know if its a boy or girl and i haven't been able to decide yet i'm a tattoo artist and in my shop we think it's bad luck to put the birth date because you never want it to have an end date but if it's important to you i would put the date because it is no ones tattoo but your own you might want to consider putting an image with the name instead something that represents the love you feel Vanilla Ninja Friends Angelina Jolie Charmed Tattoo Avril Lavigne Britney Spears Brandy (entertainer) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Frankie Laine Ron and Fez U2 (band) Phoebe Buffay's songs Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 The Miracles Namie Amuro Kyle Broflovski Jennifer Lopez Knots Landing Kodocha Sharon Tate The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Drew Barrymore Smallville (Season 4) Irezumi Teen Girl Squad Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Memento (film) Situation comedy "Weird Al" Yankovic Michelle Branch Doug The Beatles discography Gwen Stefani AFI 100 Years series Comanche Mary Wells Mandy Moore Donna Summer Billboard Hot 100 Tupac Shakur Generation X Vernon Schillinger Neighbours Bing Crosby Characters in the Smurfs Birthday Hip hop rivalries Bleed Like Me Tom Jones (singer) Fall Out Boy Journey (band) Max Martin Good Charlotte Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Treehouse of Horror XII Off the Deep End Ashanti (singer) No Doubt Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Game show Beyonc__ Knowles Rod Stewart Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pet Shop Boys Baby (rapper) Hall & Oates Urusei Yatsura Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Diana Ross Whitney Houston Cliff Richard Pazyryk Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Tattoo You Days of our Lives Notable lines in the Star Wars series Cool (song) Destiny's Child Pet skunk Bruce Dickinson Atayal Shut Down Volume 2 Boston Public Atlas Comics (1950s) Rocko's Modern Life Nine Inch Nails Pop music Scott Storch Customs and etiquette of Japan Jackass: The Movie Incarnations of Immortality Future-Drama Single certification Knights of the Dinner Table
