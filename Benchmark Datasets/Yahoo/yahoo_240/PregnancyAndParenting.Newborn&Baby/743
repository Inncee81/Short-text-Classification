how do you get a baby to accept milk from a sippy cup i've got a month daughter the sweetest thing who has been entirely breastfed so far i'm going back to work starting september so i need to get her to take her milk from something other than my breast in the past i've tried to get her to accept a bottle but it's been impossible she's been using a sippy cup to drink water for about months now and seems very happy with it the only thing is when i try to give her breast milk from the cup she takes a sip realizes what she's getting and starts crying she'll take the milk from the breast just fine so it's not that she doesn't like it she nurses in the morning when she wakes up once late morning am once in the afternoon pm and then before bed i'll still breastfeed her early morning and evening until she's about unless she doesn't want it any longer but i have to do something about the meals over the day when she's at the babysitter's what do i do thanks a lot just wanted to add that she is already on solids has meals a day is there any way i could skip the milk over day and maybe nurse her again as soon as we get back also i've tried formula too but she hated it it seems more like she wants the breast not that she doesn't like the cup or the milk keep trying have the sitter give it to her when you are out of site try lots of different cups and bottles she is old enough to start on solids you should only introduce one new food every few days to make sure there is no allergy talk to her pediatrician he should be able to give you more advice nurse her as often as you can but since you are giving solid foods she should be fine keep pumping and i would go ahead and offer her the sippy cup with your milk and if she takes it good if not it shouldn't hurt her as long as she is not losing weight and she continues to grow i wouldn't worry but if it worries you talk to her pediatrician Breastfeeding Milk Tea Baby bottle Infant formula EastEnders Fiddler on the Roof Insomnia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Fertility awareness Dairy Avenue Q Nestl__ Social rule Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Kodocha Breakfast Coffee Piccolo Junior Saga Infant The Super Milk-chan Show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Brassiere Hong Kong-style milk tea 613 mitzvot Good Morning, Vietnam International response to Hurricane Katrina The Lovely Bones Nestl__ boycott Kibbutz Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ron and Fez Breast milk Happy Meal Fasting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Meal The Shining (film) Allergy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Conker's Bad Fur Day Yom Kippur Brewery Characters in the Smurfs Cheese Cha chaan teng Breast pump Humphrey Bogart International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes The Human Stain RuneScape quests Jon Secada Nipple Friends About a Boy Pitaten Battle of Chancellorsville 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Kitchen The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hera Singlish Marilyn Monroe Rice pudding MRE Calvin and Hobbes Milkshake Folic acid Futurama (TV series - season 4) Gastroesophageal reflux disease Jewish holiday Elephant Tocopherol Dawson's Creek Casting Phil Hendrie Great Teacher Onizuka Ty Cobb Norway national football team Chocolate Tofu Anderson Cooper Nipple piercing Oh My Goddess!
