i told my niece its a bad idea to sleep with her baby what do you think her baby is month old and she sleeps with her because the baby doesnt cry if she gets to sleep with her mother this all started because the baby was really colicy for about the st months now the baby still cries unless she gets to sit on her moms lap or is being held no one else works she has to be with her mom her mom sleeps with her now because she cries if they put her in her own crip i told her its a terrible idea i told her she needed to let her get used to her own crib is it me or is this baby learning to cry to manipulate her mom well my daughter who's months now slept in the bed with my husband and i until she was about eight months she slept in a co sleeper from there she slept in a portable crib that we kept in our room until she was about one the first week of her sleeping in her own room was rough but she adapted quite nicely and doesn't have any trouble sleeping by herself i don't think anything is terrible about a mother having her child close to her and pediatricians have said that a baby does not know anything about manipulating the environment until they're at least months do you have children sometimes people who don't have kids don't really understand what it's like this will do no harm for the baby's development and the baby will eventually transition into her own sleeping area in due time babies grow up quickly and before you know it the world will began to take its toll like it does on all of us i think we should keep our kids as close to us as we can because one day they will start to seperate naturally and we will wish for those days good day Tupac Shakur Sudden infant death syndrome Breastfeeding EastEnders Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Life to Live Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Ben Johnson (athlete) Knots Landing The Catcher in the Rye About a Boy She Loves You The Shining (film) Macbeth Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Kurt Cobain Charmed Phoebe Buffay's songs Co-sleeping The Amber Spyglass The Marshall Mathers LP Baby Blues Milton H.
