strawberry hemangioma should i call doctor my daughter has a maybe dime size strawberry hemangioma on her chest that showed up a couple weeks after she was born it's still pretty flat and barely raised but i've read a little on it and am confused it sounds like it will only grow and get bigger should i be concerned about this my daughter has an appointment in a couple weeks for her two month checkup should i call the doctor about it now i guess what i'm asking is it something i should worry about my son has a hemangioma on his head it started out as a red spot and kept getting larger i brought it up to his pediatrician and he said that it is really nothing to worry about they usually grow for the st year and then slowly disappear and go away on their own if it doesn't go away they can surgically remove it the only thing you have to watch is that you don't cut or knick it or it will bleed like crazy also with hemangioma's on the chest and trunk of a child it could go down inside the body where it can't be seen since my son's is growing on his head there's no concern there because it can't grow down through the bone at months old my son's hemangioma is actually starting to shrink in size it's about the size of a quarter and raised up about inch if you are still concerned after my post though and others posts call your pediatrician and discuss it with them good luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma New York Knicks Puberty Equine conformation Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Physical examination Pediatrics The Shining (film) Darryl Strawberry StarCraft: Uprising Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human penis size The Lovely Bones Breastfeeding Ben Johnson (athlete) Reservoir Dogs Vegeta Sin City Urinary incontinence Birthmark Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Stomach cancer Sharon Tate Scoliosis Penis Floppy disk The Inside Autopsy The Contender (television series) American and British English differences Wood Milton H.
