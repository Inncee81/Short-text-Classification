why does my month old wake up screaming what's wrong he's been pretty clingy and whining a lot lately now he is waking up screaming and crying in the middle of the night what do you think it could be ok if it was only that he was waking up screaming then i would agree with the above posters night terrors and separation anxiety however you also said he has been clingy and whiny which seems to be uncharacteristic of him i would have to say teething even if he has already cut teeth check his gums for the first year molars my daughter started right about that time and it hasn't let up yet and she just turned she has stopped sleeping soundly through the night and has driven me crazy all day for about weeks and only the st on the top have cut through i can feel the ones on the bottom trying to bust up as well it is awful for us but imagine how bad they feel try a little tylenol and some teething tablets or orajel i hope this helps Tooth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing Boston Public Poker jargon Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Contender (television series) Scream (film) Manual transmission Good Morning, Vietnam Kodocha Journey (band) World Series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Nirvana (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders The Emancipation of Mimi Anxiety Negima Pok__mon Live!
