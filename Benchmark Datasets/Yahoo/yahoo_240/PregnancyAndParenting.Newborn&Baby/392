infant sleeping arrangments my bed is a kind of loft it's from top of mattress to the floor this is because we have very limited space my husband and i live with my parents temporarily and our dog's crates are under the bed there is nowhere else for the dogs to sleep and i've wracked my brain even trying to mentally put them in the bathtub it's a queen size and i would not even close to be comfortable having an infant sleep on it it's barely big enough for just my husband and i the mattress is very soft we're high up and there are huge gaps between the bed and the wall the only thing i've been able to come up with is for me to sleep in my parents' den with the baby until we move out my husband is willing but neither of us is excited about me sleeping separately from him there is no mattress we have that will fit all three of us does anyone have any ideas of sleeping arrangements that don't involve giving my newborn his own room or involve me sleeping separately from my husband the dogs are in crates so they are safe but no they can't sleep in the den they aren't allowed in the rest of the house thanks for asking though i've thought of it myself because you must know we had to move to another city and didn't have a place to live for a few months we should be out soon i can't use a co sleeper because they don't go high enough unless you know of one that's even if the dogs were gone the baby wouldn't have any more room the bed is already in a corner even pushed up against the wall it's dangerous because of the type of mattress and the way it's built haha i also have a tiny house and a bed raised to to fit dog kennels underneath i moved the bed away from the wall ditched the comforter for thin blankets etc and co slept we sleep on a full size so you could manage Mattress Sudden infant death syndrome Bed (furniture) EastEnders Kitchen Knots Landing Milton H.
