breastfeeding one month old my one month old baby will nurse and completly empty my breast and then a few moments later act like she is starving i know she is getting enough because she has plenty of wet and soiled diapers and she is gaining weight however it seems she is not getting satisfied i know she likes to suckle so i try to giver her a pacifier but she is not intrested has anyone had this experience i am drinking plenty of water and eating very healthy i also drink fenugreek tea to help with lacation last night i was up until am nursing around the clock and she would fall asleep then wake up a few moments later screaming i am taking her to the doctor next week just wanted to know if any moms out there had something similar and what did you do thanks this is my rd baby and i nursed my other two for about a year each it is funny how different they all are hi sarah boy your story brings back memories that was just like my little girl like some people mentioned keep her on the breast as long as she wants even if you think the breast is empty you'll always have a few more drops and eventually if she keeps sucking you 'll have another letdown another thing to check is to make sure she burps after feedings even if she falls asleep my baby took a long time to burp so i thought she didn't need to but she did keep her on your shoulder a few minutes maybe up to and when she burps put her back on your breasts to see if she wants a bit more then put her in bed that 'll also put her in deeper sleep so maybe she won't wake up after a few minutes other than that don't try to delay feedings and if she has enough wet diapers and is gaining enough weight don't give her formula either formula is a vicious cycle and it'll decrease your supply plus do you really want to start sterilizing bottles and boiling water if your baby doesn't really need it just nurse her as often as she wants if you don't mind try taking her to bed with you that way you can get some extra rest witch will help your supply and also being close to her will increase your supply too keep drinking lots of water and fenugreek but fenugreek capsules combined with blessed thistle capsules are more effective also raspberry leaf tea is an excellent one and it'll help your uterus shrink back to normal see what the doctor says and if she's gaining enough weight just relax and keep nursing babies at this age also have gas sometimes little aches and pains etc suckling and being close to mommy helps all of that so just be patient know you're doing the best thing for her and enjoy your little bundle of joy that as you know will grow up too quickly congratulations on your baby and on sticking to breastfeeding even though it's so hard sometimes feel free to contact me too i went through the exact same thing good luck Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Social rule Childbirth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
