baby walkers why do some people still think they are a good idea there is so much recent evidence today that baby walkers are so bad for babies development they actually delay walking not encourage it and they result in many more referrals to physiotherapists for walking problems including walking on tip toes they are also dangerous as an immobile baby is suddenly given wheels and speed without the developmental maturity to deal with her environment the same goes for baby door bouncers both are sadly used too often as passive babysitters the best place for babies to learn to walk is lying on the floor there he can roll around and learn to explore his environment safely using the right muscles at the right time in his development why are some people still putting their babies in these things and expecting them to use muscles that are just not ready yet i suspect due to lack of info why also i have to ask are these things still sold in the shops given the mounting evidence please look at the link below before answering http www bliss org uk pagebuild php texttype whatsnew babywalkers paper thanks for your answers so far i know not everyone uses them for hours on end but what i don't get is the misplaced notion that they encourage children to walk when they don't and i think the fact that this has been said for years and they are still on sale is worrying particularly as evidence is mounting the cost to the nhs must also be quantifiable due to physiotherapy referrals and gp time some countries have banned them i think the uk should consider doing the same i think given the relationship between a e referrals and baby walkers and the medical difficulties amongst others it is clear that there are safety issues with them the problem is also that they are misused and babies are not properly supervised when in them given the misguided notion that many people have that they will encourage walking that in itself can indicate that those parents may infact think that spending longer periods of time in them is beneficial i would like to see far more information and guidance given to parents if they are to continue to be sold i see where you are all coming from i am a mum too and although i didn't use a walker i used a bouncer for my son purely for his own entertainment as he loved the sensation so please don't think i am just getting at you all i realise that we can find risk everywhere and that there is a need to allow our children room to make mistakes but when it comes to babies safety i'm sorry but i just don't think this can be taken lightly i don't think this is about making our babies think they are the centre of the world they already are babies don't fit to you you fit to them you have to for the first wee while anyway thanks again for all your answers that's what i love about this forum you always get food for thought which i have i think the theme running throughout the answers is that people those who have answered are using these things responsibly with plenty of awareness of their baby's needs and assessments of their safety which is fine as i said earlier i also used a door bouncer as brief entertainment for my son but the majority of time he was on the floor that is reflected in your answers the basic problem is lack of information the kind of parents who will leave their child in these things unaided are perhaps not going to spend their time on yahoo answers or indeed even have access to the internet as a social worker i have seen parents with very poor attitudes parents who really don't have the capacity to consider these points and weigh up risks etc given that there is no info on the box with regards to these concerns the problems will continue floor time is the essential element the report is not saying that if your child so much as puts a foot in one of these things they will be delayed answerers who say their child was fine also add that they made sure their child played a lot on the floor and was only in it for brief periods lets understand that there are those who leave their babies in them far too long and then these problems develop and i am a mother as i said i am all for getting minutes to yourself and for allowing children to take risks i agree that if we read every report and took it at face value we wouldn't ever leave the house i feel strongly about that too and have a very balanced view of these things eg my son got the mmr jab years ago i suppose because i have seen the damage that lack of stimulation can have on children first hand that these things perhaps hit home more but seriously thanks for your responses and honesty funnily enough my oldest three kids who are all teenagers now used baby walkers and developed normally walked unaided on time or even a tad on the early side and have had no developmental problems at all my toddler now didn't use one and she walked unaided right when the so called experts said she should and she is also perfectly normal perhaps in this research as in the case of the study of thousands of women who had morning sickness which showed that of women with morning sickness have girls the corellation is so small as to be negligible i mean had boys but the researchers still jumped up and down and told everyone that if you have morning sickness you are more likely to have a girl oh well no point in me doing the research at this point my older kids are fine and dandy and so is the baby and the issue of to walker or not to walker is moot edit to add there are plenty of kids who have developmental issues who have never used a walker or a bouncer considering this and the fact that there are plenty of kids who have used them who don't have any problems if i were to have to make a decision tomorrow as to whether or not to let a baby be in a walker i would wonder at the legitimacy of the research and probably just use the danged walker Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infantilism Fathers' rights Little Britain Abortion
