how did you get your infant to sleep thru the night my baby is months old but still wakes up at night she breastfeeds for about minutes then falls asleep at the breast so i believe that she is only eating for comfort to fall back asleep but it is the only way i can get her back to sleep i can relate to your daughter still waking up to feed at night my son was the same way until just shy of his first birthday when he woke at night i tried just giving him the pacifier but that didn't work so i gave him a bottle i could hear his tummy gurgling as he took the bottle so yes he was hungry even though he may have only taken a few ounces it's what he needed and sounds like what your daughter needs please don't try the cry it out method or giving her water in a bottle obviously they are waking for a reason hunger or just need to be comforted now my son is months has been sleeping through the night for months and to be honest i miss holding him and rocking him when he woke at night take advantage of that special alone time that you still have before it's gone Breastfeeding Infant Fertility awareness The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep Baby bottle Knots Landing Narcolepsy Co-sleeping Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Mattress The Amber Spyglass Neighbours Hansel und Gretel Childbirth Infant formula Siesta Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare L__ Bu Hypoglycemia Dream Nestl__ boycott Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Fasting Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Social rule Care Bears Pacifier Out-of-body experience One Piece minor characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) John the Baptist Garfield Sleep disorder Characters in the Smurfs Coffee Elvis Presley Brassiere Sudden infant death syndrome Odysseus Breast Buddy Guy EastEnders Bob and George Breast pump Aphrodite The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Trainspotting (novel) Milk Emperor Xuan of Han Elimination communication Ron and Fez Slow Train Coming Cliff Richard Sola fide Futurama (TV series - season 5) W.I.T.C.H.
