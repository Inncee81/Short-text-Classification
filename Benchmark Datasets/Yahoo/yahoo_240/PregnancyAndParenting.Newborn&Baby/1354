new babies sleep pattern norm or not why does my two week old sleep so peaceful in the day i mean i have to wake him to eat and hes half asleep but as soon as i want to go to bed hes wide awake and nothing will calm him diaper change holding feeding gas medicine he just screams if i try to not hold him no matter what i do i feel dead in the day bc i am not getting any sleep this last until like am every morning and seems to start as soon as i decide to lay down any advice is this normal totally normal your little guy has his days and nights mixed up what is the best way to change this well you need to try to keep him up when he wants to sleep during the day stimulate him with books and singing and even baby einsteing dvd's just try to work on this gradually and keep him awake longer and wake him you just need to weave his little sleep pattern to mesh with yours it will take a while but it will work as he gets older you will see changes it is a learning curve for both of you it is tough in the beginning but it will get better keep a diary of when he sleeps and then look for a pattern and then try to change one of those sleepy times example sleep am eat feel asleep at woke to eat what you would do is try to keep one of those longer or more active so he would extend and go to sleep at noon till or so then just keep moving them longer but love my suggestion and i know not everyone can do this is sleep when he does let the house work go put a load of laundry in when he sleeps and go lay down when he wakes the laundry is done and you can put in dryer while feeding i would definately discuss the crying in the evening with his pediatritian they are going to say a type of cholic i know it cholic happens in the evening mostly try something soothing like the vacume or the baby carrier sitting on the dryer or a hair dryer if the dr gives you a diagnosis such as gerd or reflux i would definately take him to a pediatric gastroentroligist to speak to them before doping the little man up on meds i would maybe ck with your peditrician in the morn they will be happy to see you and discuss the concern but please sleep when he does and let things go don't be a worry wort of the stuff that goes undone there is plenty of time to catch up Urinary incontinence Insomnia Sleep Breastfeeding The Amber Spyglass Narcolepsy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Dream Sleep apnea Characters of The Sandman Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Comanche Futurama (TV series - season 5) Phoebe Buffay's songs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lucid dreaming Canonical hours Philosophical skepticism Mattress Big Brother UK series 6 Daylight saving time Diaper Sleep disorder Milton H.
