breastfeeding question my daughter is almost weeks old and she normally feeds about every two hours for the most part but sometimes she seems to want to nurse for hours on end last night i nursed her from until am until she finally went to sleep and today i nursed her good at noon but everytime i held her or set her down she always was looking for my breast what gives do i keep nursing her or do i let her cry or what i know she's getting plenty to eat my milk supply is good and she's a good nurser and she has plenty of poopy and wet diapers what's up with this it sounds like she's cluster feeding because she's going through a growth spurt in addition to the constant nursing babies can also be fussier than usual it's perfectly normal she's too young to let her cry it out and besides that could really affect your supply and cause some painful engorgement my daughter did the cluster feeding when she was weeks old and it started everynight at eventually i just put her to bed with me to nurse so i could get a little rest too Breastfeeding Breast Urinary incontinence Childbirth Nipple piercing Elimination communication Mastitis Cat Breast pump Puberty Breast milk Kibbutz Stroke Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Premature birth Nipple Fertility awareness Ron and Fez Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dialysis Kimberly-Clark Corporation Nursing Protein-energy malnutrition Dairy Diseases of the honeybee Hera Terri Schiavo Hypoglycemia Knots Landing Brassiere Nurse Shark 613 mitzvot Milk Prolactinoma Capercaillie Drosophila melanogaster History of corsets Whale Infant formula Insomnia The Amber Spyglass Drawn Together Pitaten Industrial Revolution Operation Market Garden Certified Nursing Assistant Human height Jaundice Gurage Platypus Earless seal Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Labour economics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer USS Waters (DD-115) Infantilism Obstetrics YuYu Hakusho Team Rocket About a Boy Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fasting Marie Antoinette Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Domestic rabbit Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diaper Nestl__ boycott Elephant Stuttering Cancer Rais massacre Bedwetting Penis Janet Jackson Singlish Folic acid Bread Milton H.
