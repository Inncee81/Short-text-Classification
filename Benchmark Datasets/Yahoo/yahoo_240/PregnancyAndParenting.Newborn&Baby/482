baby doesnt like me haha one of my nieces is months old and i havent been able to see her very often but when i do she is very friendly smiles a lot etc my other niece is months old and cries whenever i hold her ' everyone says she is shy with me because she's older and doesnt know me as well but with my boyfriend who sees her just as often she is fine another theory is my boyfriend is softer and im just bony haha when my boyfriend is holding her im able to kiss her cheeks and give her all the love i want is it possible for babies to be shy or does she just not like me yet or maybe im bony haha this is kind of a funny question i just dont want her to cry around me anymore month olds tend to go through anxiety when someone they are not used to everyday comes around as for why she likes your boyfriend i dont know i have an month old who cries at almost everyone who she doesnt see everyday except my husbands friend month olds dont really have anxiety yet it usually hits at months or older my daughter loved everyone before she hit months old it's a phase and the baby will grow out of it at around years old yes its a long time but dont take her anxiety personally add it doesn't mean she will grow up shy either in a couple more months that month old will start doing the same thing most likely its quite normal Atomic Kitten Kodocha Jennifer Lopez Friends Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gothic metal Social rule Ranma __ characters The Ashlee Simpson Show Kimi Finster Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Little Britain W.I.T.C.H.
