how do i get my hyper baby to sleep my baby is almost months old and she usually sleeps from about pm to am every night but lately she just won't go to sleep she gets hyper smiles a lot laughs and kicks believe me i know it's better than crying all night long i try to expend her energy by letter her have fun with the einstein play gym nurse her she doesn't want to nurse but wants to play with me i am getting exhausted since i haven't been taking naps with her during the day lately someone has to do the laundry by the way she sleeps in bed with me we are probably going to change that in the next few months any suggestions would be most appreciated it's funny i had given her a bath that night that she wouldn't go to sleep maybe i gave her the bath too late at night but thankfully the next evening i made sure she went to bed earlier and nursed her before she went to sleep that usually puts her in a very restful state i'll try to remember to get some lavender i'll see if that helps her too thanks all for your words of wisdom one thing that helps so ur baby can go to sleep faster is giving her a warm bath with that one johnson's bedtime with chamomile purple bottle right before u want her to go to sleep it says it's for fuzzy babies but they don't have to be fuzzy for it to work i do that every night with my month old baby girl and i play with her a little bit while i bathe her and after that i put on her the johnson's chamomile lotion and give her a little massage to relax her i put her piyamas on and give her a bottle sometimes i rock her to sleep or she falls asleep right after the bottle cause she so beat from playing in the water she sleeps from pm 'till am give it a try and see if it works for u too good luck Insomnia Social rule Breastfeeding EastEnders Frankie Laine Sleep Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Care Bears Knots Landing Pitaten Daylight saving time Textile manufacturing Customs and etiquette of Japan Urinary incontinence Cat Humphrey Bogart Piccolo Junior Saga The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Catcher in the Rye Spidey Super Stories Mattress The Shining (film) Childbirth Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) AFI 100 Years series Characters in the Smurfs YuYu Hakusho Henri Murger Satchel Paige Macbeth Kodocha Joke Phoebe Buffay's songs The Amber Spyglass Friends Blackadder Ty Cobb Philosophical skepticism Marilyn Monroe Have I Got News For You Grandview, U.S.A.
