rota virus vaccine causing gas i asked this last night but didnt get many answers my son had the first dose of oral rotavirus vaccine yesterday morning yesterday evening he got horrible stinky gas i havent eaten any gassy food or anything out of the ordinary so i dont think im passing anything to him through my breast milk to make him gassy anyone else noticed this the vaccine that was causing the bowel obstructions was recalled in i did the research before he had the vaccine since mommy to david is such a narrow minded alarmist let me warn you about the site she is linking this is raw diagnosis data that doctors and parents can report possible vaccine related reactions the 'search' includes roth which is part of an overall vaccine package this is nothing more than a diagnostic tool for physicians and not a substantive source for anything more than fear mongering mommy to david is a staunch opponent of having her child vaccinated and from her posts and in my opinion a certified loon her goal here is obviously to make you think twice about doing what is best for your child which is without a doubt vaccinations call your doctor odds are it's nothing more than a little gas and it just smelled horrid but please don't listen to people who just want to scare and harm children edit actually that's the big lie you tend to share in most of your posts you post something as if you actually had knowledge but cannot identify nor do you have an understanding of what you post you post studies that are not 'causal' as fact but kelly mom and lll tend to do that on a regular basis it is sad you try to come across as someone seeking to help when in all honesty you are trying to do nothing more than scare someone into your way of thinking say what you want spin how you want people like you are the worst form of activists and do little more than hurt your own cause Thimerosal Autism epidemic MMR vaccine Cancer Controversies in autism Smallpox Autism Rotavirus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vaccine Andrew Wakefield Poliomyelitis Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Herpes simplex virus Hypoglycemia Medical analysis of circumcision Plame affair AIDS Rabies Mark Geier Hypnosis Colorectal cancer Allergy Marburg virus Chronic fatigue syndrome Epidemiology Obesity Causality Breastfeeding HIV Infantilism Child sexuality Abortion Cervical cancer Multiple sclerosis Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Crohn's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vaccination Urinary incontinence Food allergy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Transsexuality Terri Schiavo Asthma Flatulence Fecal incontinence Foot-and-mouth disease John Lott Infectious disease Measles Addiction H5N1 Psychiatry Louis Pasteur Cytomegalovirus Insomnia Adverse effect (medicine) Bipolar disorder 9/11 conspiracy theories Bioterrorism Sexual orientation Dioxin Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pneumonia Foodborne illness Insulin Radiation therapy Chagas disease Ebola Traditional Chinese medicine Psychoanalysis Physician Expert system Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Tuberculosis Noam Chomsky Anorexia nervosa Raw food diet Alzheimer's disease Chiropractic Clinical depression Genetically modified food Common cold Avian influenza Mumps
