how long should my month old stay awake between naps i'm trying to help my month old baby get onto a good routine when she was months she used to take a nap about every hrs or so adding up to naps per day her naps were short only mins long now at months she recently started fighting her naps when i put her down at the first sleepy signs she yawns fusses rubs eyes almost exactly hrs after she last woke up so i've recently started keeping her up hrs at a time just so that she'll go down easy for her naps is this too long to keep her up i feel bad ignoring her sleepy signs at the hr mark but she just ends up fighting her nap for another hour anyway if i try to put her down as soon as she acts tired now she takes naps per day but i can never know how long they will be sometimes her nap is mins other days it's hrs if she takes short naps i'll either try to give her a rd nap she often resists it unless in the car or give her early bedtime like pm instead of pm what do you think they do like to keep us on our toes don't they my month old naps after an hour and a half displaying all the signs you speak of above and so i put her down and she goes off at the moment but my older daughter would fight it at times at various ages i don't think there is a should with babies i think you need to work toward what you think is right for your baby but i would suggest maintaining a good routine anyway despite her protstations after all a baby doesn't know what is good for her however she may protest as she gets older and understands there is more exciting stuff to stay up for babies can get overtired if their sleep is delayed making a good deep sleep even harder to get later on but if you feel the delaying is helping her sleep better then go with it i do the earlier bedtime as well depending on my daughters naps her naps also vary in length i just let her have what she needs Sleep Narcolepsy Cat Polyphasic sleep Siesta Daylight saving time Breastfeeding Social rule Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Battle of the Bulge Sleep debt 1957 World Series Blitzball Jon Secada Urinary incontinence Apollo 8 2000 Australian Grand Prix Delayed sleep phase syndrome Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Time Out of Mind Kodocha Textile manufacturing Equine conformation Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Current teachings of Prem Rawat Fertility awareness Aerial (dance move) Insomnia Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Lucid dreaming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sharon Tate Housebreaking Decompression sickness The Care Bears (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs The Amazing Race Electrophysiology Bodybuilding Jam (TV series) Diazepam Avenue Q Gordon Banks Poker jargon EastEnders Bruxism Parsifal Saturday Night Live Characters of The Sandman Autism Diaper Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Marching band Maya calendar Prostate cancer One (Voyager episode) Hipparchus (astronomer) Stuttering Cleveland Indians Father's Day (Doctor Who) Tupac Shakur Weight training Friends Fasting Yawn Milton H.
