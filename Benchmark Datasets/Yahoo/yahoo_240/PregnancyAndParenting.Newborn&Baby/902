starting solids my a half month bub started solids last night we gave him two teaspoons full and he loved it we are supposed to give him that amount today as well then i'm not sure how much after that how often should he have solids as much as he wants also how much additional water should i give him i would give him a little every day maybe just a couple teaspoons and gradually up it every week make sure you continue giving him plenty of formula or breastmilk whatever you give him when you give him cereal make sure you mix it with plenty of formula so it's fairly thin you don't want to give him too many solids at once because it might cause problems with his tummy or constipation if you're really not sure about it call your pediatrician they can tell you whatever you need to know good luck Breastfeeding Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dietary fiber Care Bears Flour Cooking weights and measures Fecal incontinence Dorama Justification (theology) Turkish coffee Mayonnaise Idli Cannabis cultivation Urinary incontinence Adjustable gastric band Billboard Hot 100 Bread Tocopherol Situation comedy Magnesium Fancy rat Craps Capercaillie Fire fighting Diarrhea Fernando Alonso Hamster Computus Shell (projectile) Theory of conduct Solar cell Halitosis Tempera Sandy Koufax Mattress Continued fraction Spacecraft propulsion Chinese New Year Royal Assent Winning Streak Rice pudding Casting Cartridge (firearms) Saturday Night Live Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Martini cocktail Paint Poker jargon The Beatles discography Water (molecule) Transformer Dog agility Mojito Betting (poker) Current teachings of Prem Rawat National Football League Hyperthermia Tommy Atkins Sea level rise Oasis (band) Polystyrene Remix Debye model Laxative Annuity Jordan Grand Prix Brewery Rod Stewart Heinkel He 100 Storytelling Topps Video game music Mai Tai Pottery The Ashlee Simpson Show Autumn Soluble Rehydration $ale of the Century Nestl__ boycott Kurt Cobain Bicycle lighting 1957 World Series 24 Hours of Le Mans Laundry detergent The Pet Sounds Sessions Tide Superconductivity Scooby-Doo Vinegar Galactic Civilizations Volume Chromium Russian cuisine The Chemical Brothers The nature of God in Western theology Julian calendar
