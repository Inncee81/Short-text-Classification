i have a baby crib issue well i dont have a crib thats the issue so we're staying at my mothers for awhile me and the farther of my month old are having problems so if we don't work out i need to think of solutions now i have a nice crib for him and it's at the farthers' house so when baby goes to spend night i'd rather have him sleep there everywhere else is dog hair and cat pee lol were going to get a pack n play but i would really like him to associate that with play and the bassinet that it comes with i don't think will hold him he already weighs lbs and is in long so what are there other sleeping solutions for my month old links would be great nothing too expensvie either i would say that the pack n play is a good idea you can get some that aren't too expensive my mom got one for her house and it cost at wal mart can you afford to get two one for play maybe in the living area and one for sleep in the room the baby sleeps in most kids only like to stay in a pack n play for a little while to actually play my daughter was okay with it until she started crawling then she would scream to get out they really hate to be confined so you may find that the pack n play only lasts a short time as a play area best of luck to you Sudden infant death syndrome Ron and Fez Housebreaking Cribbage Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Buffay's songs Cat What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
