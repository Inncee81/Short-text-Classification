month old fighting sleep i have a month old who up until this point has had no problems going to sleep once he falls asleep at night he usually stays asleep for about or hours however during naptime during the day he will only sleep for minutes or so he also has a history of severe reflux he was in the hospital last week and they put him on some new meds but this has been going on for a few weeks now it doesn't matter if he's in his crib if you are rocking him if you are holding him he cries and fusses for over an hour every single time we've got him on a special hypoalergenic formula as well has anybody experienced this how did you get your babies to start calming down sooner hi my daughter was a very colicy infant and cried for the first months it was really rough for us because it didn't seem to matter what we did we couldn't even get sleep and both of us were taking turns and both still exhausted from sleep deprivation the best advice i can offer is to go through the routine what could it be questions hungry gassy wet sleepy fever etc it is just one of those things that you have to keep experimenting with to see what will work if rocking him and comforting him helps then do it try to give him what he wants because he cannot talk to you his only way of communicating is by crying i know it can be so mentally exhausting but just keep at it and see what helps i know you mentioned that he has reflux do you think it is possible that he could be burped too often i think it's good to burp at every feeding but i realized with my second child that the more i burp him the more he spits up he is known to have an occassional explosion of spitting up but only when he has been overfed or it doesn't seem to agree with him rarely also putting him in a sitting up position could be putting too much pressure on his tummy instead try reclining him or feeding him in a position that puts less pressure on his stomach because gravity can cause that if he isn't doing well with his hypoallergenic formula then try giving him the regular stuff soy can be great at preventing spitting up my daughter did well with it but my son drinks the regular milk based stuff because soy makes him constipated every child is different and it is just one of those things you have to keep trying to see what works best i am not sure about hypoallergenic and had no idea they really could make such a thing since most formulas have the same ingredients and mimic mother's milk compounds all babies spit up and all of them have gas if he is crying like that for an hour then he could be hungry maybe he is ready to start rice cereal and is feeling less satisfied solely on milk my daughter was that way and particularly fussy at that age when we started her on cereal it helped a little and she would at least take regular naps and sleep at night though she still cried a lot when she was awake another thing i thought to mention at this phase of development babies are starting to notice colors and moving objects more as well as learning to roll over and explore objects in front of them sometimes they get so excited because they want to touch something that is not in their reach or they want to be walked around the room frequently my daughter was this way and when she found her feet and ways to get from here to there she was a totally different baby if the fussing is only at naptime then i wouldn't worry about it it is just a phase and will pass after a few months try laying down beside him at naps or rock him and take naps with him in the recliner hang in there and it will get better Urinary incontinence Sleep Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Narcolepsy About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Cat Philosophical skepticism Friends EastEnders Fertility awareness Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
