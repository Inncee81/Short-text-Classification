my son still has cradle cap or cradle crap as we call it he is months old and he has had it since he was about months old i have seen the pediatrician several times for it but everything we try doesn't seem to help it looks painful sometimes it looks like it is oozing they different doctors say it is just cradle cap so its not that it is something else first they had me comb his hair while i shampooed we did this for a while and it didn't work then they had me try a cradle cap shampoo that didn't work and it left his hair greasy then they said try rubbing baby oil into his scalp and let it soften then comb and wash with shampoo now they have us using selson blue times a week he has been using this for about a month and still no improvement will this ever go away is there anything else i can try to do just an fyi my son has a ton of hair so it is hard to get to also takes a lot to get a brush down to the scalp through all that curly hair i switch back and forth between using a comb brush omg my son has had a yeast infection that we are treating with nystatin at the time although the yeast infection has only been for a month we did one treatment first and are on the nsytatin now and he has had the cradle cap for much longer is it possible that the one answerer was correct it could be a yeast infection on his scalp my youngest daughter had cradle cap until she was over one maybe even close to the doctor told me all those things not the selsun blue but i hated scrubbing her head it seemed like it hurt her they told me as long as i washed her hair and scrubbed her scalp gently let it be it would go away on its own and it did finally she also had curly hair so i understand it is hard to get to if you cannot see it and it does not bug him i would let it be for a while and see if it does go away she still gets it occasionally in little spots but never as much as she use to have if you are going to use something like selsun blue i would recommend trying neutrogena t sal it is a dandruff shampoo but works much better my grandma had what looked exactly like cradle cap on her head pretty bad gross i know but she is and pretty feeble my sister was visiting and had the t sal shampoo and with good scrubbing it removed all of it i was shocked it may be worth a try because once we finally got rid of it on my daughter it hardly came back and if it does it is small and can be washed off during a shampoo Dandruff Shampoo Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Baldness treatments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Acne Massage Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Haircut Textile manufacturing Theory of conduct Crab louse Comanche Prostate cancer Candidiasis Tattoo Three Stooges Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Guinea pig Dreadlocks Blood on the Tracks Norway national football team EastEnders Poker jargon Manicure First aid Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Chronic fatigue syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Baldness It's Walky!
