lots of respect my month old cried for minutes straight yesterday now i know that's nothing compared to a lot of young ones but neither of my children have been big criers they cried when they were hungry wet or needed held and that's about it thankfully the crying stint was due to some constipation and nothing more serious but i was at my wit's end it may have just been the day i was having or some sort of homone thing but i didn't think i would make it until my fiance got home so anyway to those of you who spend hours and hours day and night comforting your babies who are colicy and just will not be soothed for anything i have so much respect for you i have a lot of patience most days but that's nothing compared to the amount of patience you need for your little one if he won't stop crying i know what i was feeling was nothing compared to dealing with a colicy baby thanks i have alot of respect for you too you have more than children i have a year old and a month old and i also do certified in home family child care for the last years being home all day with children and no adult contact can be very overwhelming especially with a new baby to add to the stress so i give you props my children were never really colicky so i can't imagine how mothers of colicky babies do it my patience has been tried many times so you are not alone good luck to you Breastfeeding Childbirth Urinary incontinence Jon Secada Poker jargon Fecal incontinence EastEnders The Beatles discography Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hikikomori Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Contender (television series) Infantilism Cliff Richard Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kodocha Grief Diaper Yesterday (song) Frankie Laine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Jude About a Boy Norway national football team The Emancipation of Mimi Extreme Programming Melanie Wilkes The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Humphrey Bogart Ranma __ characters 24 Hours of Le Mans Tupac Shakur Time Out of Mind Infant Hollyoaks Charmed Oasis (band) Hypoglycemia Freddy Fender National Kidney Foundation Singapore Edward Gibbon Wakefield Liam Gallagher Characters in the Smurfs Social rule Whitney Houston AFI 100 Years series Theory of conduct Singlish Platypus What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
