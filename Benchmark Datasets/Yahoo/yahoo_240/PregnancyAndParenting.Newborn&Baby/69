my neice this giving my great neice mo old oz of cereal goo every bottle it just doesn't sound rite to me my kids are grown but i dont ever remember giving anything like that is it just me or is it to much every baby is different i started my baby with cereal in her bottle at three months because she was a fairly large baby at birth so she ate more than other babys at her age doctors want you to hold off until the baby is atleast months and to start off with tbs per oz of formula so if her month old is drinking oz of milk your niece needs to only measure in tablespoons of cereal if you truly feel as though she is giving the baby too much cereal in her bottle you may want to suggest spoon feeding the cereal to the baby from a bowl instead of through a bottle that way the baby can get her nutritional needs from the formula and get her full from the cereal seperately and will stop eating when he she's full the cereal can get too thick and it will be really hard to suck through that little hole in the nipple and if she does decide this don't forget the baby still needs her bottle of formula along with the cereal i am just a little confused though is she giving her baby a oz bottle of formula with cereal or oz of cereal in her bottle of formula if it is truly a whole oz of cereal in her bottle then hell yes it is too much that baby is about to burst Breastfeeding Infant Elephant Infant formula Milk Trailer Park Boys Breakfast Nestl__ Coeliac disease Breakfast cereal Childbirth Bong Food Little Britain Scooby-Doo Nestl__ boycott Friends Sea-Monkey Homer Simpson Treehouse of Horror IX Humphrey Bogart Russian cuisine Guinea pig Peruvian cuisine Alcoholic beverage Kosher foods Cereal Drink Fecal incontinence Kodocha Indianapolis 500 Cheerios Folic acid Tasmanian Devil Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Bread Stomach cancer The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Flintstones The Super Milk-chan Show Knots Landing Coffee Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Fancy rat Piccolo Junior Saga Champagne (beverage) Soybean Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Salad Fingers Prolactin Cap'n Crunch Joke EastEnders Happy Meal B-47 Stratojet Diarrhea Spoon Premature birth Cat Urinary incontinence Ron Weasley Bart chalkboard gags Generation Y Nipple Characters in the Smurfs Social rule Soft drink RuneScape quests Wine Russian joke Yoko Ono Maize Kyle Broflovski Ben Johnson (athlete) Veganism Phoebe Buffay's songs Blue Whale Maple syrup Food preservation Rice Krispies Soy milk Rice John the Baptist Metrication Charmed Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Malaysia Vegetarianism Mnemonic Weetabix Vitasoy Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Treehouse of Horror XII Soap bubble Futurama (TV series - season 5) Vampire Olive oil John Harvey Kellogg
