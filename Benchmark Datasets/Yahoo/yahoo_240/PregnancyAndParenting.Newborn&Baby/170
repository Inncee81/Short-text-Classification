how much would you pay someone how much would you pay a neighbor to watch your month old from pm to am she is sleeping throught the night and we live in an apartment building right next to each other i don't want to be cheap but i also do not have alot of money how much would you pay them it will be for a few nights a week when hubby and i both have to work i am thinking maybe every two weeks if she watches her less than six times if more than a night please give me some insight on this i know that they are responsible for her and watching her just the same even though she is sleeping i was thinking every two weeks it may be up to nights a week though is this enough hesperia paying minimum wage i would barely be bringing any thing home what would be the point of working most of the time she will get to sleep as well as our daughter i know it can get rough at night but we will try and see how it goes and pay more or less if need be also if baby is sick then i am not going to go into worok that night i would be calling in sick to take care of her not making someone else do it i am in the process of trying to switch shifts nothing has come up yet though thanks to everyone who gives honest realistic answers this is just to get an idea for me i think if it is ur neighbor and ur friend a night should be just fine or every two weeks as long as ur not going over or nights i think if you pay more than that it would defeat the idea of you working does that make sense and like i said if you trust this person to take care of ur child than ur most likely friends and she'll understand and wouldn't think ur jipping her so i think u did well Theory of conduct EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Day care Friends Socrates Cindy Sheehan Jon Secada 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Satchel Paige Sharon Tate Night (book) The Pilgrim's Progress Trainspotting (novel) The Catcher in the Rye Ocean's Twelve Pregnancy Michael Garibaldi Rule of St Benedict Time Out of Mind Education in Germany Jiddu Krishnamurti Religious Society of Friends Unemployment Miss Saigon Social rule About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microeconomics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Family Feud Animism Poker jargon Simone Weil 50 First Dates Philosophical skepticism Matins Wal-Mart American individualist anarchism Kurt Cobain Philosophy of language Eddie Guerrero Unemployment benefit One Tree Hill (TV series) Supply and demand Year of the Spider Marilyn Monroe American Psycho Negima Anderson Cooper Abortion debate Blankets (graphic novel) Urinary incontinence The nature of God in Western theology Anarchism and capitalism The Lovely Bones David Hume Alois Hitler She Loves You Labour economics Blood Simple Economics Major League Baseball television contracts Keynesian economics Wheel of Fortune Eric Bischoff Athrun Zala Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chess (musical) Religion Melanie Wilkes Taxation in the United States Traumatic brain injury Haibane Renmei Garfield What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
