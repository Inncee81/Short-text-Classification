i'm nursing my week old and i think she's allergic to milk proteins both of my other two were as well but i didn't breastfeed more then a week with either of them is there any dairy i can eat drink cheeses yogurts etc i am fairly certain it is the cow's milk proteins giving her problems she has green slimy poop which usually is because of something mom ate drank that disagrees with baby like an allergy when i've drank milk she got it after i hadn't had any milk to drink and then not thinking ate some pudding i've read that it is extremely uncommon for a baby to be lactose intolerant but being allergic to milk proteins is the most common cause of the yucky poops she's been having she does have a diaper rash as well it cleared up before i ate the pudding and then it came back it all started when she was about a week old which is when i started drinking loads of milk i had always gotten my calcium with supplements before that one day milk sounded soooo good so i drank it and kept on drinking it then her poop changed colors on me and was no longer seedy like it should be i do feed from one breast each feeding alternating for each time she eats i do that to ensure she gets both the fore and hind milk my oldest was put on soy formula when he was a baby years ago my older daughter was put on nutramigen when she was a baby the nutramigen worked wonders for her where as prosobee didn't do much for my son i'm trying my best to continue breastfeeding for at the very least months so if i can i will yeah that really sounds like a milk protein allergy to me i would eliminate all dairy to start with and then see how it goes i know it's a tall order and a pita but if you are committed to bf'ing even for a little while it is worth it for both of you by the way on the la leche league forums and kellymom com forums there are sections dedicated to allergies in the breastfed baby regardless of how long bf'ing works for you and your baby lll is supportive and has been extremely helpful to me when i have run into problems best of luck you sound like a wise mama Milk Soy milk Cheese Dairy Veganism Infant formula Vegetarianism Breast milk Allergy Food Yoghurt Food allergy Lactose intolerance Dairy product Tofu Cat Infant Coeliac disease Guinea pig Dairy cattle Vitamin D Protein Ice cream Livestock Dairy farming Insulin Kosher foods Childbirth Breast Crohn's disease Nestl__ boycott Raw milk Dog Elephant Meat analogue Lactobacillus acidophilus Breast pump Rice pudding Atkins Nutritional Approach Breakfast Elimination communication Chicken Urinary incontinence Butter Fecal incontinence Nipple piercing Baby bottle Kit Kat Pasteurization Obstetrics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vitasoy Rooibos Kashrut Flatulence Nestl__ Prolactinoma Chocolate Omega-3 fatty acid Stone Cold Steve Austin Fasting Cuisine of the Philippines Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Hedgehog Cattle Jaundice Fancy rat Pet skunk Infantilism Domestic goat Hera Dieting Cuisine of Denmark Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Giant Panda Hay fever Lisa the Vegetarian Negima Nutrition Equine conformation Tooth Charles Darwin's illness The Super Milk-chan Show Trailer Park Boys Toilet humour Tattoo Irritable bowel syndrome Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof
