is this normal behavior for baby with a slight cold my son's has a runny nose since the rd his temp varies between and i called his pedi and they don't want to see him unless his temp rises to he eats very well but doesnt sleep very well since that night he'd wake up every hours or so will this go away when he's better hope it's not becoming a habit he's given infants tylenol and saline drops by docs instructions plus baby vick's vapor rub at night how can i make him more comfortable and how long does a baby's cold last on average he probably wakes up often because he is all stuffed up and is uncomfortable things you can do to help your baby be more comfortable are keeping his head up semi upright elevate the head of the bed if needed it helps them drain the mucus you can also use the car seat swing or bouncy seat use saline drops and suction baby's nose with a bulb aspirator use a humidifier or vaporizer near the bed this will help keep the secretions soft and moving hold your child in the bathroom and let the shower run to fill the bathroom with steam let he be in the steam for to minutes this will make the congestion drain i don't know about how long colds can last but i would say around weeks and over that i would definitely want the doctor to take a look at him hope he feels better Mattress Nasal congestion Childbirth Fertility awareness Mucus Common cold Knots Landing Strap-on dildo Carburetor Insomnia Friends Sauna Equine conformation Milton H.
