feeding a month old whipped cream i was at a party yesterday and my friend's very nice uncle offered to hold my fussy month old so i could eat my ice cream he was sitting behind me with the baby and when i finished my ice cream i turned around and saw that the baby had white in his mouth i grabbed a rag and said oh he spit up and the aunt said oh no that was me i just gave him whipped cream i was really surprised that anyone would give someone else's month old baby food especially garbage like whipped cream without asking them first i took him back and said calmly i really prefer he not have any whipped cream it might upset his tummy all he has ever had his breastmilk i know she meant well but i thought people just knew that it wasn't a good idea how would you have handled that situation and do you have a similar story to share this is my rd child and whipped cream has dairy in it as well as a sugar nitrious oxide fats and artificial ingredients like stabilizers giving any of these to an infant is not healthy and can be downright dangerous because infants are far more likely to have a bad reaction i don't want my infant ingesting that don't believe that just because they sell it on a grocery store shelf that you should be eating it and no he didn't like it i'm not a health nut but i don't like people giving my child anything without asking he could have had a food allergy or lactose intolerance it is common sense to ask the mom before giving a baby anything to eat oh geez i am years old and i am not going to drink just breastmilk because my son does obviously i am not going to have the same diet as a month old the ice cream was home made and i skipped the whipped cream canned and just had a little with no cake i eat very healthy with the occasional sweet i would've had a fit i'm impressed that you handled it so well i would never even think to give someone else's child at any age food without their permission thank god he's not allergic to anything they could've caused a serious problem i'm also really surprised at the number of people on here who think you're a nutjob for this whether they agree on the issue of giving a month old tastes of food or not it's really just a matter of it being your child and you deciding what is best for him Breastfeeding Milk Ice cream Dairy Food Soft drink Coffee Chocolate Cream (food) Veganism Healthy eating Hamster Cheese Dairy product Soy milk Cat Aspartame Tea German cuisine Food allergy Organic food Hypoglycemia Peanut Characters in the Smurfs Nutrition Cuisine of Denmark Bread Lactose intolerance Shaggy dog story Egg (food) Peanut butter Fecal incontinence Kashrut Guinea pig Atkins Nutritional Approach Spidey Super Stories Breast milk Dog Soybean Meat analogue The dozens Mountain Dew Diarrhea French cuisine Butter Milkshake Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Gelato Pancake Theory of conduct Street food Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia Foodborne illness Apple Cha chaan teng Hedgehog Coeliac disease Sugar substitute Stomach cancer Allergy Multiple chemical sensitivity Pepsi-Cola Infantilism Carbon dioxide Sugar Crohn's disease Margarine Pizza Tooth Trans fat Pasteurization Snack food New Coke Tocopherol Omega-3 fatty acid The Apprentice 2 Coca-Cola Obesity McDonald's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ron and Fez The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rum Fast food Eating Raw food diet Domestic rabbit
