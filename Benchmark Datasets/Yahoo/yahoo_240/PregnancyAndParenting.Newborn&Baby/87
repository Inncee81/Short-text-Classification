what type kind of breast pump works worked better for you im going to become a mommy for the st time i am weeks and need a breast pump i have seen the manual ones and also the electric pumps but im not sure which one is more efficient or which works better sorry if this sounds like an ignorant question but i have no idea of which breast pump to buy i tried the medela pump in style and hated it i was using the medela harmony manual pump for here and there and it worked great then i bought the electric one for work but it was much slower the manual one was easy to carry around not as big and bulky as the electric and i'd get more milk from the manual one if you do try the electic one get the warranty extra b c you can return it if you have trouble with it otherwise they are non returnable good luck Breastfeeding Wind turbine Breast pump Manual transmission Hydraulic machinery Pump Vacuum cleaner Abortion Solar power Locomotive Equine conformation Refrigerator Dairy Transmission (mechanics) Cruising (maritime) Airbus A380 Windmill Laser Power station Cavitation Tire Carburetor Sonar Steam engine Warranty Energy development Cardiac arrhythmia De Lorean DMC-12 Conker's Bad Fur Day Welding Novelty (locomotive) Vacuum Irrigation Mouse (computing) Urinary incontinence Hydrogen economy Tank Electronic organ Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Breast milk Copyleft Anarchism and capitalism Heat pump Solar cell DVD Elevator Battery electric vehicle Manually Coded English Aircraft flight control systems Thermal power station Ocean thermal energy conversion Pumped-storage hydroelectricity Blood pressure Nonlinear optics Fender Telecaster Skateboarding trick Floppy disk Effects pedal TARDIS Air conditioning Shotgun Eldfell Organ (music) Vickers Valiant Industrial Revolution Hybrid vehicle Who Framed Roger Rabbit Shark Diesel engine Severn Tunnel Hydraulic ram Marching band Automatic transmission Insulin Electrical generator Alcohol fuel Stalag Luft III Transformer Chernobyl accident Tooth GunBound Train Yohoho!
