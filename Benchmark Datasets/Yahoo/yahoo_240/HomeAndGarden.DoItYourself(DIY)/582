how do you make a portable stage out of wood i was wondering how i could make a portable stage ft x ft that could support around people at a time it needs to be easy to transport and get out of the way meaning it can't be too heavy but the platform needs to be made out of wood preferably the simplest thing to do is build it in smaller sections that go together either that or build it onto a trailer for more details feel free to contact me at tootall yahoo com we could possibly figure out a way to make it fold out from a smaller size it will be a bit heavy if only wood is used the pros use extruded aluminum this is nice but ups the price and the skills needed to work with it Vinegar Diseases of the honeybee Bedbug Drag racing Ed, Edd n Eddy Pesticide Bulk vending Poker jargon Coca-Cola Phoebe Buffay's songs Happy Tree Friends Hamburger The Marshall Mathers LP Insecticide Ant Menstrual cup Cuisine of Denmark Gypsy moth Hunter __ Hunter Reservoir Dogs Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Advertising World War Three (Doctor Who) Charles Goodyear George Costanza Barbecue Pittsburgh English Duran Duran Shaggy dog story Carnivorous plant Insect Vernon Schillinger Sodium hydroxide American Black Bear Knight Rider SimAnt The Human Stain Breakfast Toyota Prius Cheese Mayonnaise Vacuum cleaner Apple Ketchup EastEnders Tire Bread Ant colony optimization Betting (poker) Pickling Terror of the Autons Food preservation New Zealand English Biological pest control Plastic Toilet humour My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spider DDT Restaurant Citric acid Hamster Japanese toilet Minor characters in Morrowind I, the Jury Diner Chile pepper Sex Pistols Fish and chips Acetic acid Shen Gong Wu Apache Ant Unfaithful (film) Dim sum Good Times Kill Bill Draw poker True Crime: Streets of LA Pesticide toxicity to bees Invader Zim Ramen SMTV Live Toffee Sushi Jackass: The Movie Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Dodge Charger Tooth Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Sea-Monkey Gary Numan Treehouse of Horror XI Isle of Wight Soldering TGV Organic farming Garfield Dairy
