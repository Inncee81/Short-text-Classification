gallon swiming pool help pleaze i have a gallon pool and it is slowly turning green because of algeae what can i put in there to help it that is not clorine i heard of putting i pint of clorox in it its an above ground pool for algae you can use either shock or an algacide or a combination of both the chlorox actually is chlorine in a liquid form but a pint is likely not enough it'll all depend on how bad the algae issue is the idea is to get your chlorine levels up past break point chlorination at least possibly higher if the algae is so bad you can't see the bottom so that you have more good guys chlorine than bad guys algae that's the only way to kill it all if you go the chlorine route you could possibly use a good quality poly quat algacide alone if the algae issue isn't too far advanced forget about using the cheaper algacides they don't work well a poly quat algacide can also work still with elevated chlorine levels whereas the cheaper algacides won't one thing you do need to do is take your water in for a full analysis at a pool shop it's usually free there could be an underlying chemistry problem like a low stabilizer level or total alkalinity out of balance that could have helped cause the algae bloom in the first place Furnace Brewery Glossary of firefighting equipment Carburetor Bong Fossil fuel power plant Welding Siphon Swimming pool Spark plug Casting Rail terminology Space shuttle main engine Hydraulic machinery Diesel engine Portable stove Plastic Hydrogen economy Vacuum tube Energy development Naval mine Thermostat Stove Flush toilet Transformer Autonomous building Cruising (maritime) Irrigation Dundas Square Glossary of firefighting terms Heat Kitchen Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fire fighting Internal ballistics Sauna Dairy Basement Mattress Drill bit Solar panel Torpedo William Murdoch HVAC E85 Coffee Scuba set Diode Floppy disk Wood fuel Ocean thermal energy conversion Water purification Diving suit Motor oil Fuel injection Seismic retrofit Refrigerator Soldering Pebble bed reactor Three Mile Island Nuclear reactor Tire Gas metal arc welding STS-87 Boiler Dialysis Apollo Command/Service Module Air conditioning Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Jet engine Oscilloscope Tap (valve) Incandescent light bulb Sento Reef tank Steam locomotive nomenclature Gold standard M16 (rifle) Novelty (locomotive) Nuclear power Home repair Transistor Swimming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Domestic water system
