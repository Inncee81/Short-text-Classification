how to frame an exterior door window opening i'm making a ft x ft shed and i'm wondering how to frame the exterior door window part i saw somewhere online how to do it using king studs and jack studs and then putting cripple studs under the window opening and above the window opening and similarly for the door i'm wondering if i have to make a header board or is this method of doing it fine it's a foot opening for the door first let's define a few terms a king stud is a full length stud usually that forms the outer part of the frame for a door or window a jack stud which i call a trimmer is a shorter stud that supports the header above a door or window a cripple is a short stud between the header and the top plate or under a window between the bottom plate and the sill the header transfers the vertical load above a window or door opening to the trimmers in your situation the load may not be significant since the shed is most likely single story the international residential code in table r says that the maximum span for a header consisting of two x s or one x is ' for two x s or one x it is ' and for two x s or one x it is ' in your case with a foot door you should use a x header the rough opening for doors is generally inches wider and inches taller than the nominal door size thus if you have a door meaning the width is ' and the height is ' the rough opening should be wide by high that means you will cut the trimmers to furthermore the header is longer than the rough opening to allow for a trimmer on each end in this case for a door you'll need a x header long to assemble the door frame nail each trimmer to a king stud using a penny nail every two feet then nail the x on top of the trimmer using four penny nails on each end driven through the king stud when you nail the frame to the x bottom plate and cut out the bottom plate for the door the rough opening will be by finish the frame by cutting cripples to fit between the header and the top plate you propose to have a foot door i assume you mean a pair of doors the rough opening is inches wide by inches high as mentioned above you'll need a x header cut to long as before the trimmers are long the header is nailed to the king studs with eight penny nails on each end windows are framed similarly to doors except that the space below the window is filled with a sill and cripples unlike doors though the rough opening for a window is usually the same as the nominal window size the rough opening for a window is therefore inches wide by inches high the trimmers are the same as for doors the header for a window is a inch x the cripples under the window are long each window should be checked for the correct rough opening some manufacturers deviate from the nominal window dimensions the window frame is assembled by nailing the trimmers to the king studs then nailing a cripple to each trimmer the x header is nailed in place with six penny nails on each end now a sill is nailed to the tops of the cripples several more cripples are nailed to the sill and the header so that there is a stud every inches actually the entire wall should be framed so that a stud trimmer or cripple falls on centers this may require an extra stud or two but is necessary for nailing plywood or t siding to the wall the nailing schedule is often every on the edges and every in the field center penny galvanized nails should be used Domestic AC power plugs and sockets X10 (industry standard) Enigma machine BS 1363 Residual-current device Musical Instrument Digital Interface Power strip Modem Fuse (electrical) Vacuum tube Transformer Electric motor Embedded system Game Boy Advance Spark plug Light switch Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Digital circuit Grand Central Terminal Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Remote control SCART Distribution board Ignition system Magnetic core memory IPod Telephone exchange Alternating current Seismometer Switch Electricity meter E85 Headlight Secure Digital card Universal Serial Bus ZigBee Oscilloscope Xbox Thermostat Model aircraft USB flash drive Programmable logic controller Ford Crown Victoria Japanese toilet Armored Core Spark gap Jack plug WEPN Electrical wiring (UK) Floppy disk Transmitter Airbag Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Commodore 64 Printed circuit board Hall effect Federal Standard 1037C Automotive lighting WSCR NBC Carburetor Aircraft engine controls Transistor Disc jockey Digital photography Nintendo Tire Glow plug European Installation Bus Naval mine Power line communication Home Box Office Laptop NVIDIA Digital Personal computer Paul Is Dead Extension Cord Fuel injection The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Burglar alarm Mattress Radio controlled airplane Computer animation Bullet Atari 8-bit family Battery electric vehicle Mercury Atlas 6 Telegraphy Flush toilet Professional wrestling slang Cliff Richard Incandescent light bulb TIA-568A/B Xbox 360 Ethernet TGV
