kitchen faucet removal problem im installing a new kitchen faucet i have disconnected all hoses and the sprayer from the kitchen sink i have disconnected the handles and stem my problem is im not sure how to remove the two washers directly under the sink handles for cold and hot once i get them off i should be able to remove the remaining locking nut on each side any suggestions to get these rusted pesky washers off i have the following tools at my disposal basin wrench pliers screwdrivers drill dremel rotary tool small chisel hammer mallet metal and rubber plus pretty much any other basic tools any help much appreciated oh yeah i meant to say the washers are in the cabinet area of sink directly under the handles i believe it's considered a bottom mount faucet if you cant' get it if you have a top mount sink its just easier to take the sink out then get to it from there then you can reseat the sink back into the hole with fresh putty that way you know the sink is secure and wont' have to take it out later its not complicating to remove the sink usually takes just screwdriver or nut driver adn remove the retaining clips it may soudn like a hastle but has saved me hours of time in more than one job but if you dont want to do this the best option like was mentioned is to take a dremel with cutoff and score the bolt loose it will be a hard squeeze getting the dremel positioned exaclty where you want it to be productive dremels have many many uses and one of my favorite tools i strongly recommend pb blaster it is times better than wd and less mess little thicker and well worth the cost oh yeh for your safety remove all wd and other lubricants off the screw the liquid is flamable and the spark from the dremel can will start a fire fire extinguisher just in case is cheap insurance Switch Electric motor Light switch Fluorescent lamp BS 1363 X10 (industry standard) Transformer Fuse (electrical) Relay Telephone exchange Residual-current device Lighting Digital circuit Thermostat Stage lighting Bass guitar Elevator Light pollution Electronic amplifier Hydraulic machinery Airport Electrical wiring (UK) Vacuum tube Thyristor TARDIS Circuit breaker Dimmer GunZ The Duel DMX (lighting) Oscilloscope Ring circuit Thread (computer science) Microwave oven Thermal power station Rail terminology Embedded system Alternating current Fan (implement) Mercury-vapor lamp Apollo Guidance Computer CPU design Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Headlight Keyboard technology High-voltage direct current Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Carburetor Professional wrestling slang Gas metal arc welding Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wave Race: Blue Storm Cray-1 Fire alarm control panel Transistor Knife Overhead lines Debugging Impedance matching Four wheel drive Floppy disk Switched-mode power supply Central processing unit Wire wrap Modem Power strip Hall effect Electrical generator Speed of light Computer MOSFET 2003 North America blackout Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Antenna (radio) Street light Babe Ruth Glossary of firefighting equipment Operational amplifier Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Audiophile Australian rock Sun Ethernet School bus Skateboarding trick Enigma machine Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis National Electrical Code (US) Jack plug Impedance Pump It Up CMOS Cliff Richard Voltage regulator Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Bubble Bobble Aircraft engine controls Logic gate Diode
