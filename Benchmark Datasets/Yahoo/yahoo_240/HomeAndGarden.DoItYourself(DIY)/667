how do i get a broken bathtub drain out the x shaped thing at the bottom broke off so i can't use a drain wrench because there's nothing for it to grab the best way to this is a little tricky you will need a reciprocating saw sawzall with a metal cutting blade cut notches in the metal ring all the way around i would say notches about an inch apart be very careful as to only cut the metal and not the tub that's the tricky part once you have notches in the ring then take a flat head screwdriver and pry underneath it to pop up the ring when you do this though you will have to replace the tub drain which requires you to cut a hole in the wall behind the drain otherwise you will just have to live with the drain being broken with the piece that you say is broken the x you should be safe against leaks but you just will have to get a rubber stopper that fits inside the drain if you want to fill the tub good luck Knitting Sewing machine Sewing Textile manufacturing terminology Clothing Kimono Climbing equipment Screw Upholstery Suture Mattress Applique Yarn Textile manufacturing Glossary of climbing terms Tattoo Tire Cross-stitch Undergarment Embroidery Elastic Wood First aid kit Shoe Shroud of Turin Characters in the Smurfs Tie-dye Comanche Punk fashion Windows XP Bookbinding Wound Han Chinese clothing Textile Stocking Tzitzit Sari Dialysis Fencing Kitab al-I'tibar Community emergency response team Dental brace Cloth RuneScape quests Tensile strength Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Leather Isaac Singer Flag Kilt PlayStation 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Death rock fashion Atari 8-bit family Berlin wool work Autopsy Duct tape Silk Cochineal Threshing machine Hair coloring Compact disc Drill bit Strap-on dildo Rip Torn Garrett A.
