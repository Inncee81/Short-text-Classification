tile backsplash on drywall we are thinking about adding small mosaic or stone tiles on our kitchen backsplash we recently went to a short class at home depot on tiling the guy there reccommended installing a backerboard on drywall first is this difficult for a first time diyer several of the tutorials i've found online install directly onto the drywall any recommendations what are the consequences for installing directly onto the drywall thanks in advance backerboard hardiboard cement board different material same purpose it would be overkill on your project whether you do it is up to you but definitly not necessary its mostly used for extreme wet conditions where water is constant in contact such as shower baths or flooring on drywall install the tile directly on the drywall using thinset mortar premixed is fine to use especially for smaller projects use spacers and a good grout let dry about hours then wipe it down again let it dry for hours then apply sealer on backerboard remember applying backerboard to drywall will extend your wall if you use backerboard plus thinset then tile you bring out the wall of inch of course they make backerboard but still remember you have to cap this somehow to bring the tile back to the wall if you want more flush look you need to remove the area of drywall which you plan on tiling when you do this cut the drywall about smaller on all sides smaller than the area you are tiling cause you have to tape and finish seams between the backerboard joints using fiberglass mesh and mortar screw holes need to be filled as well as far as drywall to backerboard joints easier to do what i said above and keep it flush the only consequeces is that without proper installation it could lead to moisture problems but thats with anything that isnt' properly installed Scale model Monopoly (game) Venus de Milo M16 (rifle) Domestic water system Louvre Upholstery Slide rule Carburetor Shive USB flash drive Option Fuse (electrical) Breast implant Apple Newton Gasoline Power Mac G4 Cube Chios Fume hood Plastic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Li Ka Shing O scale De Lorean DMC-12 Inca Kola Diving suit Shoe Trafalgar Square Chevrolet Camaro EMD Winton-engined switchers Paper size Snorkel Screw Pallet Bicycle helmet Motorcycle safety clothing Diving regulator South Pole Insider trading EMD F3 Solar power Say's law Model robot Auto insurance Airsoft Hearing aid Atari 8-bit family Surface-mount technology FN FAL Hydrothermal vent Chevrolet Nova Hydrochloric acid Black-figure pottery Space Shuttle external tank Baby bottle Ford Cortina Dental brace Gameking French art Casting BS 1363 Mississippi Company Audio tape length and thickness Floorball Plastic bag Public transport Rigging Internet fraud Violin Prostitution in Nevada Hubbert peak theory MMORPG GLOCK Sunroof N-Gage Unit Load Device Nuclear reactor Let's Make a Deal Herbie: Fully Loaded G.I.
