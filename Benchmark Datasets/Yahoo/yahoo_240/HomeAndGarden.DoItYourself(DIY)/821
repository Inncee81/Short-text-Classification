how do you install a sound system in a house so that music can be played in different rooms i am building a new house and i would like to install a system that is connected to my stereo but there is a control pannel in different rooms in the house so that music can be played there for example have the music playing downstairs in the rec room but not hearing the music in the kitchen i think what you are wanting is a sound distribution board you connect the output from your receiver to this board also connected to the board are each room's speakers googling for this should turn up some hits but make sure you are sitting down these aren't especially cheap make sure you can use ohm speakers with your selection i posted a link to a user's manual that describes a board its setup and features you can see the supplier's website within the pdf document a couple things to consider i have a receiver with speakers a and b choice my a set is outside on the patio and my b set is in the house this required no special equipment and is part of the receiver's circuitry you might consider looking into or ghz wireless transmitter receivers this will allow you to broadcast your signal throughout your house without wires there is much more to this approach certainly more than space permits here good luck Couch Barrister Folk etymology Charles Eames Molecular nanotechnology Wan Chai District Chai Wan Passenger car Manufacturing Industrial engineering Kach and Kahane Chai Chai Cognac (drink) Post office Lounge music D-subminiature Voodoo Lounge Chai Jin Shau Kei Wan Solar cell Chai Xianghua Clermont Lounge Places in Singapore by alphabetical order Indiana Anagram Die (manufacturing) Assembly line Frequent flyer program Hong Kong Police Force Cigar Wan Chai Places of worship in Hong Kong Surface-mount technology Fran__ois de la Chaise Assembly language Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Bombardier Ben Ish Chai Space manufacturing Disc brake Claim (patent) Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet Assassination in Sarajevo Hamburg Boeing 747 Rolling-element bearing Siu Sai Wan CG artwork Screw Lego Pontianak, Indonesia Island Line (MTR) Convention on Psychotropic Substances Kowloon Motor Bus Enigma machine Chai Ling Factory Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine Just In Time Mass production Malawi Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Citybus (Hong Kong) History of Japan Pune Xi Shi Austin Lounge Lizards Powder metallurgy The Shining (film) Wire wrap New World First Bus Brushless DC electric motor Anglo-Chinese School Causeway Bay The Lounge Lizards John M.
