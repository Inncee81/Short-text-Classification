i want to fix the little dirtpatches in front of my house and of my neighbor's i have pics please help i maintain the front of both houses but i'm not good at it basically i remove all the weeds trim the bushes and remove any trash the problem that we're having with the houses is that the dirtpatches are on an incline and over many years the dirt continues to fall onto the sidewalk whenever it rains especially if it rains hard and then i have to go clean that up too i was planning on laying sod to make both sides look a lot better but i need a diy project that is relativly simple so i can build a small wall or barrier or whatever it's called to keep the dirt where it belongs what is there is not working well at all i don't mind working hard i would just like it to look relatively nice and inexpensive would be just as good when you see the pic of my house it's the one with the ridiculously big bush check out the house on the right i don't want it to come out looking as horrible as their makeshift patio thanks so much i'm about to add the pic links one moment this is my side http img imageshack us img sd jpg http img imageshack us img rq jpg http img imageshack us img rn jpg http img imageshack us img hx jpg http img imageshack us img lf jpg this is their side http img imageshack us img fj jpg http img imageshack us img nw jpg http img imageshack us img lg jpg of course i will ask my neighbors if they mind me doing the work if i actually can diy in the end your side has those rocks which have gaps and just don't do the job i suggest the type of retaining wall interlocking bricks as pictured in the link below they are a couple dollars a piece you should be able to do the job for about or less you will need to remove the dirt closest to the sidewalk to create room for the bricks if you use a spade you can cut horizontally and create a dirt wall before you place the bricks making the job that much easier i see that their side has what looks like a cement retaining wall but it's not high enough you need their wall to be a good six inches above the dirt to make the two sides compliment eachother i suggest that you add one layer of the same bricks atop their cement wall or whatever that is this added layer will also raise the wall enough for you to have room for mulch when you are finished planting and therefore the mulch won't end up on the sidewalk either then there is the question of plants because that loose dirt is the cause of the erosion and those empty patches of dirt will only encourage weeds to grow there because something will always find a way to grow where there is dirt and light after building your wall you need to plant perennials that will hold the soil in place i suggest that you plan the two sides to compliment eachother since they are so close together groundcover would work but it's boring i would plant perennial flowers which will spread over time don't plant grass it's boring and you have a wonderful opportunity to create two complimentary beautiful mini gardens plus if you plant grass there how are you going to cut it i don't know your zone or how much sun the area gets but i assume it must be partly sunny because i see blooms on the gardenia bush if there's sun you can plant some wonderful clumps of perennial flowers near eachother so that you have continuous bloom through the growing seasons with the retaining wall and mulching the area well there should be little run off after rains the link below classy groundcovers has some perennial flowers that retain soil well not just spreading green groundcovers which as i said before are boring that link is wonderful as you plug in all the conditions of your area including your zone and erosion issues and the site will then offer you plant suggestions that work in your spot which you can then purchase what you like at your local nursery but really any perennial will hold in the soil you don't have to limit yourself to groundcover types tear out that overgrown bush there's nothing beautiful about it and it's too large for the area just tie it up to a truck and drive away the bush will come right out of the ground if you try to trim it back you are probably going to end up with ugly brown branches that have no growth on them and sometimes they never fill back in that area look at flowering perennials at the local nursery that compliment eachother covering the entire blooming season and are varied in color something pink something red something blue and some yellows you get the idea the only things i would keep are the gardenia bush and what looks like some type of leaves from bulbs that is done blooming in the pictures next to that clump plant some flowers that will bloom after those have finished and if they are bulbs you need to plant something that will cover the view of the browning leaves which you shouldn't cut back until they are brown because that is how the bulbs are fed for the next season you could however move those to be positioned better in the garden or divide them into several clumps putting a clump in the neighbor's area too you might also plant another gardenia on your side to compliment the one on their side two mini flowering gardens could be stunning there people will love to gaze at those flowers walking past your house and flowers make people happy don't forget to mulch and mulch deep at least to keep the weeds down and retain the rain instead of it ending up on the sidewalk there will be some erosion run off in the beginning until the plants are established and the soil is compacted after you plant push the soil around the plants down firmly with your shoes it should be a fun project Drawing CPU cache Casting Solar power Floppy disk Sega Saturn
