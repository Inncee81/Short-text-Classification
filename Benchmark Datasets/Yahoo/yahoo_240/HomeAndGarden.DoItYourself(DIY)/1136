why won't the fly traps i've constructed work on anything but myself to make the fly traps i tore old newspaper into strips and dipped them into honey because i don't really like honey except in certain cookies that i can only try to make i usually burn them i hung these strips in my kitchen near a light in the hopes that i would trap the one fly that is always bothering me but i'm the one that's often caught in the traps it seems that i am perpetually washing my hair to get honey out now i know that it is only one fly but that can turn into more quite quickly why don't my fly traps work any other suggestions are appreciated eeew i hate honey too try strawberry jelly instead because if you don't catch anything you can lick the strips of paper off after a few days instead why waste good food Drill bit Screw Upholstery Tire Equine conformation Wood Knife Revolver Textile manufacturing Mattress Nail (engineering) Chopsticks Tractor Clinker (boat building) Handloading Drag racing Elevator Reservoir Dogs Lathe AK-47 Seismic retrofit GLOCK Antenna (radio) Sailing Wind turbine Milton H.
