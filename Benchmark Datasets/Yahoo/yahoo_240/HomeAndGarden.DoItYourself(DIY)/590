do you like organizing all your paper work how do u do it my desk is a disaster plz someone teach me plz specify if you are a businessman or student i am a student and my desk is full of paper i wanted to throw all of them away of course i cant but i seriously think of using dynamite sigh how should i organize it plz help next semester is going to start very soon awww there will be more paper p s i have folders and binders they wont help maybe i am not using it in the right way every piece of advise that i read to your answers are great and i've found in my organizing practice that it may not work for you you have to find your own answers but that doesn't mean you need to do it all your self you have to do what's gonna work for you other people have things that work for them but they could be a completely different person and it may not work for you there is no one organizing box that everyone fits into know that so i don't know you major so i'm making this up obviously if you are a science major you don't need to keep the art history notes after you've finished the semester start by purging stuff from previous classes that are unrelated to your major or that you don't think you will need to reference again as much as i hated accounting i kept the book because it's good to reference and i have used it one of the keys is to know what you will you and what you won't and doing a purge at the end beginning of every semester wait until grades are published things that you think you will need for reference once you get out into your field but maybe you have finished the classes on it can be packed away and well labeled so that they don't take up valuable space that can be a premium when in a dorm room or sharing and apartment as many of us do when we're in college ask youself if you need it ask yourself where you would look for it then get into the habit of taking the time to put it there just remember the more we put off the more we're going to have to do later so take the minute or two as someone else mentioned to put it away whe your done with it another couple for tips if your teachers don't test cumulatively then file away notes after the test so they will all be in one spot for the midterm or final keep the current material with you so you can reference it if a teacher mentions clean off you desk at the end of your day or study time make a note about what needs to be done when you come back to it this will help you feel better about getting started and also help you organize your thoughts as well i used to use spiral notebooks that had pocketed dividers that way i could keep the inportant stuff all in one place and reference it when i'm in class it's was a great place to keep my class syllabus if the teacher mentioned that he had to miss a class it's also a great way to keep the information together i would never tear out my notes so they were always together in chronological order and always focus on how you want it to be not on how bad it is if you focus on the positive then your more likely to create that hope this helped Seismic retrofit Drywall Casting Screw Tire Wood Textile manufacturing Gramophone record Knife Lighting San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Stairway Asbestos Architecture of the California missions Violin Atari 8-bit family Mattress Woodworking Wood carving Punch card Black hole Nine Inch Nails Leasehold estate Floppy disk Super Mario 64 Straw-bale construction Upholstery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Clinker (boat building) Poker jargon Textile manufacturing terminology Spidey Super Stories Naruto jutsu Carburetor Solar cell Patch (computing) Welding Anchor Volleyball Flush toilet McMansion Computer representation of surfaces Opportunity rover Electrophysiology Guns N' Roses USS Tunny (SS-282) Genericized trademark Second Battle of the Atlantic View camera Rigging Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Combine (Half-Life 2) Plaster Friends The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dairy Oscilloscope IRT Flushing Line Redundant array of independent disks Keynesian economics Dodge Charger Lathe Transformers: Cybertron Plastic Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Dice New York City Subway Deck (ship) Carbon dioxide GunZ The Duel Fire fighting Wire Urinary incontinence Ocean's Twelve Action potential Pottery Coffee Hard disk Stage lighting Stave church Stud poker Scientology beliefs and practices Tobacco Doom engine Faster-than-light Baroque chess Carpet Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Pretty Good Privacy
