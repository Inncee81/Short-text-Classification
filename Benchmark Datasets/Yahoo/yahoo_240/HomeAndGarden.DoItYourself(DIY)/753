i have white kitchen cabinets and want to make them look antique is there a stain that does this i saw some at lowes that were almost like an ivory color but looked antique do you use a stain or paint if so how do you do it thanks actually a glaze is easier and faster and cheaper than either painting or staining you can even save more by making your own take water latex or acrylic paint in either burnt umber or burnt sienna and floetrol mix well and you have glaze test on the inside of a cupboard to get the look you want but most of the time i just use a soft rag hubby's t shirts work well for this and use that to apply the glaze work in areas that would naturally show wear and antiquing like in crevaces and edges start out with a light hand because you can always add more to build intensity if you want the cabinets to be easier to clean wipe away grease etc finish with a coat of non yellowing uvb uva protecting polyurethane like varathane Upholstery Woodworking Wood Drill bit Knife Clinker (boat building) Stairway Netsuke Bamboo Wood fuel Table saw Hardwood Billiards Chopsticks Longbow Staple (fastener) Violin Timber framing Laser engraving Bokken Katana Nail gun Screw 2000 Australian Grand Prix Timpani Clarinet Tofu Guitar Gramophone record Seismic retrofit Saw Tire Wood carving Lathe Lycanthropy Skateboard Nail (engineering) Rigging Go (board game) Lumber Piano Brush Coppicing Textile manufacturing Pottery The Contender (television series) Gypsy moth Cincinnati Bengals Axe Punt (boat) Japanese tea ceremony Robot Wars Extreme Programming Pittsburgh Steelers Los Angeles Clippers Culture of Korea Cheating in poker Plywood Japanese cuisine Staple gun Allegheny National Forest Michael Thonet Paper Southeast Texas Qiang Diamond cut Kitchen Monopoly (game) Oak Tri-Stat dX Transformer True Cross The Nameless Novel Kasparov versus The World Mattress Geodesic dome Gunsmith Nunchaku Sword making Harp University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Monpa Greg Norman Tree Digital circuit Guqin Piney Woods Wood router Arcade cabinet Cello President (game) Chicago Bulls Railroad switch Casting Tariff Whose Line Is It Anyway?
