i want to make a garden what should i put in it i live in a condo and i have a really really little area in front of my door where your aloud to plant flowers but nothing else i want to make it look chineese but also flowers what kind of flowers and things should i use find out for sure which zone you live in figure out what type of sun exposure that small plot of ground gets year 'round do research online or otherwise or ask at a nursery that caters to its clients about what plants would be healthy in that spot considering all of the above discovered facts once you've decided what you want to plant make sure that the soil is what those plants can be healthy in if it isn't replace it with the 'right stuff' some plants aren't very picky while others are some very much so i suggest searching online st find sites that have info specifically for your location growing zone they often ask for your zip code to figure it out but more than one growing zone can exist within the same zipcode area on those sites narrow the search to what you are looking for in this case oriental flowers plants take intp account the space they need the better sites for your purpose are those that have several pictures of the plants in bloom in the case of flowers as well as detailed info about their needs i also suggest using organic fertilizers pest control they claim that pesticides herbacides are safe when they stop working on the offending agent but they only become safe to hose pests they still exist tho altered are still chemicals are still deadly to us especially when they get mixed together build up in our systems over time use the flowering plants that are best suited for what you can provide choose from those options the ones that bring the biggest smile to your face d Minnesota Transportation Museum Patch (computing) Computer hardware Dresser Industries Windows 2000 Fast bowling C programming language Double bass System 7 (Macintosh) Magic (illusion) Mac OS 9 Computer virus Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 CPU cache Windows XP Screw IPod Virtual memory Booting Drill bit Sears Holdings Corporation IMac DirectX Glossary of firefighting equipment Information Technology Infrastructure Library Albert Finney Transmission Control Protocol Floppy disk 64-bit Distributed computing Debugging Verilog Blue screen of death Archery Counter-Strike Lisa's First Word Mac OS X Bunnings Warehouse Game Boy Advance Computer Self-modifying code Rolling-element bearing NX bit OpenBSD AmigaOS Black hole Prescott Bush Halliburton Windows Vista Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone Volkswagen Type 2 Personal computer Amiga RISC Laws of cricket Hand grenade Expert system Software testing Sega Universal Serial Bus Wicket Bluetooth Seahenge Original Amiga chipset Redundant array of independent disks Password TI-89 series The Stump Plane (tool) Weapons of Star Trek Poker jargon Beatmania IIDX Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bong Slot machine ATI Technologies Microsoft GunBound Stargate (device) Const correctness Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Burroughs B5000 Integer (computer science) Caddy Wardriving Knoppix Shader Radeon Wood TOPS-20 Stack-smashing protection General relativity Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mars Exploration Rover Master Control Program Panama Canal
