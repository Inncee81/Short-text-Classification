how long can i run copper wire for amp service and still meet code i need to power an amp boat lift but would like to keep the circuit rating at amp thanks you didn't specify the service voltage but for vac single phase copper wire amps the voltage drop is a tad over volts per ft the voltage drop is linear so you can extrapolate this means there will only be about vac available to the load at ft for vac the length is about ft since you wish to maintain amp service you'll need to consider that as the load rather than the intended use load some appliances will operate at vac so you can have about ft of wire before the voltage drops to vac the voltage drop will be different for different types of service i e different voltages and or multi phase service see the site below for more info there is a calculator at the bottom of the page http www powerstream com wire size htm Bong Glass Plastic Door Printed circuit board Manifold The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Solar cell Wine making Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Christmas tree Diamond enhancement Drill bit Wheat beer Klein bottle Bottle opener Brewery Bottle Marching band PHP Wine Champagne (beverage) Woodworking Lake Wine bottle Coffee Polyethylene terephthalate Dundas Square Ketchup Cloud Beer Float glass USS Yorktown (CV-5) Great Lakes M__bius strip Milk Seismic retrofit Descriptive geometry Peruvian cuisine Glacier Water Shotgunning Smoking pipe The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Food preservation Sento Guinness Mario Fountain pen Bassoon Bubble Bobble Beverage can Poker jargon Air conditioning Professional wrestling throws Derrick (lifting device) New Orleans Mardi Gras Recycling Simply connected space Wood carving Hand grenade Harp Recycling of PET Bottles Lava lamp Apollo 15 Piccolo (Dragon Ball) I Ching divination Billiards Paul Newman The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Cello Diamond Martini cocktail Sunlight Wampum Inca Kola Homebrewing Geodesic dome Drilling and threading Super Mario 64 Port wine Sushi Motor oil Seine (fishing) Beverly Hills, California The Time Machine Screw Link (Legend of Zelda) Belgian beer Ice core Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Snipe hunt Stairway Banjo-Tooie Refrigerator car Traditional animation Sundial The Glass Bead Game Soldering
