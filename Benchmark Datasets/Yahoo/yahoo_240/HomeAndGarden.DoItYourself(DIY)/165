how do i choose and install a radon fan i want to put a fan on our passive radon system already put under house and vented through roof i'd like to hook up the fan in our basement myself but could use some help finding a good resource to choose the fan from is there somewhere online i can go to research buy or would a lowes hd be my best bet thanks p a fan for a passive system needs to be sized for the square footage of your basement and for the method used beneath the floor of your basement to allow the air to flow to the pipe if you don't know how this was done it is good to question the builder typically either drain tile is used or gravel is laid to allow air movement under the floor to the vent pipe in some cases as has been my experience neither of these are done and the pipe is shoved into the dirt and the vent doesn't work at all as far as installing the fan in the basement this not advisable a radon fan must be installed outside the living space of the home in your case in the attic the reason for this is because if a leak were ever to developed above the fan it would force high concentrations of radon into your house this is clearly stated in all radon mitigation protocols a radon fan is a specialized piece of equipment that's designed to run in wet conditions and at lower amperages also a manometer should be added assure that the fan is working and moving the air from the ground that is required to reduce your radon level don't try to buy something at the local big box store if you would like to contact me i could help you out Tap (valve) Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Thermal power station Bathing Severe weather terminology (United States) Toilet paper Furnace Japanese toilet Dishwasher Hard water Bathroom Fire Sprinkler Siphon Thermostat Samovar Swimming pool Sauna Hot air balloon Plumbing fixture Glossary of firefighting terms Menstrual cup Temperature Urinal Hyperthermia Hydrotherapy Customs and etiquette of Japan Powder metallurgy Vinegar Hand grenade Autonomous building Energy development Vacuum tube Textile manufacturing Mattress Japanese tea ceremony White phosphorus incendiary HVAC Climate of the United Kingdom Pottery Bidet Fossil fuel power plant Equine conformation Refrigerator Air pollution Barbecue Washroom Solar power Social rule Astronomy on Mars Otitis externa Hot tub Sun Geyser Comet Cruising (maritime) Fountain Poker jargon Apollo Command/Service Module Diving Wallpaper Turbojet P-38 Lightning Swimming Hot spring Aluminium Internal ballistics Toilet humour Meteor shower Avalanche Floppy disk Heckler & Koch G3 Gas metal arc welding Knife Instant coffee Onsen Tofu Acetic acid Firefighter Bookbinding Opportunity rover Agar plate Alkane Degree Fahrenheit Chevrolet Corvair Fecal incontinence Sin City Renewable energy Curling Espresso Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Domestic water system Dialysis Steam engine M-209 Polyethylene terephthalate
