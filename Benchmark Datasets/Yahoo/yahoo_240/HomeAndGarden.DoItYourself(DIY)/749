tub lip and stud gap i've just removed the old wall around my tub and it was screwed on resilient channels which were screwed across the studs probably to offset the gap between the studs and the tub lip which is more than i'm replacing the walls with cement board can i just screw it on the channels too the instructions said to screw every around all edges should i add more channels every thanks i'm not sure what you mean by resilient channels perhaps you mean furring strips which are thin strips of wood that are nailed on top of the studs to space the wall out over the bathtub lip they could also be run perpendicular to the studs but that doesn't provide as much support the cement board instructions ask for screws at every along the edges to minimize the movement in relation to an adjacent piece of cement board it's hard to put in a screw between studs when there is nothing to screw into for that reason you might want to put the furring strips perpendicular to the studs and place them on center however i think that a sheet of exterior grade plywood cdx at least thick might be a better choice that way you are assured of having something for every screw to bite into make sure you have a waterproof membrane between the furring strips or plywood and the cement board this could be pound roofing felt or it could be a heavy plastic sheet i would not use tyvek the membrane should overlap the bathtub lip Seismic retrofit Hoover Dam Antioch, Pisidia Basement World Trade Center San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Air-raid shelter Tunnel Deep Impact (space mission) Great Pyramid of Giza History of the Panama Canal Gatun Dam Temple Mount Decompression sickness Rathfarnham Biblical archaeology Dam Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drill bit Pile Rapid transit Opportunity rover Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Gaillard Cut Cathedral of Magdeburg Hoosac Tunnel Stonehenge Big Dig Philosophy of space and time Excavator Ringfort John Hancock Tower National Certificate of Educational Achievement Oak Island Volleyball Archaeological field survey Masonry Archaeology Water well Jericho Hadrian's Wall Tractor Mattress Exeter Bush v.
