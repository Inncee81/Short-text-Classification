superglue not so super why is that barnacles can stick themselves to most any surface underwater and are a real b h to get off whereas superglue only seems to stick human skin together why can't scientists synthesize the glue that barnacles use they are trying barnacle cement the substance the animals use to glue themselves to ships' bottoms and to rocks has attracted the interest of doctors a layer of this cement three tenthousandths of an inch thick over one square inch will support a weight of pounds it is even stronger than epoxy cement at temperatures above f the glue will soften but not melt and at f the cement will not crack it does not dissolve in most strong acids alkalies organic solvents or water if man could learn to manufacture this cement which barnacles have been using for millions of years it could be used to mend broken bones and hold fillings in teeth researchers discovered that bivalves extract iron atoms from sea water and use it to join proteins together linking the fibrous molecules into a strong adhesive mesh that will stick to virtually anything even teflon pretty hard to analyze something like that http seagrant gso uri edu factsheets barnacle html http starbulletin com business brill html Pebble bed reactor Seismic retrofit Ceramics Wood Pottery Porosity Platform framing Glass Plastic Printed circuit board Hydrogeology Roof Cookware and bakeware Powder metallurgy Solar power Corrosion Solar cell Stairway Primer (paint) Mattress Paint Turquoise Plywood Boat building Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Irrigation Charcoal Drill bit Parquetry High performance liquid chromatography Printmaking Light-emitting diode Pachypodium Solar panel Contact angle Hamster Pavement (material) Reinforced concrete Motor oil Tissue engineering Sol gel Inkjet printer Deck (ship) Water Fire extinguisher Alternative biochemistry Combine (Half-Life 2) Safe sex Ice core Tofu Road Straw-bale construction Alkane Vacuum tube Moss Bong Carpet Gramophone record Liquid crystal display Tile Surface tension Water (molecule) Ammonium nitrate Carbon dioxide sink Linoleum Photolithography Gas metal arc welding Downland Adhesive Heat Desert Balikpapan Carburetor Sewage treatment Concrete Plaster Woodworking Houseplant Integrated circuit Oxygen sensor Nacre Molotov cocktail Soil Friction Geodesic dome Epoxy Spark plug Building material Vitreous enamel Light-frame construction Urnfield Basement Terrazzo Essential oil Table tennis Petroleum Brazing Darcy's law
