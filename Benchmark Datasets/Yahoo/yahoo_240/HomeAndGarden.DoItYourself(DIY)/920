how do i make a pillow i have stuffing and fabric but i don't know how to make one thanks it is a good idea to get some plain cotton or muslin and make the pillow out of that then make a removable cover out of your fancy fabric so that the cover can be removed and cleaned you don't want to do all this work and not have your pillow stay looking nice cut the fabric into two matching squares rectangles circles whatever the size you want the pillow to be when you stuff the pillow it will draw up and seem smaller so you might want to add an inch or so all around plus room for the seam allowance sew the muslin or cotton square around all four corners leaving a hole about the size of your hand so you can put the stuffing in turn the sewn square right side out and stuff the stuffing in until it is as plumpy as you want it to be sew the stuffing hole shut it's easiest to do this closing sewing by hand now sew up your cover fabric leave one side open and install a zipper so you can remove the cover for cleaning if you can't cope with a zipper you can put buttons and button loops or button holes to close the cover or install ribbon ties or you can make the cover big enough so that you can just fold it back on the pillow you can also look in the pattern books at fabric stores they have home decorator patterns in them and you could buy a pattern for the type and size of pillow you want the pattern will provide a cutting template and very detailed instructions Loudspeaker Wood Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Basement Xanadu House Door Drill bit Window Vacuum Carpet Timber framing Insulation Electrical wiring Straw-bale construction Kitchen Asbestos Glossary of firefighting terms Bullet Casting Autonomous building Diode Diving suit Sento Wilton House Thermal power station Shotgun house Light-frame construction Solar cell Seismometer White House TARDIS The Time Machine Fan (implement) Combine (Half-Life 2) Solar power Dundas Square Speed of light McMansion Equine conformation Tent Transformer Spark plug Rathfarnham Lighting HVAC Volleyball Sound effect Frankfurt kitchen Wind turbine Geodesic dome Particle accelerator Le Corbusier StarCraft: Uprising Radar Violin Blood (computer game) Building material Cube (film) Poker jargon Jet engine G-Man (Half-Life) Sound Michelson-Morley experiment The Parting of the Ways St Albans Cathedral Construction Stonehenge Upholstery Chatsworth House Echo chamber Stairway The Shining (film) TGV Gramophone record Super Metroid Wood carving Abbey Microphone Buckingham Palace Integrated circuit The Phantom Manor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Masonry Tudorbethan architecture Oscilloscope Bladderwort Natural Selection (computer game) Radio masts and towers Knife Temporal bone
