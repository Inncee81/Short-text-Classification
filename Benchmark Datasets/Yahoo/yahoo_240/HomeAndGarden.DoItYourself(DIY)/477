describing facing directions of a house i need to write down facing directions of my house such as front of the house back of the house etc can someone tell me commonly used terms to describe each side of a house i mean do people describe them using north south east west directions but if they do then is that based on worldly coordinates where north means north of the city or does north mean the front of the house thanks for your help if you look out a window and you're looking north then that's a north facing wall if you look out your front door and you're facing south then that's a south facing home and so on it doesn't matter which is the front or back just the direction it faces Basket Kitchen Milton H.
