lighting fixtures and ceiling fan problems my father had hooked up a new light and and a ceiling fan whe the switch was in the off position the lights and fan came on whe placed into the on position the lights went off then the fuse popped there are switches that control both one in kitchen and one in the hall unsure if the circuit they are on can handle the wattage they are producing or if there may be a short in the switch any help would be appreciated when the lights came on and the both switches were in the off positioned it acted as a complete circuit but when the switch was placed in the on position the light went off but at that time it popped the fuse the switches on the control both lights at the same time when both fixtures were lights it worked fine but once one of the light fixtures turned into a fan light combo its not working correctly im thinking either bad switches or the area cant handle the wattage but unsure since the main concern is the lights come on when both switches are in off position it sounds to me like you have three way switches so the normal on and off position does not apply and it sounds like the fan light may have been wired wrong or the circuit is over loaded when the fan comes on Professional wrestling holds Shirt Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Bookbinding Mattress Suplex Equine conformation Skirt and dress Sewing Powerbomb Knitting Glossary of nautical terms Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Swingout Knife Piledriver (professional wrestling) Stairway Glossary of American football Comanche Kilt Glossary of partner dance terms Sewing machine Skinhead Glossary of climbing terms Carpet Floppy disk Japanese tea ceremony Cricket Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling aerial techniques Strap-on dildo Upholstery Black tie Academic dress of Oxford University Colours, standards and guidons Pattern (sewing) Poker jargon Mandible Violin Lindy Basic Panoramic photography Maxilla Chess terminology Textile manufacturing Contredanse Kurt Angle Salwar kameez Double bass Glossary of graph theory Stocking Dice Rugby union positions Casting Volleyball Mark Calaway Adam Copeland Drill bit Starfleet ranks and insignia Oscilloscope Palatine bone Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Clothing Sailing Coin flipping Computer representation of surfaces Wallpaper group Boy's surface Point groups in three dimensions Scapula Dog agility M1 Helmet Sword making Snooker Fencing Humerus Horse Jack plug Chess strategy and tactics Dog training Gurkha Contingent Shogi Betting (poker) Frontal bone Clothing terminology Rail terminology Autopsy Freehand lace DDT (professional wrestling) Welding Necktie Football (soccer)
