electric garage door opener won't work my garage door opener will not shut unless i manually release the catch and pull it down then when i go to open it i have to hold the remote control button down until the catch slides down to the correct spot about seconds after that the door opens electronically but won't close is something blocking the sensor eyes that's what it will do then will open but not close if the light on it blinks a few times but doesn't close that's definitely what it is i would almost be certain that it has to do with the sensors whether they are blocked by something in the garage itself have dirt on them or have a wiring problem between them and the motor Welding Printed circuit board Plastic Cookware and bakeware Ammonia Bullet Internal ballistics Dry cleaning Mattress Drill bit Coffee Sulfuric acid Gas metal arc welding Pottery Hand grenade Titanium Glass Arc welding Floppy disk Fire extinguisher Gilding Refrigerator Brazing Barbecue Textile manufacturing Water (molecule) Portable stove Microwave oven Textile manufacturing terminology Knitting IPod Motor oil Haloalkane Aluminium Paint Poker jargon Fiberglass Solar power Glacier Knife Nuclear weapon design Acrylic paint Kitchen Solar cell Vacuum tube Coal Diving suit Christmas tree Fabrication (metal) Steel Metallurgy Fume hood Metalworking Hydrochloric acid Powder metallurgy Laundry detergent Fire fighting Baseball Polyethylene terephthalate Iron Manicure Semiconductor fabrication Cast iron Shroud of Turin Climbing equipment Cathode ray tube Semiconductor device Brush Dodge Charger Boat building Radio controlled car Stainless steel Strap-on dildo Radio controlled airplane Mouse (computing) Integrated circuit Epoxy Seismic retrofit Circuit design Sewage treatment Mach kernel Ion implantation Sea ice Vitreous enamel Igneous rock Thermal power station Carbon nanotube Roof Carburetor Cannabis (drug) Incineration Glossary of climbing terms E85
