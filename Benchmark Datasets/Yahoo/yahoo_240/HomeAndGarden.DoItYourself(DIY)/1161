how can i cut a notch in a glass shelf i am installing my fitted kitchen myself and have come up against a minor problem i have fitted a cupboard over water pipes and cut a recess through the back so it fits nicely against the wall unfortunately the shelf inside is glass and wont fit all the way inside as it touches the pipes this means the door won't shut properly how can i recess the glass shelf to allow for the pipes only about mm so it will go all the way in dont use a cutter if the glass is tempered you can use a dremel only if you keep the glass wet and cool so it doesnt crack glass has to be wet ground this will all cost you a bit of money anyways so go to a glass store and they can grind it down for you for usually a minimal charge if its mm depth but the length is considerable they might charge a lot so you may want to get a new piece cut yes there are glass grinders but they are average and cutters are to for a good one i know its the whole diy thing but the grinding charge shouldnt be all that much so go to a pro or at least a hobby stained glass store Strap-on dildo Knife Floppy disk Gramophone record Mixtape Sega Saturn ZX Spectrum Casting Sound recording Light-emitting diode Polystyrene United States Postal Service Incandescent light bulb Nine Inch Nails The Fragile Unreal Donovan Bicycle lighting M16 (rifle) Packaging and labelling Plastic Glass Lightbulb joke Star Trek Customizable Card Game Transistor Tennis Computer and video game packaging Tofu Internal ballistics DVD Phonograph cylinder Compact audio cassette United States v.
