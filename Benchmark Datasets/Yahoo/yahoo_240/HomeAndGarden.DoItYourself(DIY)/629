how do you render an outside wall all render should be in two coat work the first cout is the scratch coat the sand should be plastering sand and you can either use ordinary portland cement or masonry cement the latter has some lime in it and it makes it easier to use but the coatings are softer if the wall is very dry then wet it down first give it a test pour a cup of water down it from the top and see how far the water runs before it is absorbed into the wall if it disapears quickly then wet it down well apply the first coat a mix of to mixed by weight very important not shovel for shovel then with a piece of wood with nails fixed to the end and just coming through the bottom scratch the wall to create a key for the second coat apply top coat after hours to allow first coat to fully dry then with a straight edged timber rule the top coat to show up all the hollows and high spots to do this you hold the straight edge horizontily at the bottom of wall and bring it up the wall using at the same time a left to right action to help you get a level finish then you fill all the low spots and do it all over again until you are happy with it then you need a tool call a float buy them at any builders merchants and go over and over the wall to make it flat and seal the coat it it dries out too fast then flick some water over the wall and it will make it easier to get a good finish Warranty Home repair Tire Tap (valve) Thermal power station Exception handling Safety engineering Microwave oven USS Seal (SS-183) Knife Tamper resistance USS Tunny (SS-282) Fire extinguisher Grey market Unreleased Madonna songs Loss leader Roof Laserdisc Spirit of Ontario I Turbulence Residual-current device Petroleum Traumatic brain injury USS Albacore (SS-218) Identity theft E85 Bicycle brake systems Ford GT Ionizing radiation De Lorean DMC-12 Diagon Alley Mattress Solar cell Waterbed Fuzzy logic USS S-44 (SS-155) Kirby Corporation Cruising (maritime) Auto insurance Bicycle lighting Variable Water tower Naval mine Siphon AvtoVAZ Tap water Vacuum tube USS S-37 (SS-142) Mosquito Binoculars Early IBM disk storage Karl Rove Best Buy Scientology beliefs and practices Cookware and bakeware MTBE Chatsworth House USS S-42 (SS-153) Western Digital Memory leak Emission standard Elevator Sellafield USS Seadragon (SS-194) Product Lifecycle Management Reference counting Fusion power USS S-38 (SS-143) Scion (car) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Canon T90 Plumbing fixture PCB layout guidelines GNU Debugger CDC 6600 Malloc Nuclear power phase-out Hamster Red Dwarf characters Plame affair timeline Oil-for-Food Programme Japanese tea ceremony Filling station North British Locomotive Company Mazda Miata Hydrogen economy Rebate (marketing) Saab H engine Sewage treatment Busta Rhymes Hamming code USS S-32 (SS-137) Failure rate Purgatory Transport in Sudan USS Amberjack (SS-219) Land Rover BMW Z1 Hollywood Squares Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant
