ceiling fan i have a ceiling fan that i am installing and the light works but i can't get the fan to work from the ceiling there is a bare ground wire a green wire a white wire and a pinkish wire the mounting bracket also has a green wire from the fan is a blue white black and green wire i have wired it like the instructions said white to white greens to greens and blue and black to the other wire which is the pinkish wire that i have am i doing this right and what do i do with the bare ground wire i suck at electricity help the green wire on the mounting bracket is just the ground those aren't a big deal the pinkish wire is probably the red wire which is the power to the fan if you mount a ceiling fan to a place where you had a light already you most likely only had one wire to go to the wall switch to switch the fan light independently you need a nd wire ran to the wall switch or to use a remote control that has this capability or rd option which is probably what you were planning to do is to use the pull chains to turn on off the fan the light if this is your plan then the hot wire coming out of the electrical box needs to be attached to both hot wires coming out of the fan there should be one for the fan one for the light in your case it sounds like you need the pinkish wire from the ceiling to go to the blue black wire the white is the neutral needs to be hooked up but doesn't carry the power and the green is just the ground once you are done if they don't turn on make sure to try the pull chains could be turned off Woodworking Violin Wood finishing Varnish Upholstery Paint Eolian Plastic St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) Volleyball Polyurethane Epoxy Dinghy Staining (biology) Pencil Stained glass Impact crater Nunchaku Wood carving Mattress Pottery Glass Carpet Symmetry Cello Economic rent Bassoon Sistine Chapel Wood Clinker (boat building) Seismic retrofit Economics European Beech Smoking pipe Polymer clay Poverty line Bong Staines American individualist anarchism Monopoly (game) Black Pyramus and Thisbe Campfire Soap The Human Stain Brush Sand Chair Casting Jean Baptiste Vuillaume Hamster Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Dilbert Desert Baseball bat Capitalism The Copenhagen Opera House Laundry detergent Fire fighting Primer (paint) Workplace democracy Vacuum cleaner Plywood Shellac Bokken Akatsuki (Naruto) Pump It Up Anarcho-capitalism Robert Lawson (architect) Radio controlled airplane Amber Osmium Parquetry Jatob__ Macbeth Bernie Sanders Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Collectibles in Bionicle Anchor Stalag Luft III Fancy rat Detailed timeline of the assassination of John F.
