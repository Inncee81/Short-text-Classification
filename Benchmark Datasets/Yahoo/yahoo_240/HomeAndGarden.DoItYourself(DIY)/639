flipping homes house flipping are there any courses out there for flipping homes i think it would be smart to have some courses completed before talking to an investor that way there is a better chance that the investor will be willing to help me out i know that flipping houses is very hard i dont need to be told that my question is are there any courses out there or what kind of courses would be benificial to take thanks in advance lola certainly just enrolling in a general real estate course would help at the very least you'd learn the market both local and otherwise you'd learn the trends the housing availability in areas ie foreclosures etc you'd learn the mechanics of financing and what lenders are ok with flipping in other words a direct line to the business in a broad sense and a way to have access to those houses listed that are most available before many others know most reasonable the condition of any house the market in any area buyer seller trends options allowing a buyer to define in a loan that the house isn't thought of as a keeper ie length of time one might legally be bound to a mortgage before re selling etc etc etc i've owned a bunch of properties in my time and many were held as rentals which isn't a suggestion i'd make for a diy handy person but if i was to become involved again i'd look into investing in multi family units flipping on the other hand is a consideration hope this helps some steven wolf Casting Paint Pottery Stucco Aggregate (composite) Sandpaper Concrete Fire extinguisher Inhalant Drill bit Colloid Painting Irrigation Pansy Pastel Fuel injection Sand Color Christmas tree Lost-foam casting Mosquito Table tennis Woodworking Graffiti Glass Pepper spray Nail (anatomy) Heraldry Arcade cabinet Fire fighting Diamond enhancement Airbrush Papier-m__ch__ Deck (ship) Stoat Micro-encapsulation Malaria Manicure Radio controlled airplane Loudspeaker Bulk vending Thermal power station Curling Stopping power Printed circuit board Screw Cat DDT West Nile virus Rainbow Anthrax Earth Liberation Front Christo and Jeanne-Claude Parquetry Coat of Arms of Canada Coat of arms Lead paint Volcanic ash Drawing Plywood Hall effect WIHT Nasal spray Ultramarine Friction Gesso Biological pest control Gas metal arc welding Galvanization Liquid crystal display Gravel Chitradurga Planet of the Daleks Hamster Opportunity rover Leech Linear Pottery culture Cookware and bakeware Tillandsia Polyvinyl alcohol Panel painting Liger Zero Spotted Skunk Controlled Substances Act Electric motor Serialism Pavement (material) Electroshock gun Lemmings 2: The Tribes Japanese tea ceremony Printmaking Turquoise Agate Anopheles Australian Aboriginal art Glaze Native Americans in the United States Xanadu House Projection screen Retroreflector
