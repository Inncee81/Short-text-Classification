the perfect soap recipie okay this isn't really a question but i have the perfect soap recipie in history okay there are many combinations but i'm just going to give you two all you need is an empty soap bottle container a regular contanier or anything you use that is empty for soap pump works best also for the ingredients you will need funny color foam soap found at your nearest walmart or target no specific color but you can custimize any color and fragrance frebreeze no lysol or oust only frebreeze and softsoap foam soap oh and you'll need a spoon here's how to make it shake up the frebreeze can softsoap foam and funny color foam soap until you can barely hear their contents then spray the desired amount of funny color foam soap into the container then take the frebreeze can and spray the can into the container until the funny color foam soap top of the foam is coated with frebreeze then take the softsoap foam soap and pump it over the frebreeze until you can't see continued from the top the top of the frebreeze and funny color foam soap then take the spoon and mix it until it is all mixed in and nothing is left but the funny color foam soap it looks like it then try it out it's better than the foam color soap because of the softsoap and it comes off easily and comes in your favourite scent for extra dry hands or just plain dry use softsoap green aloe gel soap with the same ingredients but with the softsoap gel instead of softsoap foam this is created by me and please credit me for it thank you and may god bless your day okay okay i see you all think that the frebreeze is bad for you which it is but my idiot older brother likes to mess with my account and said it was frebreeze i'm really really sorry i wrote it down on a peice of paper to remember and i wrote down different scented gel soap not frebreeze again i'm really sorry what in the world are you doing using febreze in soap i hope you aren't suggesting that people put this on their bodies anyone considering doing this please don't if you want home made soap search the net for soap making forums mixing household chemicals even soaps can be dangerous especially when combinations the manufacturers never intended are created with potentially hazardous effects according to the safety data sheet for febreze this a skin irritant on prolonged exposure rinsing with cold water is recommended to remove the irritant from the skin Linoleum Plywood Stairway Tile Seismic retrofit Platform framing Carpet Mosaic Parquetry Roof Wallpaper group Betting (poker) Poker jargon Strake Humerus Penrose tiling Mattress Gramophone record Maxilla Strap-on dildo Radio controlled airplane Mahjong Epoxy Kitchen Light-frame construction Oriented strand board Basement Adhesive Home improvement Friction Asbestos Glossary of partner dance terms Ra (board game) Elevator Enceladus (moon) Drill bit M.C.
