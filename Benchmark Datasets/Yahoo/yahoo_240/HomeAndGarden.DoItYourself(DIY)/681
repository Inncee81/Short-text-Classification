how do i improve the appearance of a concrete porch entryway this is a very small area x i would call it a stoop but it is under roof and is structurally necessary but since it is my front entry it is very visible it is a foot thick concrete slab placed on top of a ' block wall the slab is still solid but its appearance is deteriorating as there are chips around its edges it cannot be replaced as there is a structural archway being supported by this porch floor i wanted to use an epoxy river stone or nature stone floor covering but this is not available in my area so i am back to square one painting it would not do enough outdoor carpet would not look right and would be too much of a hassle to keep clean for such a small area can i use slate or stone facing on a floor any other ideas use false stone on the sides or outdoor tile can change the look dramitcally and fairly inexpensive i would take a picture of your porch and go to your local building center and get some advice with the new products on the market today lots of options HVAC Dymaxion house Medical ventilator Turbofan Boeing 707 Ventilation Volkswagen Type 2 House, M.D. Mechanical ventilation Air pollution Bathroom Japanese toilet Hermione Granger Pulmonary alveolus Concorde Chevrolet Camaro Fan (implement) Boeing 737 Beechcraft King Air Asbestos Ford Thunderbird Liquid breathing Nash Motors Vacuum cleaner Radon Airbus A320 Fire fighting Stocking CFM International CFM56 Blast shelter Married... with Children Ford Windsor engine Brian Jones (musician) Gas turbine Kresge Auditorium Mohammed Zahir Shah Flush toilet The Brady Bunch The Boondock Saints Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon Carnivorous plant Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Propeller MythBusters Big Brother (USA TV series) Tessellation Avenue Q Shotgun house Buckingham Palace AMC 35 Grumman American AA-5 Macromedia Apple Macintosh Saturday Night Live commercial Rafic Hariri International Airport Ford Mustang Sound P-51 Mustang Air conditioning Kimberly-Clark Corporation Lung Fume hood Today I am A Clown Kitchen BMW E12 Pinoy Big Brother Open Arms (Mariah Carey song) Manifold (automotive engineering) Mercedes-Benz S-Class 1,4-dichlorobenzene Construction Iron lung Dormitory Mercedes-Benz SL-Class Home improvement Pneumonia The X-Files (season 1) Dance of the Vampires Mattress Fallout shelter Psychoacoustics TARDIS Renault 16 Jayne Mansfield Toxic (song) 24 (television) B-25 Mitchell Lionel Corporation The Sound of Silence ColdFusion Opie and Anthony Mazda Miata 867-5309/Jenny Good Times United Technologies Corporation Babe Ruth Powel Crosley Jr. Competitors for the Crown of Scotland Porsche 928 Douglas Adams
