excavation estimate i'm need a hole dug in my back yard it's going to be ' x ' x deep nothing special just dirt i have one estimate from an acquaintance who's in that line of work but it seems a bit high for 'digging a hole' can someone ballpark for me what something like this should cost my estimate was it seemed pretty high rent a backhoe like a case or similar should be about a day and that should take less than a day even for a novice the guys near me i hired to dig out tree stumps to put in a garage wanted per stump pretty much the same as everyone i hired them for expediency but the second time i rented one backhoe operators typically charge much less than excavator operators like less Mattress Gramophone record Swimming pool Rail gauge Gas metal arc welding Sea ice Entropy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Knife Gauge theory Motorcycle Ice core American wire gauge Hastings Standard Model Sento Gauge (bore diameter) Magnetism The Internet Movie Database Rail transport modelling Billiards Capitalism Reactive armour Bob Hope RMS Queen Mary 2 Drifting (motorsport) Sniper Motor oil First Battle of the Atlantic Bicycle helmet Gauge blocks Chevrolet Caprice Pressure gauge Passenger ship Coffee Rain gauge Sea level rise Siphon UK Singles Chart P-61 Black Widow Hernia Jets'n'Guns Motorcycle helmet Pressure Mil Mi-24 Hoover Dam Hydraulic head (hydrology) 125 mm Smoothbore Rounds Cardboard Drowning Opportunity rover Timpani Esperanto grammar Quark Plymouth Fury People mover Arado Ar 240 SS Andrea Doria TSMS Lakonia Bicycle Conductor (material) Exploration of Mars Scale model Manometer Shoe Intelligence quotient Diamond cut Volleyball Gradius Spark plug Strap-on dildo Polish Air Force Cartridge (firearms) Landfill Caliber Compact disc Explosive material Altruism Quantum chromodynamics The Mountain Goats Generic top-level domain Bicycle frame Shotgun USS S-5 (SS-110) Technicolor National Provincial Championship Guilty Gear Textile manufacturing Beatmania IIDX Bicycle lighting Spontaneous symmetry breaking Ocean liner Kansas (band) Badminton Flavour (particle physics) Callus Status of religious freedom in France Bore gauge Geology of the Moon
