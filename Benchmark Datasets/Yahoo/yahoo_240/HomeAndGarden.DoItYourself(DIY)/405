drywall help we have the drywall hung taped and the joint compound sanded i know when you put on the joint compound you fill to the left and the right of a hump with the edge of the tool on the bump to fill to level the area why do i still see the seal of the tape under the paint we have done three rooms now and it is still happening we have tried both types of tape the stick mesh and the reg kind please help thank you jim i'll go and get to work again thanks so much tess sounds to me that you need more mud on the joints lol anyways to start off you need three coats of mud on the tape first is a coat of mud thick enough to hold the tape to the wall using a six inch knife no bubbling or rippling and make sure the tape is the right way seam going into joint of drywall then let dry second coat you may use a ten inch trawl use lots of mud on this coat but not so think your shoulders would explode sanding it just enough to taper the edges of the joints roughly ten inches wide when u sand give the edges a good sand and go over the middle pretty good but not down to the tape remember you feel more with your hands and not with your eyes third coat is just to fill any imperfections use a twelve inch trawl to do this coat remember to use a thin layer of mud for this coat and again taper the edges good luck Drill bit Stairway Solar cell Wood Drywall Seismic retrofit Molding (decorative) Mattress Solar power Floppy disk Lighting Casting Woodworking Equine conformation Door Tire Poker jargon Microeconomics Textile manufacturing McMansion Straw-bale construction Glass Strap-on dildo Wood carving Collision detection Apollo Command/Service Module Light-frame construction Sento Welding Wilton House Temporal bone Loudspeaker Violin Wallpaper group Glossary of firefighting equipment P-61 Black Widow Pottery Upholstery De Lorean DMC-12 Gas metal arc welding Opportunity rover Oscilloscope Glacier Rigging Fire fighting Timber framing Architecture of the California missions TARDIS Japanese toilet Kitchen Doom engine Sailing Windows XP Fan (implement) Wayne Corporation Electrical wiring Space elevator Firearm Carburetor The Shining (film) Passenger car Mosaic Porsche 911 Carpet Boat building Thermal power station Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Anchor Diamond cut Amateur telescope making Mirror Gramophone record Hamster Terminal ballistics Asbestos Basement Sternum Air-raid shelter Deck (ship) Blood (computer game) Plastic Economic inequality Table saw Dodge Charger Sacrum Jet engine Rathfarnham Normal distribution Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Eyepiece Chair Diving suit Mass spectrometry Wall
