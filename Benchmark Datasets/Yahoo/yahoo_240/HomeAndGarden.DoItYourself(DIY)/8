can i install windows in my attic i have large gable vents in my attic of them and i would like to take them out and put windows in there to bring in more light but i also want to keep the attic ventalated how would i do that i thought about maybe putting in the windows and above the windows at the ridge putting in a triangle gable vent but of cource it would be smaller than the vents that i have now its a walk up attic with buit in stairs and wood plank flooring i'm guessing your gable vents are in the ceiling why not put windows in the end walls of the attic it's apparently large enough to stand up in so there should be enough room to install windows HVAC Bungalow The House of the Seven Gables Stairway Chatsworth House Passenger car Light-frame construction Roof The Haunted Mansion Basement Abbey Kitchen Lake District McMansion Sento Shotgun house Fire fighting Holkham Hall California Bungalow Rathfarnham Glossary of firefighting terms Lighting The Phantom Manor Tudorbethan architecture Robert Lawson (architect) Shaggy dog story Wilton House Doom engine Freedom Tower Washroom Old New Synagogue, Prague Compton Wynyates Solar power G-Man (Half-Life) Window Furnace Villa Farnese World Trade Center The Diary of Anne Frank (film) Pforzheimer House Syphon Filter Futurama (TV series - season 5) St Albans Cathedral Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Domestic water system York House Cannabis cultivation Platform framing Columbine High School massacre Glossary of firefighting equipment Palazzo Vecchio The Brady Bunch Montacute House Grand Central Terminal St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) 742 Evergreen Terrace Build engine Cathedral of Magdeburg Temporal bone Architecture of the California missions Le Corbusier Robert Ballard Ford Torino An__tkabir Trombe wall Combine (Half-Life 2) Home improvement The Penultimate Peril Sistine Chapel King's Head Inn, Aylesbury Wood Wood carving Seismic retrofit James Hanratty Bristol Grammar School Apollo 8 Volcano Mount St. Helens John Vanbrugh Rushton Triangular Lodge Dymaxion house Alhambra Hogwarts Floor Directory M16 (rifle) Marathon (computer game) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Princes Risborough Manor House Cubicle desk Burton Constable Hall RuneScape quests Arlington House Kedleston Hall Bus models used in New York City Transit Capernaum Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Toilet Castle Wars Autonomous building Blood Simple STS-61
