how can i fix a toilet that's leaking out the back and side of the tank i just moved into a new apartment and i suddenly have a weird problem with my toilet whenever i flush the toilet water starts leaking out the right side of the tank into the floor it's like too much water is refilling the tank or something the maintenance people in my apartment take forever and don't seem to be very competent is there a way i can fix this myself any ideas what might be wrong thanks in advance for any help you can give me i think i wasn't specific enough with the place of the leak the water is coming out of the top of the lid of the tank and running down the side into the floor take the lid off the tank and see what is happening if the amount of water of a refill is actually overflowing the tank then you need to adjust the device that regulates the level at which the water stops flowing this could be a ball on the end of a metal arm in which case you may need to ajust a screw that changes the angle of the arm or you may need to bend the arm so the ball engages at a lower water level if it is a float device that shuts off when it floats to a certain level you need to adjust the clip that shuts off the flow when the float gets high enough these are the two most common fixes it all depends on what is inside your toilet if there is something wrong with the refill mechanism other than adjusting the fill level then you probably shouldn't tackle that yourself if you have no idea what you are doing you could break the toilet or cause a flood which would end up being very expensive problems Jet engine Turbocharger Temperature Axial compressor Thermal power station Turbofan Electric motor Supercharger Fan (implement) Transformer HVAC Refrigerator Diesel engine Turbojet Carburetor Gas compressor Toyota Prius Air conditioning Gas turbine Central processing unit Ocean thermal energy conversion Heat Vacuum Two-stroke cycle Furnace Solar power Phase change heat pump Dodge Neon Apollo 13 Engine cooling Propeller Bi-metal Control system Cray-1 Overclocking Supersonic transport Wind power Ford Ranger EV Welding Thermoregulation Mercury Atlas 6 Skateboarding trick MOSFET Stirling engine Nuclear power Embedded system Nuclear reactor Three Mile Island Digital circuit Transistor Circuit breaker Heinkel He 100 Motor oil Explosive material Pratt & Whitney J58 Magnetic core memory Fossil fuel power plant Rebreather Stall (flight) Equine conformation Helium Bicycle Climate of the United Kingdom Steam engine Oscilloscope Automobile Wind turbine SABRE Audio level compression Ozone depletion Swamp cooler CPU cooling Hard disk Ceramics Ironing Personal rapid transit Electrophysiology Gas absorption refrigerator Spacecraft propulsion Loudspeaker CPU design Monsoon Internal combustion engine Hydrogen economy Mooney M20 Thermocouple Aircraft engine controls Hot air balloon E85 Microphone Fire fighting
