learning to use a sewing machine my mum is teaching me to sew using a sewing machine at the minute i'm just getting the feel of it so she's drawing patterns on paper for me and i'm trying to follow the lines without going out of them my mum used to work in a clothing factory but she's only made a few full garments the factory had a production line she only did a fraction of the work and i want to eventually learn how to make my own full garments there's only so much my mum can teach me though so at some point i'll have to start self teaching myself out of books and whatnot i'm very impatient when i'm teaching myself stuff so i'd really appreciate it if experienced sewers could tell me where they thing i should start and how to build my way up to making my own garments i'd appreciate any book recomendations too please don't suggest classes as i'd have to travel out of town which i can't or tv shows because i live in spain and probably don't get the same tv channels i would suggest going to a fabric store they should have books as well as simple patterns for beginners my first project was an apron then a skirt and finally pants you could probably also find books at your public library if you've got one near you good luck and have fun it's a great hobby and a good skill to have Plastic Domestic water system Roof Seismic retrofit Plumbing fixture Basement Casting Rail terminology Flush toilet Fecal incontinence Drill bit Toilet paper Polyvinyl chloride Novelty (locomotive) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Motor oil Water supply Billiards Thermal power station Carburetor Soldering Screw Kitchen Gramophone record Portsmouth Block Mills Bong Cross-country skiing Siphon RuneScape quests Professional wrestling holds Sound effect Elevator Japanese toilet Hamster Internal ballistics Drainage Coupling (railway) Coppersmith Mixed martial arts Dymaxion house Autonomous building Asbestos Skateboard Equine conformation Cello Nunchaku Skateboarding trick Euphemism Hashish Guitar Geodesic dome Professional wrestling attacks Muay Thai Mattress Lionel Corporation Sewage treatment Electrical wiring Bristol Grammar School Home repair Wood Floppy disk E85 Eifel Aqueduct Stairway Glossary of firefighting equipment Wood carving Perl Washroom Johnson Wax Headquarters Toilet Diamond The Emancipation of Mimi Table saw Toilet humour Condom Sento Manifold Pipe organ Urinary incontinence Harp Knife Vacuum Blue Man Group Violin Clarinet Rigging Scale model Saturday Night Live Door Diving suit Wagonway Irrigation Cruising (maritime) Shit Chopsticks Chevrolet Corvair engine Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey O scale Menstrual cup
