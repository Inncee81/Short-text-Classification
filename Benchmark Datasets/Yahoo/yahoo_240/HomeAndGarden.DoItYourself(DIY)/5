hot water out of the cold tap i asked this question awhile ago but now i think i've narrowed it down and need some more specific information we have never had cold water from our cold taps it has always been at best tepid sometimes almost hot i have looked at several probable causes and think i have it narrowed down but need help on what to do to fix it when the taps in the house are all turned off the cold water inlet pipe on top of the water heater is cold when we turn on any cold water tap in the house you can immediately feel the cold water inlet pipe begin to get warm i am assuming that there is some kind of siphoning going on drawing hot water into the cold water pipes is there some kind of valve that i can install in the cold water pipe to prevent the hot water from entering oh yeah its an electric water heater about years old we had the same problem with the original water heater thanks for your help you can purchase an anti syphon valve install it on the cold water inlet on the hot water tank to stop this back flow the pressure drop at the open tap cause the pressure in the tank to try to equalize thus causing back flow if you have trapped air in the water heater it will act like a pressure tank on a water well pump check for trapped air by opening the safety valve only if you have the discharge plumbed to the outside or a drain good luck Siphon Carburetor Thermal power station Solar power Flush toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Tap (valve) Furnace Thermostat Ocean thermal energy conversion Autonomous building Irrigation Two-stroke cycle Water heater HVAC Plumbing fixture Jet engine Brewery Fire hydrant Three Mile Island Bong Dam Steam engine Hydraulic ram Hydraulic machinery Pump Rebreather Rail terminology Turbocharger E85 Water hammer Diving regulator Apollo 13 Fossil fuel power plant Glossary of firefighting terms Sewer Novelty (locomotive) Newcomen steam engine Vacuum tube Heat Carbon dioxide Basement Four-stroke cycle Snorkel Cruising (maritime) Diving suit Water supply Hydropower Dodge Neon Samovar Turbojet Air conditioning Poker jargon Drowning Canal lock Radiator Turbofan Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Space Shuttle external tank Water turbine Kitchen Hot air balloon Apollo Command/Service Module Steam locomotive nomenclature Soldering Home repair Gas compressor Stirling engine Axial compressor Water organ Central heating Fire fighting Scuba set Sewage treatment Eldfell Nuclear power Seismic retrofit Chevrolet Corvair Motor oil Welding Refrigerator Transformer Sento Energy development SR-71 Blackbird Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water Glossary of wildland fire terms
