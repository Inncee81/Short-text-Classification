hanging x mirrors i just bought twelve x mirrors for a little diy project really because i'm bored i am planning on hanging them on my wall in a x grid with about inches of space between each i think it should look pretty neat when all done my question is how to hang them i bought enough mounting clips to use per piece one top one bottom is this going to be enough the pieces of mirror are pretty light and right now i have a much bigger mirror hung with only clips so i am thinking should be fine any other advice before i start in about minutes depends on how permenant these are supposed to be i worry about you using two clips it only can provide stability in one axis and not two as clips would do if the wall is drywall then use a full set of clips if it is plaster then i would use or small spots of black mastic to mount the mirrors do not use the mastic on drywall unless you are never planning to take them off it will tear the drywall the plaster can be cleaned with a putty knife instead and repainted without much hassle make sure to pencil in your grid lightly ahead of time builder Graduate school Education in Romania Education in Germany Massachusetts Institute of Technology Shaggy dog story GED A Course In Miracles Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Education in the United States Cleveland Browns Richard Feynman Far Eastern University Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Negima The Inside One Tree Hill (TV series) Martial art The Catcher in the Rye Blood on the Tracks The Star Wars Holiday Special Great Teacher Onizuka Franklin W.
