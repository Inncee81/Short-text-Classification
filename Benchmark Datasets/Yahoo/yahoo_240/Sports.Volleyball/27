are black or white knee pads better i just bought black kneepads and i was wondering what the difference between them was black ones are a different color than white ones other than that there are a couple differences the black ones will get just as dirty as white onces but they won't look as dirty if you are out playing in the sun the black ones will absorb more sunlight and therefore be warmer than white ones i would be happy with your choice to buy the black ones as i'm guessing whatever you're using them for will be indoors and so there won't be much sunlight and i'm also guessing that you'll be rubbing them on the floor so they won't look as dirty afterwards because the floor is dirty even if you sweep it and mop it Albedo Human skin color Sock Bulk vending Upholstery Pump It Up Wheel of Fortune Cloud Ultraviolet Melanin Solar power Sun Black Sunlight Volleyball Keeshond Horse Black body African American literature White (people) Solar cell CPU cache Phoebe Buffay's songs Badminton Flag of South Africa Cat Rayleigh scattering Lighting Eight ball Skin 1919 World Series Color Boards of Canada Dundas Square Aerial (dance move) Indoor soccer Light-emitting diode PRIDE Oakland Athletics Hamster Passive solar Dodge Charger Hair color Pet skunk Weather lore Piet Mondrian Black (people) Minesweeper (computer game) Infrared One-hit wonder Boston Bruins Floorball Mars Jennifer Lopez Water Carnivorous plant Christmas tree Sample chess game Houseplant Baltimore Ravens Ric Flair Enceladus (moon) Bong Japanese tea ceremony Electromagnetic spectroscopy Network File System Beachwear Comanche Chess variant Technicolor Richard Allen (reverend) Paleoclimatology Tango (dance) Black belt (martial arts) Global warming Sitting Sunflora The Amazing Race Humphrey Bogart Shotokan Black Panther Party Color theory Jam (TV series) Edith Head French Defence Chicago White Sox Table tennis Economics Eddie Guerrero Sun tanning Negro league baseball Weekly World News Satchel Paige Chess problem Stalemate Lithium Apollo 8 Solar panel Phosphorus
