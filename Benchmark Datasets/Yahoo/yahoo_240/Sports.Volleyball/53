my daughter has volley ball try outs does anyone have any advice for my daughter who is ten years old she is going for volley ball try outs in a few days and this will be her first time playing volley ball she has aced basketball and softball she loves sports but volley ball is something different for us and we were just wondering if anyone had any tips i'm suprised at that age anyone would consider making kids try out although it is possible they are just looking to place her where she fits best as a youth coach for children and under fo rthe past years and a high school coach for the past three there are a few big standouts for participants looking to play an outgoing confident attitude will show the coach you have what it takes even if you are currently lacking the proper skills a coach who understands the sport looks for personality types they feel they can coach so listening well to direction and not being afraid to ask questions if you don't understand is also important and in my experience when you put a lot of year olds on the court there can be quite a bit of just standing there so teach her not to be afraid of the ball if the location she is trying out is age appropriate they should be using a youth volleyball for ages and under which is lighter in weight and easier to pass and serve so she shouldn't be afraid of the ball knowing the fundamentals is always good but it could be a catch some coaches prefer to work with what we call a clean slate at that age in general the most important skill in volleyball is passing being able to control the ball on a serve receive or on defense you won't see as many plays at that age as you will in the upper levels but ball control is a considerable bonus at that age similiar to knowing how to dribble before basketball try outs arms out palms up one palm in the other thumbs touching this hand positioning will give you the best platform for your pass which should be off of the forearms about inches up from the wrists and more importantly than anything tell her to go out there and have a blast no need to be nervous just confidant in her ability ot have fun and keep an open mind and remember rules differ between beach volleyball and indoor volleyball as i am unsure of what area of the country in which you reside you can find most of the youth rules etc at www usav com or on the asep website good luck Baseball Basketball Softball Ultimate (sport) Table tennis Four square Badminton Beach volleyball Aerial (dance move) Social rule New York Giants American football Fast bowling Lacrosse Vegeta Water polo Squash (sport) Pete Sampras Sport Tag Norway national football team Diving Billiards Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Racquetball National Football League Lore Weight training Football (soccer) Swingout Tai Chi Chuan Umpire (cricket) Tenshinhan National Football League Rugby union positions Milton H.
