volley ball tryouts i'm a freshman and today was our orientation where you can sign up for clubs and stuff so i decided to go for the volley ball team from everyone else on the sheet i was the tallest i'm ' most were ' and and it turns out the tryouts are in days the only problem is i've never even played before except for messing around with friends so what can i do to try and get better also what are the rules and stuff for playing okay so if you've never played before the two skills that you need to focus on most are bumping and serving if you don't feel comfortable with either of those skills go to the about com volleyball section that site has a wide variety of drills and explanations of the basics of volleyball if you are the tallest you may also want to try a little bit of spiking spiking is hard to learn practice on your own but if you can practice the basic motion of spiking the ball you will already have an advantage okay so here are a few suggestions for drills activities to do in the next few days to help you prepare bump the ball to yourself over and pver again and see how many you can get in a row practice bumping against a brick wall or the side of a solid building practice bumping the ball to one spot you don't have to hit that spot every time but try and get it in the general direction of your target every time this will really help you to learn to control your passes this one is a little more tricky to explain okay toss the ball up as if you were going to bump the ball to yourself only this time bump it up a few feet in front of you try and get to the ball by moving your feet once you get to the ball you want to practice setting your feet and making a solid pass do this over and over each time bumping the ball a few feet in front of you so that you have to move to get to it this drill helps you learn to move your feet to get to the ball and helps you to learn to make a successful pass even if you have to move to get it as far as rules go here are the basics each side can only hit the ball three times before it goes over no player can ever touch the ball twice in a row after a team gets a point they get to serve the ball in hopes of getting another point they are allowed to keep serving until they mess up the serve or the other team scores a point when either of the teams gets a point and gets the ball to serve their players must rotate in a clockwise direction there are players on each side at a time in the front and three in the back for more details on the different positions in volleyball go to www wikipedia org and search volleyball sorry for how long this was i hope it was of some help Table tennis Badminton Softball Glossary of American football American football Laws of cricket Rugby union Water polo Snooker Squash (sport) Fast bowling Australian rules football Baseball Basketball Drill bit Fielding (cricket) Cricket Aerial (dance move) American handball Billiards Rugby league Football (soccer) Four square Dog agility Beer Pong Sandy Koufax Curling Canadian football Racquetball Rugby union positions Beach volleyball Eight ball Batting (cricket) Golf Poker jargon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Strap-on dildo Comparison of Canadian and American football GunBound Wrigley Field New York Giants Football (soccer) positions National Football League Glossary of partner dance terms Fischer Random Chess Tag Team Fortress Classic Skateboarding trick Pitcher Serve (tennis) Craps Seishun Academy Middle School History of Test cricket (to 1883) Professional wrestling throws Bike lane debate English cricket team Parachuting Carolina Panthers Tenshinhan Squash tennis Dominoes Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Contract bridge Real tennis Dodgeball Collision detection Archery Internal ballistics West Indian cricket team Tris Speaker Mixed martial arts Roller hockey Lindy Basic Mahjong Super Bowl XVII Sport rowing Textile manufacturing Scrum (rugby) Ron Weasley 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pete Sampras Car handling Ty Cobb Cleveland Browns Vehicular cycling Devil sticks History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Baseball statistics No ball
