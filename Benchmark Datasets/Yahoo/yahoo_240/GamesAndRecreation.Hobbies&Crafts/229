can you sew plastic canvas patterns on perforated canvas or is the perforated canvas only for cross stitching my sister in law is the self proclaimed plastic canvas queen she makes some cool stuff i've watched her for hours uh years my grandmother always did cross stitch and embroidery what she called embroidery used longer stitches as opposed to one square at a time with the cross stitch so based on my observations the plastic canvas patterns are exactly the same as doing embroidery only you use perforated canvas and embroidery thread instead of plastic and yarn have fun Textile manufacturing terminology Cross-stitch Embroidery Knitting Textile manufacturing Sewing Berlin wool work Cloth Carpet Crochet Yarn Bookbinding Lace-making Blackwork Embroidery Softball Arts and crafts Quilting Tatting Textile Tapestry Applique Wire Patchwork Tire Wassily Kandinsky Kilt Linen Bayeux Tapestry Shaggy dog story Weaving Elizabethan era Suture X-ray Flag of India Jacques-Louis David Cruising (maritime) Football (ball) Kayak Super 8 mm film Art needlework Long-term potentiation Paper size N__ Shu Kimono Austrian Crown Jewels Clothing Filet lace Box Cricket ball Mattress Kirby: Canvas Curse Canoe Casting Lilo & Stitch: The Series Lilo & Stitch Knitting needle Sundial Sari Tank Printed circuit board May Morris Jute Freehand lace Knife Cilaos Baseball (object) Quilt Electrophysiology Shabbat Welding Aviation history Cricket J.
