crocheting scarf help i can crochet the first two rows but when i finish the second i dont know how to start the third it aways ends up back wards that is the nature of crochet when you start the third row you must turn the potential scarf over and start back essentially each row is the reverse of the previous one however if you are making something like a cap or a flat rug you keep going until you reach the size you want without turning it over and changing directions i could show you easier than explaining it but i hope it helps you good luck Textile manufacturing Knitting Crochet Textile Swingout Pittsburgh Steelers Textile manufacturing terminology Atomic Kitten The Wall Cleveland Browns The Curse of Fenric New York Giants Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Peter Shilton Dai shogi Mario Lemieux Carolina Panthers Pink Floyd Knitting needle Indianapolis 500 Aerial (dance move) New Zealand cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Jennifer Lopez New York Knicks Poker jargon Chu shogi 1957 World Series Winning Streak Skateboarding trick Betting (poker) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fast bowling Wheel of Fortune Knot Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Newcastle United F.C.
