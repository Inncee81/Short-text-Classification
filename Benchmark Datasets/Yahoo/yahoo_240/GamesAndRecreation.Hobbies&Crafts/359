how do i lower the waistline on my skirt i have a couple of skirts that go up above my bellybutton and i want to lower the waistline how do i do this and what do i do with the zipper it is difficult to lower a waist on a skirt mostly because there isn't enough fabric to make the new waist band you could try getting some fabric that matches fairly closely you would need to take the zipper out cut off what you don't want of the waist band make an inverted like self lined waist band that would sit under the skirt and ride on your hips as it were then you would put the zipper back in at the lower measurement if you don't know how to make a skirt then you will probably find it difficult to make this alteration it isn't a lot of fun to make these skirts from scratch i've finally made enough that it is getting easier but to take it apart and do it over isn't fun at all depending on how much you paid for them you might want to pay to have a tailor remake them for you that is what i do and all three skirts could be done in one day Kimono Trousers Tightlacing Undergarment Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) High-heeled shoe Kilt Zipper Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling holds Coat (clothing) Corset Shirt Textile manufacturing Suplex Suit (clothes) Crinoline Contredanse History of corsets Professional wrestling throws Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Batting (cricket) Clothing Game programmer Paragliding Hourglass corset Upholstery Powerbomb Hakama Marching band Diving suit Social rule Kimi Finster Japanese toilet Chair Fast bowling Brassiere Pantyhose Casting Mattress Skateboarding trick Time Out of Mind Boxing Bondage (BDSM) Volleyball Shorts Music genre Kayak Christmas tree G-string Urination Quake III Arena Glossary of American football Social aspects of clothing Stocking VFO Amusement ride The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Craps Illegal drug trade Overall Divorce Pitaten Recumbent bicycle Swingout Anchor Tank Piledriver (professional wrestling) Figure skating Bicycle Parachute Badminton Hip hop culture Theory of conduct Culture of the United States Snowboard Han Chinese clothing Textile manufacturing terminology Philosophical skepticism Mach kernel Kitesurfing Wind turbine CPU design Solar cell Sampling (music) Blood (computer game) Plame affair Doublet (clothing) Great Teacher Onizuka The Apprentice 2 Roger Ebert's most hated films Sarong Ski Speedo (suit style) Snooker Victorian fashion
