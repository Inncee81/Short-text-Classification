in california are gas powered remote control cars legal on the streets i heard gas powered remote control cars cannot be played on the streets is that true i have a neighbor who lets his son play his remote control car on the street of our house it is soooo loud it sounds louder than a lawn mower someone has told me that it is illegal to play on the street i can't find that on the web can anyone help in the uk motorized rc vehicles battery are allowed to be used with caution and not on the road but nitro fueled rc vehicles can be used without a permit but only on private grounds property and with owner of the land permission which is fair enough because some nitro fuelled rc vehicles go extremely fast and would cause a nasty injury if it hit somebodys foot leg on the main street if that helps at all ps and of course there is the high level of noise pollution to be taken into consideration too so all in all and i have never been to sunny california in my life i will stick my neck out and say no you cannot use a gas nitro rc vehicle on pavements and streets purely because it makes sense not to Motorcycle Radio controlled car Internal combustion engine Traffic light Toyota Prius Hybrid vehicle Noise pollution Street E85 Battery electric vehicle Fuel injection Explosive material Diesel engine Environmental Protection Agency Automobile Locomotive Freeway Energy development Drag racing Fuel cell Natural gas Hydrogen vehicle Lawn mower Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Transportation of Los Angeles Gasoline Airbag Sport utility vehicle Speed limit Headlight Battery (electricity) Solar power Future energy development Renewable energy Filling station Tennis Road-rule enforcement camera Automobile emissions control Easement Emission standard Bus rapid transit Auto racing Bicycle lighting Manual transmission Turbocharger Urban sprawl Radio Firefighter Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Road pricing Road traffic accident Transport Auto-free zone Vehicle registration plate Steam engine Alternative fuel RFID Light rail Carburetor Transmission (mechanics) Milpitas, California Manitoba Hydro High-occupancy vehicle Zero-emissions vehicle Suppressor Ownership Rules of the road Insurance Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Continuously variable transmission Leasing Honda Electric vehicle Land mine Autonomous building Taxicab Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wildfire Remote control Automatic number plate recognition Air pollution Thermal power station Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Pavement (material) Gas turbine Moose Hybrid Synergy Drive Road safety Westheimer Street Festival Airsoft Ice hockey Fuel efficiency Chevrolet Corvair London Congestion Charge Highway Crash test dummy
