what can i do with leftover craft mirrors i have lots of round and square pre cut mirrors ranging in size from about across to about across they were part of a project that i completed these are all leftover and i don't want to throw them away but i don't know what to do with them either does anybody have any ideas of what i can do with them thanks ooh fun here are some ideas off the top of my head if i think of anything really awesome after i post this i'll edit and add it my first obvious idea was a disco ball maybe hot glue them to one of those styrofoam balls or to be a little unusual do a styrofoam cone or even carve a shape from a bigger piece of styrofoam maybe your first initial that styrofoam stuff is easy to find at michaels hobby lobby ac moore etc hot glue them around the top and bottom edges of a lampshade or make a design on the shade or lamp itself you can get basic inexpensive lamps from target or walmart same thing with a picture frame your desktop monitor or a mug to hold pencils in you can buy some grout to put between the tiles to reduce sharp edges if you want speaking of grout you could buy a mosaic stepping stone kit and use them on that are the edges sharp well either way you could take some fishing line and hot glue them every couple inches make several lengths like that and hang them on your wall or in front of your window take a cheap plastic clock from walmart or wherever like bucks and glue them to the outside of the casing like the frame of the clock just outside the hour numbers i got one of those clocks and discovered that i could take it apart and carefully take the hands off and take the face off it was just a sheet of plastic i traced it onto a sheet of white paper and cut the paper out and put pretty stickers in the place of the numbers and put it back on the clock and reassembled it it looked way nicer than the i'd spent this is a crazy idea but if you have a big frameless mirror like a full length mirror or whatever you could hot glue them around the edges to make a crazy mirror frame for the mirror have fun Drill bit Textile manufacturing Plastic Floppy disk Polystyrene Pottery Glass Knife Radio controlled airplane Screw Ship model Internal ballistics Drawing Bookbinding Violin RuneScape quests Amateur telescope making Boat building Sundial Brewery Strap-on dildo Bicycle frame Rigging Redundant array of independent disks Terminal ballistics Cello Paper size Casting Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Regular polytope Rod Stewart Scale model Dice Stairway Billboard Hot 100 Beehive (beekeeping) Hamster Wood carving Shotgun Bicycle Fast bowling Hubble Space Telescope Volleyball Loudspeaker Skateboarding trick Timpani Handloading Timber framing Blood (computer game) Laser engraving Glossary of partner dance terms Euclidean plane isometry Table tennis Sega Saturn Billiards Wal-Mart Laptop Fire fighting Headlight Tag Manifold Professional wrestling throws Atari 8-bit family View camera Equine conformation Gramophone record Table saw Mercury Cougar Spark plug Professional wrestling match types Door Surrealist techniques Oscilloscope Hardware random number generator IBM PC compatible Clarinet Minesweeper (computer game) Dominoes Parachute Tile Glossary of American football Diamond cut Seismometer IMac Slide rule Swingout Dinghy Dodge Charger Solar cell
