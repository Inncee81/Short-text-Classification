my yr old says he really wants to start collecting and playing warhammer k i'd like to get some info please he knows which armies he'd like but what's a good size army for a complete beginner and do you recommend any particular brand of creature what is the usual cost of this size of army as a mum should i be aware of anything unsuitable scary etc for him is a good age to play this game he has played with older friends at their houses anything else you think would be useful for a beginner to know you can start playing the game with nothing more than a single squad of soldiers which is usually models and costs between and i usually recommend that all beginners do this and even moreso for the younger beginners because it gives you a chance to get to grips with basic painting and modelling techniques and to learn the basic elements of the rules a typical club level army is points all models have a points value depending on how effective they are so two point armies will be roughly equal in capability even if one is numerically superior to the other a point army varies in cost depending on the choice of army and whether you buy new models or acquire old models second hand on ebay is a conservative estimate and it wouldn't be unusual for an army to cost twice this however i know that you could get an army for half this if you were prepared to buy someone else's badly painted old models from ebay well i was when i first started playing i'm now so you can see how addictive it can be the parent company games workshop is well aware of the concerns of parents and carers and takes this into account in most of its publications i never had nightmares from reading the rulebooks myself and my first army was composed entirely of skeletons that said the imagery can be pretty graphic including illustrations of self harm codex witch hunters especially torture mutilation violence and stuff that is known to afficionados as gribbliness that isn't to say don't buy it quite the opposite i'm a full time writer artist with two young sons of my own and i whole heartedly believe that despite this imagery that can shock casual browsers at first glance the hobby is an immensely beneficial one if you'll forgive me i'm going to copy and paste an answer i gave on mumsnet the parenting forum in answer to a similar question most warlike games and in this i include action man gi joe and toy weapons of all sorts involve one good side usually represented by invincible hero characters thwarting one bad side usually represented by powerful but stupid evil characters no one really gets hurt and or injured and it's home in time for tea and medals tabletop wargames stand as a stark contrast to this now the following points apply broadly to all such wargames historical and otherwise but i'll mainly apply the points in detail to the warhammer stable of games warhammer and its sister game warhammer both have a strong context that is a back story that makes the battles fought make sense in both cases the context is a world or a whole galaxy for wh k torn apart by almost constant warfare these worlds are portrayed as bitter terrible places to live where every day is uncertain plagues and monstrosities stalk that land and even death is no end to the constant battle yes this holds a certain grotesque fascination for young boys but no one in their right mind would want to live there in fact it provides an instant and salient lesson of a world where war and conflict is allowed to become the principle political tool of government secondly the battles themselves teach the players that no amount of magic armour or clever tactics can save you from the whims of chance it doesn't matter how many hours you spent painting your general or how beautiful that regiment looks on the tabletop if the dice go against you you're dead meat war it reminds us might be an adventure but it's an adventure that some people don't come back from to expand a little on the wargaming community yes if your only exposure to it is through reluctant forays into games workshop it can seem to be dominated by pony tailed beardies with an unhealthy lara croft heavy metal fixation just remember that there are many more players who aren't in gw because they have jobs to go to a much better idea of the social cross section can be found by going to a wargaming club night there is a national parent organization for wargaming clubs in the uk the gaming club network that sets a code of conduct and sponsors crb checks for club supervisors visit any of these clubs and you will find yes the pony tailed geeks but you will also find doctors lawyers postmen security guards students bank managers accountants dentists psychiatrists computer programmers and film stars will smith and robin williams are both big fans of warhammer and you'll also find children and you'll also find an environment where those children can compete with men three or four times their age as equals yes it is mostly men as i'm sure most of you are more than aware there just doesn't seem to be the same appeal to most women although the proportion of gamers who are women is increasing year on year and some of the world's best miniature painters are women do a google search for victoria lamb for evidence i could go on about what i believe are the positive benefits of wargaming but i'd be here all day suffice to say that examples include craft skills negotiation probability theory diplomacy strategy and a surprising amount of advanced physics while i'm here i'll also speak up in defence of the games workshop staff they are practically unique in that they work for not much more than minimum wage because they passionately love what the company does yes they are all crb checked it's a mandatory pre requirement to work at the shop they will try very hard to answer your questions but they are also working hard to prevent the little s dropped off by parents who think gw is a free creche from nicking the stock and they get a little testy after the twentieth person that day comes in looking for a copy of world of warcraft take note gw does not sell computer games no not even the ones based on their own intellectual property minimum wage part timers remember if you want to speak to someone who has a bit of decent customer service training ask if the manager of deputy manager is available alternatively you can phone their mail order line or visit their online store gw has one of the highest standards of mail order customer service in the world City of Heroes
