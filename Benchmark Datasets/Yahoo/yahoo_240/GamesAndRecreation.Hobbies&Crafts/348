can you cook fimo twice i am making a hill with people on top and i want to know if i can cook the hill put the people on top and then cook the whole thing but i don't want to try because it can sometimes ruin it the answer to this depends a lot on several factors but bascially if you can make sure the temperature never goes above the temperature you're supposed to be using theoretically polymer clay can be baked for a very long time and baked repeatedly it can be hard to make sure that temp never rises though and certain brands of clay will darken more easily if baked longer than necessary like sculpey premo kato fimoclassic and even fimosoft would darken less and be stronger after baking too there are ways to protect the items you're baking though so that probably wouldn't be a problem as long as you buy and use a cheapie oven thermometer at grocery store as well many ovens don't actually heat to the exact temp shown on their dials or the temp can spike even after preheating also you don't mention the thickness of the items you'd be baking you shouldn't bake polymer clay itesm that are thicker than anywhere because they can crack you'd need to use an armature underneath like scrunched aluminum foil or a form like a bowl or something else underneath that could be removed after baking if you needed more than that thickness you can find loads of info on all these baking things on this page as well as strategies for avoiding darkening or scorching the clay etc http glassattic com polymer baking htm btw you can bake the items together or you can make them separately then join them after baking or you can make the people and bake them to harden then impress them into the raw clay hill and bake the hill then join them back etc how you'd connect the pieces would depend a lot on their sizes and how they'd fit together though if they were all baked you could join them with a part epoxy glue or even e if one were raw and the other baked you might want to use liquid clay instead then bake them together possibly also joining them with a wire or toothpick between for added strength check out this page for more on glues that can be used with raw and or baked polymer clays http glassattic com polymer glues diluent htm and look on this page for almost any other topic you'd like to read up on about polymer clay http glassattic com polymer contents htm hth and good luck diane b Casting Welding Plastic Pottery Bread Cookware and bakeware Epoxy Pizza Aluminium Paint Brewery Coffee Explosive material Transformer Solar cell Bicycle frame Glass Knife Dairy Floppy disk Fiberglass HyperText Transfer Protocol Baking Domain Name System Printed circuit board Wok XML Pancake Thermal power station Mattress Seismic retrofit Motor oil Steel Gas metal arc welding Temperature Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Upholstery Theory of conduct Katana Barbecue Tofu Hash table Tire Paragliding Slow cooker CPU cache Opportunity rover Poker jargon Carbon dioxide Manifold Nuclear power Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fire fighting Polystyrene Horseshoe Equine conformation Violin IPod Carbon nanotube Polymer Strap-on dildo Ice cream Portland cement Handloading Drill bit Bacon Bong Adhesive Brazing Kosher foods Tissue engineering Glacier Photolithography Roswell UFO incident Magnetism Diving suit Legal research Geology of the Moon RuneScape skills Professional wrestling match types Alcoholic beverage Egg (food) Textile manufacturing Liquid crystal Cuisine of Denmark Motility Mokume-gane Sling (weapon) Shoe Cocaine Polyethylene terephthalate
