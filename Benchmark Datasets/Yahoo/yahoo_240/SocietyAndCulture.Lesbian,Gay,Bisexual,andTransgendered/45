why are atheists so belligerent about their beliefs i just saw a woman with the american atheists complaining about having a moment of silence in school why is it her business whether or not someone is praying to themselves and who is she to take that moment away from anyone oops sorry about the category what does a moment of silence have anything to do with religion at all you can reflect on whatever you choose i agree with joe fox about the section i wouldn't have come across this question if you hadn't posted it to the people talking about the exclusion of certain kids since when were laws made with condsideration about ppls emotions if this was the case i imagine that the commercial industry might have been regulated for presenting ideals that give us teenagers negative self images anyway a moment of silence should by no means be considered an explicitly religious activity just because you are given the option to pray does not mean that anyone else has to how is it at all possible that a person praying in a public institution infringes on another person's rights giving someone this option in fact is respecting their freedom giving them the chance to think reflect pray stand and stare around whatever you want are we to eliminate respect of others views wait the ppl that do have views i think that exactly what you're pointing out is the question that if atheists have nothing to live for believe in what are they protecting themselves from if you really do believe in nothing then go about your life as if there is no danger in the world to protect yourself from just live and die 'fake' stuff can't hurt you let the church not dictate our laws but atheistic obsession should not attack belief either otherwise the religion of nonbelief is created ironic Separation of church and state Status of religious freedom in France Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Religious conversion Same-sex marriage in Canada Atheism Theory of conduct Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Religion Theodicy Religious Society of Friends Objectivist philosophy Marriage Freedom of speech Ten Commandments Separation of church and state in the United States Constitution of Ireland Unitarian Universalism Alcoholics Anonymous The nature of God in Western theology Roe v.
