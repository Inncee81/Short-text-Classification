can guys have a child i'm wondering if i remove the nucleus of egg cells then let the sperm from one male fertilize one egg cell then the sperm of the other male fertilize the other egg cell then we fuse the eggs wouldn't it be possible to produce an offspring i understand that the risk off yy chromosome will occur if the sperms are selected by chance please explain why this producing an offspring from males isn't possible i have read that it is possible that eggs from women can be fused by an electrical impulse resulting a daughter child i am wondering why can't we remove the nucleus of the eggs then replace it with the genetic material from the sperm then we electricute the eggs so that the eggs would fuse what you are suggesting sounds like it could produce a chimera of sorts or fraternal twins well it seems to me that what you'd do would be to first take an egg cell then you find a female sperm cell you'd replace the nuclear dna of the egg with the x sperm's dna now a problem this could pose would be nuclear mitochondrial incompatibility so you'd probably have to replace the mitochondrial dna as well in the egg cell it is out in the cytoplasm in the sperm cell i believe that is out in the tail somewhere then you can take a sperm cell of the other partner and use it to fertilize the reconstructed egg if nothing happens it may require some sort of electrical stimulation to get the cells to divide then what you do is implant the embryo or zygote into a surrogate mother In vitro fertilisation Meiosis Chimera (genetics) DNA Spermatozoon Human cloning Cloning Sexual reproduction Ovum Infertility Mitosis Cell (biology) Mitochondrial genetics Mitochondrial DNA Parthenogenesis Fertilisation Stem cell X chromosome Reproduction Intersexuality Mitochondrion Alternation of generations DNA repair Pregnancy Apoptosis Morphogenesis Multiple birth Cell nucleus Birth control Biology and sexual orientation Prostate cancer Ploidy Abortion debate Chlorophyta Cell growth Drosophila melanogaster Species Cephalic disorder Puberty Flowering plant Cancer Platypus Sexual differentiation Patau syndrome Huntington's disease Menstrual cycle Ovary Francis Crick Eukaryote Sexual intercourse Cellular differentiation Senescence Emergency contraception Transformation (genetics) Jurassic Park Edward's syndrome Color blindness Genome Miscarriage Sex Xenomorph Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Non-coding RNA Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen Chromosome Animal Mutation Human genome Ovulation Human Y chromosome Motility Intersex surgery Plant breeding Spider Orgasm Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Male reproductive system (human) Genetic disorder Homosexuality and medical science Bird Genetically modified organism Obstetrics Nuclear fusion Parkinson's disease Genetics Fetal development Biological life cycle
