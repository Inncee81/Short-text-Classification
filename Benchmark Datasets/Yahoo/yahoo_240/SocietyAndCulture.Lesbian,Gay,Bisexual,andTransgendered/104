how why would the glbt be so forgiving i see some of these horrid questions i'd like to take a baseball bat to these bigots granted i'm not a forgiving person i'm not gay but i can't forgive their hate how can you humans are prone to all emotions and many live only by them forgetting that they have a brain to override basic animal instincts true sometimes i would love to weild that bat i don't consider myself above anyone but i try to claim some enlightenment to the base human element and that is love from love comes kindness and forgiveness and words are just words if someone tried to attack me physically i would defend myself and if someone physically hurt someone i love that bat would be in my hand among other weapons and it would take alot of force to stay my hand the tongue may gouge the psyche but the strong soul knows better that words are just words yes it is a battle everyday for some that which does not kill you makes you stronger just a thought Soul Love Human EastEnders Sin Emotion Dualism (philosophy of mind) John Berryman A Course In Miracles Consciousness John Howard Yoder Human nature Meaning of life Summa Theologiae Psychology Dog Infant baptism Jewish principles of faith Hulk (comics) Roman Catholic Church Jon Secada Free will Mahou Sentai Magiranger Baseball Vegeta Forgiveness Lataif-e-sitta Abortion debate Rave Master Simone Weil Unconscious mind Martial art Samurai Deeper Kyo Immortality Theory of conduct Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Ranma __ characters Franz Boas Numerology Trinity Mnemonic David Hume Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Structuralism Age of Enlightenment LGBT Salvation Chakra Reincarnation Anger management Theodicy Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Gay Stoicism Novel Angel (vampire) Sufism Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist FLCL Religion InuYasha (character) Goldstein's book American Psycho Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Heterosexuality The Death Gate Cycle StarCraft Episode VI Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Narcissism Sesshomaru Beast Wars Gorgias Homosexuality and Judaism The Amber Spyglass YuYu Hakusho Lightsaber combat Urantia Happiness Homophobia Determinism Altruism Blood II: The Chosen Freedom of speech Slander and libel Motivation Christianity BloodRayne Meat Loaf Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Aikido Klingon Marvin Gaye Alignment (role-playing games) Borderline personality disorder Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Wolfrider
