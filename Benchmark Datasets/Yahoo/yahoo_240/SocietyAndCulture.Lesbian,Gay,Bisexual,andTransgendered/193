i am bi but my friend is not i am bi and my best friend that i really like is not and i really want to be with her but i am pretty sure that if i tell her i have feelings for her she will think that i am weird and she would not want to be friends anymore what should i do if you're not out to her yet coming out would be the first step and would open up discussion in general if you are out to her there are other fish in the sea so just be happy to have her as a best friend rather than a gf that you might have a messy breakup with Avenue Q King Crimson Elijah Wood Cliff Richard Kodocha Kim Possible H2G2 Hip hop culture Theory of conduct Timeline of alternative rock Shaggy dog story Futari wa Pretty Cure Nine Inch Nails First Macedonian War Cats (musical) Blood on the Tracks Pure Pwnage Funeral Harem anime God Emperor of Dune Family (Buffy episode) R.E.M.
