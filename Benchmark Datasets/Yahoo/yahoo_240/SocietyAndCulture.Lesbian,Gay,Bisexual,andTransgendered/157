does this make me bi i always have only ever liked guys and have never thought of being attracted to a female but i realised that i kinda have a crush on one girl and i dont think id wanna go out with her and thinking of anything sexually with her doesnt turn me on or anything i only like her cos shes really pretty and im physically attracted to her ive never felt this way before for a girl and its not the same as liking a guy i dont like her as much as i do for guys i can imagine kissing her and stuff but id never do anything sexual maybe its just a phase i dont know but does this make me bi or curious or not i would say you might possibly be curious but since the idea of anything sexual or a relationship doesn't appeal to you then you're probably not bisexual it's natural for women to notice other women that they think are physically attractive that doesn't make you bisexual or gay it's just the way we are some women even have the desire to kiss another woman even though it would never go any further than that i'd say it's all admiration and curiousity good luck finding yourself Sexual orientation Friends Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Bisexuality Lesbian Gender role Heterosexuality Transgender Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Homophobia Reparative therapy Gay slang Zoophilia Pedophilia Infantilism The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sexual attraction Phoebe Buffay's songs Britney Spears Bi-curious Sexuality in Christian demonology Eric Cartman Homosexuality Dead Like Me Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Swinging Physical attractiveness Avenue Q Kurt Cobain Yuri (animation) Revolutionary Girl Utena Stewie Griffin Coming out Pederasty Ginny Weasley Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Biology and sexual orientation Love Human sexuality Cybersex History of sex Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Harem anime Transsexuality Hentai Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Cliff Richard Domestic violence Something Positive The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Asexuality Homosexuality and transgender Anal sex Sexual abstinence Transwoman Ron Weasley Sex and the City Sexual revolution Undergrads Characters from Arrested Development Sex-positive feminism Kodocha The Smoking Room Christina Aguilera Herbert Garrison Miss Saigon Narcissism Maison Ikkoku Ultra Maniac Kylie Minogue Oh My Goddess!
