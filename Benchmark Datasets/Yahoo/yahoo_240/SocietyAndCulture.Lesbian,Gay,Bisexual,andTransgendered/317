is it possible that a man is hetrosexual till the age of and thereafter become a homosexual i don't think so i can't say for sure because everyone is different but i believe that if you are homosexual you are most likely going to be one from birth however you might be bisexual that is a possibility and maybe since you're you've reached the point where you are comfortable enough to consider that other side of your nature or it could also be that you've dated or been married for a while to women and decided that those weren't working for you to the point that you want to fully embrace the other part of you and see where it leads you it could be many things but i think most people are who they are period some just don't realize that there are other sides to themselves until later in life hope this helps you good luck Bisexuality Sexual orientation Gay Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Infantilism Vernon Schillinger Friends Heteronormativity Homophobia Marriage Transsexuality Transgender William Shakespeare Summa Theologiae Clerical celibacy Don't ask, don't tell Age of consent Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and transgender Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Generation X LGBT Theory of conduct Gay rights Coming out Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality Heterosexuality History of sex Aesthetic Realism Biology and sexual orientation Mystique (comics) Transvestism Gay slang Religion and sexuality Humphrey Bogart Homosexuality and Islam Reparative therapy Metropolitan Community Church Homosexuality and Neopaganism Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Incarnations of Immortality Homosexuality and Christianity Scenes from a Memory Religion and sexual orientation Blonde on Blonde Phoebe Buffay's songs Laura Schlessinger Homosexuality and Scientology Alfred Kinsey Stewie Griffin Autogynephilia Singapore gay equality movement Cole Porter Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Religious Society of Friends Homosexuality in China Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Queer Anal sex John Holmes (actor) Barbra Streisand Nicomachean Ethics Holy Orders Fable (video game) Social rule Sex-positive feminism Kate Vaiden Boston Public Bill Maher Group sex Homosexuality and medical science 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sharon Tate Escape from New York Charly Garc__a Aphrodite Fecal incontinence Bi-curious The Critic Culture of Lithuania Arthur Schopenhauer Lawrence v.
