the worst possible thing the one thing i thought would never happen to me has happened my boyfriend cheated on me he slept with someone else when i was at work he said he was totally wasted when it happened he told me days after it happened and i totally freaked he's really sorry and i belive him when he says he still loves me and i forgive him and everything but i feel like i never want him to touch me again things were going so great with us and he totally f cked it up i really want us to be okay but i can't totally shake off what he's done does anyone have suggestions on how i can just move on and not think about whats happened because i just want to forget about it i can't even sleep in the same bed with him i keep picturing him with someone else i can't just dump him its like we've overcome so much we came out together and confronted out parents together and i love him and i can't see my myself with anyone one else i just want to forget first realize that it will be ok the most important thing right now is to communicate and talk about what happened and why no matter how difficult it is him being wasted is no excuse i believe there has to be another reason examine what happened and then determine if you both still love each other and want to work it out if you do then you both have to make it happen he has to earn your trust again and you have to let him earn it good luck EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Friends Social rule Avenue Q Milton H.
