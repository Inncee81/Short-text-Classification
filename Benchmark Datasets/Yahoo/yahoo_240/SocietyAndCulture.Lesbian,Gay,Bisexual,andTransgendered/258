are you ever propositioned by straight married guys probably a dozen times in my life i have been propositioned by straight married guys after they find out i am gay it is usually under the guise that they are curious never tried it with a man wonder what it would feel like they are horny and not getting any at home or they have had too much to drink have you had similar experiences do you believe this is the reason there is so much homophobia today these guys are afraid we are going to share their dirty little secrets we know the statistics that the majority of people arrested for lewd behavior are married guys those in parks public bathrooms etc your thoughts i've been hit on a number of times at the gym usually in the locker or shower rooms overt looks and a smile or the sauna everything from looks to touching themself and gesturing me to come closer when i don't look away in disgust at least half the time the guy is wearing a wedding ring though it's not something i'm into i generally take it as a compliment and just smile back i feel badly for obviously not entirely straight guys that get pressured into marriage as long as it doesn't translate into homophobic speech and actions even as i recognize that this type of cruising is part of what gives the gay community a bad name it's certainly ironic that gay guys that do as the religious right would have them do try to be something they're not at the expense of their loved ones are used as tools by the same folks to condemn us all Homophobia Human sexual behavior Gay bathhouse Friends Sexual orientation Ex-gay Social rule Sauna Avenue Q Gay Gay rights Marriage Homosexuality Sento One Tree Hill (TV series) Bisexuality Religion and sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart Futurama (TV series - season 2) Ten Commandments Outing Poker jargon Toilet Eric Cartman Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Shaggy dog story Homosexuality in China Ron Weasley Gay slang Yoko Ono Homosexuality and Islam Swimming pool Customs and etiquette of Japan Homosexuality and Judaism Marilyn Monroe Trailer Park Boys Homosexuality and Scientology Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Little Britain Recurring South Park characters Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Same-sex marriage Divorce Queer About Schmidt Changeroom Nicomachean Ethics Domestic violence Gay rights timeline Infantilism Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
