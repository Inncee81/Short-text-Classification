what's the difference if homosexuals are granted all the rights privileges and benefits granted to a married heterosexual couple and are granted all the rights afforded to a heterosexual couple on a state level but it would be considered a civil union rather than a marriage what is unequal about this i understand and support equality for all people and am genuinely curious as to what kind of responses this question might bring i fully support gay unions whether they end up being called civil unions or marriage doesn't matter to me either way i suppose one might look at it as asking is a ham and cheese sandwich different than a cheese and ham sandwich it's a different name but if the benefits and privileges and rights are the same what's the problem my wife and i have talked about this she's claiming that nothing less than the word marriage will do i personally don't see what the difference is as long as the benefits privileges and rights are there i forgot to include the word federal in my description if benefits were equal at both the federal and state level would there be a difference sorry for the confusion if straight couples can marry then gay couples should have the same right in terms of legal government sanctioned unions however maybe it woudl be better for government to get out of marriage altogether why not have government civil unions and church marriages that would clarify the separation between church and state as it should be note that in doing so churches woudl be free to marry gay or straight couples while the government would be compelled to register the unions of all thus freedom of religion is preserved as well as equality in th eeyes of the law for all Same-sex marriage in Canada Marriage Federal Marriage Amendment Civil rights Separation of church and state Sexual orientation Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Lawrence v.
