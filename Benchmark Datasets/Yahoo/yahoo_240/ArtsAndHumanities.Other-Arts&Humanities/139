is there a way to preserve a tooth that was extracted by a dentist a couple of years ago my dentist pulled out one of my canine teeth i saved it though and was thinking of having it encapsulated in a clear but durable plastic material and then make a pendant for a necklace you see if shark teeth and other light objects can be made into pendants what more for one's own but then i don't know where in the valley los angeles i could go to for such a purpose my friends really balked at this weird idea of mine or so they said any ideas i've heard of mothers saving their children's baby teeth and creating necklaces with kids i'd have quite a collection can't imagine wearing one of your own teeth would be weirder than that i would think a dremel drill or other tiny drill bit would make a hole to string it or go to a craft shop and find a metal cap in jewelry making supplies to glue to the top of the tooth then wear it on a chain maybe you could recycle old braces and make one Drill bit Dental brace Tooth Money Screw Turquoise Guitar Shark Dental caries Dental fillings Dentistry Printed circuit board Woodworking Pearl Solar cell Casting Barque Netsuke Filigree Bong Crown (dentistry) Naval mine Clothing Polymer clay Wire Tyrannosaurus rex The Fairly OddParents Gramophone record Leather Chainmail Perl Orthodontics Disc brake Knife Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Seismic retrofit Drill Bruxism Sonic Adventure Hand grenade Toa Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories The Amber Spyglass Characters of Naruto Doug Upholstery Shen Gong Wu Borehole George Costanza John Lennon Ammolite Drizzt Do'Urden Troll Violin Ceramics San Jose, California Hitler's death Dog Rave party Lute Hip hop fashion Gold Piano The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Carburetor Mario Frank Zappa Petroleum Tetrapod Human evolution Happy Tree Friends Sundial Radio controlled airplane Iron Glass Canoe Waste management Rave Master Skateboard Motor oil The Dentist Dil Pickles Tooth enamel Neanderthal Ice core Land mine Black hole Conan the Barbarian Polystyrene Orichalcum Guinevere Jones Eric Cartman Singapore Police Force Sharon Tate
