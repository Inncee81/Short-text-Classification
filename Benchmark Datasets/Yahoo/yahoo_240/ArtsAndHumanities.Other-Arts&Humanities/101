write something creative irma ladeux she looked longingly at his picture as she grasped it between her slender fingers how long had it been in mandy's mind anything more than minutes was monotony my god she cursed to herself i feel so anxious and so warm better stop looking at chad's picture thoughts coursed wildly in her mind and created both excitement and apprehension in every part of her she nervously shoved his photograph back into the envelope there was no time left for thinking now mandy defiantly flicked long silken strands of hair from her cheeks causing her blonde tresses to blow like ribbons in the breeze furtive glances at her watch confirmed that time was indeed passing slowly almost two she sighed impatiently and forced her glance into the distance he should be arriving soon as mandy's thoughts echoed in the vastly empty expanse of her cerebral cortex she stood facing the endless avenue gazing idly at the vista of wheat fields in the distance the tall grasses danced sensually responding to the light breeze with little effort this lazy scene only increased mandy's tensions in moments she expected chad's car to stop in front of her and she would once again embrace him thwack came the resounding thud as the book fell to the floor mrs irma johnston shifted her position on the uncomfortable seat as the bus rounded a corner too sharply this particular september day was so hot and so steamy sweaty people crammed in the aisles struggled to prevent spilling on top of each other with her stop now in sight she silently sighed to herself and reached onto the floor to grab the novel shoving it into her large canvas bag that's enough of that for one day she decided firmly to herself i've really got to stop buying these cheap romance novels not proper for a woman my age to daydream and with that the bus came to a grinding halt the elderly lady trudged laboriously to the door and exited unnoticed it's never too late to daydream the woman reflected as she plodded on irma finally arrived home slightly puffed out by the cumbersome shoes and the long walk in a warm autumn sun surprisingly she unlocked the front door effortlessly and spryly walked inside sunbeams danced gaily on the walls of the hallway illuminating the mirror in the entryway reflected there was a disheveled older woman with shaggy gray hair and matronly clothes with a pronounced gesture irma threw her dark coat aside and removed the heavy shoes from underneath the now cast off facade she blithely wiggled her slim legs and pranced jauntily into the kitchen a profusion of light hit her full force and displayed her truly ravishing features well irma she said wryly to no one at all i have most certainly come a long way so glad to rid myself of that ridiculous disguise she tossed the matronly clothes casually to the floor revealing a comely outfit of black silk her slim figure and long honey colored hair escaped effortlessly from the captivity of the gray wig as she reveled in her welcome freedom undercover work was tedious kate was consummately attractive successful and undoubtedly in high demand but this was not surprising to anyone who knew her bright beautiful and bored she secretly knew that she was slowly turning into an asshole hmmph to that she mused mischievously and tossed her handbag onto the sofa with careless aplomb kate idly toyed with the canvas bag with playful curiosity what could mandy be up to now she wondered almost aloud she delved into the bag and retrieved the book mandy narrowed her eyes in the brilliant afternoon sun as she surveyed her surroundings chad should be here by now and soon they would be together once more she played with a stray wisp of hair as she mindlessly dipped into her bag for lip gloss applying it liberally she glanced at her reflection in a compact mirror and smiled seductively as she imagined their first moments together again and then later back in her apartment when they were truly alone she recreated this scene yet again as she had done a million times anxiously looking at her watch for the umpteenth time she sighed loudly at the words of that tiny inner voice ha late by nearly minutes she scrutinized the horizon her truly impatient nature took form in her defiant glances behind her she blinked rapidly at the familiar row of houses dotting the avenue and the comfort of her home territory quite a contrast to the open road ahead mandy's consternation was suddenly interrupted but not chad's blue camry instead it was a low sporty model the rag top was down from behind the steering wheel a very attractive man effortlessly maneuvered the vehicle the car came to a stop scant feet from the tip of mandy's gold high heels hey kid how are you long time no see he smiled gallantly his provocative eyes sweeping the entire length of her well proportioned form hop in let's go for a ride mandy knew that justin lusted after her but she had rebuffed him solidly ever since stupid chad had reappeared on the scene just a few short weeks ago for a moment she cast her eyes directly into his dreamy brown ones she very nearly wobbled on her heels but recovered quickly never once displaying any vulnerability one last perfunctory look past him to the empty road beyond confirmed mandy's thoughts no chad where the hell was he with her voluptuous lips instantly changing from a puckering pout into a devilish smile she finally spoke to justin meanwhile on the other side of the mountains chad was having yet another one of his misadventures in his never ending efforts to be on time clutching a now empty biggie sized quickie mart soda cup he clumsily fought his way out of the hissing car and turned his back on the steaming radiator what will mandy think of this he grimaced as he scaled the out of the ditch he tediously made his way towards a small creek he remembered seeing some miles back in the clean air of solitude he started to replay the events that had created his predicament how could this finely tuned well loved car suddenly betray him stranding him in the middle of nowhere his mind was thick and his head thumped loudly from last night's romp at the chalet why was justin so chummy what the hell was the name of that drink he bought me mandy peered through heavily mascara laden lashes and blinked in vacuous fashion at justin's disarming smile reaching for her lip gloss again she artfully applied yet more this time more liberally to her coquettishly poised lips all the while returning his flirtatious glances with a long heaving sigh chad in his unerring lateness was yet again fading fast from her limited memory in the heat of the moment mandy's words froze like the spider to the fly justin leaned over and opened the passenger door invitingly mandy now fully glossed hesitated for a scant second and then seated herself beside him as she was slowly and seductively enveloped within the leather interior the sensuous aroma of his new car combined with the relentless heat made her mind such as it was spin with muddled thoughts of anticipation wordlessly the pair drove off in a haze of dust kate read on with rapt interest oblivious
