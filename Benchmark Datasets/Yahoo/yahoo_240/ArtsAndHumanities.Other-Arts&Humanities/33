i write poetry and lyrics songs how do i get my work published and out there to be used purchased i love writing songs poems lyrics anything i believe myself to be very creative lyrically how do i go about breaking into that type of work publishing a book writing songs for artists things like that it's a tough world to work your way up through poetry is not likely to be very profitable for you even if you're very very good at it it's still a good thing to do and certainly is a wonderful means of self expression but its reward is more in the responses you get from those who read your work than it ever will be in cash song lyrics are another story there doesn't seem to be any particular way to get them out there effectively i think you just have to make it up record yourself singing it so folks can know what you intend it to sound like even if your singing isn't very good you don't have to sell your own voice in order to sell your lyrics add music to it if you're able i'd advertise it on a web site giving sample lyrics and offering more to those willing to enter into an agreement for them but you're not going to be able to demand that sort of thing right away it's the age old way of things one still must be discovered in this world in order to become successful at things such as these the more you get it out there the more people see it and the more people see it the more likely it is that one of them will like it enough to pay you for the right to use it for both their and your profit just be careful there are people who will try to take advantage of you and then there are people who will take advantage of you in that business you do have to learn to tolerate being used like that at least to a certain extent one need not be a total media whore of course but it's healthy to recognize early on that not everybody in the business is inspired by your work as much as they are by your income generating potential they will pretend to be impressed of course depending on how popular you are or how popular they think you might become but by and large most of them won't really be able to give a fig about you or your art they just want you to help pay their bills there aren't very many genuine people out there and that's a sad sad thing for serious and inspired talent good luck i hope some of this has been of at least a little use to you Folk music Time Out of Mind Leonard Cohen Kylie Minogue Mixtape Poetry Rod Stewart Gross domestic product Apple Computer C__line Dion Aesthetic Realism Sampling (music) Nine Inch Nails Literature Hip hop music Insurance Bee Gees The Smashing Pumpkins Cantopop Music genre Boards of Canada Roxette Neopets Social rule Airline Joni Mitchell Grunge music Theory of conduct I Want to Hold Your Hand The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Karaoke Pop music Love and Theft Bringing It All Back Home Poker jargon Spice Girls Anne Rice Sacred Harp The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Roy Orbison Another Side of Bob Dylan Quarashi Aladdin (1992 film) Trademark Wonderland (McFly album) W.
