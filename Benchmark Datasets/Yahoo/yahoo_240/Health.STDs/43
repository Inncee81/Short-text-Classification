testing for std's i know that for males chlamydia is tested with a q tip type thing that is inserted in theyre uretha somewhat painful if u ask me my question is that if theres other ways of gettin tested for that like a pee test or some sort so there is pee tests well i kinda figured there was because i have a g f who got tested for that and all she needed to do was pee so does that pee test is the same and the q tip test is there a difference is one more accurate than the other i dont get why they have two completely different tests for one thing seriously and all joking aside no the reason for the swab is to increase the chances of obtaining bacteria for the sample that can actually be grown for identification if needbe if you urinate you would flush out most of the bacteria and the chemistry of the urine would destroy most of it what bacteria did survive to grow might have come from your bladder your prostate or kidneys and it would take a couple days to grow enough to identify presuming that you won't want to wait that long for what could be a missed diagnosis it's quicker and more efficient to use the cotton swab yeah it's unpleasant and sometimes painful but it does tend to serve as a reminder next time to wear a raincoat bacteria don't eat through latex there were some studies done to see if chlamydia could be detected using urine and although sometimes it could it wasn't considered reliable enough for males especially the best way remains to use a swab Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Medical analysis of circumcision Cancer Urinary tract infection Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cystoscopy Urinary system Anal sex Oral sex Bacteria Kidney stone Group A streptococcal infection Pneumonia Hypoglycemia Reiter's syndrome Urination Agar plate Menstrual cup Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease Cytomegalovirus Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Radiation therapy Candidiasis Drug test Diabetes mellitus HIV test Diaper Quicksort Genetically modified food Leptospirosis Chronic fatigue syndrome IgA nephropathy Strap-on dildo Benign prostatic hyperplasia Tour de France Needle aspiration biopsy Prostatitis Insulin Jon Secada Conjunctivitis Colorectal cancer Autism Epididymitis Urethra Medicine Multiple sclerosis Chlamydia Acute renal failure Escherichia coli O157:H7 Common cold Endometriosis Legionellosis Clomipramine Myocardial infarction Crohn's disease Infertility Condom Genetic fingerprinting Ulcerative colitis Shroud of Turin Medical laboratory Science Dairy Cotton swab Vulvovaginal health Calvin and Hobbes Redundant array of independent disks Kashrut Toilet humour Lymphogranuloma venereum Growth hormone treatment Burial Renal cell carcinoma Kidney Mass spectrometry Mesothelioma Non-gonococcal urethritis Little Britain Marathon (sport) Toilet Scientific method Tattoo Diabetic nephropathy Internal ballistics Ben Johnson (athlete) Dehydration Ice core
