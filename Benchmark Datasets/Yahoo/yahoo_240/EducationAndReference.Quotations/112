when you give a woman a compliment she looks in the mirror but a man an old arab proverb when you give a woman a compliment she looks in the mirror but when you tell a man something honey pours out of his ears what does honey pours out of his ears suspose to mean he like what he hears like saying ' beauty fades and dumb is forever ' the saying means this whatever compliment you pay a woman she will always 'go to the mirror' because the compliments they most value are those about their appearance so even if you say to her 'you're really clever' she'll rush to the mirror check herself out and wonder why you didn't compliment her on her hair or her eyes when you compliment a man however he is immediately suspicious wondering if you are trying to 'butter him up' or ridiculing him or trying to distract him et al thus the words may be metaphoric 'honey' entering his ears but it will pour out again because he won't let such nonsense in overall it means paying women compliments works wonders but paying men compliments does nothing they fall on deaf ears there are dvds available that illustrate how compliments can take you with women Joke Book of Isaiah Marilyn Monroe Hathor The Unquiet Dead Milton H.
