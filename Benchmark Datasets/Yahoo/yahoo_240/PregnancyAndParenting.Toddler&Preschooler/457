toddler hitting baby what do i do my month old is hitting her baby brother she also throws things at him separating them isn't really an option this doesn't happen when she gets angry with him she'll be in a perfect mood and all of a sudden throw something at him or she'll be talking to him and holding his and and all of a sudden hit him so i can't really stop her because i don't know what to expect right before it happens sometimes i am holding him when it happens and other times he is in his swing he's weeks old i have tried time out saying no telling her what to hit instead of her brother etc nothing seems to work are there any tricks to getting her to stop doing this and i hate to say it but she has gotten a spanking from doing it that didn't work and i don't want to do it again how do i get her to stop and i don't want to tell her that she can't touch her brother at all because i want her to continue the loving relationship she shows towards him the other of the time she's very attuned to his needs and i often ask her what the baby wants so far she's never been wrong i am going through the exact same thing my year old is very protective of his little brother now mos he asks where my friends are taking him in his car seat won't give permission to others to hold him and watches him like a hawk things have been very different recently these past few days while i am out of the room from both of them he's grabbed one of his toy bins and put it over the baby's head and pushed on it pushed him over hit him with toys he's thrown food at him covers his face with a blanket and just today he bit his finger i'm beginning to think he likes making him cry i know he's doing it at least twice a day the baby is pretty mellow and barely cries and now it seems he's crying for no reason when i rush to investigate i hear little feet thumping away from the scene he seems to even do it on the days where i sit with him and do puzzles and draw the only thing i can think of is to ask advice from my doctor you may want to try too Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
