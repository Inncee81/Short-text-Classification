any ideas on how to stop toddlers from playing with feces i have twin year old daughters who are currently potty training some days when i put them down for their nap we have no problems however there are the days that i walk into their room after they wake up and find them diaper less and the carpet and walls smeared with poop i am at my wits end on how to deal with this my sons nieces and nephews never did anything of this sort so i have no previous experience in dealing with this kind of behavior for some reason my daughters don't seem to use their poop for paint when they wake up in the morning only after their nap i have twin year old daughters who are currently potty training some days when i put them down for their nap we have no problems however there are the days that i walk into their room after they wake up and find them diaper less and the carpet and walls smeared with poop i am at my wits end on how to deal with this my sons nieces and nephews never did anything of this sort so i have no previous experience in dealing with this kind of behavior for some reason my daughters don't seem to use their poop for paint when they wake up in the morning only after their nap i have tried ignoring it and just cleaning up the mess but they just did it more often i taped their diapers on but they just ripped the diapers making a bigger mess i taped shorts on over their diapers but they figured out how to get the tape off i tried telling them what it is and how disgusting it is but that hasn't seemed to help either i tried making them help clean up the mess but they made it worse i have tried ignoring it and just cleaning up the mess but they just did it more often i taped their diapers on but they just ripped the diapers making a bigger mess i taped shorts on over their diapers but they figured out how to get the tape off i tried telling them what it is and how disgusting it is but that hasn't seemed to help either i tried making them help clean up the mess but they made it worse boredom none of my children acted out in this way playing with poop but they did in other ways messier ways lol but easier to control i suppose for example baby powder all over the entire room vasoline everywhere including in the hair lol you need to try and emphasize that for one poop is disgusting to play with you need to tell it like it is poop is waste from our bodies just like garbage is waste from our family no one plays with the garbage do they no so then its not okay to play in poop yuck you also might want to highlight how bad poop smells and that when they get it on them because they are playing in it they smell that way too also try to not have a huge reaction when you walk in and see this like i said boredom they will enjoy your reaction so you need to hav a reaction it just needs to be the right one an action and disposition of disgust disappointment and love for your children would probably work best in this situation tell them that you are disappointed that instead of doing 'something else' that they enjoy craft going to park watching a tv show you all need to spend that time now cleaning up a big poopy mess it isn't funny or cute its gross and a lot of work that they are capable of helping you clean up which they definatly should do if anything hand them each a wet cloth and have them wipe down the walls children aren't born knowing whats right and wrong and why its our job as parents to teach them while loving them to bits don't scold them for it just teach them why this behavior is not acceptable and why it is disrespectful to themselves to you the entire family daddy other siblings and to their room and things this won't be a miracle and work after one time but eventually maybe a couple times they will get it hang in there till they do also as a preventative measure you may want to try timing there naps if you know that they usually sleep for about hour then go in at about mins and start puttering around putting laundry away tidying up etc this way you are already in the room and ready to start the second part of the day with them when they are ready its all about boredom kids get into the most trouble when they are bored p and you've got teammates on your hands lol Social rule Infantilism Diaper EastEnders Friends Sin City Pitaten Theory of conduct Kimi Finster Toilet humour Milton H.
