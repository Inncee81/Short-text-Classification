my two year old daughter keeps waking up at night she goes to bed at pm and always wakes between midnite and am calling out and crying weve tried ignoring her but she becomes hysterical and we end up going in as shes so loud she distubs my son who is months old and i dont want him to start getting up aswell we give her a drin k of water and then she will go strait back to sleep some nights this can happen times any advice as to what we can do and what may be causing this nothing has changed in our home life it's pretty normal for kids to wake up a couple of times at night just because it's part of their sleep cycle the thing is that now your daughter has figured out that when she wakes up and cries for you you come in don't stress my suggestion and it's worked for my almost year old is to go in when she's cring but don't talk to her don't look into her eyes cuddle her hug her shush her etc but don't engage her into conversation with time she'll figure out that it's kind of boring having you come in to her room and not talk with her and then hopefully she'll stop calling for you good luck Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Insomnia Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Milton H.
