my month old son came home from visiting his father scared to death to take a bath does anyone know why he would be this way he loved the bath before he left and would sometimes take a day and does anyone have any ideas on how i could ease his fears well if i were you i would talk to his father and ask him if your son had taken a bath while he was there and if he says yes i would then ask if anything accidental happened while getting his bath such as slipping in the tub or choking on the water be very careful when asking him because if you sound as if you are accusing him of any wrong doing it won't end in a very good way usually when children get hurt doing something even if they loved it before will tend to get upset when having to be involved with whatever they got hurt on the next time it just might take a few times for him to start liking it again if that is the case i would start raising questions if everytime he gets back from his dads house he's afraid of taking a bath because then something could be going on that shouldn't be just pay very close attention without seeming obvious and if it happens again then notify someone that you are concerned with your sons safety at his fathers house Social rule Shaggy dog story About a Boy Pitaten The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fathers' rights Plame affair Kodocha Customs and etiquette of Japan Diving The Human Stain Ranma __ characters Scenes from a Memory Milton H.
