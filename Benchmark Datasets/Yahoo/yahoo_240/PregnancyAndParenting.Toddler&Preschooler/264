is it bad that my two year old toddler boy dresses in girl clothes when playing dramatic play my boyfriend freaks out when our year old son dresses in girls clothes and puts on makeup with his sisters he gets angry and wants to punish him he says that he will grow to be a fag and allowing him to freely play this way only teaches him to be feminine i disagree and feel that many young children do this and it shouldn't be an issue it breaks my heart that my boyfriend would think this way what would someone who has experience in early childhood development say to this it's perfectly normal behavior kids need to try out all sorts of roles when he gets to preschool he'll probably move on to dressing up in more traditional boys things your boyfriend can do real damage by making him feel guilty what you can do is to offer him some more choices the girls would benefit too add some uniform pieces some pieces of fabric and lots of job related hats i hope your boyfriend doesn't get upset when one of the girls decides to dress up as a firefighter and by the way how a year old dresses has nothing to do with his sexual identity and anyhow why does it matter Characters in the Smurfs Friends Pitaten Gender role Cross-dressing Avenue Q Teen Girl Squad EastEnders Theory of conduct Daria Child sexuality Clothing Narcissism Women in Islam Infantilism Recurring South Park characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Adolescence Little Britain Transsexuality Knots Landing Phoebe Halliwell Hunter __ Hunter Child Boston Public Great Teacher Onizuka Revolutionary Girl Utena Kimberly-Clark Corporation The Apprentice 2 Pedophilia Urusei Yatsura The Devil Wears Prada Sex and the City Homosexuality Vernon Schillinger Sexual orientation Ashlee Simpson Kodocha Jennifer Lopez Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ranma __ characters About a Boy French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools The Brady Bunch Everwood W.I.T.C.H.
