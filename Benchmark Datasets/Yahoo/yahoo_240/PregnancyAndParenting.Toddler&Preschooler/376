my five year old cousin keeps saying erotic instead of exotic what should i do he's obsessed with the word like if i show him something in the store he'll say in his cute little voice that's so erotic marlene he thinks it means exotic because when i asked him what he thought it meant he said it's not normal like another country it's far away like hawaii i told him he means exotic but it's hard for him to pronounce so i told him to say cool instead but he refuses and he says you aren't my mom marlene stop telling me what to say i told my aunt but she says she's never heard him say it he says it like four or five times a day when he's around me though should i do something about it you can try to do something about it but it is obvious that he is already closed to your help the majority of people understand that some children have a hard time saying certain sounds and won't look oddly at you or anyone with him when he says that talk to your aunt again tell her that you understand she hasn't heard him say this but he does say it maybe try to get him to say it in front of her not by prodding him but by providing a situation which would make him say that word so that she can hear it herself then ask her what she would suggest doing i would suggest that perhaps he get in for some sort of speech therapy then again he could grow out of it on his own Milton H.
