when do you start potty training how my son is months old i was wondering when i should start potty training him he's expressed an interest or should i say a fascination with the toilet lately he loves to flush it thinks it's neat when mommy daddy use it to pee i read one of the signs of readiness is if they have a dry diaper for a few hours but he's never had that anyone have any good tips dry diapers for a few hours dry nighttime diapers able to tell you he has to potty wanting to try sitting on the potty knowledge of when he has to potty like if he pees and realizes he peed or knows he has to poop and goes away to hide to potty the average boy is years old when they pottytrain boys take longer they have to learn to eventually stand to pee then they have to sit to poop so they find it more confusing at first let your son watch your husband pee and he will learn faster how to stand and pee but remember to be patient when you do start until he can tell you he has to potty or he did potty he isn't even close to ready he also needs to be able to get his pants up and down by himself Toilet training Toilet Urinary incontinence Elimination communication Infantilism Diaper Japanese toilet Shaggy dog story Milton H.
