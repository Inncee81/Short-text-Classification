year old not interested in learning new things our year old son does not seem at all interested in learning new things for example we have been trying to get him to learn to ride a bicycle with training wheels learning to play baseball at least to hit the ball with bat swimming he has no desire for the swimming my parents have a pool i try to encourage him to wear the arm floaties or his life jacket he won't wear either tonight we were at a community pool he was the only person in the baby pool he will try to ride his bike for about minutes if that and says i'm done and that is the end of that i am disappointed when i see children younger then him or children his same age doing things that he can't or won't do i understand all children learn at different stages and rates i am concerned this might turn out to be something more is this something to be worried about could this just be phase he is going through any suggestions on getting him more interested in trying new things have someone else teach him my son does the same thing he's taking speech therapy before he was he would not point at the right colors for me nor even listen repeat abc 's since in therapy he listens to the therapist children this age tend to do more for teachers and other family members than their own parents don't worry about it its normal Infantilism Autism The Giver Milton H.
