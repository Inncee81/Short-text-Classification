how can i stop my little girl my little girl likes sleeping on her belly there for being months she stills wear nappies i change her nappie everytime she wokes up but most times i have change everything everything she has on and her bedding becuase she sleeps on her belly everytime she does a wee it goes right up her belly its getting to much having to keep changing her and i cant let her sleep wet any ideas on how to give her a dry night sleep no rude replys please the nappie im using on her is a boys and its the biggest i could get hold off seeing that she is months old you really can't change her sleeping style she likes her belly and there's nothing you can do about that as for the peeing you can do what the other gals have suggested try changing her diaper size or brand if you are using cheap ones sometimes using the more expensive ones work better maybe getting a good brand for night time you could also get ones designed for night time also cut the amount you give her to drink nothing to drink for an hour before bed and change her right before she goes to bed as bad as this might sound letting her sleep wet might be better than waking her up she probably wants more to drink and you being a good mom get her another bottle or cuppie this only adds to the cycle of drenched nights giving her less to drink before bed and letting her sleep through the night will actually encourage the dry nights she's only months so you have a while to go before she really starts sleeping dry you might be one of the lucky ones where she hates the wet so much that she actually potty trains herself like my little sister did she was about months i wish you all the luck in the world i know it's tough but you can do it i have boys that pee in every which direction my youngest is been potty trained for nearly years and still misses the toilet also you can try incontinent pads they come in disposable and washable types available at most health care stores if you can't find the disposable ones at your local walmart in the adult diaper department attends depends try the dog section they have puppy training pads they are the very same thing you could also get diaper inserts i don't know if they have them in the baby department but you can get them in the adult section i think they're called poise pads they're basically big maxi pads good luck Diaper Urinary incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Sanitary towel Sin City Jackass: The Movie Breastfeeding Humphrey Bogart Menstrual cup Social rule Toilet humour Genericized trademark Avenue Q Recurring South Park characters The Shining (film) The Fairly OddParents Japanese toilet Rugrats Knots Landing The Sims Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Urination Friends The Catcher in the Rye The Lovely Bones Insomnia Procter & Gamble Sleep Good Morning, Vietnam EastEnders Dog Trailer Park Boys Rooibos Housebreaking Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Subtle Knife The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fancy rat Daylight saving time Kimi Finster Ranma __ characters Public transport What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
