is it rude to tell your mom to shut up i normally am very respectful to my mom and would never tell her this but oh my god she is driving me nuts my son is we dont live with her i am a good mom to him and he is an awesome kid however she needs to put her cents in about everything you need to do this you need to do that do this do that what you need to do is blah blah blah believe me i know she means well and she is only looking out for him and me but i have tried explaining to her that i am his mom he is well taken care of but she wont stop she literally calls me every morning at to ask me did you feed him breakfast like i would forget she calls at least times a day and i am sooooo fed up she even came and broke into my house one day because i took my son to see a movie and didnt bring my phone in with me so i didnt answer calls in a row so she thought something happened and actually broke my sliding glass door what do i do this is very out of hand you must have a talk with your mother i don't think shut up will do if she thinks she has to tell you to feed your kid and she's literally breaking into your home when you don't answer your phone long enough to see a movie there is some kind of psychological issue going on with her because this is not normal healthy behavior ask her straight out if she sincerely thinks you will forget to feed him if she doesn't tell you to then go through her other behaviors and explain that the constant calling and for pete's sake breaking down a door are very inappropriate ask her why she feels the need to act this way you would be surprised how much people examine their own actions when forced to explain them to others if she just can't help herself explain to her that you will answer the phone to her no more than once a day you simply can't parent or even lead your life effectively if you have to answer the phone that many times a day that would make me go insane and she will be responsible for any damages she causes to your home one thinks of tough love in regard to children but you may have to use tough love for your mother and keep her at a distance from your life and your son's until she learns some boundaries Shaggy dog story About a Boy Theory of conduct Cindy Sheehan Humphrey Bogart Social rule Laura Schlessinger Friends The Amber Spyglass The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rich Mullins Rent (musical) Customs and etiquette of Japan Theodicy Sexual orientation Eric Cartman Evil The Smoking Room The Shining (film) Kodocha Human sexual behavior The Marshall Mathers LP Narcissism Muslim ibn Aqeel EastEnders Little Britain A Course In Miracles Charmed Grandview, U.S.A.
