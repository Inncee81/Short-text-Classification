did she do this on purpose i went to blockbuster yesterday afternoon with my husband my year old daughter and my month old daughter as i walked in i looked at the girl behind the counter and smiled at her she didn't smile back say hello how are you can i help you or even screw you it didnt bother me and i went through the store and we chose our selections we then went up to the counter to pay for the movies we chose and my baby daughter started fussing i looked down at her in her car seat and said that we were about finished the girl behind the counter asked me if she was my grand daughter i kinda went white and mumbled that she was my daughter the girl didn't skip a beat and went on about her business she didn't even seem embarrassed she just had this stupid grin on her face as if she did this to embarrass me why do some people assume that is too old to have children i have been told that i look at least years younger i wanted to smack that grin right off her face thanks to all that answered almost everyone had an intelligent answer i was basing my assumption that she did this on purpose being that she ignored my inital entrance into the store but said hello to everyone that came in after we did lol i am not really bothered that much by her behavior not to be mean but she was used as the ugly stick if you know what i mean so i guess it was out of jealousy when i go out with my year old and my month old some people think she is his some think she is ours i am i just laugh it off don't let it get to you i usually have a come back you should have put her on the spot like i don't look that old do i or maybe she thought it was your daughters child meaning nothing about you just that your daughter could have a child which today is sadly very common i know how you feel but she didn't mean anything by it she was young right she just did not know any better Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Eddie Guerrero 2000 Australian Grand Prix Joker (comics) Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Social rule Joke Father's Day (Doctor Who) Russian joke Shawn Michaels Hall & Oates Cliff Richard Rais massacre Megan Griffin Kodocha Ty Cobb Blood on the Tracks The Marriage of Figaro Plame affair timeline Sharon Tate The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Satchel Paige The Catcher in the Rye Sin City Mojave people The Marshall Mathers LP Muslim ibn Aqeel K' Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Inside Pitaten Teen Girl Squad Ben Johnson (athlete) Phoebe Buffay's songs Public Eye Coming of Age (TNG episode) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Frankie Laine The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Neighbours Columbine High School massacre Poker jargon Monty Hall problem Milton H.
