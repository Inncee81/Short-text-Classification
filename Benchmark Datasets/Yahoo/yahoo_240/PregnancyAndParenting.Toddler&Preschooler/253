any rememdies to stop the runs i am an experienced mum but i have never known a year old have the runs the way my daughter has now she is not in any particular pain so i suspect a tummy upset but the poor thing is exhausted she is not able to make it to the toilet so that is adding to her problem she is very embarrassed and putting her back in nappies would be unfair to her i would usually let the runs pass through but these are nothing i have experienced before we have used pairs of knickers no sooner are they washed and dried they are soiled and back in the machine and thats not including the towels and bedding that have also been washed my man is away so anything suggested has got to be bought from the near by shop and no medicines please she is only years old thank you in advance for any remedies she is exhausted because she has been up all night she is certainly not dehydrated and be assured she is drinking sips of water its a tummy upset for that i am sure and as an experienced mother i would take her to the doctors if it continued past hrs poor wee thing well you sound like you know what your doing but the way i see it is if she has caught a wee bug then having the runs is flushing out her system so just keep with the sips of water cool boiled water is best as you no i wouldnt bother to much about food as long as she is drinking if anything try something light like toast or scrambled egg pairs of knickers is a lot to go through sounds like she has it bad erm i would get the doctor in at the hour mark to the house dont take her out to him poor wee thing is going through enough i agree with not putting nappys on her she might feel she is doing something wrong or is being a baby kids minds dont think the same as us you could try the pull up pants they have wee pictures on them might make her feel special or a potty next to her all the time hope she gets better soon Sento Social rule Urinary incontinence Tea Poker jargon Breastfeeding Japanese toilet Fecal incontinence Milton H.
