month old biting my daughter bit me yesterday now other people have been telling me over the passed couple weeks that she has bit them but i didn't think she did it on purpose but she straight out just bit my leg yesterday out of nowhere then after i yelled at her for it she tried to bite me again while she was crying i really couldn't believe it all other people talk about is how sweet and gentle she is and she is but this was kinda scary i was wondering if all kids go through a stage like this or is it because she's in daycare and learning it if your kid s did go through this stage were they in daycare or have older siblings they learned it from or is this like a 'natural' thing they figured out just for the record i don't believe in spanking anyway i know that only results in her thinking that hitting is okay plus i just think it's wrong i'm thinking about trying time outs for discipline on biting but i'm not really sure she'll 'get that' just yet we'll see i'm surprised it took her this long most toddlers bite when they are teething you have to understand that she doesn't understand that it hurts you a child of that age has a very limited understanding that others have feelings and the reaction can be quite amazing to a little one hehe mine has recently learned to hang up the phone while mommy is talking generally speaking if a behaviour doesn't get them what they want then it stops pretty quickly then again it can be hard not to scream depending on where they bite and whether you were paying attention Piccolo Junior Saga Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
