help with month old nap our mo dd is driving me crazy she goes down for a nap between am and sleeps for half hours and then she is up until bed time which is am which means she is up for half hours way too long i have tried moving her nap to once a day at pm but that backfired she only would sleep for mins and be miserable the rest of the day until bed no matter how hard we play she refuses to take the afternoon nap nd nap or sleep longer with a later a day nap i would love to have her on one long later nap it just doesn't seem to be working for me please any help or advice would be great i had kinda the same issues but honestly the only thing you can do is try moving the nap time by minutes or so later and see how that goes then do it again honestly you are on her schedule and she will sleep when she needs to esp if she has got into the schedule of napping at that time my daughter stopped taking naps all together when she was about yo she would only nap if she needed it but would play quietly in her room for a set amount of time instead my son is the exact opposite he still needs a nap at times but would take up to a hr nap when he was that age and still sleep through the night Siesta Sleep Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Blitzball Narcolepsy Polyphasic sleep Daylight saving time Apollo 8 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Knots Landing Opportunity rover timeline for 2005 March STS-61 Network Against Prohibition 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Equation of time Insomnia Mattress Sin City Sumo Shaggy dog story Nara Shikamaru EastEnders Time Year Medical prescription Fertility awareness Cleveland Indians Public transport Olympias Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ty Cobb 1957 World Series Lucid dreaming STS-59 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April New Alliance Party Blonde on Blonde Grandview, U.S.A.
