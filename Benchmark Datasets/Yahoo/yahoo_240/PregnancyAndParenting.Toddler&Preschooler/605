don't know what to do my son is months old and he will randonly come up and throw toys at me hit me and kick me i have tried putting him in time out but it isn't working my boyfriend the father has also tried saying no to him and putting him time out but when we take him out our son would be mad and start throwing toys at me and hitting me some more what should i do i don't believe in hitting a child so please don't tell me to do that this is to linda d i am not allowing him to do this if you spank a child then the child will only want to hit you more because that is what you are teaching him or they will grow up scared of you and no i do not want that to happen i want my son to feel free to come up to me and talk to me whenever he needs too well mom here's the thing your son is trying to communicate with you and there's a breakdown somewhere he is showing signs of becoming a bully and i'm guessing that's not what you want my friend has a son who was turning out to be a bully too and we talked extensively about it she read articles on line about it and talked to her ped basically she tried time outs she tried threats and even yes gasp spanking spanking was about the only thing that worked but eventually she realized that if she got really busy with him and just occupied all of his time and kept him busy busy busy then he wouldn't be so angry so she basically burnt him out with activity now he is a bit older and can communicate with language and things are alot better so keep working on the language aspect b c the base of this is he can't tell you what he wants but he sure does want it also don't be afraid to keep putting him in time out he needs to understand that you are sorry he can't have anymore crackers before dinner but throwing a toy at mommy is unacceptable now sit here until i tell you that you can get up thank you hang in there and stick to your guns let him walk all over you now and it will never stop Shaggy dog story Kodocha Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Milton H.
