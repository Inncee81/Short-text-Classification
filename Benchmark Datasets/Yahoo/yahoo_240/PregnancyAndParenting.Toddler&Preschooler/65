potty training hi im potty training for the first time i have read the books but not as good as people who have really been through it im training my first child i have the potty and she has done a wee wee once has any got any hints tips on how too make this go as smooth as possible i mean in the sense of do i let her walk around the whole day with no nappie how long do i sit her on there for when do i put her on there any help would be appriciated thanks first congrats to your little girl this is a big deal for her so let her know how grown up she is becoming when buying her new big girl underwear make it special for her by having a big girl's day out also letting her pick out her own underwear makes it a special event the thing with potty training you have to make it fun not a chore think up some neat little games i was lucky i have a boy so we just threw fruit loops in the toilet and told him to try and sink them teaches good aiming skills too since you have a girl why not get her a go potty doll i've seen them at toys r us and walmart little mini potty included she will be responsible for training her baby and will learn by teaching also learning by example works great take potty breaks together rewards work well too i used my little boy's favorite candy m m's keep them in a jar where they are visible but out of reach each time she goes potty allow her to pick two or three out of the jar if you don't want to go the candy route toddler cookies work great too any of her favorite bite size snacks will do try making a potty chart each time she goes to the potty she gets a star or she can mark it off herself when she goes potty a certain number of times then take her to her favorite park or chucky cheese's or let her pick out a new toy and most important lots of praise and hugs applaud dance sing whatever it takes to show her what a good job she is doing usually after drinking she should be ready to go in about to minutes unless she's got a large bladder pay attention to her after she drinks to pick up her potty habits she may stand still or crouch when she has to go potty some kids even hide especially if they know they are being trained if you can't catch any visible habits just start checking her pull up after about or minutes this will give you a timeline so you can time her potty breaks accordingly just remember keep a cool head kids are wonders at sensing stress and frustration this could have a reverse effect on her and she will associate going potty with mommy getting all tense and making a mad face in other words she will avoid the potty with a passion to avoid your reactions i wouldn't make her sit on the potty for an extended amount of time either this leads to more stress especially for her keep it a positive experience for her and you it will take time and perseverence and lots of patience so don't get too worked up about it if she doesn't pick it up immediately kids learn at their own pace and in time she'll get the hang of it just don't give up and revert back to diapers sends her the wrong message and allows her to think she can continue going potty however and whenever she pleases and when you get frustrated just remember how good it's going to feel when you get to finally bypass the diaper aisle best of luck Urinary incontinence Dog training Rugrats Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jackass: The Movie Diaper Kimi Finster Fecal incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Avenue Q Milton H.
