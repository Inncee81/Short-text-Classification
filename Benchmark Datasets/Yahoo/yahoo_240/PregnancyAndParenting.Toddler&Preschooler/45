how can i pottytrain my boy joey i just potty trained my son and daughter and i used the potty stool http www thepottystool com i started by just setting it at the toilet my kids immediately climbed up on the stool and discovered that they could safely use the toilet this got them very interested in using the toilet and they were potty trained very quickly it really helps boys to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations i like that i don't have to double the steps of potty training by training them first in a potty and then training them to stop using a potty and not dumping and cleaning a potty each time is great the best thing is that kids use it for years i hope this helps you Toilet humour Toilet Fecal incontinence Toilet training Elimination communication Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Urination Kimberly-Clark Corporation Aerial (dance move) Sento Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Feral child El Chavo del Ocho Parenting Bristol Grammar School AFI 100 Years series Uniform Resource Locator Jackass: The Movie Son Goku (Dragon Ball) SpongeBob SquarePants Train station The Sims Railroad car Vegeta Stomach cancer Rugrats Toilet paper Puni Puni Poemy Sewer HyperText Transfer Protocol Siphon Humphrey Bogart The Body (Short Story) The Fairly OddParents Mnemonic Urine West Bromwich Albion F.C.
