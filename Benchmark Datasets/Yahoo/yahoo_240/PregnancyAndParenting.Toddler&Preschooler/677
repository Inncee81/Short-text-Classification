how do i get my month old to stop pulling hair my month old son loves pulling hair not his own but everyone elses he tends to do it when he's in playful mood so i think he thinks he's playing problem is he does it to my friend's children makes them cry i scold him for it once or twice he's cried over it but then he still does it i tried ignoring him when he does it to me or distracting him but he just pulls harder what should i do when it comes to pulling other children's hair i would start by telling him that the kids won't want to play with him if he pulls their hair if that doesn't work then i would have the child who has had their hair pulled be asked to pull your son's hair i know it sounds cruel but i actually put this into practice once and it worked i was babysitting a little boy and he pulled my older son's hair my son was older by about years and although i had told the little boy previously that the other kids wouldn't want to play with him if he pulled their hair he only seemed to remember that for a short while so on the next occasion i said to my son to pull the little boys hair lol my son was horrified and didn't want to do it but i said to just do it softly so that the other little boy could see what it felt like my son did it the little boy looked extremely surprised cried for only a minute but it seemed to get through to him because he never did it again when he does it to you i would tell him he is hurting mummy and if he continues to do it that mummy will have to put him down if you are holding him or that mummy is upset and needs to be on her own for a few minutes remove him from your immediate 'space' each and every time he does it to you he needs to know that it is not a nice feeling and that you won't accept him doing it to you and that when he does do it to you that you don't want to be around him i know that is a hard thing to get across to someone his age but if you continually put him down remove him from your lap or you leave the room when he does it i think he will understand that you are not going to continue to allow him to do it good luck to you it's awful when our children begin anti social behaviour but you have to 'nip it in the bud' as soon as possible Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga The Shining (film) Social rule Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind Tenshinhan Knots Landing The Inside The Contender (television series) Milton H.
