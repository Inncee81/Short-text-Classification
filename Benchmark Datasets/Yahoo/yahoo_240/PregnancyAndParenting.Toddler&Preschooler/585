my daughter wakes up like crazy and drinks alot of bottles hi my daughter wakes up alot and drinks alot of bottles has anyone else experienced it she's years old and she for example woke up last night i had to change her times or she might leak through on the bed we put her in her bed and she sleeps for a bit then wakes up and cries and comes into our room by the time she falls asleep sometimes we're asleep so cant bring her to her room again and she wakes sometimes when we move her tried tough love but she screams in our room and it's soo bloody loud and we have a month old and dont want her to wake up what have you done to remidy the situation and no she doesnt have diabeties or anything p just incase some might think so asked the doctor and he cant figure out why she wakes up alot also it's a waterbed we have and it's a little warm but not hot so we cant figure out why or she needs a bottle all the time maybe to sooth her oh she has never used a soother also her bed is big so she has room to roll around sorry to tell you but it just sounds like a bad habit that you'll just have to break i like the water idea but you need to stay firm also try feeding her more solids before bed like ceral oatmeal etc something to help fill her up we use music therapy to lull our baby to sleep you can get lots of baby music for that purpose at most any store we like the fisher price baby go to sleep cd you can get them at walmart babies r us target etc and even online we have always used music and she has never needed a pacifier or a bottle to sleep good luck Mattress Knots Landing EastEnders Urinary incontinence The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Sin City Characters in the Smurfs Waterbed Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare The Amber Spyglass The Big Sleep Social rule Out-of-body experience Hip hop collaborations Charles Bukowski Humphrey Bogart Hansel und Gretel Breakfast The Catcher in the Rye The Emancipation of Mimi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Characters of The Sandman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Co-sleeping Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Slow Train Coming Ron and Fez Sleep Jam (TV series) Baby bottle What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
