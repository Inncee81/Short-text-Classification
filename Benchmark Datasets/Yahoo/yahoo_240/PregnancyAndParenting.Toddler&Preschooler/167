month old pulling out her hair my friend's month old daughter is pulling out her hair at night when she is sleeping she now has a bald spot on the side of her head because she only pulls it from that one area every night she has seen a doctor and he has ruled out any physical ailments to be the cause they also just took her to cut her hair in hopes that will help does anyone have any ideas on how to stop this behavior before it gets worse things already tried telling her pulling out her hair is a no no putting a hat on when she sleeps she just took it off cut her hair really short yes she for sure is pulling it out when they get up the hair is balled up in her hand i heard a story about a child who did something similar when he was weaned from the breast he would pull his hair out and rub it on his face after many specialists it was discovered that his mother had hairy nipples while this is probably not the case with your friend for some reason her daughter really likes to pull her hair out so much so that it is a self soothing method too bad she doesn't suck her thumb i would recommend giving her an alternate hair pulling option put a very fuzzy stuffed animal in bed with her and see how she does or even a barbie doll or something like it they could also try to teach her to pet her hair instead of pull on it as an extension of the 'touch nice' lesson failing all else i would recommend mittens or socks on her hands so she cannot get a good grip on her hair Breastfeeding Sin City Salad Fingers Kodocha Avenue Q Dog Eric Cartman Baldness Textile manufacturing Aerial (dance move) EastEnders Hair Characters of The Sandman The Critic Ranma __ characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cheating in poker Dog training Knots Landing Barbie Hormone replacement therapy (trans) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Garfield Cat The Shining (film) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Subtle Knife The Addams Family Little Britain Humphrey Bogart W.I.T.C.H.
