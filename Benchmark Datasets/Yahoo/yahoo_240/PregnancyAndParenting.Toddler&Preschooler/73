strange toddler behavior beating up her imaginary friends i have a year old and she had imaginary friends already she will yell and kick them she will tell them to go away and dont touch her i dont know why but it kinda worries me is this normal sometimes she'll tlk to them and be friendly but most of the time she just yells and tries to get them to leave her alone imaginary friends show that your child is highly intelligent so please ignore the answers about sending her to see someone about this does your daughter have siblings the fact that she can show a distinction between her imaginary friends and everyone else just proves her intelligence my three yr old yells at her brother to leave her alone and does all the things you describe that yours is doing with her if please do not worry about this just make sure you are doing plenty with her to stimulate her congrats on such a bright child Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Autism Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends The Smoking Room Tag Father's Day (Doctor Who) Knots Landing Le Malade imaginaire Asperger syndrome Big Brother UK series 6 Color Intelligence quotient Salad Fingers The Flintstones Beat generation Child sexuality The Marshall Mathers LP Atheism KaBlam!
