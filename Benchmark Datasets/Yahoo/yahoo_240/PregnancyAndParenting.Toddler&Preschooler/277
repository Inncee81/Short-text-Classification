should i let my daughter give away her favorite toys i have taught my daughter two things that i think are important that she is fortunate to have things that she desires in addition to the things she needs and to give to others less fortunate this in addition to not wanting my house over run with toys i have a toys at a time limit has led us to pack boxes to take to needy children every once in a while and she gets to choose which toys go but what if she chooses toys that are really sentimental to me and used to be sentimental to her should i let her part with those things or is it a concept taken overboard when her most prized stuffed animals are given away i would love to know what you think i think at this point that it probably depends on how old she is if she is years old and intends to give away something that you think she will later regret you could stash it away until a later date and ask her to decide again explaining that you thought she might change her mind on the other hand if she is a little older and embraces the concept of providing for underprivileged children for you to keep what she chose to give away would be to undermine her decisions you seem to be raising a thoughtful compassionate child good job mom Predestination Calvin and Hobbes Extreme Programming The nature of God in Western theology Kodocha Free will Supply and demand Israel ben Eliezer Theory of conduct Microeconomics Kevin and Kell Infantilism Summa Theologiae EastEnders Meaning of life Love The Sims W.
