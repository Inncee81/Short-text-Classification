what age should i start potty training my daughter i have a mo old daughter and i was wondering if it is too early to start potty training we just had a baby boy and the sooner she is out of diapers the better for the past months whenever i give her a bath i put her on her potty and let her go while i am feeling up the bathtub then i make a big deal out of the fact that she has gone she can barely talk right now and i dont know if she even knows when she has to go potty should i wait if it is time to go ahead and start how do you start thanks from a first time mom well i think they say certain requirements such as these signs include staying dry for at least hours at a time having regular bowel movements being able to follow simple instructions being uncomfortable with dirty diapers and wanting them to be changed asking to use the potty chair or asking to wear regular underwear you should also be able to tell when your child is about to urinate or have a bowel movement by his facial expressions posture or by what he says in my opinion you give it a try and stay calm with accidents and if she isn't showing interest or acting like she is getting it try again later Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Elimination communication Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Toilet training Toilet humour Infantilism Housebreaking Social rule Japanese toilet Sento Undergarment The Amazing Race Rugrats Prostate cancer SpongeBob SquarePants Milton H.
