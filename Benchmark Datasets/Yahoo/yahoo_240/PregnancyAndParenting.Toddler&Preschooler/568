getting him out of my bed my babys is months old and hes always slept with me not because i wanted him too well maybe a little but because we live w my granmother in a one bed room house so to make sure he doesnt wake her up hes always slept with me we ae moving to my dads in weeks and he'll be able to sleep in is own crub but is it too late he already is a night mare to sleep with so i can only imagine when he's on his own what are some tips to keep him in is own bed we will have to still be in the same room though i just want him to sleep in his own bed i'd transition him out slowly not only is he going to be a brand new home but he is going to be missing the comfort of mom right there i loved cosleeping until ds was about months he started kicking me we are both light sleepers and kept waking eachother up long story short it wasn't working for us anymore transitioning him out was not really a big deal we started a predictable bedtime routine bath jammies stories rocking and put him in his crib at bedtime when he woke up a few hours later to nurse i moved him into my bed where he stayed the rest of the night after several days of this i put him back in his crib when he woke up for that first feeding and moved him to my bed later when he woke up again gradually he was spending more and more time in his crib and less and less in my bed i also introduced a lovey a blanket he likes to chew and snuggle i held it between us when he was nursing and wore it in my shirt so it would smell like me he held it when he read his nighttime stories and when he was tucked in i never had to let him cry it out it was an easy transtion for us and we are all sleeping much better now Shaggy dog story Sleep Insomnia Daylight saving time Kitchen EastEnders Blankets (graphic novel) Knots Landing Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Aerial (dance move) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sin City Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Urinary incontinence W.I.T.C.H.
