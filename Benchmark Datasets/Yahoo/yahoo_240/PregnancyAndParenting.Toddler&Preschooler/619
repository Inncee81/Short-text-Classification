would my yr old be affected long term by my occasional angry moods and frustration like everyone i get very frustrated with daily things ie chores why is baby crying spouse problems ect would things like occasional yelling or frustration mentally or emotionally scar a yr old in the long term i have a year old and a month old so i can definitely sympathize with occasional mood swings and frustration being a stay at home mom don't know if you are but i am is a hard thing and it doesn't get much easier into the toddler years but i have found that when i am about to blow up i try not to direct it at my kids it's hard especially when the year old pees on the carpet and the month old is screaming for the th time in an hour and if i do direct it at my kids and my year old seems affected by it i explain to her that i am frustrated apologize to her for yelling and give her a hug and try to calm myself down i don't think you are going to permanently damage your child as long as you're not being violent towards him her and as long as you let him her know that it was nothing that he she did that you are just frustrated good luck take a deep breath Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Marshall Mathers LP Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Fairly OddParents Traumatic brain injury Electroconvulsive therapy Grief The Inside Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hypoglycemia Kodocha Jon Secada Asperger syndrome Ron and Fez Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anger management Domestic violence Hulk (comics) Stuttering EastEnders Fruits Basket Procrastination Recurring South Park characters Characters in the Smurfs Jam (TV series) Rent (musical) Dog training The Adventures of Pete & Pete Blood (computer game) FLCL Ranma __ characters Bart chalkboard gags Infantilism Oh My Goddess!
