how do you stop a yr olds crying i babysit a yr old and everytime her mom even steps out of a room she starts crying i try to give her something to eat or drink even put in a movie or let her play but nothing works i could really use some awnsers thanks children at this age start to realize that others are separate beings from them and it can be scary to some they go through separation anxiety they only way they know how to deal with it is to cry and for a while that's all she may do but soon she will get used to the idea that mommy will come back mommy always comes back as long as you are doing everything you can to comfort her then you are doing just fine and it's just going to take time i know it's hard but you will do just fine if you get to a point where you feel that you can't take it or you may do something bad put the baby in a safe place playpen crib or strapped in her high chair and walk away take a few deep breaths calm down recollect yourself and go back in to deal with the situation if you feel it's more than you can handle call for help and remember everything will be just fine take care and good luck The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Tag The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Casualty lifting Knife Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Pitaten Poker jargon Zhao Yun K' Transsexuality The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Breastfeeding About a Boy What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
