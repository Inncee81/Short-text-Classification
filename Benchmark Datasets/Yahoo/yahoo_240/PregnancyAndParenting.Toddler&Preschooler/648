my toddler years is pinching kicking hiting and biting my two month old baby what can i do i am quite aware that her behaviour is normal and age appropriate and that she is jealous of the baby and testing boundaries she'll hurt him and then say sorry and immediately do it again i know that this is normal behaviour and that toddlers think it's funny for them to cause a baby to cry how do i make her understand that it is not acceptable and that it is sore i have smacked her put her in the naughty chair and corner pinched her back ignored it punished her by taking toys away nothing helps i know she'll grow out of it and the phase will pass but i cannot have her hurting her brother has anyone experienced this what can i do i have twin toddlers and a baby who is months i think that you may need to reassess the reasons for your toddler's agression sometimes toddlers hit kick and bite only as a way to relate to others also i have never seen a toddler that thinks that it is funny to make a baby cry in my experience they usually get upset when another small child is crying although the behavoir is age appropriate from your descriptions assuming that it just jealous or testing boundaries could be too simple it sounds like she may be looking for the attention that you give her when she is aggressive towards the baby you could try as someone suggested separating yourself from her when she is aggressive and paying special attention to the baby i found saying ouch that hurt we are not going to play with you any more and then leaving the general area gets the point across when you do use this tactic be sure to follow it up with something postive she can do to help you with the baby maybe throwing the diaper in the trash when you change the baby or bringing you something you need then be sure to lavish her with attention when she does the helpful thing the same way you did to the baby when she was mean another thing i have noticed with my kids is that one of my sons seems to frequently hit the baby when he is already crying i have a theory that he is actually trying to comfort him but gets kind of carried away so when he does this i try to teach him gentleness by modeling the behavoir with the baby and encouraging him to do the same with a doll until she stops the behavoir these are some of this things i have done to keep my baby safe first when the baby was little i never left the twins alone with him if that meant the baby spent all day attached to me in the snuggli so be it next as he got older and started needing more tummy time i would spend the time with him guarding him from his siblings now if i want to leave him alone i fence him off from his siblings we have a play yard that fences off about the same area as a 'x ' rug so either the twins or the baby can go in it if i need to run downstairs and get the laundry or something good luck Milton H.
