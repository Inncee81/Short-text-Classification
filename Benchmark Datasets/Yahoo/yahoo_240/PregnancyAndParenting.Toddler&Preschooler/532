when did you stop using nursery water how old was your baby toddler when you stopped using nursery water to water down their juice just curious my son just turned and i'm not going to buy it anymore i'll use the brita filtered water my husband and i drink from now on it is nice that you are concerned for your child i never used nursery water because it is no different than the filtered or bottled water we drink it's just another way for a company to make money my son will be in november and i still usually dilute his juice with water to regulate the amount of sugar he has it's a good thing for them to get used to because then they won't want drinks that are full of sugar artificial flavoring it's healthier anyways Soft drink Alcoholic beverage Rum Milk Sugar Cider Beer Tea Coffee The Coca-Cola Company Vodka Champagne (beverage) Lemonade Drink 7 Up Wine Sake Absinthe Water Wine making Yerba mate Brewery Breastfeeding PepsiCo, Inc.
