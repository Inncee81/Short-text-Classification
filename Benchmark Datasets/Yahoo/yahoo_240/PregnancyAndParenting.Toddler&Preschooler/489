my toddler is very attached to his poo my year old has always hated his nappy being changed but recently the tantrums have gotten worse whenever he poos he always runs off to do it and the reason i know he has done one is because he wont bother me at all he stays away because he doesnt want to be changed today when i found him hiding with his pooey nappy he screamed when i went to change him like really screamed and then screamed for minutes afterwards and kept trying to get it out of the bin and put it back on he got himself into a real state until he eventually fell asleep i have heard of male toddlers being more attached to their poo anyone know about this i think its the poo because he is fine getting a wee changed and its not the changing bit that upsets him its that he actually wants the poo back out of the bin and to put it back on he doesnt want a new clean nappy why is it you think he is attached to his poo and not that he just doesnt like being changed sometimes yr olds can do uncommon things to show a like or dislike for something id put my bet on him just not liking being changed than him being attached to it jmo edit ok well if you think its the poo then maybe use it as a start for potty training it sounds strange but kids go for some weird things that work when training make it a goodbye like memorial service when he poos in the toilet make it fun sing a song or something and tell him if he poo's in the toilet instead of in his diaper lol or nappy i guess youre not from the us you can say bye bye to the poo etc if you make it fun for him it might solve this problem and also help gettin him outta diapers Diaper Conker's Bad Fur Day Ron and Fez Atomic Kitten Salad Fingers Recurring South Park characters Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Elimination communication Jackass: The Movie Toilet Rugrats Social rule Shit Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet humour The Angry Beavers South Park The Curse of Fenric Family Guy Sin City Rammstein Infantilism The Marshall Mathers LP Pitaten Scenes from a Memory "Weird Al" Yankovic Captain Underpants Hey Jude Viz (comic) Infidels Pok__mon Live!
