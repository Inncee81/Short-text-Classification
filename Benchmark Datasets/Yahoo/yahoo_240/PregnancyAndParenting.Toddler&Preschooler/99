where should i put my daughters stuff animals in a small room my daughter has a small room and alot of stuff animals is there any ideas for where we should put the stuff animals in her room one thing that i found was a great idea was at my neighbour's place where they got a hammock type thing they slung up across one corner of the room and arranged all the stuffed animals in it it looked good and was easily accessible well for the parents at least maybe if your daughter would like to access the stuffed animals often you could hang the hammock lower just make sure to emphasize to her that the hammock would not be for her to lay in it would surely fall out of the wall hope this helps heather Hammock Gag (BDSM) Tent Great Teacher Onizuka The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Star Wars Holiday Special Rigging Stuffing Siegfried Line Happy Tree Friends RuneScape locations Glossary of climbing terms StarCraft: Uprising Kitchen Mattress Wilton House Care Bears Kim Possible 2000 Australian Grand Prix Neighbours Professional wrestling match types Manos: The Hands of Fate Garden Serenity (Firefly vessel) Incarnations of Immortality Sento Pentagram Columbine High School massacre Tooth enamel Make money fast Azumanga Daioh Bristol Grammar School Domesticated turkey Kasparov versus The World Kodocha Douglas Adams Theory of conduct Treehouse of Horror XIII Rathfarnham Blood (computer game) KaBlam!
