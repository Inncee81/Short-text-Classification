can any one let me know the secrect to win in limted game texas holdem please i'm sorry to say but there is no secret to playing winning poker you just have to know when you should make a play at a pot or when you should fold the more you play the more you will know what hands you should be playing in the first place that's the great thing about poker you will always get the same starting hands but you will never play them the same way and you will never have the same situation twice hands have no set value in poker so in one spot i will fold a hand like k q and in another spot i will play it for a raise playing position and playing tight aggresive poker is the way to go now there are diffrences between limit hold and no limit for sure first you will have more players in each flop because you can't bet to get others out of the pot you will also have weaker hands in each pot as well since they are getting good oods to stay in the pot most times bluffing the pot is a lot more limited and you are always getting a good price to chase draws because of this i limp a lot with a wide range of hands and if i have it i bet and if i don't i check and go away the only time i really will make a stone cold bluff on a pot is if im in good position or if i am heads up i myself play tight at limit tables but i will also play a lot more trash as well since i'll be getting a good price to do so in some spots and i can get payed off in big pots with bad hands Texas hold 'em Betting (poker) Draw poker Omaha hold 'em Poker Bluff (poker) Poker tournament Poker strategy Community card poker Stud poker Sandbagging (poker) Seven-card stud Cheating in poker Online poker T.
