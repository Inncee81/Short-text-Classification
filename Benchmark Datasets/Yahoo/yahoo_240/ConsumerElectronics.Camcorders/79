the flip video camcorder i'm wanting to get a video camera of some sort has anyone else bought the flip video camcorder and absoloutely loved it or should i just get a regular video camera from wal mart or something p thanks for the inputs oh and i have about saved up so i can't really go out and buy a camera i think it's a terrific camera the size could not be handier and to connect with your computer it has a little arm that flips up that goes right in your high speed usp port i find the videos to be clear and good sized certainly superior to any phone and the software allows you to take snapshots from your videos so it's a camera too hard to see the lcd in bright sunlight but this is no gadget it's a fine beginners camera good sound recording too i consider it money well spent Digital photography Camcorder Digital camera 8 mm video format Bluetooth Videotape Handheld game console Digital video DVD FireWire Television Beatmania IIDX Game Boy Secure Digital card High-definition television Movie camera Konica Minolta Floppy disk Betacam IBM PC compatible Game Boy Advance Computer Archos Oscilloscope DV Stereoscopy Universal Serial Bus Digital cinema Motion capture ZX Spectrum VHS IMac Back to the Future Computer and video games Pixel Sharp Zaurus JVC Mouse (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis S-VHS Camera Commodore International Videoconferencing Mobile phone Closed-circuit television IPod Photography Streaming media PlayStation Portable Warez System/36 Wal-Mart DVD-RAM Game programmer Desktop computer Surveillance Digital circuit Girls Aloud Covert listening device Hubble Space Telescope Atari 8-bit family RCA Screenshot Charge-coupled device Sega Sun Xbox 360 ITunes Film Handheld video game Nintendo DS Automatic number plate recognition PlayStation (original) Laserdisc Copy protection Amateur astronomy Walkman Digital video recorder The McGuire Sisters Traditional animation Liquid crystal display Windows Vista Fishfinder Video game developer History of computer and video games Sega Dreamcast Sound card Skateboarding trick Movie projector Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital cinematography United States Postal Service Apple Newton Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Tripod (photography) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Inspector Gadget TurboGrafx 16 Dynamic random access memory
