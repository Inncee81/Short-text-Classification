your opinion on attachment towards an adopted vs biological child hi i am wondering for pure curiosity if you think there is a difference between how parents feel towards their adopted versus biological children it seems the obvious answer would be that there is a difference just by human nature but i'm not sure i agree i worked with infants and felt such strong bonds with some of them and it taught me how easy it was to love a child regardless of whether or not it's your own also i am studying to be a social worker and will be working with prospective foster families so this is just for personal insight if you are an adoptive parent or a child either adopted or with adopted siblings i would love to hear what you have to offer on this topic thanks good question darlin' i'm a biological adoptive and foster parent i have five kids in my house right now two bio two adopted one foster they range in age from to we've had our bio kids all their lives they're two of the four teens we have obviously our foster daughter also a teen has only been in our family just shy of two weeks our adopted daughters one a teen the other have been in our family for years we're completely attached to the adopted ones just like we are our biological kids we're attaching quickly to our foster daughter also she was sitting on my lap this afternoon this evening we had a great time just snuggling i would lay down my life for any of the five without regard for whether or not they share our genetics i would walk to the ends of the earth for any of them how this plays out in my daily life is that we love care for and nurture them all we advocate for them all one has special education needs another special emotional needs another was missing some credits for graduation we needed to figure out how to help her graduate with her grade level peers this all took major advocating for them we consulted with experts we went to meeting after meeting after meeting we drove many miles getting them help and sacrificed a lot for it we got them the help and the results that they needed it was very much worth it we enjoy spending time with them and being the parents they need all of them not one over the other Abortion debate Adoption Intelligence quotient Nature versus nurture Graduate school Sexual orientation Child sexuality Infantilism Biology Motivation Autism Education in the People's Republic of China Breastfeeding Narcissism One Tree Hill (TV series) Asperger syndrome Education in the United States Child abuse Homeschooling Simone Weil Dawson's Creek Human About a Boy Grief The Giver Biology and sexual orientation Species Affirmative action Fathers' rights Parenting Saved by the Bell Foster care Hikikomori Family Social rule Spanking Education in Germany Love Theory of conduct Culture Child Altruism Polyamory Sex education Teach the Controversy Laura Schlessinger Good Times Androgen insensitivity syndrome Charter school Sexual differentiation Objectivist philosophy Sigmund Freud Happiness Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Creation-evolution controversy Autism rights movement A Course In Miracles Social work Moral Politics Intelligent design movement Human sexual behavior Race and intelligence Charles Darwin Lazarus Long Gifted Transsexuality Catechism Attachment parenting Same-sex marriage Second language acquisition Controversies in autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Biodiversity Characters of Smallville Josemar__a Escriv__ Appeal Hollyoaks Prostate cancer Developmental psychology Intelligent design Center for Science and Culture EastEnders Scientific method Social justice Deprogramming Education Mystique (comics) Extinction Justification (theology) High school T'Pol Opus Dei
