is it wise to celebrate the adoption day with adopted children my niece has had a large party for her yr old every year to celebrate the day she was adopted and calls it her heart day this year the yr old acted funny about it and my niece was wondering if she is feeling too singled out she has a new mo old brother from mommys tummy and asked if he would have a heart day the question is does this show a seperation that could make a difference in the way both children will feel i believe it is truly dependent on the family and the way the child reacts i would try to make it a family day when other non adopted children are involved spend the day doing something special as a family etc so that no one feels left out however my son is an only child and we do celebrate our welcome home day because it is special to us and we want our yr old to understand that adoption is a beautiful thing not something to be ashamed or embarrassed of we typically will spend the day doing something together have a favorite meal and he gets a small gift from mommy daddy nothing elaborate but enough to make him realize how special he is to us and our family Social rule Infantilism Family Christmas Adoption Eid ul-Fitr Passover Care Bears Garfield Escape of Charles II Birthday Whose Line Is It Anyway?
