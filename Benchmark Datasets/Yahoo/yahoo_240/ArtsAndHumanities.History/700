what is the purpose of hte indian caste system i'm doing a project and i need to know what the purpose of the caste system was the purpose or the reason the caste system is there to begin with the purpose is to keep people in their places within the rigid hierarchical structure that most of india still follows to keep untouchables doing the grunt work all their lives with no chance of finding good work in their lifetimes it is sad really that people are born into a body that determines whether or not they have a chance to make something of themselves the brahmans get educated have money and therefore get the good jobs like doctor lawyer scientist computer expert etc the lower classes are born into debt and remain in debt their whole lives the reason for that is because they do not make enough money to pay back the debt only to survive barely essentially the lowest class the untouchables are slaves religiously the caste system has to do with the belief in reincarnation if someone performs good deeds in their life they can be reborn into a more noble caste in their next life once they reincarnate as brahma the highest caste if they are good in that life they will go to nirvana basically heaven to them but much different however if you are a bad person in this life you could end up as a sheep or cow or even worse an insect in your next life the idea is that every living thing has a soul and these souls never die they just go from vessel to vessel body to body in between lifetimes only the highest souls can ascend to nirvana and not bear the suffering of inhabiting an earthly form Reincarnation Soul Indian caste system Brahmanism Heaven Karma in Hinduism Hinduism Immortality Dalit (outcaste) Brahman Advaita Vedanta Afterlife God Simone Weil Karma Bhagavad Gita Philo Religion Hell Max Weber Christian eschatology Trimurti Summa Theologiae Theosophy Adi Shankara Meaning of life Ascended master Capitalism Sri Aurobindo Lord of Light Scientology beliefs and practices Theodicy Eastern philosophy Jainism Social class Vishnu Samsara Sant Thakar Singh Pitaten Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Nicomachean Ethics Sikhism Ramanuja B.
