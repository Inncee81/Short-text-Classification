what is position of akbar's religion 'deen e elahi' in present times is there any the din i ilahi was essentially an ethical system prohibiting such sins as lust sensuality slander and pride and enjoining the virtues of piety prudence abstinence and kindness the soul was encouraged to purify itself through yearning for god a tenet of sufism islamic mysticism celibacy was condoned as in catholicism and the slaughter of animals was forbidden as in jainism there were no sacred scriptures or a priestly hierarchy in the din i ilahi in its ritual it borrowed heavily from zoroastrianism making light sun and fire an object of divine worship and reciting as in hinduism the sanskrit names of the sun in practice however the din i ilahi functioned as a personality cult contrived by akbar around his own person members of the religion were handpicked by akbar according to their devotion to him because the emperor styled himself a reformer of islam arriving on earth almost years after the prophet muhammad there was some suggestion that he wished to be acknowledged as a prophet also the ambiguous use of formula prayers common among the sufis such as allahu akbar god is most great or perhaps god is akbar hinted at a divine association as well akbar is recorded by various conflicting sources as having affirmed allegiance to islam and as having broken with islam his religion was generally regarded by his contemporaries as a muslim innovation or a heretical doctrine only two sources from his own time both hostile accuse him of trying to found a new religion the influence and appeal of the din i ilahi were limited and did not survive akbar but they did trigger a strong orthodox reaction in indian islam akbar removed the tax on hindus despite the traditional mandate in islam to tithe non believers and invited scores of religious scholars including hindus jews and christians to debate him personally in his private chambers often late into the night akbar's wives were also of different religious backgrounds each marriage was thus a strategic union that would allow the adherents of india's many faiths to feel that they too were apart of the royal household over time akbar's fascination with religion grew to almost an obsession when he fashioned his own faith called din ilahi din ilahi was an eclectic mix of the other religions akbar had studied during those late night theological debates he borrowed what he saw as the best components of each and blended them into the melange that became din ilahi the new faith however never caught on among the hindus and muslims outside of his court but despite this failure akbar continued to support religious tolerance among his people i don't hear anyactivity of this lovely religion now a days Love Theology Al-Ghazali Monotheism Sant Mat Vegetarianism History of Buddhism Great Apostasy Hindu philosophy Muslim music Fasting Marriage Satanism Reincarnation Devil Meditation Baptist Mormonism and Christianity Islam in Turkey Mantra New Testament Sin Opus Dei Mahatma Gandhi Religion in Israel Jewish views of religious pluralism Divisions of Islam Sacrifice Church of Christ Bah__'__ Faith Sharia Atheism Prophet Eschatology Soul Angel Filioque clause Persecution of Christians Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Abdul Qadir Jilani History of Hinduism Shi'a Islam United States religious history Philipp Melanchthon Criticism of Islam Apostasy Advaita Vedanta Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Indian caste system Demon Abraham Jainism Mary, the mother of Jesus Icon Protestant Reformation Islam in Indonesia Islam in Bangladesh Islam and anti-Semitism Nation of Islam Baptism
