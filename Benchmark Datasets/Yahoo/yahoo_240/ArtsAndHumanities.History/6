was lenin as bad as stalin your question calls for an examination of lenin against the benchmark of bad established by stalin that is fine by me i consider stalin on a par with hitler mao and pol pot and maybe a few others in the pantheon of horrible th century dictators my personal opinion is that lenin deserves to be on the same list of horror dictators but to be fair i acknowledge that some marxist leaning historians still cherish his memory let s summarize their pro lenin arguments first see source link for more detail good lenin arguments lenin was a highly principled idealist whose attempts to establish a socialist utopia were thwarted by right wing reactionaries and then ultimately perverted by stalin lenin took land from widely hated landowners and gave it to million oppressed peasants lenin ended huge suffering in russia when he sought and obtained peace from germany lenin wanted political self determination for all races lenin abolished the death penalty in the russian army legalized abortion and divorce and insisted on freedom of speech for the press and for ordinary citizens the reason why the bolsheviks retained power in russia was because most of the russian people firmly supported lenin now for a summary of the anti lenin arguments see source link for more detail bad lenin arguments lenin was indeed an idealist but one with utterly perverted ideals that showed no respect for human rights and liberties a master of doubletalk lenin s public pronouncements were generally for pr purposes only his actions put the lie to his words if lenin had lived longer his tyranny would have proved just as severe and brutal as that of stalin as early as lenin introduced forced slave labor as a standard economic instrument by the first slave labor concentration camps were in place the start of the gulag lenin s secret police the cheka began murdering fellow socialists social revolutionaries and mensheviks from onwards red terror reprisals against political opponents very quickly included the mass execution of hostages the so called alliance of workers and peasants was a mere slogan lenin despised russia s peasants because they stood in the way of his notions for collectivization with the injunction merciless war against the kulaks lenin unleashed the cheka and red army against farmers slaughtering hundreds of thousands lenin s anti peasant campaigns were directly responsible for the famine of in which between million and million died of starvation his words notwithstanding lenin instituted merciless persecution of religion not just the russian orthodox church but also jews catholics and muslims actions speak louder than words as far as i m concerned lenin was no better than stalin and of course without lenin s actions we d probably never have heard of stalin or mao or pol pot we might not even have heard of hitler nazism might have had much less appeal in germany but for the dread of red revolution as an alternative History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) History of socialism Nazism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socialism Workers' Party of Korea The Holocaust Conservatism NKVD Sino-Soviet split Separation of church and state Holocaust denial Liberalism Holodomor World War II Finnish Civil War Khmer Rouge The Black Book of Communism Right-wing politics Capital punishment Weimar Republic Islam as a political movement Russian history, 1892-1920 Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Red Army Vyacheslav Molotov Kulak Past and present anarchist communities Grigory Zinoviev Cheng Feng Appeal Left-wing politics Trotskyism Polish-Soviet War Anarchism in Spain Left-Right politics Religion in the Soviet Union Criticisms of communism History of Poland (1939-1945) Crime against humanity Russia Civil rights Reactionary History of Communist Albania Opus Dei Mahatma Gandhi Democratic Kampuchea Persecution of Christians Simone Weil Abortion debate Russian history, 1855-1892 Kronstadt rebellion October Revolution History of Ukraine History of Europe History of anti-Semitism Capitalism Rosa Luxemburg History of Poland (1945-1989) Kibbutz Gulag Freedom of speech History of the Jews in Poland Ture Nerman
