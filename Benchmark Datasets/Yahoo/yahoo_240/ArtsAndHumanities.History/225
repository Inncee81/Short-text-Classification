did the huns encounter racism in europe i have some theories it is known that attila the hun had once studied in rome as a hostage prince he later returned to his hunnic kingdom with a burning rage towards rome and immediately sought to conquer rome when he became king why did he have this obsessed hate towards rome could it be due to racism he experienced as a child while in rome sources describe his asian features although there were times when he treated germanic and slavic tribes cruelly there were also instances when he treated them fraternally too he proclaimed himself king of all barbarians regardless of race he even intermarried with german princesses hilda or ildico in roman but the germans later turned against his sons and grandsons claiming they were treated as slaves under the hunnic confederation maybe the germans also rebelled because they realize that mixing with the huns were changing their racial features southern germans and austrians today don't look like the northern germans racism was a lot more common back then and most people were guilty of it remember that people were enslaved based on race and most people fought for their own race at the expense of others rome was just more powerful did more damage and it was better documented i doubt they weren't any worse than the barbarians on racism Huns Ostrogoth Attila the Hun Western Roman Empire Battle of Chalons Rome: Total War Xiongnu History of Europe Slavic peoples Magyars Byzantine Empire Flavius A__tius History of the Balkans Transylvania Franks Burgundians Hungary Barbarian Migration Period Emperor Holy Roman Empire Turkic peoples Hephthalite History of Slovakia Goths Gepid History of Schleswig-Holstein Roman Kingdom Marius Scythia Romulus and Remus Nazism Jews in the Middle Ages History of West Eurasia Macedonia (region) Khazars Taranto Italian unification Middle Ages Ancient Rome Hungary before the Magyars History of Germany Medieval Croatian state Jew History of Vojvodina Kushan Empire Sassanid dynasty Hl__d Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor Roman Emperor House of Bourbon Slavery Christian Identity Migration Period art Penda of Mercia Alfred Rosenberg Roman Republic Roman Emperor (Late Empire) Alans War of the Spanish Succession Valens Colonisation Alamanni History of Hungary Celtic Christianity Anglo-Saxons History of Romania Visigoth Military history of the Roman Empire History of Albania History of Portugal Black (people) Battle of Nedao Kalemegdan Rastafari movement Wang Mang Caratacus Yuezhi Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor History of ancient Israel and Judah Artabanus II of Parthia Schleswig-Holstein Question Henry VIII of England Nationalism Serbia King of the Britons British monarchy Second Crusade George I of Great Britain Saka Pretender Marcus Licinius Crassus Lombards King Arthur (film) Hannibal Roman conquest of Britain
