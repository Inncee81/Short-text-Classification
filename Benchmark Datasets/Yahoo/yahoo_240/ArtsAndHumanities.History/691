common complication of childbirth in the early 's another research question as it seems my skills are still lacking today i need to know some common complications of childbirth in the early 's that would lead to maternal mortality again could you please provide links to verifiable sources thank you so much for your help first the political side of childbirth medicalization has its benefits but it also has created many problems for women during birth in the hospital much of the dignity was taken from childbirth women also cannot control their own health and body in a hospital women are shaved and sliced for reasons that have no real support for instance episiotomies are often performed so that a woman won't tear during birth it's like burning down your own house so someone else won't in studies women heal better and faster without episiotomies have less pain during sex months later and have more comfort in the few weeks after childbirth they are also covered up and draped so that the doctor would only see a vagina instead of the entire woman pregnant women became subjects to the patriarchal world that we live in where medicine rules over nature traditionally women have given birth squatting or standing due to the medicalization of childbirth women now are forced to give birth laying down with their feet in the air a position made popular by a rich and powerful man years ago because he wanted to stand behind a curtain and get a good look at his wife birthing their child this position allows the doctor to stand or sit without having to put much physical effort into the birth by bending his her back but the position actually makes going through the labor and childbirth more difficult for women she must push her baby in an uphill fashion going against gravity in the hospital women are usually attached to machines and monitors this is a sort of bondage for women her body is working extremely hard and she is stuck to the bed in what could be an uncomfortable position for her when women have the chance they usually prefer to walk move bathe and bend during labor and birth the reason that so many women today still have children in hospitals is because there is a lack of options the idea that a woman won't be able to take the pain and that our culture does not support home births there are fewer midwives available today and most of us still think that all births should be under a doctor's close watch in actuality midwives are just as reliable if not more for low risk women let me repeat for low risk women they spend an average of hours with women before the actual delivery while doctors spend an average of midwives are about to of the cost of doctors they perform less c sections episiotomies and other surgeries hollywood portrays only the most painful and difficult of childbirth and therefore women begin to think that they will not be able to take the pain the pain may be intense but many women today want to be alert enough to remember their delivery with the ability to sit in warm water and move around more women can deliver their children without drugs the medicalization of pregnancy is only one of the many aspects of women's health that has been turned into an illness and something that a woman can no longer control http www everything com index pl node id mostly women died from septic causes the major causes of maternal death are bacterial infection toxemia obstetrical hemorrhage ectopic pregnancy puerperal sepsis amniotic fluid embolus the substitution of doctors for midwives and of hospital delivery for home delivery did little in themselves to reduce mortality rates for mothers it was not until around when antibiotics and transfusions were introduced that a sharp reduction in the maternal mortality rate occurred in maternal mortality was about times higher than it is today and not much lower than it had been in the mid nineteenth century by world war ii however death in childbirth had been cut to its present low level http www digitalhistory uh edu historyonline childbirth cfm here you have numbers http www beverlylahayeinstitute org images content dd pdf Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Herpes simplex virus Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Publicly funded medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Gonorrhoea Psoriasis Abortion in the United States Intravenous therapy Medical analysis of circumcision Epidural Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder In vitro fertilisation Cancer Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Prenatal care Oral sex Fertility awareness Acute respiratory distress syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stomach cancer Menstrual cycle Hypoglycemia Decompression sickness Unemployment Medicare (Canada) Bipolar disorder Sickle-cell disease Obesity Oral contraceptive Equine conformation Malaria Condom Group A streptococcal infection Strap-on dildo Prenatal diagnosis Twin Cephalic disorder HIV Roe v.
