could someone tell me the real story about slavery sure as human beings began to enter organized and 'civilized' societies they realized that some indeed many of the people around them were less 'civilized' than themselves this discovery led them to turn on the people in their near vicinity and enslave them with threats of killing and beatings etc as time progressed societies continued to get more 'civilized ' they realized that if they went to a distant area and uprooted people and dragged them somewhere completely unfamiliar they would be helpless if they escaped so they started carrying people away from their homelands and enslaving them abroad to help coax them into working better and continued to beat and threaten to kill etc to encourage their slaves with the accumulated wealth from more efficient slavery societies continued to grow even more 'civilized ' they soon discovered that religion and or superstitions and promises of eternal torture etc were even more effective means of enslaving people and what worked even better was convincing them that they were free they also discovered that this could effectively do everything that uprooting slaves had done without the cost of transportation however they maintained their other means of 'encouraging' slaves so the term slave went obsolete in the most 'civilized' parts of the world and was replaced with words like vassal and surfs as the world continued becoming more 'civilized ' many of the lowest slaves began thinking about posterity and not necessarily wanting them to be slaves of this nature so the 'luxuries' afforded to the highest slaves in the past concubines also began to be afforded to the lower slaves as well and state sponsored rape became comon place as time went on and people continued getting more 'civilized' they started looking around and noticed that the slaves were very little different from their masters and were in fact often blood relatives however luckily for 'civilization's' sake this was around the time that people began exploring the broader world and wha la low and behold they found people who appeared a lot different and less civilized who also lacked sophisticated weapontry so they started uprooting them and affording to them the same 'luxuries' and 'encouragement' that they had been giving to the people they had called vassals and surfs etc as a special bonus they didn't want to dissolution these people with words that might conote even a slight amount of freedom so they started calling them slaves again as time wore on they found new and more creative forms of 'encouragement' that included more creative turtores and scientific proofs done in the presence of slaves of their own drastic inferiorty in an endeavor to disprove science slaves had the audacity to form close knit communities and verbal tradition and lore as well as music that proved that they could be as cultured if not as 'civilized ' as their masters grossly insulted science set out to prove that slaves did not posess the full range of emotion etc that was endowed to their masters these new discoveries enlightened the masters to a new form of population control whereby they continually broke up communities by selling and trading slaves numerous times in their lives eventually a few very cultured but not necessary 'civilized' people began to develope habits of getting exiled from their native countries by daring to commit the intellectual heresy of asserting the possibility that slaves were being abused and that they were very little different from other people appalled and outraged the 'civilized' world began pointing out the numerous advancements and profits that would be utterly impossible without slavery extending the life of this 'civilized' institution for perhaps another hundred years ultimately however the few people who had been getting exiled used their travel visas to their advantage and were able to become the majority of the people in many 'civilized' countries as several wars and rebellions had become popular ways of major movements to express themselves many governments in europe started sympothizing with these growing movements and with the people who were enslaved the western world began abolishing slavery throughout itself and its colonies somehow the southern united states didn't get the memo as it began to realize that it's policy was weakening the minority of americans decided to implement a policy that had a tendacy to work for majorities were voting wasn't quite state sanctioned rebellion not revolution because they sought to prevent change not cause it the north was more revolutionary i e progressive somehow this strategy didn't quite work when the numbers were against them either and the last strong hold of slavery eventually collapsed however time continued to tick and people continued to grow more 'civilized ' they continued to look for more and more ingenious ways to escape work many people found it in machines but some realized that even machines were not as capable as human beings and continued looking for entire groups of people to exploit they have found it in children and in much of the world today child slaves are subject to the exact sorts of treatment that the slaves before them have endured but generally endure the worst at a younger age even before they are capable of manual labor many children become sex slaves the real story is that slavery isn't history it has always been a systematic destruction of human lives that targets whoever has the least
