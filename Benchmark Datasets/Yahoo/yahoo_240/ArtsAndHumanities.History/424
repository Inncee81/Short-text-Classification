the industrial revolution i'm writing a story about the discovery of electricity set in the year i heard that the industrial revolution was on so i need to know the info about that year and how life was and was there merchants in thanks the invention of the battery in made possible for the first time major advances in the theories of electric current and electrochemistry both science and technology developed rapidly as a direct result leading some to call the th century the age of electricity the development of the battery was the accidental result of biological experiments conducted by luigi galvani galvani a professor of anatomy at the bologna academy of science was interested in electricity in fish and other animals one day he noticed that electric sparks from an electrostatic machine caused muscular contractions in a dissected frog that lay nearby Battery (electricity) Electricity Brain Electrostatics Industrial Revolution Baghdad Battery History of physics Electrochemistry History of science Biology Volt Tesla coil Superconductivity Charles Wheatstone William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin History of science in the Middle Ages Bologna Physics Electric motor Vacuum tube Fusion power Electric charge Lightning Benjamin Franklin Electrical breakdown Michael Faraday Petroleum Second Industrial Revolution Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Galvanic cell Directed-energy weapon Sir John Randall Joseph Henry Alessandro Volta Radio Nuclear power History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Johann Philipp Reis Gas metal arc welding Diode Hydrogen economy Current (electricity) Welding Jumpstart 3rd Grade Victoria University of Manchester Electrical engineering Electroplating Galvanization History of medicine Transformer History of radio Franz Boas STS-87 Renewable energy Sociology Polarization Nuclear reactor James Prescott Joule Hannes Alfv__n Sociocultural evolution Scientific revolution Weight training Quantum electrochemistry Technology Fran__ois Arago Late Middle Ages Capacitor Magnetic field Alexander Graham Bell Plasma cosmology Circuit design Ronald N.
