what are your thoughts on world war ii this is just a random thought that popped into my mind i would love to hear your thoughts i would like to thank all of you for taking time to answer my question most of them were quite an interesting read jim p is right except for giving france credit if anything they helped start it i think about it alot because my dad almost didn't survive and if he hadn't i wouldn't be here because he didn't marry until he came home my fil was in the worse battles and this is just the ones we know of if he hadn't survived my husband wouldn't have been here or any of his siblings even if my hubby had been alive my son and i would've both been dead because he recognized the smell of sulphur and got us out of the house safely so i often think not only of them but of all the children never born and those forced to live w o a father in a time when you were considered worthless w o both when mothers struggled in dead end jobs often two to still have to raise their kids in poverty i think of all the victims the ones they loved gone or those who lived with the scars all the children never born whole families wiped out with no one left to mourn their passing then i think of the men so brutal and cold that i hope are roasting in the deepest pits of hell they weren't crazy they were sociopaths incapable of feeling beyond appearances then i think of those in germany that allowed a man like this to be elected and france and later the league of nations who kept trying to appease them pretty much like the u n does today that let hitler gain the power he needed to do the damage he did but most of all i'm thankful that there were good men both civilian and soldier who saw the wrong and stood up to it often at the risk of their own lives men with the strength of character that couldn't sit back and do nothing alot of stuff happened on both sides that were wrong but sometimes i think the moral high ground has more to do with lives saved than the action taken itself war is hell but if you set a high standard for yourself while the enemy has a anything goes attitude then how can you win kamakazee fighters were like today's suicide bombers but the difference was their targets were other fighters not innocent civilians that's what makes the difference between an honorable soldier or militant if you wish and a terrorist in any war there is collateral damage that often can't be helped but to target innocents is cowardly and deserves no respect or rewards well guess i'll get off my soapbox but you did ask lol Theory of conduct Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Zhao Yun Sin City Diablo II Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Suicide bombing Cindy Sheehan Kurt Cobain Polish September Campaign Knots Landing Assassination Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scenes from a Memory Rais massacre Daredevil Operation Market Garden Theodicy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Time Out of Mind Hillary Rodham Clinton Simone Weil Total war Strategic bombing Evil Yusuf al-Qaradawi Blood (computer game) Second Battle of the Atlantic Abortion debate Pitaten Serial killer Kodocha Continuation War Incarnations of Immortality Justification (theology) Married... with Children Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Alignment (role-playing games) Night (book) Ten Commandments StarCraft: Uprising Poker jargon Days of our Lives Joke Wolfrider Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Piccolo Junior Saga Yoko Ono A Course In Miracles Noam Chomsky Battle of the Bulge Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sons of Korhal Yasser Arafat Luftwaffe Jean Grey War New York Giants Bombing of Dresden in World War II Winter War One Tree Hill (TV series) Appeasement Samurai Deeper Kyo Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Good Times Jon Secada EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Akuma (Street Fighter) 2004 Republican National Convention RAF Bomber Command Professor X John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Major League Baseball television contracts Neighbours Friends Boston Public Kain (Legacy of Kain) Warsaw Uprising Capital punishment Luminoth The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Contender (television series) Guilty Gear Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope South Park Son Goku (Dragon Ball)
