tell me a bout hitler in words hitler the rise of evil the saga of the rise of hitler is that of a frenzied and preposterous ambition that plunged the entire world in brutal war for almost a decade only an army corporal in world war i hitler rose through the ranks and his thirst for power was only quenched after he ascended to the post of chancellor of germany years later his rambling and immensely emotional autobiography mein kampf reveals everything about his noticeably unstable early life hitler was born adolf g hitler in austria his father wanted him to study for a government job but the thought of slogging in an office made hitler sick he yearned to be an artist and practiced water colour painting but he achieved little later on he approached the vienna art academy but he was rejected and labeled untalented failure dogged him all these humbling experiences flamed his discontent for his patchwork country austria he looked across the border to magnificent germany flourishing with an unending flow of wealth and blooming with unhindered development hitler's hatred of poverty his rabid and radical devotion to his german heritage and his bigoted loathing of jews combined to form the seeds of his later successful political doctrine hitler left wretched vienna for munich a true german town there he drifted from job to job as carpenter architect's draftsman and watercolorist always he ranted about his political ideas during world war i he gave up his austrian citizenship and enlisted himself in the german army he was a remarkably brave soldier and his unflinching gallantry won him the iron cross unfortunately for him germany was defeated and he landed up in an infirmary temporarily blinded my mustard gas having renounced his austrian citizenship and yet to become a german citizen hitler was now a man without a country in the aftermath of the war munich was caught in a political tirade officers like hitler were used as political spies this marked the turning point of hitler s life on one such cold night of spying hitler guided by intuition ended up as the seventh member of a meeting around a broken gas lamp it consisted of a motley group of army officers painters artisans and crafts men who nursed one ambition ruling germany hitler soon took control of this faction this diverse group went on to become the distinguished nazi party with hitler as its leader the party began to garner supporters hitler s voice torn and hoarsened by mustard gas was hypnotic his audience just remained spell bound he indeed was an effective speaker sneering at the liberal generalities of the various bourgeois parties and hating the communists hitler shouted accusations against the jews and cried out to the germans to form an all powerful national state the flamboyant spirit of the growing nazi party now began to attract the varied restless men who were to become its core the party grew in strength in terms of followers it grew so politically powerful that it started thinking of overthrowing the government well this is precisely what hitler did he with the backing of the brutal nazis attacked a government meeting in a beer hall and tried to seize the reins of governance but he miserably failed accused of high treason and found guilty hitler was thrown in prison due to the immense public uproar his term of sentence was reduced to eight months it was during his time at prison that he wrote the epic mein kampf with the help of the loyal rudolf hess hitler emerged from prison to the roaring applause of the people it was blatantly apparent that he undeniably was a demi god for them after serving his term in captivity he remarked that it would take years for him to rekindle the flame of passion in the hearts of the people what he said was true at the time of his release germany was prospering and revolutions don t flourish in prosperity in a world wide depression hit germany poverty grief and hardship was staring the germans the nazis underwent regeneration they were back stronger than ever this time with the persistent support of the communalists and army personnel the blatant supremacy of the nazis was inevitable hitler was appointed the chancellor of germany and from then onwards he started striving towards his goal of global conquest his quest for power ultimately ended when he rose to become the dictator of germany chief instigator of world war ii hitler was also the master mind behind the mass genocide of jews called holocaust as all of us know germany was finally defeated in ww ii and hitler committed suicide ending a sort of legend in a very desolate fashion among germans during his time hitler was considered as a super man nazi propaganda had made of hitler a symbol of strength and national virtue his indecisions were cloaked as intuition despite his hours and even days of brooding inertia he was pictured as a man of intense action he became idolized by young germans covering his unsavory and cruel character propaganda built a legend of his ascetic habits and selfless devotion to germany after all that i have written above i can indubitably state that hitler through his life and times can be considered as an epitome of sinister malevolence and malicious wickedness though an excellent orator and courageous combatant i feel that hitler could have done much better had he channelized his talents in any other constructive field hitler through his life showed the world that even one man with a strong will can make a world of difference Participants in World
