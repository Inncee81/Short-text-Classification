here is the second part of the introduction to my novel what do you think mario hernandez ran up the hill how lovely it was when they had been told they'd been specially selected for relocation he had no idea he glanced down at his wife pilar she was struggling up the hill with their third child pedro antonio the family had fallen on hard times he had been laid off from his job at the bank when his boss had called him into his office mario had thought it had been for a promotion instead it was a pink slip after half a year of living on savings and a loan from his parents mario had to sell his house he moved his family into saint christopher's shelter one room was all they got but everyone had their own bed mario was ready to embrace the homeless life when two men visited the shelter they promised a better way of life with a job and housing mario quickly signed his family up for the government program here's the rest mario looked back at his wife miguel his eldest child was helping little cameron to navigate the hill his wife was almost to him pilar finally reached the top huffing while pedro giggled in her arms she looked around and frowned it's beautiful mario but where are the houses she started to put pedro down but instead fell on top of the toddler pilar mario rushed to her side he rolled her over and saw blood his lips trembled as he felt her neck no pedro was lying still the back of his head a bloody pulp feeling naseas mario looked wildly around for his children miguel was lying on the ground the side of his face a crimson gory mass mario started to shake when he felt a hand grasp his leg it was little cameron he stood up and lifted his daughter he held her tightly as he started to run down the other side of the hill if he could only save her a bullet ended that thought his daughter lay limply besides him this is the last sentence the last sight he saw was of a man in a beret and carrying a rifle run up to him and bend down the last thing he heard was an old man laugh now i know that you won't get this this is set in the future which you would read on the book jacket and the title of the novel is 'thinning out' a reader wouldn't be able to get all the information in the introduction but if you continue to read it all makes sense this was a fun thing to do and i hope you like it there are some grammar mistakes i have pointed out some of the mistakes so you could revise your draft when his boss had called him into his office mario had thought it had been for a promotion should be a semicolon and not a comma after the word promotion one room was all they got but delete the comma after but everyone had their own bed the correct sentence should be one room was all they got but everyone had their own bed pilar use either a question mark or an exclamation mark but never use both mario rushed to her side his lips trembled as he felt her neck no pedro was it pedro or pilar was lying still the back of his head his or her head who are you referring to in a bloody pulp or with a bloody pulp it would be better if you could make it clearer who's got the head injured his or her referring to who feeling naseas spelling error it should be nausea mario looked wildly around for his children overall it is okay but i couldn't give more opinions on the story as it bits and pieces from the whole work Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Alex Ferguson Aerial (dance move) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eddie Guerrero EastEnders Suplex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing New York Giants Professional wrestling attacks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Super Mario 128 Muslim ibn Aqeel Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Blood on the Tracks Scenes from a Memory The Contender (television series) Punctuation Miss Saigon Pittsburgh Steelers The Death Gate Cycle Charmed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Skateboarding trick The Catcher in the Rye Plame affair Cleveland Browns Piledriver (professional wrestling) English grammar Phoebe Halliwell Friends Equine conformation Avenue Q Kasparov versus The World Shawn Michaels Paul Is Dead Mario Lemieux Piccolo Junior Saga Carolina Panthers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) St. Julian's San Antonio Spurs Whose Line Is It Anyway?
