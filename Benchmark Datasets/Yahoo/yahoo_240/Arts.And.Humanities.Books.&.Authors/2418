harry potter plot hole spoiler alert is it just me or was there a huge plot hole in hp near the end when voldemort is hunting down his horcruxes he thinks that there is no way anyone else could have found the room of requirment where he hid the diadem but in hp malfoy used the room of requirment to smuggle death eaters into hogwarts and he got the idea from when harry potter used the room for his da meetings so how could voldemort not know about the fact that hogwarts students mainly harry potter were more than aware about the existence of the room good answers but some things are still not clear the thing is when voldemort used the room it was in the same aspect lost things as the room that malfoy was using and considering the difficulty in getting into hogwarts don't you think voledemort would be extremely interested in how malfoy managed to get past hogwarts normal magical defenses also i think voldemort was aware of the unusual powers of the room i can't recall the exact line but there was something about the 'amazing room' or something along that line which says to me he knew the rooms secrets since he readily admits he uncovered more of the secrets of hogwarts than any other student i think this was lack of good writing quality we know from from book when harry enters the room of requirement to hide the half blood prince's potions book that there are centuries and centuries worth of hidden items therefore i don't know how riddle voldemort could have thought that nobody could have know about the room if there were already lots and lots of things in there perhaps we can pass this off to voldemort's arrogance we already know that he was stupid enough to use harry's blood to regenerate himself in gof without considering the consequences we know that voldemort would not take any of harry's statements about how harry is the rightful owner of the elder wand seriously when harry was in his final confrontation with voldemort and we know that that voldemort disregarding harry's information about the wand was quite stupid given the history of the wand we know voldemort was stupid to think that nobody would be able to penetrate the cave especially since he used kreacher Diagon Alley Death Eater Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hogwarts subjects Ginny Weasley Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter: Book Seven Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rubeus Hagrid Draco Malfoy Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone House-elf Horcrux Horace Slughorn Hermione Granger James and Lily Potter Tom Riddle's diary Neville Longbottom Harry Potter Hogwarts Floor Directory Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Sirius Black Hogwarts Houses Minor Hufflepuffs Tom Riddle Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ministry of Magic Lucius Malfoy Dark Art Wizarding world Order of the Phoenix Weasley family Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Remus Lupin Rita Skeeter Minor Ravenclaws Bellatrix Lestrange Regulus Black Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Dumbledore's Army Nymphadora Tonks Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Sybill Trelawney Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Dolores Umbridge Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dark Mark Cho Chang Narcissa Malfoy Unbreakable Vow Fawkes Cedric Diggory Triwizard Tournament Legilimency Magic (illusion) Minerva McGonagall Half-Blood Prince (character) Grimmauld Place Beauxbatons Professor Quirrell Knockturn Alley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries RuneScape quests Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Peter Pettigrew Minor characters associated with Quidditch The Hogwarts Founders Hogwarts Express Ordinary Wizarding Level Hogwarts ghosts Minor Hogwarts teachers Kain (Legacy of Kain)
