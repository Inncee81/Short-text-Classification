does anyone else share my opinion that the book moby dick is just horrible i am currently reading moby dick and i am about half way through it and don't know if i can or want to finish it i think i would rather pull out a tooth than finish but all the reviews that i have read including my wife's say how great the book is so i want to finish does it get better in the second half or should i just cut my losses and rent one of the movie versions instead i love moby dick and re read it constantly but it is a novel for slow enjoyment and is written for the sort of reader who enjoys a particular kind subtle jokes a heavy dose of philosophical pondering and methods of storytelling and characterization that are now out of fashion if you're the sort of reader who reads mostly for the story and not also for the texture of how the story is told i'd suggest that you cut your losses the essential plot of moby dick could be told in a tenth the number of pages a movie version will tell you the story without all of the philosophy humor and speculation about the nature of whales by the way my answer might sound judgmental as if i'm saying you just don't get it but reading tastes and the things we read for are as varied as our tastes in ice cream someone who prefers moby dick to a novel by john grisham is no more superior than someone who prefers cherry ice cream to chocolate and the appeal of an author can be unique to that author not liking the humor or philosophy of melville doesn't mean you don't like humor or philosophy it just means that melville's methods don't do anything for you speaking as someone who does love moby dick finishing a book that you aren't enjoying seems like a waste of time to me there are so many books that would be to your taste and life is short Moby-Dick Herman Melville Narrator Novel Aesthetics Humphrey Bogart Sperm Whale The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Philosophy Little Britain Ray Bradbury Mary Poppins Will Eisner Meaning of life Deconstruction Anne Rice A Series of Unfortunate Events Literature of the United States Storytelling The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) George Orwell Theory of conduct Philip K.
