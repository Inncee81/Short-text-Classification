can anyone recommend anything by h p lovecraft i'd like something particularly lovecraftian to start with as i'm an h p virgin i'm more inclinded towards fantasy fiction rather than ghost or horror stories so anything leaning in that direction would be best cheers folks to be honest i am not a big lovecraft fan i appreciate his importance and influence more than i have enjoyed actually reading his work still even if you wind up feeling the same way it's good to have some familiarity with him if you read fantasy or horror he's referenced ripped off all the time my favorite lovecraft story is probably pickman's model it's about a painter who creates some truly disturbing images and where he gets his ideas pickman is one of lovecraft's best known stories along with the colour out of space lovecraft's personal favorite of all his stories a science fiction story about a family destroyed by an alien substance to understand the oft references cthulhu mythos you should read the call of cthulhu and the dunwich horror dunwich has about as close as lovecraft ever came to a happy ending there are many more related stories but these are good starters they all deal with the idea that ancient alien beings once ruled the earth like gods but are currently inactive they are still worshiped by human cults and could awaken at any time the shadow over innsmouth is also a major lovecraft story dealing with these themes it's a novella involving a hybrid race of fish people not pretty mermaids and those old gods under the sea all of lovecraft's work that i'm familiar with is much more horror sci fi than fantasy he often has aliens in his stories and in his writing aimed to portray truly alien aliens not aliens that acted like kind of weird humans his human characters often wind up driven mad by their encounters with these horrifying and powerful alien beings Cthulhu Necronomicon Cthulhu mythos reference codes and bibliography Ramsey Campbell Deep One (Cthulhu mythos) Arthur Machen Old Ones Cthulhu mythos arcane literature Great Old Ones Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game) Dagon Science fiction film Arkham Stephen King Great Old Ones compendium Frank Belknap Long Nyarlathotep The Call of Cthulhu Yog-Sothoth Science fiction Abduction Phenomenon Fan fiction The Shadow over Innsmouth The Dunwich Horror Motif of harmful sensation Azathoth Robert Bloch Horror fiction Alone in the Dark (series) Conan the Barbarian Ancient astronaut theory Marvel Universe Fantasy subgenres At the Mountains of Madness Ghoul Fritz Leiber Cthulhu mythos biographies Elder Gods (Cthulhu mythos) Unidentified flying object H.P.
