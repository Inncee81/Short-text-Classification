if you've read a murder is announced by agatha christie did u like it i just read this one a couple of weeks ago i liked it well enough but it's not one of my favorites it takes a while for miss marple to arrive on the scene one major plot twist seemed far fetched to me and another i saw coming hundreds of pages in advance i'd consider this a middling miss marple mystery not one of the best still i probably would have enjoyed it more if not for the way the character of the central european housekeeper mitzi was treated in a book this old it's not surprising to have ethnic stereotypes that now seem offensive but i think christie went too far in this case mitzi often mentions how much she suffered during the war and how her entire family was killed by the nazis and christie seems to intend for the reader to find this amusing yuck Agatha Christie Miss Marple Sleeping Murder Whodunit Hercule Poirot Joan Hickson Murder, She Wrote Detective fiction The Mirror Crack'd And Then There Were None The Moving Finger Crime film Murder by Death The Murder of Roger Ackroyd Crime fiction CPU cache Dorothy L.
