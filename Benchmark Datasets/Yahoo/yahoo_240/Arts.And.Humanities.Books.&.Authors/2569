would you read a book about this c'mon take a look at least about a fourteen year old girl who is infatuated with mysteries and detective books and movies her family is very rich but all the members in her family are sort of weird after some time a real mystery pops up when the life of one of her brothers is threatened the killer is probably one of the brother's seven friends who come to stay with them for the holidays this killer comes up with several original ways to kill the brother for example the killer brings in poisonous wood and lights the fireplace in the brother's room with it the windows are closed and the fire goes on all night while the brother sleeps this could kill him but he survives because someone breaks into his room early in the morning long story but the brother manages to escape every time the police have a hard time believing that these are all cases of attempted murder because they are very unusual and dismiss the whole thing saying that it's just these rich people making mountains out of molehills this book is narrated in first person by the girl in a very informal manner the narration is very humorous in bits it begins with dear nosey reader you are likely to find this piece of writing when i am dead and gone for i intend to keep it well hidden until i reach the age of seventy after which according to science i might die anytime so when you find this note that the person you will start reading about is not in this world anymore therefore if you find my ramblings uninteresting for some reason i cannot imagine it is best that you tolerate them because it would give much peace to my spirit and also because i will surely haunt you if you ever call my memoirs boring note it s not my book i m doing this for a friend i can t write to save my life if you want to read more of it contact my friend at cagla yahoo com cheers jingles thanks for giving a proper honest opinion how would you change that paragraph then if i was a young teenager it would appeal to me Sin City The Lovely Bones The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death Note EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crime fiction Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Theory of conduct Days of our Lives American Psycho W.I.T.C.H.
