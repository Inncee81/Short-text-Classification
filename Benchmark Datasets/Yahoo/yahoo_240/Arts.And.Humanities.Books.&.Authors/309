your thoughts on the deathly hallows did you love it hate it did things happen that you didn't expect or things you expected to happen that didn't let's hear your thoughts on the last book of the famous harry potter series me i thoroughly enjoyed reading it because there were plenty of shocking moments like after the chase to the tonks' house when the chapter was titled fallen warrior i really thought hagrid was dead at the beginning and i was thoroughly upset or when hermione got tortured bellatrix decided to do it so suddenly it was a shock but the ending was too fairy tale if you know what i mean the good guy won and got the girl and i was convinced that harry would sacrifice himself to defeat voldemort the last few chapters made it sound like that and neither ron nor hermione died i was expecting throughout the entire book for one of them to die so your thoughts i can't believe so many of you are satisfied by this fairy tale ending i mean i didn't want harry just killed and voldemort was the winner but it would have been cool and stuck in my mind more if they had some epic climactic battle and they ending up killing themselves but instead now my children will ask me what happened in the end and i'll say oh he won in the end that's it i agree the ending was a little too corny for me but then there aren't many girls of harry's age around to marry so he's pretty limited god knows why he called the kid albus severus when he hated for years and years stuff like that wouldn't just be forgotten i don't think Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Blood purity (Harry Potter) Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Magic (Harry Potter) Death Eater Dates in Harry Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts subjects Ginny Weasley Order of the Phoenix Rubeus Hagrid Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Albus Dumbledore Severus Snape Hogwarts Houses Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Horace Slughorn R.A.B.
