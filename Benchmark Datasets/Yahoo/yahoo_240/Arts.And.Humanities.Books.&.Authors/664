is the hitchiker's guide to the galaxies a good book series my teacher recommended it to me and said it's really funny is he right yes what he said was the most right est thing anybody has ever said those books are hilarious my advice though is too read them one right after the other don't read other books or you'll be completely cofused when you read the next one because they get a little confusing alot between books The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Douglas Adams The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as international phenomenon The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series) Marshall McLuhan The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Neil Gaiman The Giver Hitchhiking Hilary Swank Harry Potter The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Beat generation Joke C.
