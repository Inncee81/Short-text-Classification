feedback on this story intro i'd like some feedback on this introduction prologue for my story grammatical storyline level of interestingness etc prologue twice upon a time there thrived a most mysterious forest a very peculiar forest it was for death had no power upon it yet in this forest lay a pedestal and in this pedestal lay the key to life and to death many a cruel hand had tried to use this pedestal for evil but it was brilliant in its design for it only opened itself to those with good intentions this pedestal had but one flaw only the presence of one innocent being was required for access to the treasure inside here's chapter one http answers yahoo com question index ylt al ucwgoqmzts qh a mmvsy ix qid aabafbt i disagree about the other posters' criticism of the so called repetition those sentences present two different pieces of information you're saying that only those with good intentions can open the pedestal so evil people are according to the design barred from opening it however in the next sentence you explain that an evil person could indeed open the pedestal by using an innocent being this second bit of information i assume sets up your conflict an innocent being who is used by an evil one to gain access to the pedestal i think the prologue sets up the conflict very well it does make the reader want to know what happens next grammatically i would suggest revising the sentences that contain dashes three sentences with dashes in one paragraph dilutes the power of the pause i think you should keep the first one make the second one a comma and the third one a colon your use of twice upon a time is intriguing provided that the phrase serves a purpose in the plot it sounds as if the forest had two periods of thriving and yet in the second sentence you say that the forest could not die that makes the twice upon a time phrase seem nonsensical and just a bit of trite cleverness on the other hand if the twice upon a time serves a purpose in the plot it's a brilliant way to start a story Quotation mark The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shadow the Hedgehog English grammar Extreme Programming Theodicy Slashdot subculture Modem HTTP cookie Slashdot trolling phenomena Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Stuttering Scientology beliefs and practices Second language acquisition Link (Legend of Zelda) Grammatical mood Book of Job Evil Goodness and value theory Meaning Wario Translation Noam Chomsky Computer Master Sword Figure of speech Joke Intelligent design Gender-neutral language American and British English differences CPU cache Torture Storytelling Authorship of the Pauline epistles Supergirl Shaggy dog story Little Shop of Horrors Legacy of Kain Morse Code IBM PC compatible Bayesian inference Royal Assent I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Life insurance Nicomachean Ethics X86 Judicial review Alignment (role-playing games) Plame affair Xenosaga Atheism Resurrection of Jesus G-Man (Half-Life) Watchmen RISC Originalism Operational amplifier Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword House of Leaves Documentary hypothesis Wikipedia Doctor (Doctor Who) Augustus De Morgan Assassination Singlish Time travel GED Socrates Objectivist philosophy The Wheel of Time Discworld Chinese language Dictionary Incarnations of Immortality Nonsense Creation science Concerto Macbeth God and gender Baldur's Gate series Electrophysiology Philo Secret of Mana Life imprisonment Ajax (programming) Unlawful combatant Pleonasm Capital punishment E-mail spam
