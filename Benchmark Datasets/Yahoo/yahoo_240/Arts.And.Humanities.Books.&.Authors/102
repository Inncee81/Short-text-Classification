how much do authors make when hey publish a book how much do authors make when hey publish a book i mean how many percent goes to the editor agent publisher and all that and how much remains for the author technically speaking authors are only payed a percentage of the profits of the book when it's sold this is why the money an author receives prior to publication is called an advance it is a flat amount that the publishing house gives to the author no matter how well or how poorly the book sells it's usually in installments a bit on signing the contract on turning in a draft that is accepted by the editors as ready to go into the copy editing process and a chunk on publication an author publisher contract will outline what percentage of the book price belongs to the author for authors just starting out the percentage begins around of each book sold but can begin at up to or more for more bankable proven authors i say begins because this percentage is often on a sliding scale the percentage of the book price an author receives usually increases with the numbers of books sold for example an author may receive of the sales from to books from to books sold and on books sold from copies and beyond so an advance is really just a bit of the projected profits that the publishing house is willing to pay upfront a bit that they cannot take back no matter how few books are sold that said future payments or royalties are only payed to the author when the publishing house has recovered that advance they calculate the author's percentage of every book sold and apply that bit to the amount they've already paid out for first time authors the publishing house will often make the first print run of the book a break even print this means that if all the books printed sell the author's advance will be recovered by the publishing house but royalties for the author above that amount will be impossible unless the book goes into another print run to make this a little less confusing i'll outline the math with an example the author gets word from her agent that the publishing house wants to give her a advance woo hoo she signs an author publisher contract with the following parameters on books on books on books and beyond the publishing house pays the author of her advance on signing the contract the publishing house pays her of her advance when she hands in a manuscript that the editors are happy with the publishing house decides to print copies of a book that will cost the publishing house pays her when the book hits bookstores the book sells through meaning it sells out of all printed copies but the publishing house decides not to print any more the book has sold copies the author's percentage would be for the first books and on the second books that means that the publishing house has recouped their advance to the author and banked less production costs now a word on agents our intrepid author would never have made contact with the publishing house if it hadn't been for her agent her agent receives of everything the author receives some more established authors negotiate an agent percentage closer to to in fact the publishing house sends the money to the agent the agent takes his percentage and then sends a check to the author meaning when all is said and done the author actually receives before taxes i know all this because i am a published author with several agents publishers and books sold hope it helps Publishing Vanity press Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Inflation Insurance Mutual fund Tax Annuity Self-publishing Internet fraud Screenplay Supply and demand Life insurance Credit card Copyright Oxford English Dictionary United Kingdom corporation tax Estoppel Contract FairTax United States Postal Service Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus U.S. public debt Textbook Article One of the United States Constitution Illegal drug trade Fawcett Publications Flat tax Economy of Russia Money Islamic banking Public domain Salary cap Video game crash of 1983 Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Value added tax Capital accumulation Intellectual property Nuclear power Economy of the United States Ra (board game) American individualist anarchism Poker jargon Progressive tax Unemployment Video game publisher Labor theory of value Social Security (United States) CPU design Short selling Social Security debate (United States) Margin of error Book Surplus value Kyoto Protocol PE ratio Open access Economic inequality Privatization Gold standard Divorce Oil-for-Food Programme Finance Wal-Mart Public good National Football League Oakland Athletics Airline Publicly funded medicine Productive and unproductive labour Commodity markets CPU cache Fair use Encyclop__dia Britannica Monopoly (game) Newspaper Hey Jude E85 Minimum wage Gambling Externality Peer review First-sale doctrine Mortgage
