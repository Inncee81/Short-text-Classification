who wants howard shore to compose the music for deathly hallows i do on the contrary mmg the music matters very much in conveying the emotions of a film if there was not music in a film you would not become as involved with the story knight i love john williams themes like hedwig's theme the indiana jones theme the star wars theme they are always memorable but the rest of the score tends to be redundant i think howard could really capture the epic proportions of this book and write beautiful pieces of music through the whole movie i still wish james newton howard had done the earlier films except then we wouldn't have hedwig's theme so maybe i don't but really i'll probably be happy with any composer that isn't patrick doyle goblet of fire omg i hate that soundtrack he throws in crecendo's at every dramatic moment and it just makes it so cheesy sounding no offense to shore but i'd rather see john williams return to compose the music for the last two movies shore did a good job with the lord of the rings trilogy and philidelphia but i find williams compositions more memorable Film score Film soundtrack Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Academy Award for Original Music Score Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John Williams (composer) Patrick Doyle James Newton Howard Jerry Goldsmith James Bond music Grammy Awards of 2005 Storytelling Spartacus (film) John Barry (composer) Ewoks: The Battle for Endor Star Wars Trilogy Indiana Jones Soundtrack Blade Runner Philip Glass Raiders of the Lost Ark The Amber Spyglass The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Literature Rodgers and Hammerstein Der Ring des Nibelungen Babylon 5 Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Anne Rice Magnolia (film) Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope George Lucas Bernard Herrmann Classical music era The Mary Tyler Moore Show Humphrey Bogart Shakespeare on screen James Bond Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade You Only Live Twice Little Shop of Horrors Diamonds Are Forever The Chronicles of Narnia Musical film Poetry Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi 2001: A Space Odyssey Aladdin (1992 film) Koji Kondo Films that have been considered the greatest ever High fantasy Alfred Hitchcock Sonata (music) John Updike Lost in Space Tom and Jerry (MGM) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Bj__rk Jim Steinman Gosford Park Michael Land The Lord of the Rings Musical mode Romantic music Parsifal Robert Schumann Harry Potter Baroque music Johann Sebastian Bach The High and the Mighty (film) AFI 100 Years series Monday Night Football The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy Final Fantasy music They Might Be Giants Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Arthur Machen Quincy Jones The Art of Noise 1957 World Series 10 Things I Hate About You Dr. No Brian Jones (musician) Cincinnati Bengals Video game music Harry Potter (character) Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Spy Who Loved Me Mary Poppins Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Science fiction film The World Is Not Enough Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Leonard Cohen Music genre The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)
