i am confused as to what the real climax of a separate peace is i've had suspiscions of the climax for this book either being finny falling from the tree or the interrogation with brinker i have been hearing both and i don't know which one it really is just in case i've read the book finny falling from the tree led to the interrogation with brinker which led to finny storming off and breaking his leg again in the process which led to the operation which killed him by accident which led figuratively to gene sort of becoming finny or taking finny's place gene becoming finny is the resolution so what happens before that that makes the resolution finny's death which was after the operation which resulted from finny falling which was because he was fleeing the interrogation so the interrogation is the climax because the main events led up to it and then it leads to the events before the resolution and the resolution thats what i think anyway A Separate Peace T'Pol Zahra Kazemi The Bunker Project MKULTRA John Sheridan (Babylon 5) English grammar Dispensationalism Act of Parliament Iran Air Flight 655 FOXHOUND Heinrich M__ller Beslan school hostage crisis UN Security Council Resolution 242 Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution End times German grammar Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Safety engineering Miranda warning Gulf War Deadpool Mediation Glen Jacobs Henry Lee Lucas Air traffic control Professional wrestling holds Birth control Polymerase chain reaction International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Conscientious objector The Amber Spyglass Grandfather paradox History of Israel Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mutation Syphon Filter PostScript 24 (television) Hash table Seymour Hersh Natural disaster Books in Canada First Novel Award Cyprus dispute Hearsay Taxi Driver Neil Gaiman Ulic Qel-Droma Angel Sanctuary Knots Landing United Nations Protection Force Gene Gene Wolfe Terrorism Ages of Myst The Death Gate Cycle The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Professional wrestling throws Columbo Shabak Norwegian Campaign The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Apoptosis Ayyavazhi mythology The Champions Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Political status of Taiwan Day of the Daleks Srebrenica massacre RISC World Series English verbs Randomness Witch-hunt Finnish grammar 613 mitzvot 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Natural law University of Houston Battlestar Right to silence Town meeting Professional wrestling slang Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Darfur conflict The Trial The Five Doctors Mirror Universe (Star Trek) Cell (biology) D'ni timeline It's Walky!
