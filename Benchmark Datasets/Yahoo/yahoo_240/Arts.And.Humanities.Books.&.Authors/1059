title for a story ok i am bored and started writing a story about humanity's future war with an alien race kind of like halo but not really i was wondering what i should call it it takes place in alien group is called the allegiance any thoughts and o ya if u want give me some ideas for a good story line imagine this friendly aliens come to warn the coming of another alien race ready to destroy and enslave the human race the friendly aliens leave obscure warning signs to humans the humans read the warning signs and somewhat understand them the friendly aliens decide to come to earth to help prepare earth's humans and want to give counsul and advice when the friendly aliens arive they are met by armed forces who immediatly shoot down all the friendly aliens the irony of the story would be that the signs told the humans to ready themselves for an evil alien race coming to destroy them when the friendly aliens show themselves the humans would think them to be the evil ones from the warnings and kill them off subsequently the true aliens from the warnings come by and the prophecy that is foretold in the warnings comes true you could base the title around the word warning or prophesize God Emperor of Dune The Dalek Invasion of Earth Extraterrestrial life in popular culture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an John Sheridan (Babylon 5) War of the Worlds (television) The Invisibles Alien races from the Godzilla films End times Death Comes to Time Alien invasion 343 Guilty Spark Tenshinhan Destroy All Humans!
