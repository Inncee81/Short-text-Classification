is this allowed i recently bought a book while i was looking in the store inventory i noticed there was a book of the exact same title but different author the other one didn't have a description but i know they were different the covers were different too i thought it was illegal yes it is titles cannot be copyrighted there are many books that have the same title it isn't necessarily the best choice for an author and publisher but it is done most of the time if the author suggests a title that is already used the publisher will change it especially if the other book is a bestseller pax c Copyright Publishing Public domain Video game crash of 1983 GNU Free Documentation License Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act New York Times bestseller list Book Ebook Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism L.
