disappointed with the final harry potter book was anyone else or is it just me personally i thought the ending was crap a pathetic and lazy ending to a battle which has been anticipated for years voldemort's wand kills him god how stupid the ending was crap in fact the whole book was quite crap the battle was just weak and stupid with so many deaths but not knowing how they died in fact the battle at the end of the th book was weaker than the battle at the end of the th book at least that one had some meaning the whole book had holes in it all over the place like who was the person that j k said would perform magic who wasn't supposed to that never happened the nineteen years later chapter was just a lot of rubbish because although there did need to be a chapter saying what happed to everyone it should have been sooner after the battle j k rushed that chapter snd it wasn't thorough enough it didn't mention the rest of the main characters and it didn't say whsy everyone does for jobs or where they are living like i said and like you said crap Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Ron Weasley Severus Snape Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Albus Dumbledore Hogwarts subjects Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter: Book Seven Dates in Harry Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Craps Blood purity (Harry Potter) Year of the Spider Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter Piccolo Junior Saga Death Eater Ginny Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Rubeus Hagrid R.A.B.
