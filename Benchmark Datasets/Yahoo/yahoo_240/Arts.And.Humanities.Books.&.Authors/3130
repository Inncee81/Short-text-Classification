why is elizabeth so anxious to distrust mr darcy and to trust mr wickham from jane austen's pride and prejudice because when just after they were introduced she heard him tell mr bingham who had said my there are allot of lovely ladies here tonight mr darcy answered something like i supposed so if you like that type or something similiar kind of a back handed compliment like 'if you like countrygirls i guess so ' also when asked about jane he said she was only tolerable upsetting her so later at the same dance when he asks her to dance she says something like sure if you like your partners only tolerable so he knew she overheard him the problem with the couple was she the one without money and thought of herself as educated was both prideful and prejudiced as was mr darcy each thinking that their way of life was better because of either loving families or other things when they should have just been happy for being happy both thinking that their money or lack of it made for better breeding and the love in their family tighter and brought them closer together both thinking that they should approve or disapprove of the wives and husbands of others but not listen when others do the same for them etc jane thinking that rich people could only be shallow and vain mr darcy for thinking country people could only be loud and rude etc so after arguing with him she wanted to believe the worst of him and along comes mr wickham and his story of the rectory and who wouldn't love a man who gets denied the chance to serve god what a rich story but if you actually listen to what wickham tells her in the book he tells her that the rectory was worth so many thousand pounds a year not about serving there or actually working there but how much money it would bring in Pride and Prejudice Pride and Prejudice (BBC) Jane Austen EastEnders Knots Landing Metonymy Shaggy dog story Friends Miss Saigon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct Novel The Inside Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Le Malade imaginaire Humphrey Bogart Book of Isaiah William Wycherley Sense and Sensibility Neighbours Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Jude Philosophical skepticism Meaning of life Ayyavazhi mythology Muslim ibn Aqeel Jennifer Lopez Babe Ruth Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Marriage The Time Machine Asperger syndrome Nashville Skyline The Ashlee Simpson Show Anne Boleyn Homophobia First Impressions Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Bernard Williams Haven (TNG episode) Fancy Crane Bisexuality Jon Secada Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Mojave people The Shining (film) Theodicy Rich Mullins Jane Fonda Mary Jane Watson Prejudice Evil The Death Gate Cycle The Emancipation of Mimi Married... with Children Atheism Schabir Shaik Trial Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sexual orientation Grandview, U.S.A.
