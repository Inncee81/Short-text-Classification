harry potter seven did you like it or where you a tad bit disappointed with it as i was do you think that jk rowling will write another book perhaps a prequel or do you think that the series is fine where it is and is better off just being left alone i think it was a bit anticlimactic but then i didn't especially like book either i think and were far and away the best books of the series there was simply too much going on to wrap up well in that length of a final book i liked how she maintained her strong theme of friendship and loyalty to some of the lesser characters like neville and luna but it all felt really contrived to me as for the epilogue i think it just gives room to license other writers to expand on the world rowling created i don't think she'll write any more novels at least not soon about the world of harry potter but i can see others filling in the gaps very soon the publisher would be foolish not to try and license it for other books the possibilities for spin offs and prequels and sequels is immense just look at the star wars and star trek books not to mention dragonlance that do this and see how successful those series are and they didn't even have the worldwide literary recognition that harry potter has i think as a whole the series is wonderful despite a lack luster finale i like the possibility of other writers getting to flesh out their favorite characters but if it doesn't happen i'll be happy with it as it is Harry Potter Canon (fiction) Fan fiction Sequel Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ginny Weasley J.
