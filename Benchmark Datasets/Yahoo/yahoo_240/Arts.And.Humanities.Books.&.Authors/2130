can anyone suggest good books just for pleasure reading please give me the title and maybe a little about what the book is about i don't usually read for fun but i feel like i should broaden my horizons and get into it so all suggestions are welcome because i'm not really particular at this point i don't really know what i want to read i'm i don't really want to read anything that has a movie to go along with it because i've probably seen the movie and that just ruins which ever on you get to second the book or the movie right now i have a book on communicating and relationships that i heard about in one of my classes it's okay but not quite that interesting i want something more for pleasure and not like i'm learning about something well here are some of my favorites and i'm not a huge fan or reading either mitch album the five people you meet in heven tuesday's with morrie and for one more day these books will open your eyes to the world they will make you laugh and cry i love mitch album because of his thoughtful enotion he puts into it you should read tuesdays with morrie first they arn t a series thats just the best one it was requied for me to read it in school and i hate required reading books but this one was so amazing it's also a move and so is people you meet in heaven not nearly as good as the books though louis sachar holes a classic it's about this boy who was caught stealing a famous persons sneakers his dad is an inventor this boy says he isnt guilty then gets sent off to this boys camp where all they have to do all day is dig a five foot by five foot hole it's in the center of a dried up lake and the councelor is a mean old woman who is really just looking for her burried treasure it's a great story cause every little fact you find out has to do with something else so in the end the entire story makes sence also the best part about it is how the history if the lake that they are on is explained everyother chapter you'd think it would get confusing that way but really it helps strengthen the storys plot line anywas i'm not a big independent reader but i've read this book times all the way through so it's deff got to be good hah emily franklin all you need is love this book explained my life haha no but really this book is actually the thin a set of series i havent read the others yet but gosh i can't wait to get started it's about a senior in highschool girl who has friends drama boys teachers the usual life but the way she speaks just blows your mind i loved it very much louise rennison angus thongs and full frontal snogging funnny i don't remember a lot about it but i remember it being a great book just because of how it was written it's written like the girl georgia's journal she tells about her days and her weirdo family it's a great summer book i don't know the author of this one but it's called the little enveolpes i loved this book again because it's about a teenage girl who find love in a different country but her goal is to follow her aunts rules her aunt set up elvelopes sending her across the world by her self i first thought it was a little impractical but you really get caught up in her travels and troubles About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Holes (book) The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Friends Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Social rule YuYu Hakusho Kodocha W.I.T.C.H.
