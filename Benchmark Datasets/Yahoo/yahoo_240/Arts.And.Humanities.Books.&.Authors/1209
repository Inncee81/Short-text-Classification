last harry potter book what do you think of it did you like it are you sad they're over i am an i love this book but i dont just love the very endind i wish it would have been harry proposing to ginny or they're wedding cuz we're not used of harry being a dad so it didnt seem like him i have no criticism to do the series's ending was perfect in every sense she the author killed people but not crucial people i was afraid till the end that she might kill either harry ron or hermione but that didnt happen therefore i'm happy i'm also sad it's all over now all i'd wish is that chris columbus hp and director could take command in the movies again and made a remix of movies and and plus direct and honestly he was the only director worthy of making these films he could make masterpieces out of this these hp movies are really pissing me off Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter (character) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ginny Weasley Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter: Book Seven Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter fandom Minor Ravenclaws Weasley family Luna Lovegood Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Terry Gilliam Viktor Krum Dumbledore's Army Hogwarts subjects Death Eater Fleur Delacour Battle of Hogwarts Rubeus Hagrid Minor characters associated with Quidditch Diagon Alley Emma Watson Percy Weasley Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Cho Chang Neville Longbottom Poppy Pomfrey Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Magical objects in Harry Potter Cormac McLaggen J.
