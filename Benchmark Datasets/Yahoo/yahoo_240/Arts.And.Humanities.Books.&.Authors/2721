the wish list by eoin colfer i just have a few questions for those people out there who read the wish list what did you like about the book what did you learn from the book would you recommend it i enjoyed the book and was wondering other peoples responses thanks catherine i liked the story in general and colfer's approach it was engaging and thoughtful he didn't force anything on the reader yet he got his point across the girl's character and the old man were both well developed and i thought the devil and his demons humorous approach really paid off i read this a while ago and cant say anything i learned really anything except that colfer is a really good author it got me to read the supernaturalist and the artemis fowl series the message of the book which is to say its never to late to change one's path and that being kind and compassionate to other can reap rewards even if unexpected is nothing new but its put across effectively definitley recommend it and his other books Eoin Colfer Artemis Fowl II C.
