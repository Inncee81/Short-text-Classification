deathly hallows was this explained when harry is pretending he is dead and voldemort is facing the angry hogwartians when the sorting hat falls from the window with the gryffindeor sword inside it my question is who threw down the hat how was the sword inside it the goblin took it in gringotts and the fake was left in the lestranges vault okay do you remember in the chamber of secrets when harry used the sword and dumbledoor said that only a true gryffindor can get like that well it sword was going to neville and he was a true gryffindor so i am guessing because the book doesn't explain that it doesn't matter if it is stolen of lost because it will come to you whenever a true gryffindor is in need and as for who threw it down that could have been anyone the ghost or someone else Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ginny Weasley Diagon Alley Neville Longbottom Lord Voldemort Horcrux Minor Hufflepuffs Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Blood purity (Harry Potter) Death Eater Minor Ravenclaws Hogwarts Floor Directory Hermione Granger Dates in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Tom Riddle's diary Professor Quirrell Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Regulus Black Magic (Harry Potter) R.A.B.
