bartimaeus trilogy i was planning to go to the book store and buy some new books and i came across this trilogy i was wondering what genre it was and what it is basically about and would you recommend this book to someone who likes fantasy books yes i love this trilogy it's set in an alternate universe where there are magicians and non magicians the magicians run the government children with talent are taken from their parents and raised by magician parents the feel is a bit post victorian edwardian historical figures are recast in light of this world disraeli for example was one of the greatest magicians now i expect that sounds a bit boring but that's just to let you know the setting the real fun starts in the first pages when bartimaeus a very great jinn by his own reckoning is conjured up by this wet behind the ears looks like he's about to pee in his pants kid magician who thinks he's going to order him about the nerve and what does he want just for bartlimaeus to get an amulet sounds simple really dangerous assignments always do and this is a series that has a definite end and it's a doozy it's definitely a ya series and the structure is a little odd in a way in the second book you meet some new characters and see some of the events in the first book from an entirely different perscpective the third book ties everything together in a way that takes your breath away you can see this has all been coming but it still blindsides you let me know if you try it Magic (illusion) Expanded Universe (Star Wars) The Foundation Series The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Incarnations of Immortality Magic (paranormal) Jonathan Stroud C.
