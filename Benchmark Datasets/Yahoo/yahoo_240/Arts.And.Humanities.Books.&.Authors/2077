jane eyre report ok for my summer reading project i read jane eyre and what we have to do is make a visual of it by that i mean a board that includes a central symbolic figure that represents your interpretation of one of the major themes and several symbols of significant developments within the novel what i was thinking of was doing the pearl necklace that rochester gives jane and she leaves it at thornfield when she runs away and then he keeps it on him even when she is gone i was thinking of this becuase a pearl is formed by a mistake and gets caught in the oyster and is constantly covered by calcium or in this case the constant problems jane faces in early life wether it is lolwood or whatever but in the end she turns out to be a lovely being with good qualities she is so simple like a pearl is simple a sphere yet so complex like at once this pearl was a grain of sand not even knowing it would have such an outcome jane living with reed i will go on with it but does itwork also the tree in the garden that got thundered rochester compares himself to it in the end being a blind cripple and all the tree is representing jane and eds love ane even though it is torn apart part of it still stands and also that even in the story when there is lightening is foreshadowing becuase the weather in this book always matches the character's moods am i right i agree with you on the weather but i really think the pearl idea is very classic and perfect i really like the way you used the way a pearl is formed compared to janes childhood with her aunt and then later on at lolwood good luck it was a wonderful book huh jessica The Eyre Affair Pearl The Catcher in the Rye Charles Dickens House of Leaves The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Mary Jane Watson J.
