sherlock homes ok tell me more about it who wrote this character and when is this character based on a real person i like his detective stories very much want to know more about it is there any movie on him can i download it from there sherlock holmes is a fictional detective of the late th and early th centuries who first appeared in publication in he is the creation of scottish born author and physician sir arthur conan doyle a brilliant london based detective holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skillful use of deductive reasoning somewhat mistakenly see inductive reasoning and astute observation to solve difficult cases he is arguably the most famous fictional detective ever created and is one of the best known and most universally recognisable literary characters in any genre conan doyle wrote four novels and fifty six short stories that featured holmes all but four stories are narrated by holmes' friend and biographer dr john h watson two being narrated by holmes himself and two others are written in the third person the first two stories short novels appeared in beeton's christmas annual for and lippincott's monthly magazine in the character grew tremendously in popularity with the beginning of the first series of short stories in the strand magazine in further series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared almost right up to conan doyle's death in the stories cover a period from around up to with a final case in sherlock holmes is often pictured in trench coats with a hat and a pipe constantly smoking the character his knowledge and skills in the very first story a study in scarlet something of holmes' background is given in early he is presented as an independent student of chemistry with a variety of very curious side interests almost all of which turn out to be single mindedly bent towards making him superior at solving crimes in another early story the adventure of the gloria scott more background on what caused holmes to become a detective is presented a college friend's father complimented him very highly on his deductive skills in a study in scarlet dr watson assesses holmes's abilities thus knowledge of literature nil knowledge of astronomy nil knowledge of politics feeble knowledge of botany variable well up in belladonna opium and poisons generally knows nothing of practical gardening knowledge of geology practical but limited tells at a glance different soils from each other after walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of london he had received them knowledge of chemistry profound knowledge of anatomy accurate but unsystematic knowledge of sensational literature immense he appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century plays the violin well is an expert singlestick player boxer and swordsman has a good practical knowledge of british law later stories make clear however that the above list is misleading and that holmes who has just met watson is pulling watson's leg two examples despite holmes' supposed ignorance of politics in a scandal in bohemia he immediately recognises the true identity of the supposed count von kramm regarding non sensational literature his speech is replete with references to the bible shakespeare and even goethe this is somewhat inconsistent with his scolding watson for telling him about how the earth revolved around the sun instead of the other way around given that holmes tries to avoid having his memory cluttered with information that is of no use to him in detective work moreover in the adventure of the bruce partington plans watson reports that in november holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the polyphonic motets of lassus a most specialised field of knowledge for which holmes would have had to clutter his memory with an enormous amount of information which had absolutely nothing to do with crime fighting knowledge so extensive that his monograph was taken as the last word on it see the later stories definitely abandon the notion that holmes literally did not want to know anything unless it had immediate relevance for his profession in the second chapter of the valley of fear holmes instead declares that all knowledge comes useful to the detective and near the end of the adventure of the lion's mane he describes himself as an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles already in a study in scarlet conan doyle presents a comparison between his sleuth and two earlier more established fictional detectives edgar allan poe's c auguste dupin and emile gaboriau's monsieur lecoq the former had first appeared in the murders in the rue morgue first published in and the latter in l'affaire lerouge the lerouge affair in holmes is also a competent cryptanalyst he relates to watson i am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject in which i analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers one such scheme is solved using frequency analysis in the adventure of the dancing men which uses a series of stick figures holmes has shown himself to be a master of disguise from his earliest cases adopting personas from all walks of life he appears as a seaman in the sign of four an opium addict in the man with the twisted lip an old italian priest the adventure of the final problem a plumber in the adventure of charles augustus milverton and even as a woman in the adventure of the mazarin stone although holmes looks upon himself as a disembodied brain there are times when he can become very emotional in a righteous cause such as when he disapproves of how the banker holder treated his son in the adventure of the beryl coronet and rounds on the duke in the priory school for putting his own son in danger at the end of the adventure of the six napoleons he is touched by inspector lestrade's deep gratitude for his assisting scotland yard watson says he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than i had ever seen him and in the adventure of the three garridebs watson is wounded by a forger he and holmes are pursuing while the bullet wound proved to be quite superficial watson is moved by holmes' reaction holmes analysis of physical evidence is both scientific and precise his methods include the use of latent prints such as footprints hoof prints and bicycle tracks to identify actions at a crime scene a study in scarlet the adventure of silver blaze the adventure of the priory school the hound of the baskervilles the use of tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals the adventure of the resident patient the hound of the baskervilles the comparison of typewritten letters to expose a fraud a case of identity bullet comparison from two crime scenes the adventure of the empty house and even an early use of fingerprints the norwood builder holmes also demonstrates knowledge of psychology in a scandal in bohemia luring irene adler into betraying where she had hidden a photograph based on the precis that an unmarried woman will seek her most valuable possession in case of fire whereas a married woman will grab her baby instead despite the excitement of his life or perhaps seeking to leave it behind holmes retired to the sussex downs to take up beekeeping the second stain and wrote a book on the subject his search for relaxation can also be seen in his love in music notably the red headed league where holmes takes an evening off from a case to listen to sarasate play violin his personality and habits holmes is not at all a stuffy strait laced victorian gentleman as one might think in fact he describes himself and his habits as bohemian modern readers of the holmes stories are apt to be surprised that he was an occasional user a habitual user when lacking in stimulating cases of cocaine and morphine though watson describes this as holmes' only vice and later weaned holmes off of drug use in his personal habits he is very disorganized as watson notes in the adventure of the musgrave ritual leaving everything from notes of past cases to remains of chemical experiments scattered around their rooms nevertheless watson is very typical of his time in not considering a vice holmes' habit of smoking usually a pipe heavily nor his willingness to bend the truth and break the law e g lie to the police conceal evidence burgle and housebreak when it suited his purposes in victorian england such actions were not necessarily considered vices as long as they were done by a gentleman for noble purposes such as preserving a woman's honour or a family's reputation this argument is discussed by holmes and watson in the adventure of charles augustus milverton since many of the stories revolve around holmes and watson doing such things a modern reader must accept actions which would be out of character for a law abiding detective living by the standards of a later time they remain staples of detective fiction however holmes has a strong sense of honour and doing the right thing holmes can often be quite dispassionate and cold however when hot on the trail of a mystery he can display a remarkable passion despite his usual languor he has a flair for showmanship and often prepares dramatic traps to capture the culprit of a crime which are staged to impress watson or one of the scotland yard inspectors e g inspector lestrade at the end of the norwood builder he also holds back his chain of reasoning not revealing it or giving only cryptic hints and surprising results until the very end when he can explain all of his deductions at once holmes is also proud of being british as demonstrated by the patriotic vr victoria regina i e queen victoria made in bullet pocks in the wall by his gun he has also carried out counterintelligence work for his government in several cases most conspicuously in his last bow most often tracking down stolen state documents or thwarting the work of foreign spies holmes does have an ego that sometimes seems to border on arrogance however he has usually earned the right to such arrogance he seems to enjoy baffling police inspectors with his superior deductions however he is often quite content to allow the police to take the credit for his work with watson being the only one to broadcast his own role in the case in the adventure of the naval treaty he remarks that of his last fifty three cases the police have had all the credit in forty nine although he enjoys receiving praise from personal friends and those who take a serious interest in his work although he initially needed watson to share the rent of his comfortable residence at b baker street watson reveals in the adventure of the dying detective when holmes was living alone that i have no doubt that the house might have been purchased at the price which holmes paid for his rooms suggesting he had developed a good income from his practice although it is never revealed exactly how much he charges for his services he does say in the problem of thor bridge that my professional charges are upon a fixed scale i do not vary them save when i remit them altogether this is said in a context where a client is offering to double his fees however it is likely that rich clients provided a remuneration greatly in excess of holmes's standard fee in the adventure of the final problem holmes states that his services to the government of france and the royal house of scandinavia had left him with enough money to retire comfortably while in the adventure of black peter watson notes that holmes would refuse to help the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him while he could devote weeks at a time to the cases of the most humble clients holmes also tells watson in a case of identity of a golden snuff box received from the king of bohemia after a scandal in bohemia and a fabulous ring from the scandinavian royal family in the adventure of the priory school holmes rubs his hands with glee when the duke notes the sum which surprises even watson and then pats the cheque saying i am a poor man an incident that could be dismissed as holmes's tendency toward ironic humour certainly in the course of his career holmes had worked for both the most powerful monarchs and governments of europe including his own and various wealthy aristocrats and industrialists and had also been consulted by impoverished pawnbrokers and humble governesses on the lower rungs of society the victorian class system was much more complex than today's it would have been degrading to offer a bill to a royal figure but such a figure might well provide recompense of the equivalent of millions in modern currency holmes is generally quite fearless he dispassionately surveys horrific brutal crime scenes he does not allow superstition as in the hound of the baskervilles or grotesque situations to make him afraid and he intrepidly confronts violent murderers he is generally unfazed by threats from his criminal enemies and indeed holmes himself remarks that it is the danger of his profession that has attracted him to it on occasion holmes and watson carry pistols with them however these weapons are only used on five occasions besides a pistol holmes twice uses a riding crop cane as a weapon finally holmes does have capacities for human emotion and friendship he has a remarkable ability to gently soothe and reassure people suffering from extreme distress a talent which comes in handy when dealing with both male and female clients who arrive at baker street suffering from extreme fear or nervousness in the adventure of the norwood builder we see an example of holmes's affection for dr watson when it is revealed that watson has sold his practice as a doctor to a man named verner who gave with astonishing little demur the highest price that i ventured to ask an incident which only explained itself later when i found that verner was a distant relation of holmes and it was my friend who had really found the money again we are shown his close personal friendship with watson whose near death at the hands of a counterfeiter in the adventure of the three garridebs elicits much grief and anger from holmes over time holmes's relations with the official scotland yard detectives goes from cold disdain to a strong respect and the classic might have been in holmes's life is of course irene adler from a scandal in bohemia who is later referred to in the most laudatory terms by watson this is the only such canonical incident however despite signs of interest in other women watson is frequently disappointed that holmes shows no further interest in them once the case is solved people in his life historically holmes lived from the year at b baker street london in early notes it was described as being situated at upper baker street a flat up seventeen steps where he shared many of his professional years with his good friend dr watson for some time before watson's marriage in and after mrs watson's death the residence was maintained by his landlady mrs hudson in almost all of the stories holmes is assisted by the practical watson who is not only a friend but also his chronicler his boswell most of holmes's stories are told as narratives by watson of the detective's solutions to crimes brought to his attention by clients holmes sometimes criticises watson for his writings usually because he relates them as exciting stories rather than as objective and detailed reports focusing on what holmes regards as the pure science of his craft holmes has an older brother mycroft holmes a government official who appears in three stories the greek interpreter the final problem and the bruce partington plans he is also mentioned in a number of others including the empty house mycroft had a unique civil service position as a kind of memory man for all aspects of government policy a kind of walking database sherlock thought mycroft more gifted but not a man of action preferring to spend his time at the diogenes club described as a club for the most un clubbable men in london in three stories the sign of four a study in scarlet and the adventure of the crooked man holmes is assisted by a group of street children he calls the baker street irregulars law enforcement officers with whom holmes has worked include inspector lestrade tobias gregson stanley hopkins and athelney or peter jones all four of scotland yard and francois le villard of the french police holmes usually baffles the police with his far more efficient and effective methods showing himself to be a vastly superior detective a fact that the police seem to have learnt to take with good grace witness lestrade at the end of the six napoleons holmes's archenemy and popularly supposed nemesis was professor james moriarty the napoleon of crime who fell struggling with holmes over the reichenbach falls that's all i could put in for holmes sorry for not listing movies
