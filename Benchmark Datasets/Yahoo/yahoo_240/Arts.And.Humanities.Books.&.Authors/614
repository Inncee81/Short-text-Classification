i have a book that is years old how do i find out if it is worth alot of money its still in good condition also its a hard cover first off it's important to understand that a used or rare book like any other collectible is worth precisely what someone else is willing to pay for it at a particular point in time value is a personal and constantly changing concept the same is true in the art world and actually rare books are a part of the art world there is no one official catalogue of used and rare books and while such an immense undertaking might at last be plausible with the advent of computer databases i would not foresee that even that would be sufficient let's take an example the collector comes across a copy of william tyler olcott's sun lore of all ages how much is it worth first which edition is it is it a first edition or a reprint is it a book club edition these are not alas always easy questions to answer a first edition is usually worth significantly more than a reprint or a book club edition sometimes information on the title page or the page immediately following may be helpful so be sure to look there if the book has a dustjacket the dustjacket might state book club edition on the inside flap or the lack of a price might also indicate that this is a book club edition sun lore of all ages has no dustjacket so that won't help us the title page and the copyright page both state we can look the book up in one of numerous guides and see if it's listed there that would help wouldn't it the big pound mandeville's used book price guide price guide publishers po box kenmore wa shipping doesn't have it listed neither does the edition of the same price guide the insider's guide to old books magazines newspapers and trade catalogs by ron barlow and ray reynolds windmill publishing co windmill view road el cajon ca postage does have it listed it reads olcott william t sun lore of all ages ny st ed fine our copy was published in new york presumably in and so presumably is a first edition more information like the name of the publisher would have been helpful here to see if that matches the name of the publisher of our copy Stamp collecting Book collecting Ra (board game) Oxford English Dictionary The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Book Intellectual property Comics Yu-Gi-Oh!
