why should we read books for pleasure your opinions why should anyone adult read books for pleaure instead of reading i think adults should all do other beneficial activites like spend time with family friends tv exercise exercise relaxing etc i am a family doctor and i feel that reading pleaure books will do nothing in my life i know how to read and would like to do something pleasurable in my relaxing time i rather just do somehting else i am not going to school so why should i practice reading people who are in school should practice reading and not adults this is my opinion it is your choice if you want to read or not so dont get me wrong your thoughts feelings motivations etc thank you warning this message is not intended to discourage children and adults from reading stating if you are an adult or adolescent will help more details will help me understantd through the ethnocentrism viewpoint i only read scientifc magazines time mag once a month like hour a month ok to start i'm a year old girl who loves reading i think that adults well everyone but your question specified adults should read for pleasure for many reasons for many people it's relaxing it's a way to escape from stress sure some of the other beneficial things you mentioned are escapes too but some people just prefer to read another reason reading sparks imaginations a person might read a book for pleasure and suddenly be inspired to work to find a cure for cancer write the screenplay for the next big blockbuster think of an alternative fuel to power automobiles etc also people adults in particular should read to keep their minds active i'm sure that doing those other things that you mentioned are beneficial to the mind as well but reading improves vocabulary having a wealth of words to choose from enables a person to communicate his ideas clearly also i'm sure that reading can help keep one's memory healthy most importantly people adults and adolescents alike pleasure read just for the sake of enjoying it you may not enjoy reading a story but many people do if reading is what makes someone happy he should read as often as he likes happiness is only beneficial besides who's to say that just because someone enjoys reading they're not doing those other beneficial things you mentioned i understand and respect that you don't like to read for pleasure a lot of people don't but many of us do enjoy it very much i hope you understand and respect my ideas opinions as well Theory of conduct Infantilism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Nicomachean Ethics Autism rights movement Goodness and value theory Transactional analysis Human sexual behavior Autism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Utilitarianism Objectivist philosophy About a Boy Microeconomics A Course In Miracles Ten Commandments Social psychology EastEnders Extreme Programming Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion Goldstein's book Bipolar disorder David Hume Alignment (role-playing games) Clinical depression Religious Society of Friends Economic inequality Simone Weil Church of Christ, Scientist Sant Thakar Singh Socrates The Giver Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aristotle Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Motivation Love Vishnu sahasranama The Wealth of Nations Polyamory Soul The Fairly OddParents Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chronic fatigue syndrome Human Stoicism Storytelling Childlove movement Abortion debate Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pedophilia Scientology beliefs and practices Kender Altruism Suicide Literacy Economics Insomnia Empathy Hikikomori Second language acquisition Annuity Alternative medicine The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Finnish language Hearing impairment Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stomach cancer Magical thinking Christian eschatology Evil Dissociative identity disorder American Psycho Masturbation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Church of Christ Plame affair Scientific method Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Children of God Orgasm Moral objectivism Ye Shengtao Hypnosis Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Jehovah's Witnesses
