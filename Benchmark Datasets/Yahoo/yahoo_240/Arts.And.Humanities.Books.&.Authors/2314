is the da vinci code appropriate is the da vinci code appropriate for a teenager to read i have heard many different views on it i have wanted to read this book for a while and i am right now my mom feels it is okay for me to read as long as i dont believe what it says now i am catholic and i love to read and i dont think a book is going to change my beliefs especially a book that is fiction i started to read it and so far it seems okay the book is an easy read and is interesting but i was wondering if it is actually appropriate for me to read like is there parts in the book or certain details i should be prepared for or something to be honest i feel it is okay for me to read but what about you guys yes the da vinci code is a great book for a teenager or adult to read it is a fiction book but has true facts put in there from history like wiccan having strong females that scared catholics of old and such but you are old enough to do the reseach and make up your own mind books are there for you to read and yes at times even open your mind to new ideas Witchcraft Opus Dei C.
