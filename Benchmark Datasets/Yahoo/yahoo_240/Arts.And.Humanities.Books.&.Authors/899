how have john lorraine matured in the book the pigman both characters apparently mature i have no idea how they have matured can someone give some examples please and thank youus i felt that john and lorraine finally matured when mr pignati died then they realized that they were both partly responsible for his death had they not gotten involved with him in the first place through that phony charity prank they played on him then he might still be alive sure they gave him some bright moments when they became friends with this lonely old man but they hastened his death when they threw that party without his permission or knowledge in his house and all of mr pignati's beloved and deceased wife's pig figurines were destroyed this plus the death of bobo the monkey at the zoo a favorite of the pigman and john and lorraine's and most of all john and lorraine's betrayal caused the pigman to suffer a fatal heart attack john and lorraine at the end of the book are finally mature enough to realize this and to also realize that they are responsible for what happens in their own lives too good luck and happy reading to you Pitaten The Catcher in the Rye Days of our Lives One Life to Live Death Charmed Nero The Emancipation of Mimi Original sin Young adult literature Louis XV of France Fight Club Phaedo The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Tiberius Care Bears Knots Landing Avenue Q Adi Da Sub-Zero The Archers Ren__ I of Naples Shaggy dog story The Brothers Karamazov Claude Lorrain Miss Saigon It's Walky!
