how do i make my fantasy world more believable i'm writing a fantasy story and i have a good plot and good characters etc the only problem is the majority of my story takes place in one country the landscape is vast and varied but as my main character is traveling from one region to another i'm having a problem making the landscape world believable they pass through several towns and i'm not sure how to make them unique different etc any help would be greatly appreciated particularly in describing the landscape for me language is something that really makes a fantasy world believable by that i mean things like place names seem to make sense after a while for example whatever word you make up for 'road' or 'river' or 'mountain' or 'village' should be consistent david eddings does this well along with c s lewis and of course tolkien if the language or languages are believable your world seems like it automatically has a history and authenticity edited to add to bring the landscape alive instead of just describing it go into detail about how your characters are interacting with it and it with them for instance maybe the desert sand impedes their travels as they sink deep into drifts with every step sand in their eyes up their noses making them sneeze grit irritating every bit of skin it touches or maybe the misty riverbank induces a feeling of melancholy despair and longing for home talk about the physical and emotional effects of your lands on your characters i'm not a writer but i do read a lot i hope that helps some J.
