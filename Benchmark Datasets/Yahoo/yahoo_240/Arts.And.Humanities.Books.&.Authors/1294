did harry not tell his kids from what i gathered harry didnt tell his kids about voldemort or any of the fighting or any of his history or anything did i miss something because albus seemed surprised when harry told him that the sorting hat let him choose which led me to believe that he didnt tell his kids anything i believe that harry's children do know a bit about their dad but the major events are still being kept from them remember that they are still quite young and probably not able to understand everything that happened it is probable that james being the oldest and already in hogwarts knew a fair bit but the younger ones probably did not remember that this is years later and the battle and events leading up to it are now history as for the sorting hat harry only told albus about being able to choose his house to calm him down his older brother had been constantly teasing him about ending up in slytherin which became a real fear for albus harry told him this to let him know that he was the master of his own fate and that his wishes mean a lot to where he ends up in life that was a personal memory for harry and not one he would normally share Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Magical objects in Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Hogwarts subjects Horcrux Harry Potter (character) Horace Slughorn Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dates in Harry Potter Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Remus Lupin Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Sirius Black Order of the Phoenix Death Eater Hermione Granger Blood purity (Harry Potter) Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Magic (Harry Potter) Battle of Hogwarts Draco Malfoy The Hogwarts Founders Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Albus Dumbledore Tom Riddle Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Tom Riddle's diary Minerva McGonagall Dumbledore's Army James and Lily Potter Ginny Weasley R.A.B.
