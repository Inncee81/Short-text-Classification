need names for my story i cant think pleeeeez help okay the main girl's name is bella i think i want to go with the last name gibbons i need dad's name mom's name and about girl's names for little sisters dog name and if you dont think i should use gibbons please feel free to share other good ones a name for a house that they move to its a really old house in the story and i want to have a name for it and as many names as you can think of for people from a far off land that has different customs and culture please help you are going about this completely the wrong way i see this in so many novice writers their biggest concern is adorable names for their characters and a cool name for their story wrong approach all you are going to wind up with is a whole lot of silly cliche sounding names that an editor will probably change anyway yep once you sign a contract a publisher has the right to do that like it or not your first step is your homework your character studies and your outline you need to really flesh out your characters and make them living breathing people as i often do with kids in classes i would ask you questions like does the girl brush her teeth up and down or side to side does she like mustard or ketchup on her hotdogs what was her math grade last semester you should know your characters that well people have pasts and those events have a lot to do with shaping who they are names are not a good jumping off point i often ask classes about a character i am writing she is a very hot sexy movie star type she is sexually promiscuous drinks a lot and occasionally does drugs she is blonde and blue eyed wears a lot of makeup but never wears underwear she loves older men who are rich and powerful and uses them for her own means now i want to name this character the name i have decided on is norma jeane mortenson does that name fit the description not very well but let's change her name to her stage name of marilyn monroe sound like a better fit it is not uncommon to see an author use xx and yy for characters i do an exercise with writers where i insist they use those as names very hard to do i am a firm believer as are many writers that when you know enough about your characters they start communicating with you eventually you will just know their names don't dwell on them work diligently on making the people real through character studies let the names happen same thing with the title i once wrote a whole book with my lead female character having a certain name i was sure it was right for her when i finished the book i realized it wasn't one click of the mouse and find and replace and just like that she had a new name focus on the important stuff the rest will fall in place pax c Marilyn Monroe Calvin and Hobbes Recurring South Park characters Doug Shaggy dog story Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Jon Secada AFI 100 Years series Sin City Scrooge McDuck KaBlam!
