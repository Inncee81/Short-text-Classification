harry potter and the deathly hallows questions warning contains spoilers i read the book and finished the first day it came out a while back and i loved it but some questions harry couldn't die completley because some of harry's blood was still in voldemort when he used it in goblet of fire to re generate himself so if harry kept dieing could he keep coming back similar to the first question was he able to come back due to the fact voldemort had his blood in him or because he had gathered the deathly hallows and now was master of death even if he was master of death could he keep dieing and coming back what was the point of the prophecy now that i look back at it it just stated both can't live well if harry was able to keep coming back if he is able to what is the point of it i know harry was the master of the elder wand at the end and that's why the killing curse back fired on voldemort why didn't it backfire in the forest when harry first died any clarification would be helpful thx p oh and in the first question i meant goblet of fire the book not the real goblet itself those are very good questions but the one that interests me most is the th it's basically the same answer to all the questions hold on let my type up some answers for st it's not that he could keep coming back to life but it's how he died he died willingly he wanted to give up his life to save the others so that really helped him but also like you said when he took his blood he had some of the protection that lily left for harry when she died for him he took his blood correct okay so that means that since harry's blood runs in voldemort's veins its like if a part of harry lives inside voldemort so when he killed harry he wasnt able to finish it because if he lived then so did harry i already answered that in the apragraph above he took his blood harry was the master of death correct but he didint know that did he the profecy wasn't ever supposed to be real it was going to happen indeed but it would happen because severus snape at the time a death eater heard the profecy and therefore told voldemort about it voldemort took it seriously and he chose harry potter to be the one who would be able to eliminate him he wanted to kill him before that happened too late haha well neither can live while the other survives right what that means is that neither can stand it if the other is alive voldemort can't stand harry being alive because that means somone actually has a chance on beating him and harry can't stand voldemort being alive because voldemort would commit crimes and murders he did not want that ahhh yes the question i've wanted to answer well it didn't backfire in the forest when harry first died he died trying to save a the witches and wizards that were currently hogwarts that's one of the reasons also harry had no wand to disarm voldemort with expelliarmus but i think expelliarmus did the trick when it backfired because by disarming him harry proved that he was the true master of death i hopw i was of any help thanks i beg for a best answer lol it doesnt matter as long as i know i helped Hogwarts subjects Blood purity (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Order of the Phoenix Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Hogwarts Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Battle of Hogwarts Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter Sybill Trelawney Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ginny Weasley Horcrux Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Weasley family Rubeus Hagrid Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Minor Hufflepuffs Rita Skeeter Ministry of Magic Minor Ravenclaws Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Horace Slughorn Dark Mark Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Hermione Granger House-elf Hogwarts Houses Peter Pettigrew Professor Quirrell Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Barty Crouch Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Wizarding world Luna Lovegood Dark Art Remus Lupin Bellatrix Lestrange Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) R.A.B.
