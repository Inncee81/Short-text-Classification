did you cry at reading the last harry potter i had tears in my eyes when hedwig died it was so sudden you know also at dobby's death when snape was at sirius' place holding lily's letter and crying that broke my heart and when harry called his younger son by his full name saying severus snape was the bravest man he ever knew it was so good to learn harry had forgiven him but i think the saddest moment was when harry visited his parents' grave and he stood there thinking how much he'd want to be lying there with them and when he found his home and saw the sign outside it that chapter was really very emotional Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Severus Snape Harry Potter (character) James and Lily Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Dates in Harry Potter Remus Lupin Hermione Granger Order of the Phoenix Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Scenes from a Memory Half-Blood Prince (character) Hogwarts subjects Ron Weasley Death Eater Hogwarts Floor Directory Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Narcissa Malfoy Peter Pettigrew Hogwarts Houses Sydney Riot of 1879 Magical objects in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Potions in Harry Potter Horace Slughorn Bellatrix Lestrange Occlumency Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Dobby Diagon Alley Legilimency Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Alan Rickman Pitaten Battle of Hogwarts Unbreakable Vow Harry Potter Draco Malfoy Fan fiction Ginny Weasley John the Baptist Relatives of Harry Potter Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter The Amber Spyglass Sybill Trelawney Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) R.A.B.
