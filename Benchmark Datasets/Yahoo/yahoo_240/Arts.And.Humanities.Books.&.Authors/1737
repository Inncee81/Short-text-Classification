horror suspense not mystery author suggestions i'm a fan of clive barker and dean koontz for example koontz is fairly prolific and i like his style so i keep up with what he's writing clive barker is less prolific but he's my god and i'm front and center when his novels come out i'm looking for a new author to take interest in any suggestions what i'm looking for i'm interested in non traditional horror stories such as the stuff you encounter from the above mentioned authors i've enjoyed chandler mcgrew's the darkening for example i enjoy chuck palahniuk though he's not necessarily a horror writier i was not impressed with christopher golden his novels strike me as innordinately presumptuious stephen king has his moments cell wasn't bad but no so much any more what i don't want no vampire stephanie meyer or zombie fiction please no harry potter either this section is saturated enough with them as it is i seem picky but that's because i've see these writer ans i'm just not impressed by 'em thus far several responses have rung true to authors i've already read thanks hp lovecraft was a master of the art f paul wilson i've stayed current with all of the repairman jack and this other fiction since the keep it's hard to reference all the writers i love but these definitely hold an honored place on my selves with those previously mentioned thanks again all f paul wilson has written several sci fi horror and medical thrillers he's best known for 'the keep' which was made into a movie in the 's the keep is the first part of a six book series called 'the adversary cycle' about two supernatural forces battling it out over the years with earth caught between wilson is also known for his popular character repairman jack www repairmanjack com jack has erased his existence and for a price will 'repair' your problems trouble is many of these problems end up taking a supernatural turn jack's first adventure is 'the tomb' which also happens to be part two of the adversary cycle you might also like douglas preston and lincoln child who write as a team while some of their works are archeology type thrillers they also do some horror supernatural stuff their most popular character is agent penderghast Clive Barker Horror film Dean Koontz H.P.
