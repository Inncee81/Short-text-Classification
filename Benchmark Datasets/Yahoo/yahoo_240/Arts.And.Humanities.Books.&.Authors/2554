why was hagrid expelled from hogwarts i just started reading the sorcerer's stone and would like an answer from all of the harry potter fans out there thanks he was expelled during his third year after being caught in possession of a dangerous acromantula this already grave crime was worsened due to the belief that it was the monster of slytherin and that hagrid had released it from the chamber of secrets and either intentionally or unintentionally allowed it to attack and petrify and in one case kill other students this inaccurate belief was encouraged by riddle the actual criminal who had been using the true monster a basilisk to attack students and who had framed hagrid to avoid the school being closed Rubeus Hagrid Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tom Riddle Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Tom Riddle's diary Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Death Eater Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Ron Weasley Hogwarts Houses Ginny Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Hermione Granger The Hogwarts Founders Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Severus Snape Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Minor Hogwarts teachers Minor Hufflepuffs Hogwarts ghosts Professor Quirrell Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Knockturn Alley Potions in Harry Potter Hogwarts Express Minor Slytherins Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Lucius Malfoy Blood purity (Harry Potter) Dobby Hogwarts Floor Directory Magic (Harry Potter) Minor Ravenclaws Wizarding world Remus Lupin Battle of Hogwarts Minerva McGonagall Rita Skeeter Draco Malfoy Sirius Black Argus Filch Luna Lovegood Colin and Dennis Creevey Motif of harmful sensation Fawkes Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Buckbeak Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dark Art J.
