what's wrong with me i'm writing a book and a couple of weeks ago i finally wrote the inciting incident of my story it's at an exciting part of my book but i have no desire to write writing is my passion and i don't understand why i don't want to write is it just that i need to take a break or am i telling myself that the inciting incident isn't good enough please help i'm not an idiot i know what writer's block is and this isn't it it means you need to put the book down forget about it and walk out of the house completely forget about the book don't worry about it don't think about just forget it and don't think that there is a deadline to finish it even if there is creativity has only one source true creativity anyway and that is from empty space nowhere in zen it's called awareness which seemingly contradictorily is in absence of thought you'll never finish the book if you don't stop thinking about it or not well anyway good luck and forget about it eventually it'll hit you Milton H.
