how many people in america do you think actually read the harry potter books or like do most people just wait for the movies and jsut watch those see i love the books and movies too but my sister has a friend that covered his ears when she was talking to someone else about the th book but he doesn't read the books he only watches the movies then there are my people like my friends that some will r ead the books but normally just watch the movies because they don't like to read and expecially a book as thick as the hp books so i'm wondering still how many people you personally think are in america are like this and don't care for the book really at all which makes me freakin mad 'cause the books are freakin awesome there are definitely a lot of people who wait for the movies but i think most who go to see the movies have already read the books prior i think the real question is how many people in america are not into the harry potter mania books or movies d Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas Minor Harry Potter Beasts The Ashlee Simpson Show Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Discworld American Psycho Rich Mullins Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Rubeus Hagrid Social rule Magical objects in Harry Potter Minor Slytherins J.
