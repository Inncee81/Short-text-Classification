what did you think of the th harry potter book personally i thought it was very weak none of the main characters died voldemort wasn't very strong the ending seemed almost inevitable and the years later was really weak i also found way too many questions unanswered especially regarding the deathly hallows if that's the saddest book you've ever read then you either have problems or have been reading too many children picture books harry doesn't count because he doesn't really die and to prove voldemort being weak look how neville longbottom was able to just take an easy swing at his snake that makes little sense to me the ending was extremely cheesy i don't get dumbledore being stupid enough to touch that ring also the deathly hallows really had little to do with the actual story and were a significant divergance from the main plot how many times does harry get to almost die too it's like he gets saved every chapter through sheer luck or from a young wizard hermoine or ron somehow beating off a death eater or voldemort's snake jk rowling wrote the book on what she thought people wanted her to write it rather than what she truly wanted to write this was not the case in the th previous books yeah the th book did not get my standing ovation the years later part at the end ruined it for me how cheesy and the whole harry dying but not really part was weak Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Severus Snape Hogwarts subjects Death Eater Ron Weasley Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) R.A.B.
