when writing a book that takes place in a real town is it best to use actual businesses or make them up should i research the history of all of these businesses the book spans from or make places up that have some of the characteristics of the old place i am referring to hotels stores etc what is the proper etiquette and what would you the reader prefer this book is also fiction i think most people make up the places their characters interact with the hardware shop the local coffee shop etc and keep the real landmarks empire state building for example i suppose chains might be kept mcdonald's mariott hotels for example or the obvious places sears tower in chicago has a lot of offices you could have a character going to a fictional law or financial firm located there now i'm talking big cities small towns are harder and i'm not sure about that i believe and maybe one of the others knows for sure that you don't want to make it too obvious in a small town the smaller it is the better off you would be however to make up a new place with characteristics of the original in order not to offend anyone Wall Street Sears Tower Eaton's San Andreas (state) World Trade Center Makati City Urban sprawl Chicago Loop Underground city Paris Chester Ballwin, Missouri Shopping mall Surreal number Hotel Oklahoma City, Oklahoma North York, Ontario Donald Trump RuneScape locations Uptown, Minneapolis Grand Forks, North Dakota Champaign, Illinois Coffeehouse Craps Downtown Los Angeles W.
