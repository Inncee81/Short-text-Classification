eclipse and new moon questions ok now edward cant read bella mind nor any other vampire's abilities work on her so how come alice saw when she jumped out of cliff and the dont work on her i was wondering what if she gets bitten she did get bitten we just never got to see what happens cause edward sucked the venom out what if she doesnt turn into a vampire what if the venom doesnt work on her http twilightlexicon com personal correspondence in this someone asks a question about bella and why the other's powers have no effect when jasper's and alice's do q if bella is immune to vampire powers why can jasper and alice use their talents on her a bella has a very private mind no one can touch her there what jane does is entirely illusion you only think you re feeling pain what aro does is like what edward does he gets inside your head what jasper does effects not the thoughts but the body he doesn t make you think you are calm he actually puts your body into a calmed state or angry or whatever it s physical rather than mental alice sees the outcome of bella s decisions because those outcomes happen in the real world not just inside bella s head and as for her becoming a vampire q if someone s bitten with loads of venom right by the heart how quick is the conversion and is it more painful than a regular conversion were some of the cullen s transformations worse than others a about the conversion process if there is a lot of venom in the human s system the pain is more intense to begin with like fire the venom burns through the body so with fire in more places there is more pain at the outset when bella was bitten by james the fire was only in her hand painful enough but not as bad as if she had several bites of course this is only at the outset if james venom had been allowed to spread through bella it would have over time made its way through her whole system and the pain eventually would have been just as intense as if she d been deliberately infected with multiple well placed bites jugular wrists ankles etc so all that early pain as the venom wound through her system is extra an added portion of pain that doesn t in anyway cut down the time or the intensity of the greater pain the greatest pain begins when the venom is all the way through the body through the heart and it starts meeting itself in the veins again and then burning them dry it moves slower than blood because it s thicker each beat of the heart can only push it so far the changing burning process is slow the venom has to leak through to every cell before it ends it took carlisle a little more than three days because his bites were not deliberate or well placed it can be as short as two i hope that helps Kain (Legacy of Kain) Milton H.
