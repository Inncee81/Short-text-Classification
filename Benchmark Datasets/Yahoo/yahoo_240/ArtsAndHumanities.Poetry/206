when i wrote this poem i described the setting just as it was tell me what you think plz among the darkness of my room i'm setting in the floor pen in hand i begin to write once more small amounts of sunlight shining through my poorly closed curtains i sit here still waiting trying to find my purpose i'm half stuck inbetween this life and i know i don't belong this could be my fault because i've known this all along as the light becomes less and the sun it starts to set i think of you and in one breath i'll tell my last regret if you'd only listened times before i'm sure you'd understand this more and this is goodbye again i wisper oh lord i'm still here alive waiting for my own death god please take my last breath this is beautifully written as i was reading this poem things i have notice that is similar i noticed about writing in little light and also about death the person i would be thinking of is anne frank Jon Secada Famous last words Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tag William Cowper The Amber Spyglass Trinity Origin belief Sunlight The Subtle Knife Soul Past teachings of Prem Rawat Blood (computer game) Christian eschatology Cupid and Psyche Anne Rice Triage Japanese tea ceremony The Dunciad The Time Machine Paul Is Dead Lighting Force (Star Wars) She Loves You Miss Saigon Boom Town (Doctor Who) Religious Society of Friends Roxette Current teachings of Prem Rawat Prayer Night (book) Rainbow Horus I Want to Hold Your Hand Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Shaggy dog story T.
