warning parental controls advised i wrote this after my wedding night what are your thoughts wrapping my legs around you wrapping my legs around you pulling you close inside we now share the secrets that i once i did hide your arms wrapped around me holding me so tight you take me now on a most wonderful flight our mouths come together with the rush of a fierce kiss for now the time lost will never be missed faster and harder our tongues carry the beat within your arms the torture is so sweet the friction of our bodies building an intense heat creating the climax that surpasses the highest peak it is now upon us oh yes i cry as the hot river of life now flows inside you hold me tighter not wanting to let go the kiss fiercer still as the river flows the moan from your throat is music to my ears as sweat flows from our bodies like careless tears locked together afraid to break the spell the drum now beats slower saying all is well cont our kisses are now gentle and light for the magic of this moment will last all night you nibble my ear and nuzzle my throat you capture my breast your mouth my nipples coat the caresses do not stop there for you and me for between us there always will be sam i know you appreciate honesty and what i'm about to say doesn't suggest in any way that you don't know how to write you have a good smooth style while this is a wonderful poem to give your spouse and while it conveys an overtly erotic mood i have some issues with it first there is simply not enough imagery here it is simply the event detailed for me a poem needs more layers than a simple retelling there are two bits of imagery you do use the drum and the river the drum is interesting and that image could be expanded on as an extended metaphor the river actually feels pretty ordinary also there is a bit of forced rhyme here not a lot but for example and nuzzle my throat your mouth my nipples coat the coat rhyme seems forced when i read it in short while i don't mind the content at all i'd like there to be more layers to it a bit more suggestion and subtlety i don't know if this feedback will be helpful to you but i respect that you want to work on the craft of writing and i wanted to let you have my honest feedback take care Internal ballistics Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swingout Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Diving The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Janet Jackson Piccolo Junior Saga Dog Drill bit Eye EastEnders Poker jargon Time Out of Mind YuYu Hakusho Naruto jutsu Marilyn Monroe The Contender (television series) The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) One Tree Hill (TV series) Erogenous zone Electrophysiology Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Comanche Oral sex Milton H.
