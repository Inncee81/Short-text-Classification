another poem i'm sure everyone's sick of mine when i think about the past we once knew i wonder what happened in the years so few because i know that we have changed a little and we ve found out the hard way life is brittle hold friends close and never let go who ever knew we d stoop so low once so alike we drifted apart then one soul but now two hearts i listen and know your little mistakes these are just tests that life sometimes makes i ve failed a few of them and so have you friends are always there its what makes them true that is amazing seriously i could never get sick of your poems Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Pitaten William Blake One Tree Hill (TV series) Year of the Spider Rei Ayanami Socrates Das Lied von der Erde Solomon Ibn Gabirol Cao Zhi Sant Thakar Singh Soul Yehuda Halevi Phaedo Scenes from a Memory Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Du Fu Kain (Legacy of Kain) Methos Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 James Henry Leigh Hunt Sub-Zero Children of Dune Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Amber Evidence of evolution Bob Dylan (album) Transformers: Armada Anchor Humphrey Bogart Iron Characters in the Smurfs Retcon W.
