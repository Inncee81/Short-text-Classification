comments on this poem self image you don t know me this is what you know my hair held captive against my head does not cascade down my back it lays listlessly a nest uncombed my skin is blemished and stained scarred and bruised same as my name it is not pure like milk my poems do not resonate they flit about like a firefly easily contained in the palm of your hand they are let go and forgotten mere acquaintances my voice cannot hit every high note it breaks instead like glass i reach down and pull the low notes out of my belly they feel slippery between my fingers i quiver even on the middle c of i love you and you are disappointed and i am disappointed i really liked this again it felt like plath to me this feels like the strongest poem out of the one's you've posted today it's really good i like what you did with the voice and the glass i like how it was the voice breaking rather than the glass that was very well done great ending my only issue in each strophe you deal with an area of the body except when you deal with my poems i think it would be better if you could keep it more linked to your body somehow that's it this one has a ton of potential it is really good thanks for sharing all of your work today Diving Double bass Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Violin Suplex Timpani Glass InuYasha (character) The Inside Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Pet Sounds 613 mitzvot Professional wrestling throws Garth Brooks Professional wrestling attacks Harp Poker jargon Butterfly stroke Bong Yoko Ono Anchor Naval mine Physical attractiveness The Doors Sub-Zero Cleveland Browns Hall & Oates Swimming Salad Fingers G-Man (Half-Life) Hand The Caves of Androzani Skin Japanese poetry Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Platypus Sylvia Plath Rudyard Kipling Sin City Madonna (entertainer) Volleyball United Airlines Flight 93 Knife Sesshomaru Pittsburgh Steelers The Shining (film) Bon Jovi Poetry Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jon Secada Cello Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nineteen Eighty-Four Milk Philadelphia Eagles Slow Train Coming Birthmark HTML element The Ashlee Simpson Show Cascade Range Guy Sigsworth Cascading Style Sheets Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Four Quartets Dragon Booster Tina Turner Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII) Physical characteristics of the Buddha Rod Stewart Fast bowling The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show Elephant Space elevator Inspector Gadget Characters in the Smurfs Samurai Deeper Kyo Snake Breastfeeding Cliff Richard Treehouse of Horror XV Gesture Mattress Spanking Bigfoot Twelve Swords of Power John Berryman Backstroke W.I.T.C.H.
