can you relate to this poem what feeling does it leave you with cut and bleed i am a dysfunction of life i feel like a ghost with a knife needing to alert myself that i'm still alive so i cut and bleed to survive no more fears for my tears to fall no more for i have drank them all unafraid of the pain i need sore eyes watch as i cut and bleed i see myself laying in a pool of blood but not yet have i had enough of the pain that is so enticing the pain thats ever so enviting so i cut deeper to fade out my last light as i watch my skin turn completely white thanks for the hug depressing but very good you have a talent for writing that should make you feel better Traumatic brain injury Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Bleeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass Stroke Chronic fatigue syndrome Rais massacre Books of Blood Darken Rahl Knife Blood Simple Book of Isaiah Bruise Childbirth Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Cocaine Wound YuYu Hakusho Into the West (miniseries) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drowning Piccolo Junior Saga Alcoholism Callus Sin City The Shining (film) The Subtle Knife Mosquito Happy Tree Friends StarCraft: Uprising Darth Vader Shaving Twelve Swords of Power Sexual dysfunction One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Menstrual cycle Miss Saigon Breastfeeding Leukemia Chlorpromazine EastEnders Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Stopping power Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Arthas Menethil Night (book) Yami no Matsuei Hamlet Equine conformation Hollyoaks Methamphetamine Scenes from a Memory Aztec Bob Dole Wolfrider Ninja Scroll Berlin Wall Poker jargon Pressure point Blood Syndicate Rei Ayanami The Parting of the Ways The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Nicomachean Ethics Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Anxiety John Barleycorn W.I.T.C.H.
