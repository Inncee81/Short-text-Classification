i would like to publish but i have one poem not a dozen but one i've read through the suggestions but mostly i get you should publish with a book of your own work i doubt one poem is worth that sort of effort can you see a one page book out there i understand that it's not necessary to copyright but where can i go a trustworthy place to publish one poem hi dahlias everybody starts with one that's a given i've known some poets who can take a long time between poems they've learned not to rush their process if you want your one poem published then send it to a magazine keep sending it out keep reading other people's poems in the meantime like in the magazines you are thinking of sending to then you'll probably find yourself inspired to write another poem side note stay away from reading work here i say that because this place has no editor and so you haven't seen work that has gone through any kind of publishing process good luck Japanese poetry Objectivist poets Michael Drayton H.D.
