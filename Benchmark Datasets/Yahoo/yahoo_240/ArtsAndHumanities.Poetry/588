written for one in jail pros and cons welcome i lie here thinking endless thoughts these walls are cold and hard and bare the past of should and should have nots and whether anyone will care i need to plan ahead for time and keep my mind from deep despair and yet it's hard to count the days not knowing when or what or where the ebb and flow of life are boxed in cold metallic shades of steel and tears i cannot cry are locked around my heart that cannot heal lying still upon my back i look up in the midnight air and count the specks of bleakest black and silently begin my prayer oh lord i pray do not forsake this hurting child of thine be near me please and soothe the ache and if you would a sign and from afar there came a voice so still and small and mild you will ever have the choice to always be my child i will never leave you now forsake you i will not the crown of thorns upon my brow and cross your future bought i love you more than words can say i want you for my own i listen to each word you pray when you are all alone and then a silver ray of sun began again to shine my broken heart was warmed and won and tears were left behind i'm trusting now that your will lead my life and path i take so help me with each word and deed lord daily as i wake and may i never lose this hope please let me share your love with others who may blindly grope and need help from above great poem i would just make some changes in the last two stanzas i'm trusting now that you will lead my life my path by your light help me with word and every deed lord daily as i live may i never lose this hope please let me share your love many who blindly grope they need your help from above Jon Secada Alaga__sia Muslim ibn Aqeel Time Out of Mind Book of Isaiah Four Quartets Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Repentance The Amber Spyglass Rule of St Benedict Concepts in the Wheel of Time series EastEnders Ten Commandments John Wesley Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Jazz Singer Kain (Legacy of Kain) John the Baptist Church of Christ, Scientist Parsifal Poker jargon George Fox John Howard Yoder Amidah Christian views of Jesus Past teachings of Prem Rawat Mattress Simone Weil The Shining (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Pilgrim's Progress Shen Gong Wu Jewish services Shaggy dog story Siegfried Schtauffen Pitaten Conan the Barbarian Salvation Tav-Prasad Savaiye YuYu Hakusho Sikhism primary beliefs and principles The Death Gate Cycle Bhagavad Gita The Contender (television series) Nightmare (Soul Calibur) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Frankie Laine Virgin Mary in Islam A Course In Miracles Canonical hours Torii Mototada Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Eastern Orthodox Church Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Children of Dune Sola fide Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Estoppel Miss Saigon Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Arthas Menethil Night (book) Unreleased Madonna songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tefillin Aramaic of Jesus John Berryman The Doctor Dances Saruman Cliff Richard Mercury Atlas 6 Prayer The Dalek Invasion of Earth Shawn Michaels The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Zhuge Liang Nineteen Eighty-Four Vacuum Smallville (Season 3) Sant Thakar Singh Rosary Qiyamah Israel ben Eliezer Knots Landing Scenes from a Memory The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nico Robin Hinduism God Save the Queen
