is this a good poem about love love is like a lump of gold hard to get and hard to hold of all the girls ive ever met youre the one i cant forget i do believe in god above created you for me to love when i die and go to heaven and youre not there i'll wait beside the golden stairs and if youre not there on judgement day i'll know youve gone the other way so just to prove my love is true i'd go to hell to be with you ooooh i like it i write to you know but my stories are dramatic and suspensful fantasies keep up the writing i hope that someday my stories will become famous even though right now they're sitting in a shoebox under my bed Jon Secada C.
