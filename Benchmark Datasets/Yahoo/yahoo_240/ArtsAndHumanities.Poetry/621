what is your favourite poem and favourite poet for what reasons while considered more of a songwriter than a poet my favorite poet is bob dylan aka robert zimmerman his work is pure genius and them some bob dylan is was very prolific some things he wrote aren't even attributed to him because other musical groups made the works popular like scarborough fair all along the watchtower mr tambourine man blowing in the wind one of my favorite works of his is i want you a beautiful song with an incredibly imaginative edge i will post the lyrics here maybe it's just me but this is descriptive poetry beyond the pale while it is surreal it is not off the wall his lyrics feel like they make sense even if once can't make the connection that is why he is a genius the guilty undertaker sighs the lonesome organ grinder cries the silver saxophones say i should refuse you the cracked bells and washed out horns blow into my face with scorn but it's not that way i wasn't born to lose you i want you i want you i want you so bad the drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep and the saviors who are fast asleep they wait for you and i wait for them to interrupt me drinkin' from my broken cup and ask me to open up the gate for you i want you i want you i want you so bad now all my fathers they've gone down true love they've been without it but all their daughters put me down 'cause i don't think about it well i return to the queen of spades and talk with my chambermaid she knows that i'm not afraid to look at her she is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see she knows where i'd like to be but it doesn't matter i want you i want you i want you so bad now your dancing child with his chinese suit he spoke to me i took his flute no i wasn't very cute to him was i but i did it though because he lied because he took you for a ride and because time was on his side and because i i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you Bob Dylan Another Side of Bob Dylan Time Out of Mind Blood on the Tracks Infidels Blonde on Blonde Street-Legal The Times They Are A-Changin' Pet Sounds Highway 61 Revisited Empire Burlesque Leonard Cohen Desire (album) Shaggy dog story Jon Secada The Band Paul Is Dead John Wesley Harding (album) Poker jargon Love and Theft Van Morrison Tom Waits Oh Mercy The Amber Spyglass Country music Dylan Thomas The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Tears for Fears The Emancipation of Mimi George Harrison "Weird Al" Yankovic Brian Jones (musician) Poetry Slow Train Coming Salad Fingers Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roy Orbison American Pie (song) Bob Marley Characters in the Smurfs John Berryman Humphrey Bogart Robert Schumann Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Beat generation Theory of conduct The Waterboys Social rule Jack Kerouac Music of the United Kingdom (1950s and 60s) Mark Calaway The Beatles World Gone Wrong The Human Stain Avenue Q The Basement Tapes Anne Rice The Beach Boys Knots Landing Alfred Edward Housman Rod Stewart Garth Brooks Great Teacher Onizuka Robert Browning EastEnders Plame affair Please Please Me AFI 100 Years series Mixtape Planet Waves Milton H.
