what do you think how can you hurt someone who meant the world to you hurt the one that would die for you how can you break her heart to go find someone new and leave her crying hoping she was still the one for you how can you take someone else to your dance not even give her a second chance how can you watch her standing there with tears in her eyes while you dance with that girl to the song that held so many lies how can you live with yourself after what you ve done you promised her she was the only one but then you went and broke her heart and left the pieces on the floor left her life and locked the door now the only man that holds the key will be able to set her heart free my boyfriend of a year broke up with me and asked my best friend to our homecoming dance he and i kept in touch and promised that we would dance together if they played far away which had been our old song when the song came on he looked up at me and said not today and went back to dancing and singing the song to my best friend while i stood there feet away watching them in tears i thought if you knew what the poem was about it would be easier to place yourself in my shoes this poem is strat from the heart and is exactly how i felt that night that's a very nice poem i could almost picture the person while reading it Jon Secada Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Pitaten Fiddler on the Roof Tears for Fears Blood on the Tracks Theory of conduct Hall & Oates Miss Saigon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pip (South Park episode) The Jazz Singer Fancy Crane Shawn Michaels EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Bon Jovi Time Out of Mind The Doctor Dances The Ashlee Simpson Show Sin City Nico Robin The Beatles discography Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Emancipation of Mimi The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Highway 61 Revisited Harry Nilsson Kodocha Sex and the City Knots Landing Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Johnny Appleseed The Inside Unreleased Madonna songs Avenue Q Eddie Guerrero The Catcher in the Rye Bonnie Tyler Friends The Contender (television series) Muslim ibn Aqeel Professional wrestling match types Yehuda Halevi Ray Charles Phil Collins Remix Marching band Professional wrestling holds Socrate Scenes from a Memory Johnny Cash Ocean's Twelve Rent (musical) We Belong Together 50 First Dates Cyndi Lauper Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME About a Boy Titanic (1997 film) Billie Frank A-ha The Parting of the Ways Tori Amos Alfred Edward Housman The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Irish dance DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Kill Bill Roxette StarCraft: Uprising Paul Is Dead Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pok__mon Live!
