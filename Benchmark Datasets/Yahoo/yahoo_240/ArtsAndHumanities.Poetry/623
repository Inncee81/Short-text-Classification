just a poem for a dreary monday girl in black she glide's right on by i caught only a glimpse i'd keep a safe distance if i only had sense her perfume the scent of cleopatra's tears some long lost aroma like a sorcerer's fears her sin pale perfect as white as a dove on each of her hands a long black lace glove how could i go without ever seeing her as she walked by a faint dusting of myrhh like a shadow she seemed all dressed in black one touch from her lips i felt panic attack with just that one kiss she had set in her hook a wind at that moment my whole body shook the skies opened up and it started to rain just then i noticed my head racked with pain my shadow was gone and with her it seems not only my heart she had stolen my dreams wow wow wow wow absloutely captivating beautiful i love you marilyn your angel of san juan The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marilyn Monroe The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Darth Vader AFI 100 Years series Perfume Sin City Academy Award for Costume Design Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography K' YuYu Hakusho The Shining (film) The Subtle Knife Kate Bush Henri Murger The Curse of Fenric Book of Isaiah Professional wrestling throws Shen Gong Wu Timeline of alternative rock Professional wrestling holds Characters in the Smurfs The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Queen (band) Salad Fingers Cliff Richard Naruto jutsu Alice's Adventures in Wonderland John the Baptist Frankie Laine Alaga__sia One Piece minor characters Saga (band) Palindrome Shaggy dog story Taikyoku shogi Timeline of heavy metal Milton H.
