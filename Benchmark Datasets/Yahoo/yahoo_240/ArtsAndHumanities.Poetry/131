is this more likely to be a poem or a rhymed thought honestly like the star when it glitters in a velvet night like the sun when it dawns to make a day bright like the moon s beam that comforts a heart in the dark like the lighthouse that shores at night light and mark and like what no words can ever describe to me he is and if my growing love i did hide i was scared i won t be his does he know that all my thoughts are centred upon him does he know that he s the only one my life did rebegin alas for me feelings towards him he tends to ignore a sweet sister a friendly friend or a love he s still not sure but if he once opened his eyes he ll see just me whose feelings for him did rise and before him never felt that happy whether he ll stay or not he still needs some time to think but if he asked me i ll say i ll be always there before his eyes blink i ve lost the key of the carved closed box in my chest and my restless tired and roaming soul now deserves a rest if he chose to be away then my blocked box he s to break if he chose to be away i ll do before him but for whose sake with tears streaming on my heart i ll tell him you re free to go i ll utter it not because i m weak for my weakness did my strength show heartily i ll be happy for him whatever his sentence will be for alas he is a dream that will not turn to be a reality i think it has potential but you should read it over and do some revising i mean this as constructive criticism maybe you should avoid all that twisting of phrases such as that shores at night light and mark this rearrangement doesnt make it seem any more poetic im not saying get rid of all the pharses that are written this way but maybe a few but you have a lot of talent you should be so proud of your work Jon Secada Sin City Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass John Berryman Rent (musical) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shen Gong Wu Poetry Blink-182 The Beatles discography W.I.T.C.H.
