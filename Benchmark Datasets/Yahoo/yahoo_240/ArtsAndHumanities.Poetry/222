check out my new poem the optimist and comment please the optimist this restaurant crowded with intelligence and bourbon clinking of glasses never hard enough to break but damn near david s favorite restaurant and he always ordered a cherry coke he could knot the cherry s stem among other things with his tongue this is how i justified him this house crowded with lifestyles and hairspray each held apart from the others but not separate my mother and father years before they met sat under trees and bent over diaries planning my brother s first birthday and the sun streaks in my hair this is how i justified them so i have a brother who never smiles in photographs and parents who wish their son was more like his sister david doesn t remember my name but i bet he remembers how to tie those cherry stems i m thinking of a lesson an optimist once taught me life is a bowl of cherries i d like to ask him how he figures oh geez it's actual poetry maybe you should think about getting a deviantart account if you don't already have one they'll appreciate you there but fantastic job anyways Friends Knots Landing House of Bourbon Wood Brian Jones (musician) Anne Boleyn Shaggy dog story EastEnders Ludwig Wittgenstein Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron Weasley Pitaten Good Times Badly Drawn Kitties Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Epistemology Ty Cobb Great Teacher Onizuka W.I.T.C.H.
