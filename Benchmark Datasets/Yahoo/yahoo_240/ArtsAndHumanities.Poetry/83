a poem i wrote one night think its any good well its more than characters maybe i can split it up we are the paupers that would be king if we held in crushing grip the truth in our right hands the world and our left the heavens we become so that we may envy and become those that may envy us with hollow abandon we strive for these shallow dreams and earthly ideals if only the poor man pleads if only you gave me what was bestowed upon those that would bestow upon me nothing nothing but the pitiful answers that i have no need of if only the rich man pleads if only you gave me what was bestowed upon those that would credit me with nothing nothing but empty performance alas if only the prophet pleads if only i could change the way these people breathe the air and see the land removing their empty shallow ways if only the wife pleads if only i could make of myself the reflection of what you made them through your will never to be the shadow but what they see at eye if only the sinful man pleads if only you gave me what was bestowed upon those that would waste away their chance and scorn those that envy the true sinners we are truly the stuffed men the hollow men but lo upon the mightiest river beheld will be issued judgment upon the melancholy souls worst not their fate but the epiphany presented there for behold every man s burden be known that without envy or prosecution of another in crushing grip truth in your right hand the world and the heavens in your left i do agree that it is pretty long but nothing compared to my favorite poet t s eliot first off i'd like to tell you that i loved the whole theme and the entire thing was great over all the use of words was great it seems very negative and the mixed meanings are all portrayed very nicely the use of characters in the manner used is great once again over all it was wonderful Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Summa Theologiae Ten Commandments Philo Repentance The Amber Spyglass Angel Hell Paradise Lost Israel ben Eliezer Urantia Theodicy Divine grace Trinity Cliff Richard Sin Fallen angel Sola fide Four Quartets Eastern Orthodox Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Revelation Love Meaning of life John the Baptist Salvation Philipp Melanchthon Zohar Jacob Victor Hugo Microeconomics Wood carving Michael (archangel) Qiyamah Bhagavad Gita King James Version of the Bible Christian eschatology Slow Train Coming Soul Amidah Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand The Pilgrim's Progress Simone Weil 613 mitzvot Christopher Marlowe Demon Justification (theology) Italian literature Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Phaedo Rich Mullins Predestination Jewish eschatology Psychopannychism Macbeth Book of Mormon Sin City Priesthood (Mormonism) Noah Zhao Yun Hades Genesis Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Clement of Alexandria Conan the Barbarian Knots Landing Holocaust theology The Mikado Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Gospel of Thomas Gautama Buddha Humphrey Bogart Hanshan Dovber of Mezeritch The Great Gatsby Christian apologetics Maimonides Miracle Ezekiel Satan Godspell Religion A Course In Miracles Atomism Idolatry Reality
