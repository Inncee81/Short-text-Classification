an artists statement you may wonder why is a person so critical if you want to pursue writing like golf or another distant hobby then do so if you want to be serious you take your writing to the most critical person you know hemingway for instance sought out gertrude stein for the very sake of tearing his writing to pieces which by the way she did mercilessly and hemingway grow so broadly so fast that he thanked her eternally for her help if i come across as full of hubris or condescending its because i have already endured years of criticism and i wish to expose those here who seek real constructive criticism that will give them opposing perspective to the voice of the devil's advocate it's nothing personal its not an ego trip as i once thought it to be with my mentors its for the sake of what's on the page which is all that matters to someone who really gives a damn about producing quality lines go in peace i respect and criticize everyone i read this was written in response to someone calling me out for being a dick because they openly supported a poem i thought was ego obsessed and they aired private communiques in a public forum to make me look like a dick i really care but im not that nice you can get nice at subway toasted i don't disagree with your comments here if someone wants to get better at a skill they need critique from people that know what they're talking about i've seen a few of your critiques and they seem to be very constructive i actually think you're pretty fair with them you seem to focus on one or two things that the writer can work on i mean it's pointless to show everything wrong in a piece people can only revise according to their skill level hemminway was a genius he likely had great skills when he went to stein so he could benefit from the ruthless detail in the critique when i think of my own writing i'm still gaining the skills necessary to understand the critique i expect improvement to come in stages not because my ego couldn't handle it all at once but because i frankly wouldn't benefit from the critique fully my skills are laboring to catch up ya fundamentally isn't a workshop site some people use it for that but in most cases do you like my poem means please affirm what i'm feeling and me as a person i pass over most vanity posts i only like commenting if i really see something interesting there or if i feel the person wants honest feedback to get better i know you sent something private and didn't expect it to be aired publically i can respect that in the defense of the other person though people comment for different reasons i don't feel that the individual in question panders or flatters he simply likes what he likes i am glad though that you do give good critiques in your comments we can use more people like that here those of us whose goal is to improve their writing Theory of conduct Plame affair Extreme Programming Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory Supply-side economics Scientology beliefs and practices Libertarianism Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism John Howard Yoder Deconstruction Philosophy of language Intelligent design movement Property (ownership right) Teach the Controversy A Course In Miracles Liberalism Criticism of libertarianism Postmodernity Current teachings of Prem Rawat Gertrude Stein Religion Nicomachean Ethics Humphrey Bogart Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Immanuel Kant Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Transactional analysis Religious Society of Friends Internet troll Past teachings of Prem Rawat Ernest Hemingway Intelligent design William A.
