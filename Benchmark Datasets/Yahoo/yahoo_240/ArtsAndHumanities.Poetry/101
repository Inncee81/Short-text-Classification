poem not yet mine please critique i laid here beside you one night in the dark longing to hear your heartbeat and feel your touch knowing that your heart wasn't yet mine i gently placed my arm around you that night and lightly pressed my body to yours just to feel the warmth of your body against mine a promise i had made this promise that for you i kept to not take what i wanted as mine when my hand touched yours you tucked it under your own and that night my heart was no longer mine rick kinda on the right track but it's more that he wasn't ready for the committment and she was and her heart is already deeply involved here's my one question for you does this poem work on multiple levels or does it just relate an event it's not enough to tell us about something you need to have some revelation about the event i would challenge you to rethink this and attempt to take it to the next level that would be the sum total of my critique i hope it helps in some way take care Milton H.
