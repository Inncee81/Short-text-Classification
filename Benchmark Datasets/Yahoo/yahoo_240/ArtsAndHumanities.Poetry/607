does this poem get the message across or is it too defined of a lakeside all thrush's song and ripple's dance such beauty should yet cannot enchant you brought you here and dare not go but with all your rush you cannot know peace falls so near yet not so deep you focus on ends not this waking sleep but someday soon or someday late you know you'll return when time can wait you'll count no hours you will not know a race you've learned to sigh long and you can know this place tell me the good the bad and the ugly please as well as answering my qustion thanks i like the cadence and the tone here line feels a little clunky with the meter line did you mean to say you brought you here it's a bit confusing using the you pronoun twice in general i'd like to see more imagery throughout the poem i like stanza four quite a bit i think your strong stanzas are one and four i feel the middle of the poem needs a bit of clarity don't take this as harsh i can tell that you can write it's just that i feel you open up with two wonderful images there is a sublime sense to the poem and then it gets a little vague for me i don't know if that ramble helps i hope it did in some way Poetry Jon Secada The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Infidels Meter (poetry) Four Quartets Time Out of Mind Social rule Das Lied von der Erde Pok__mon Live!
