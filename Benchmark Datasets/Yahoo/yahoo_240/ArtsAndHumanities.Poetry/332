haiku for the heat i know many of you live in warmer climes but vermont infrequently climbs above the mark today it went above if it were possible to live in a meat locker i would consider it so here's my horray for the heat degrees in vermont heat stills the world like snowfall small breezes come through leaves become unhappy wind chimes dog pants lays at my feet sighs dry earth tinged air pulled expelled i shake my glass balsamic and raspberry rickey hides in ice book computer tinged with damp watering waits for later phone calls go ignored let thoughts laze pass by unharmed days pass winter will come this moment recalled here past history obscureb this is lovely i'm not going to suggest word changes because i don't often critique haiku and i don't want to suggest alterations to what is already well written but i do have to ask if it would be possible to recast yourself in the moment of this poem and say more outside of haiku i e write another poem using this as the basis but not in haiku something that allows you to expand you're so darned good at this maybe it is just the nature of haiku but so much feels unexplored for me here it as if there is unleashed potential in some of your lines maybe i am missing the point the observation of heat stilling the world like snowfall was an actual transportation for me it awoke me to the feeling of peace i feel in the winter when new snow has painted the dreary greys and browns of dormancy with the innocence just before new life emerges and i can hear the sandy sound of those hairs brushing across a drum's kettle as the leaves reiterate their presence in the breeze another transportation this one audible there is so much memory to this poem yet so much presence of the teller and the telling interesting to see the dry earth reaching up to touch the air instead of the air smothering it is that what you meant and i want that drink now and get yourself a sprinkler and for god's sake put a rotating fan on the patio and get ice cubes for that precious dog who for a brief moment reminded me exactly of you and right who would intercept thoughts on a day like today way too much effort which gets me to my next thought this looked effortless and i hope it was not because it had so many sensory elements about the ending and this is probably just me but after almost getting sensorily drunk reading this it was almost inconsequential i can't quite relegate what i experienced to here past history all in all a beautiful poem you belong at www criticalpoet com thanks for sharing this one margot Haiku Severe weather terminology (United States) Blood on the Tracks Yoga Sutras of Patanjali G-Man (Half-Life) Time Out of Mind Milton H.
