does this poem have good use of imagery it's not really a poem just something random that i might use later it's called first date can you envision what your reading is it descriptive enough with that first kiss he sealed the deal unknowingly right then and there with his crimson lips carressing mine that was the moment he captured my heart and don't get me wrong it wasn't all about the kiss the moments leading up to it were just as special him taking my hand as we strolled on the sidewalk after a sensational dinner infatuated with each other and enraptured with the easy flowing conversation the world around us disappeared we exchanged smiles way too many times to count and laughed at each others jokes consistently whenever i spoke i couldn't help but notice how he stared at me with adoring eyes i stopped in mid sentence to smile as i blushed then continued with the story and whenever he spoke i did the same giving him every ounce of my attention thinking to myself could he be any more perfect for the record i know this is not a poem it's more like a start to a short story or novel it's a good start but i have a few suggestions to make it into a poem you just have to cut a couple phrases and it will flow really nice like right then and there also break up the lines in to stanzas keep up the writing i really love the line crimson lips carressing mine lovely imagery Shaggy dog story Whose Line Is It Anyway?
