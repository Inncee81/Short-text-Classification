my poem his curse comments there was once a man who had some great vision in taking his time with every decision but there were some who pulled at his leg who cried to him and then they would beg he knew in his heart what they really wished for when push came to shove they wanted to score he was born with a curse which tore him apart it was known far and wide that he had a great heart they all sure did try to give it a go hoping his money to them it would flow he usually tried to help those in need hoping their word was true and not greed but in the end he always gave in in his mind saying no was surely a sin he always found out their words were not true they never paid back like they said they would do and there came a day when his wealth went away not many more would come and would stay it came to him clearly when those days were done the ones who came calling they wanted none not bad at all it needs a little tidying but you have a grasp of the basics such as rhyme and meter and the message is clear keep writing and read as much good poetry as you can well done Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Original sin John Berryman Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sydney Riot of 1879 Miss Saigon Poetry Muslim ibn Aqeel Japanese poetry The Dunciad The Contender (television series) Justification (theology) Norway national football team Repentance Socrates Hip hop collaborations Ten Commandments Alliterative verse Book of Mormon One Tree Hill (TV series) Phoebe Halliwell Ra (board game) Yehuda Halevi The Hunting of the Snark Christianity Rhyme Book of Isaiah Dean Koontz Tenshinhan Meter (poetry) Discordianism Odyssey Escape from New York Apology (Plato) Ernest Hemingway Fancy Crane The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Tommy Atkins Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist John the Baptist Infant baptism Vishnu sahasranama Macbeth Richard Rahl The Amazing Race Cao Cao One Piece minor characters Kaliyan Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Band Numerology Babe Ruth Medieval Welsh literature Merit The Times They Are A-Changin' Charles Bukowski Paradise Lost Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alfred Edward Housman 1919 World Series Literature Cleveland Browns Eschatology Beowulf Rais massacre Avenue Q Water polo The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Huineng John Skelton Bhagavad Gita Rabindranath Tagore Niccol__ Machiavelli Marina Tsvetaeva Adam Mickiewicz Parsifal George Fox The Amber Spyglass Alaga__sia Kodocha The nature of God in Western theology Godspell Prophet Confessio Amantis Anglo-Saxon literature EastEnders Theory of conduct Anselm of Canterbury Summa Theologiae Michael J.
