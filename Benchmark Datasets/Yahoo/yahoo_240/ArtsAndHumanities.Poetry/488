help me edit i tend to write without even thinking then go back and move lines around ect i'm kind of stuck on this one at the moment it's ironic because it's about not caring about other peoples opinions and yet here i am wanting yours again poetry what is mine is not yours once i have filled the page not a thing you can do with your ink will change it commas and hyphens run ons and periods less than perfect grammar the few errors in prose these scars define only the face of my poetry the outward appearance some call it ugly i call it character ok my thoughts i don't like the second part it just doesn't sit well also thought i would change character to beautiful then changed my mind again thoughts and opinions please some call it ugly i call it true stay away from clear cut dichotomies like cold hot fast slow etc to me since you are trying to minimize the importance of form grammar and standard modes of presentation in poetry i don't see why you've chosen four line stanzas the slant rhyme and meter are your best asset so far so i would concentrate on making it a sound poem you have also slimmed your audience down to the people who understand grammar and typical poetic conundrums and of the people who can appreciate poetry thats not so large a portion as we would like to believe ultimately instead of approaching this idea from what is mine is not yours but you have failed to answer what is yours i dont get hung up on grammar or capitalization either so if thats how you roll what are you about that is what i think is missing from your poem and what will fill out your dialectic you have your antithesis and you already have your synthesis though it is rather abrupt so the hard part is already done technical crap restating the face of your poetry as outward appearance is cliche and degrades the interesting image of a poem having a face i would further describe your face as opposed to restating your metaphor the first two stanzas are strong except the line not a thing you can do which is vague change your vocabulary get more specific and you can sell this keep on rocking in the free world babe Poetry Literature Meter (poetry) Alliterative verse Screenwriting Noam Chomsky John Berryman English grammar Translation Biblical poetry Theory of conduct Poetic diction English language Philosophy of language Dialectic Urdu Perl Song The nature of God in Western theology Tamil language Anglo-Saxon literature Imagism Aesthetic Realism Microeconomics Socrates Extreme Programming Sant Mat Finnish language Italian literature Chinese language Novel English literature Deconstruction H.D.
