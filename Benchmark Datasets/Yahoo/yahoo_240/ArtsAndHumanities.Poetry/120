hi i need opinons on my poem these thoughts keep reoccurring in the depths of my mind and every coincidence is an excuse for a sign the way that every heart beat is right on cue and the things i never had to tell you because you already knew the clearest of blurs that i have ever seen in the perceivers eye is yet but a dream the intimacy in our senses while we secretly switch glances tell me there is a reason you are worth taking these chances the way that you make me feel so fey like i can confide in you through out a single bleak day like the sun could deteriorate but you could hold out its rays it could all merely be a wrong perception a map i was given with no direction a path only created for a physical reason like a leaf that will disappear come the winter season for lust or for touch or for some other meaningless cause along with all this doubt that if i stay around will you notice my flaws still i long to sit upon your knees as if they were a kings thrown to have you blanket your arms around me and keep me sheltered and warm in between my company of trash and saints you are the calm of the water that is keeping me sane intentions unknown no sticks without stones just me these false hopes high with that fear of disappointment and being left out to dry too long Time Out of Mind Jon Secada K' Causality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daredevil Philosophical skepticism Poker jargon Yoga Sutras of Patanjali God Emperor of Dune Social rule Weather lore Textile manufacturing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Epistemology Deconstruction God and gender The Church Autism Love War of the Worlds (television) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dualism (philosophy of mind) Direct realism Religion Snooker Lucid dreaming Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Infantilism Treehouse of Horror V Glossary of partner dance terms Alexander Technique Scientific method Pitaten Falsifiability Alaga__sia Negima G-Man (Half-Life) Denis Law The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Ten Commandments Satchel Paige Philosophy of perception Kain (Legacy of Kain) Atheism Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The nature of God in Western theology Metaphysics Maurice Merleau-Ponty Peter Shilton Physical intimacy Enneagram David Bowie Swingout Diving Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sigmund Freud Sabbath Francisco Hern__ndez de C__rdoba (discoverer of Yucat__n) Neuro-linguistic programming Theodicy The Dunciad Tlingit Appeasement Narrator Naruto jutsu Psychoanalysis Philosophy of mathematics William II of England Japanese tea ceremony Duties of the Heart Ra (board game) Vipassana Blood on the Tracks Professional wrestling throws Existence of God 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Aerial (dance move) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Domestic violence One Piece minor characters Tag Aikido Milton H.
