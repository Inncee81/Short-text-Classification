when we two departed what does this poem make you think of okay so when i first read this poem i fell in love with it what does it make you think of when we two departed when we two parted in silence and tears half broken hearted to sever for years pale grew thy cheek and cold colder thy kiss truly that hour foretold sorrow to this the dew of the morning sank chill on my brow it felt like the warning of what i feel now thy vows are all broken and light is thy fame i hear thy name spoken and share in its shame they name thee before me a knell to mine ear a shudder comes o'er me why wert thou so dear they know not i knew thee who knew thee too well long long shall i rue thee too deeply to tell in secret we met in silence i grieve that thy heart could forget thy spirit deceive if i should meet thee after long years how should i greet thee with silence and tears lord byron freezes me absolutely and scares me how can anything be more painful than having to stay in the shadow for both love and death and what can be more painful than the fact that sometimes you cannot make the difference between love and death besides there's a good question why wert thou so dear don't we always wonder that but i find it absolutely wonderful the way the poet brings together light and darkness past and future or a future that is nothing but a continnuous rememberance of the past and how subtle he keeps the silence the secret with every word but then it's lord byron Ten Commandments Matthew 5 Jon Secada Bhagavad Gita Shakespeare's sonnets Virgin Mary in Islam Fallen angel Amidah Thou Joseph of Arimathea David and Jonathan Requiem Stabat Mater The Dunciad Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eternal Father, Strong to Save Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Hamilton College Newfoundland The Amber Spyglass Yehuda Halevi O Canada Darth Vader Wiccan Rede Weapons of Middle-earth Trinity James Forrestal God Save the Queen Scenes from a Memory Kain (Legacy of Kain) Apostasy Hidden Words Gospel of Barnabas Rabindranath Tagore Slayers Mary, the mother of Jesus Hamlet Time Out of Mind The Subtle Knife Shaggy dog story Book of Isaiah Rowland Taylor Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Contrition Psychopannychism Famous last words Tulane University George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Sin City Vampire fiction Carrie Jacobs-Bond Socrates W.I.T.C.H.
