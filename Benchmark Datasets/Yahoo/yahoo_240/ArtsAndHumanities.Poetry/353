it's been a while but i have another one my world's end by yoselis ramos i open my eyes looking at what sorrounds me darkness a lone heart an empty soul my feet drag me through the dark space i feel cold air splashing my face the reality of my heart unfilled brings rain pouring on me i've been kissed by far worse than death but by cupid this vicious fiend is the reason for my mourn of love i met his crystal eyes and the end of life i was dazed hypnotized and completely his his voice the melody to my soul his smile light to all my fears my world filled with pink and butterflies soon to be a living hell a fray against reality dreaming you would once look my way drawing my sword but the shot already going through my flesh simply knowing i will never be a part of your heart brought the end to my world thank you person for your suggestions they really are helpfull and i definately agree with the ponctuation but i've seen a lot of people on here who dont prefer the periods and the commas but you're right thank you hi so you enjoy poetry and you ask of my opinion hm well can ya take it like a poet maybe lol now don't take meh wrong i love da poem it has meaning and depth but a few suggestions maybe here first i would add in a lil' more punctuation example i met his crystal eyes and the end of life i was dazed hympnotized and completely his his voice the melody to my soul his smile light to all my fears my world filled with pink and butterflies soon to be a living hell see doesn't the punctuation create beneficial pauses and do wonders for ya poem now the his voice and the his smile i understand that by doing this twice you're attemtping to add in some style which is good but the thing sorta takes away from the poeticness lol here i'd do his voice so soft the melody to my soul his smile so bright light to all my fears the three dots give it style as well but don't take attention from the poem as much as the see what i mean well do what you want just lettin' ya know my opinion but good job keep writin' edit no problem any time The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
