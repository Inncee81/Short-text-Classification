poem called have a heart what do ya think tappin' my feet on the soft carpet enjoying my chair twirlin' round my fingers my blond hair lookin' outside i see a fire truck thank the lord for my safety realizing my luck i say a silent prayer for everyone in need praying the world will take heed outside i see a beggar looking poor gave him a hundred and drove him to the store told him my address because he needs a place to stay i tell him stop by any day driving home i see two people in a wreck wrote them each checks you don't see good deeds too often maybe our hearts need to soften you have a surface control of rhyme a brain something of a way with words not great something then you disgrace yourself like nothing of what you said was important or lasting you twirl your hair as you diss the tragedy happening all around you but then u say u say a prayer and then you go on to describe how you buy off tragedy and then you tell the reader you did a good deed and we need to be more sympathetic i don't know your point of view do you Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tommy Atkins Sharon Tate Customs and etiquette of Japan Past teachings of Prem Rawat Vishnu sahasranama Onam Mass (liturgy) Paul Is Dead Hard disk Thermal power station Holy Spirit The Inside Bilal ibn Ribah Amidah Leaf Qiyamah Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jewish services The Marshall Mathers LP Surveillance Reservoir Dogs Anthony the Great RMS Titanic The Cartridge Family Tulsidas RuneScape quests Storytelling Korban Hymn Jacob Neusner Reaction to the assassination of John F.
