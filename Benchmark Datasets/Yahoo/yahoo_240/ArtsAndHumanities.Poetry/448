this is another poem i wrote you folks do such a great job thought it would be interesting to get your take i make excuses thousands upon thousands i lost count years ago i excuse you even though there isn t one big enough to cover your sin or my bruises so what then start all over tomorrow lose count again hold you accountable yeah right as if there is a method to stop your need no determination to destroy whatever comes your way out of my mouth my mouth that used to want to engulf to praise everything about you and now just wants to spit you out and wash away the taste of salt and bitterness somehow i see you still what you ve tried to hide from me underneath the sarcasm the blood covered words i see your beauty this has not been changed since the day i sat down and scribbled it out i was in a hurry and angry obviously so don't tell me it's ranting i already know i also know how i'm planning to refine it my question is what would you do with it i love to see different styles best answer to whoever comes closest to what i have in mind or convinces me there's a better way i like the energy of the poem and the last five lines provide a nice turn by showing a different perspective without really shifting moods the two main refinements i think you can make would be to fine tune some of the language and to consider playing with line length for language some of what you have written can be compacted e g wash away the taste of salt and bitterness could simply be wash away the salt and bitterness without losing any meaning and some can be clarified e g to stop your need no determination to destroy whatever comes your way out of my mouth is a little confusing to me is he trying to destroy what you say or your ideas hopes love or something else also the line to engulf to praise is a bit much to put in one line not in a prudish sense but simply in trying to pack in both lust and verbiage in that same place these are examples but it's worth working through the whole poem to see what can be tightened or clarified as for line length i am not averse to skinny poems here though the energy seems a bit inhibited by the form as though the driving reason is simply a desire for short lines some lines contain discrete thoughts while other ideas spill over several lines with no real reason i can see for breaking where you do some of the passion you put into the poem gets choked off as a result i hope we get to see the revision this is a great first draft Microeconomics Philosophy of language Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Extreme Programming Photography David Hume Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Vampire Jean Grey Originalism Mathematics Haven (TNG episode) Epistemology Causality Euphemism Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles God Emperor of Dune The Smoking Room G__del's incompleteness theorem Korban Tenshinhan Simone Weil Deconstruction Origin belief Meaning of life Sinfest Theory of conduct Quantum mechanics Novel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Summa Theologiae Milton H.
