a few questions about poetry i love writing poetry i have been writing poems for about years and i have won an award for one of my poems however i find it hard to write about something that i have not experienced myself maybe it's because i do not know what it's like being in other peoples shoes i don't know but how can i be more creative and step out of my shoes and into another persons another question is how can i get rid of writers block because i get it very often thanks if you're anything like me when you get writers block it's because you're attempting to force it and write on demand when this happens the most important thing to do is relax listen to music go take a walk somewhere if you must write don't try to write a complete piece just free write observations lines whatever comes to mind and save those snippets somewhere i often recognize new ideas from those fragments later to your first question while it's true that the more things you experience the more things you will be able to write about there are many things you would never want to experience and still will want to take a crack at i substitute lack of knowlege on a subject by interviewing people just asking questions so how did that make you feel wow what was that like etc observations of strangers or the world reading about it i just did a poem on howard hughes recently on this site i would hope never to experience his madness i'm reading through his notes memoirs and journals to get into his mindset and finally relate emotions and events you have felt to the other foreign emotion for example if someone close to you hasn't died yet but you want to write a poem about that focus on some loss you have experienced friend moving away divorce etc and transfer that emotion to the other event well i think i've rambled enough i hope some of that's helpful to you good luck with your writing take care Poetry Beat generation Arthur Machen Theodicy A Course In Miracles Psychoanalysis Social rule George Oppen Out-of-body experience Sampling (music) Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Aesthetic Realism Polyamory John Berryman Socrates Milton H.
