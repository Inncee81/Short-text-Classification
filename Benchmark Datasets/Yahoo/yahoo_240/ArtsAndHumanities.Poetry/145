i don't understand the poem a song on the end of the world http www peakdesign com peak ram polsong htm this is the poem i don't understand this poem at all what is the writer trying to say please write an alanysis for me so i can understand the poem i just read the poem and think that its beautiful now i'm no expert and not even remotely qualified to analyse a poem i only love poems and enjoy reading writing them but if were to guess at the meaning i would say that it has alot to do with what he feels about his surroundings at that time i mean it being the end of ww and in warsaw where alot of people were persecuted i guess anyone would have thoughts of the world's end or impending doom but despite all of those negative factors that were undoubtedly going on he still has a pretty positive outlook i think if he can write about such mundane and serendipitous things as animals' activities music floating to the heavens and a sailboats narrowing proximity to some island it also sends the subliminal and timeless message that no matter what life goes on and that the main theme is disguised a bit by the obvious theme that the end of the world here refers to the war and the words the prophetic old man repeats no other end of the world there will be this i believe is the hope of the writer that there shall never more be a war of such magnitude or this could all just be his the writer's notion of how the end of the world will be not like what is always predicted in holy books and sci fi movies that instead of chaotic uncontrollable storms or cryptic signs there will just be a simple even gentle expiration of the world almost unnoticed by all except the other worldly wise individuals quite like one dies peacefully in their sleep contented and painless Four Quartets Book of Isaiah Christian eschatology A Course In Miracles Anne Rice Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The nature of God in Western theology Poetry The writing of Principia Mathematica Yehuda Halevi Science Leonard Cohen E.
