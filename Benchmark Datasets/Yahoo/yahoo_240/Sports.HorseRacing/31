when you are riding a horse what is it called when you are riding a horse normally like on a saddle with your legs on both sides because there is side saddle bareback and thanks i don't believe there's a general term for riding in a saddle with one leg on each side there are many disciplines of riding in which you're in a saddle with one leg on each side and i believe instead of a general term we use many specific terms for whatever discipline the rider is doing the two blanket terms for riding are western and english if you're riding in the big saddle with the horn it's western if it's a smaller saddle without the horn it's english but even then there's many many different things you could be doing with your horse if western you might be doing western pleasure horsemanship trail riding running barrels or poles cattle cutting or some other ranch type event if english you might be doing jumping or just flatting and you might be using a wide variety of saddles hunt seat saddle seat dressage personally instead of saying that i'm riding normally with one leg on each side of the saddle instead i say that i'm flatting or hacking or jumping my hunter actually i believe if you just say that 'i'm riding my horse' most people would understand that to mean riding normally with a saddle the other two are less common most people ride normally with a saddle that's why there's no name for it it's not really special it's not uncommon Horse Cowboy Horse tack Equine conformation Equitation Show jumping Western Saddle Comanche Arabian horse Dressage Hunt seat Horse gait Eventing Rodeo Rail terminology Horse show American Quarter Horse Bicycle Skateboarding trick American Bison Appaloosa Archery King Ranch Seabiscuit Standardbred horse Stirrup John Wayne Bullfighting Tank locomotive Tennessee Walker Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Bicycle frame Thoroughbred Bull riding Connemara pony Thoroughbred horse race Windsurfing Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Cavalry Charreada Breaker Morant Martingale (tack) Paragliding Cowboy boot Bridle Kitesurfing Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Clarinet Unicorn Trail Mountain biking Tour de France Steer wrestling Traveller (horse) Arizona Territory Pistol Switzerland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Zion National Park Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ostrich United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Bow (weapon) Fast bowling Noseband National Finals Rodeo American Saddlebred Horse breaking Tai shogi Glossary of climbing terms Crop (implement) Western (genre) Ammonite Dog agility Charisma (horse) Chris LeDoux United Kingdom horse-racing Professional wrestling aerial techniques Selkirk Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Fox hunting Snowboarding Western music (North America) Aerial (dance move) Captain Thunderbolt Belmont Park Native Americans in the United States Coney Island Spanking Chu shogi American Old West Chariot Surfing Livestock Milton H.
