i want a horse kind of but my trainer turns down every single one whats should i do i sorta kinda want a horse but everytime i find what seems like the perfect horse my trainer always has something to say about it like this one horse i found on the internet that was a good horse for beginners learning how to jump and is really good with kids but she said that it would be a difficult horse so should i just wait or just try to keep finding that perfect horse maybe because you only kind of want a horse maybe your trainer knows you're not ready for one for real yet but even so there's a balance it's ultimately your choice your trainer can't tell you no but if i were you i'd trust their advice especially if you're buying from the internet people can say whatever they want about what they're selling and it may not be true your trainer should know what's best maybe ask them to direct you to some trusted breeders suppliers if you ask your trainer for advice they can help you find a good one Horse breaking Horse Rich Mullins Microeconomics Horse gait Weight training Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dog training Quake III Arena Cliff Richard Horse racing Pok__mon Trading Card Game Eventing Socrates Battle Frontier Supply and demand Thoroughbred horse race Trojan horse (computing) Obedience training Taikyoku shogi Breeders' Cup GunZ The Duel Radio controlled airplane Seabiscuit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Smarty Jones Sunday Silence Equine conformation Dog agility Theodicy Martial art Cattle A Course In Miracles Boxing training Pok__mon (anime) Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Girls Aloud Missingno.
