ty cobb hitting people say ted williams is the only one to hit in a season but what about ty cobb didn't he do it like three times in his career was it because these season were strike shortened or something so they didnt count those people are greatly misinformed williams was the last or as i prefer to put it most recent to hit a qualifying batting average and that was in it was easier for the media to talk about ted than the other guys because he was still with us until and was always willing to talk about baseball and give good quote skipping past the th century ce guys we have these men who hit lajoie hof once hornsby hof three times sisler hof twice cobb hof three times jackson ineligible once williams hof his one time heilmann hof once and terry hof once over a five year period hornsby batted and for a aggregate you can pick your jaw up off the floor now think how hard hitting is if it took ted williams at the peak of his skills to do it i'd love to see it happen just once in my lifetime but have no expectations it will it would take someone with bonds class plate discipline in hitter cuddly coors field to have a chance Ty Cobb Batting average Babe Ruth Rogers Hornsby Ted Williams George Sisler Home run Baseball Shoeless Joe Jackson Tris Speaker World Series October 4 in baseball Rickey Henderson Nap Lajoie Satchel Paige Hank Aaron History of baseball in the United States Tony Gwynn San Diego Padres Chicago White Sox St. Louis Cardinals Detroit Tigers Lou Gehrig Baseball Hall of Fame W.
