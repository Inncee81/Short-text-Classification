will mets or yankees make it in the playoffs will they win it i would much rather the mets but i think that both teams will make the playoffs the yankees have been very strong since the all star break and the mets are holding on by a thread in their division they will have trouble staying in first with the phillies and braves on their heels and they also have the same amount of making the playoffs as not making them i still think both teams have a really good chance of making the playoffs New York Mets World Series Philadelphia Phillies Houston Astros October 4 in baseball Joe Torre International League New York Yankees Cincinnati Reds Oakland Athletics Atlanta Braves Los Angeles Dodgers St. Louis Cardinals October 5 in baseball San Francisco Giants October 16 in baseball Pete Rose 1957 World Series Tim McCarver Hank Aaron Pennant playoff 2004 American League Championship Series Toronto Blue Jays Chicago Cubs Florida Marlins Robin Ventura October 21 in baseball Interleague play Curse of the Bambino October 12 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim October 1 in baseball October 7 in baseball October 13 in baseball Cleveland Indians Detroit Tigers Tom Seaver Reggie Jackson September 2005 in sports 1986 National League Championship Series 2005 World Series October 8 in baseball Davey Johnson October 10 in baseball Montr__al Expos October 3 in baseball New Jersey Nets Pittsburgh Steelers Milwaukee Brewers 1996 World Series Playoff Alex Rodriguez October 20 in baseball Arizona Diamondbacks Jesse Orosco October 15 in baseball September 20 in baseball November 2 in baseball Cleveland Browns Bernie Williams Seattle Mariners Baltimore Orioles NBA Finals October 27 in baseball Wrigley Field Major League Baseball television contracts 1999 National League Championship Series October 2004 in sports October 26 in baseball National League Curse of the Billy Goat Houston Rockets June 2 in baseball Darryl Strawberry Indiana Pacers Los Angeles Clippers November 3 in baseball Lenny Dykstra American Football League Indianapolis Colts New York Knicks Red Sox Nation Carlos Beltr__n Curt Schilling October 24 in baseball Derek Jeter Tug McGraw Walk-off home run New York Giants 1986 World Series Chicago White Sox John Smoltz Philadelphia Flyers Choke (sports) October 25 in baseball Satchel Paige ESPN25
