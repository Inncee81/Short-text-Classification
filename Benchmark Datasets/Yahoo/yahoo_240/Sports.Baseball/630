does anyone hate barry bonds like me this guy should be kick out of baseball the homerun list follws hank aaron babe ruth willie mays sammy sosa ken griffey jr frank robinson and so on i forgot screw sammy sosa cork back crude piece it would be harmon killebrew instead wow you really sound like you hate bonds i guess maybe it s one of those steroid tests administered by mlb that bonds failed what date was that again ummmm hold on i m thinking i m thinking oh wait i just remembered bonds has never tested positive for steroid use i guess the only thing you can base your hate on is your emotions your suspicions your broken crystal ball your utilization of the george w bush system of logical reasoning a lot of kool aid drinking here what makes you put hank on a pedestal above barry i love hank don t get me wrong but he has used amphetamines he s admitted to using greenies see his book i had a hammer bonds has used amphetamines too and like hank bonds has never failed a test for steroids administered by mlb so why all the barry bashing meg while you think bonds used steroids says it all for you it doesn t prove anything the only thing that separates bonds and aaron are a couple of decades and personalities could it simply be that you guys hate bonds because of what he isn t perhaps because he doesn t shuck and jive for the media maybe because he s had a horrible personality for much of his career he s definitely not the media magnet of say clemens wrapped up in the balco investigation or mcgwire in his heyday but clemens is okay suspicions are not enough for anyone to cast doubt on him but it s enough for barry could it be that barry bonds a black baseball player under suspicion of steroid use is just not as marketable to america as clemens a white pitcher whom everyone forgets is said to have used steroids could it possibly be you guys hate barry because american sports media told you to barry has never been kind to them or maybe you hate him because bud selig wants you to i mean mlb really has lost face for its encouragement of the drug culture of baseball over the last sixty years so what would you do if you were selig i would declare war on steroids but that s not enough you have to have a villain for a war i borrowed this notion from you guessed it the george w bush system of logical reasoning every great leader which selig fancies himself needs their arch nemesis their saddam hussein so for selig that s bonds bonds will be the fall guy the guy that mlb leaves out in the rain the guy that will take the criticism and judgment of the masses so mlb won t have to i mean aside from being emotionally charged after watching sports center and knocking back a bud light have any of you even contemplated why you hate bonds or would even be moved to use such a strong word as hate i m curious to know bonds is just one baseball player among many who live in the culture of american baseball the culture that mlb fashioned over the decades suspicions or not suspicions aside from having a horrible personality what s he done to you to deserve your hate where s the proof Sammy Sosa Baseball World Series Boston Red Sox Bud Selig Babe Ruth Major League Baseball All-Star Game New York Yankees Major League Baseball television contracts Major League Baseball titles streaks Reggie Jackson Baltimore Orioles Negro league baseball St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs San Francisco Giants Rafael Palmeiro Ken Griffey, Jr. Ty Cobb October 4 in baseball Friends Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 MLB on FOX EastEnders September 6 in baseball Pete Rose Alex Rodriguez Detroit Tigers ESPN25 Atlanta Braves Satchel Paige Lou Gehrig Manny Ram__rez The Sporting News Player of the Year Award Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Toronto Blue Jays 2005 World Series Montr__al Expos Baseball Stars Oakland Athletics September 20 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers One Tree Hill (TV series) Wrigley Field Tris Speaker Milwaukee Brewers The Jim Rome Show Sin City New York Mets Hulk Hogan Roger Clemens Knots Landing Washington Nationals Batting order (baseball) July 2004 in sports Babe Ruth's Called Shot 1990s Hank Greenberg October 3 in baseball Theory of conduct Pedro Mart__nez Ben Johnson (athlete) San Diego Padres Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Roger Maris South Park Jackie Robinson Willie Mays Shaggy dog story Muhammad Ali Cincinnati Reds Plame affair Red Sox Nation Montreal Canadiens Pittsburgh Steelers Eric Cartman Andr__s Galarraga 1960s Gary Sheffield Vin Scully Nolan Ryan Seattle Mariners Troy Glaus 2003 Invasion of Iraq
