should matt murphy have to pay taxes on barry bonds' homerun ball for the record i think it is crap that he may have to pay taxes on a baseball for its resonable estimate of value the government already charges us tax on everything else isn't that baseball technically worth about a dollar until he sells it imagine this he pays taxes for its value then he sells it and is taxed again on the income just goes to show that its not just fans trying to get in on the action the government wants in on bonds' fame also what are your thoughts just to add something to those of you who think he should be taxed just for having the ball i believe if he sells tax the crap out of him its income and thats fair why tax an item that has no value until it is sold i work in mortgage its not like he can declare it on a loan application as an asset because value is subjective on something like that however he could declare it as income if he sells it and that can go on the application im just saying dont tax or force him to sell the man for being lucky enough to catch that one food for thought i read the article and makes no sense at all how can you put a tax figure on something that isn't sold always have there hand out for any possibility of a dime i heard yesterday that the ball may not even be worth what they were thinking bonds continues to hit home runs people are going to want his last home run ball the all time record ball plus if bonds is found to have done illegal steroids that will significantly drop the value like i said how can you put a figure on something that hasn't sold make no sense and how can that not be against the law he may never sell it why should he pay taxes on it Taxation in the United States Baseball FairTax Barry Bonds Tax Home run Mortgage Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Softball Microeconomics Babe Ruth Baseball Stars Property tax Municipal bond Flat tax Gross domestic product Annuity Hyperinflation Insurance Major League Baseball Life insurance Tax protester American football Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Glossary of American football Tris Speaker Mutual fund Gold standard Illegal drug trade Boston Red Sox 401(k) Inheritance tax Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Gary Sheffield Craps SCO-Linux controversies Economy of Russia Capital gains tax Satchel Paige Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Citigroup Baseball (object) Government debt Money Security (finance) Baseball scorekeeping Predatory lending Warren Buffett Productive and unproductive labour Topps Jos__ Canseco Surplus value Tennessee State Constitution Baseball statistics Lou Gehrig Treasury security Poker jargon Blackjack Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Public good Mark McGwire Deflation (economics) Mortgage-backed security Personal finance Supply and demand Plame affair Troy Glaus Dale Murphy Income tax Mois__s Alou Income statement Monopoly (game) Government National Mortgage Association Gold as an investment I Want to Hold Your Hand Cincinnati Reds Hank Aaron Tax avoidance/evasion National Insurance Cricket Road pricing Government of Maryland Value added tax Income trust Supply-side economics Tax bracket Wal-Mart Willie Mays Keynesian economics Babe Ruth's Called Shot
