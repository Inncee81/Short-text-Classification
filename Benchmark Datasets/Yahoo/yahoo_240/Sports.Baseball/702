what rat related jokes can i take to angel stadium i'm headed to that vermin infested sports arena in anaheim when the yanks come to town later this month in case you haven't heard they've had health code violations in the last two years for contrast dodger stadium has had only seven in that same time frame i need some funny ideas to stick it to the angel fans that they have a rathole for a sandlot congrats a rod go yankees you could ask them if they like to spank their rally monkeys granted it isn't rat related but i think it is still funny i think i just came up with a couple of rat related jokes ask them if the rats have to pay full price for their seats also ask if the mcdonalds family deal also applies to a family of rats if they were to show up at the game how about this one ask them if a rat is going to be their new official mascot or if it is rat night in angel stadium another suggestion would be to ask if they know any rats that are angels fans Oakland Athletics Babe Ruth Reggie Jackson St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum New York Giants World Series St. Louis Rams Boston Red Sox Angel Stadium of Anaheim Los Angeles Dodgers San Diego Padres Minnesota Twins Yankee Stadium Los Angeles Kings Vin Scully Major League Baseball television contracts Stadium New York Yankees October 2004 in sports New Jersey Nets New York Mets Anaheim, California Milwaukee Brewers Troy Glaus Seattle Mariners Los Angeles, California Dodger Stadium Rally Monkey Damn Yankees October 13 in baseball Red Sox Nation October 5 in baseball 1981 World Series October 19 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Atlanta Braves Darryl Strawberry 2004 American League Championship Series I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue 2005 World Series November 2004 in sports October 4 in baseball Stanley Cup Charles O.
