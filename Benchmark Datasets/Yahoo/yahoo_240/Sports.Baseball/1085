roger clemens suspension does anyone believe that roger clemens and joe torre should be suspended do you think any blue jays should have been suspended i was at the game i don't believe a suspension was appropriate here unless blue jays pitchers are suspended also they started the mess when they didn't catch a easy pop up no matter what arod says you catch the ball then after their own mistake they publicly whine about the play and go after a rod twice plus what a rod did wouldn't physically hurt someone so the retaliation should have been to go out there and beat the crap out of the yankees on their home turf which they couldn't get done either so the baseball gods have spoken and toronto comes up on the short end of the stick Toronto Blue Jays World Series Roger Clemens San Francisco Giants 2001 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts Chicago White Sox Boston Red Sox October 14 in baseball New York Yankees Ty Cobb 2003 World Series Babe Ruth Houston Astros No-hitter Tris Speaker October 15 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series Pedro Mart__nez 1993 World Series October 22 in baseball October 16 in baseball 2005 World Series Alex Rodriguez Red Sox Nation Softball Atlanta Braves Satchel Paige October 17 in baseball Don Mattingly Randy Johnson Pitcher Reggie Jackson November 2004 in sports November 2 in baseball October 4 in baseball Lou Gehrig October 13 in baseball October 20 in baseball Baseball Sandy Koufax International League Detroit Tigers October 25 in baseball Ben Johnson (athlete) Philadelphia Phillies Rogers Centre Home run June 11 in baseball September 20 in baseball November 1 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) 1986 World Series Seattle Mariners Tim McCarver New York Giants Manny Ram__rez Nolan Ryan Interference (baseball) October 2005 in sports Montr__al Expos October 12 in baseball Baseball statistics Kenny Rogers (baseball player) Hank Aaron ESPN25 October 1 in baseball September 2005 in sports Wrigley Field Fay Vincent Cincinnati Reds Minnesota Twins St. Louis Cardinals Bud Selig October 2004 in sports 2004 World Series 1994 baseball strike June 8 in baseball The Sporting News Player of the Year Award Interleague play October 26 in baseball Joe Carter Robin Ventura Polo Grounds Tim Wakefield Joe Torre Charles O.
