barry bonds in pete rose not now that barry bonds has broken the home run record it is being said that this solidifies his trip to cooperstown given that this record will always be overshadowed by the possibility of steroid use is it still fair for pete rose to not receive the invitation to cooperstown based on betting i say you either let them both in or keep them both out to allow bonds in based on hrs and not rose is a travesty separating professional from personal is the key for example dennis rodman was a helluva rebounder and his off the court antics shouldn't take away from his professional accomplishments after reading some of these wonderfully insightful comments i have to insert my opinion betting drug enhancement are both cheating it doesn't matter if you bet on baseball or you cheated on the field with body boosters while i see the difference in what rose did to what bonds has done cheating is cheating if dimaggio mantle nolan ryan or craig biggio cheated in any way betting drugs they should be noted as such we all know bonds took steroids how else can you double in size within years he sure didn't eat big macs everyday you can't hit like that without enhancements mcgwire couldn't do it sosa couldn't do it they cheated and now are ridiculed bonds has stayed silent and that silence to me doesn't excuse him from the obvious overwhelming guilt when he personally testifies i'll perhaps change my mind cheating on the field to me is more damaging than betting rose's ability was astonishing as bonds to exclude rose and include bonds is awful i agree somebody got those hits and that somebody was pete rose it's the hall of fame not the hall of morals Home run Barry Bonds History of baseball in the United States Pete Rose Babe Ruth Sammy Sosa Ty Cobb Mark McGwire ESPN25 St. Louis Cardinals Craig Biggio Lou Gehrig Hank Aaron World Series Baseball Baseball Hall of Fame EastEnders Nolan Ryan New York Yankees Cincinnati Reds Mickey Mantle Jim Rice Houston Astros October 4 in baseball San Francisco Giants Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Willie Mays Whose Line Is It Anyway?
