are mlb pitchers jaked do they have six packs are there legs very very strong im a pitcher and wounder what i should get lol just look a david wells for the six pack lmao but yes they have very powerful legs when i met nolan ryan his legs were like tree trunks and the right side of he torso was more built up then his left just remember pitchers generate their power through their legs but it does help to work the whole body added on next day actually the last guy is wrong i have pitched for years and my legs are strong and i also use to throw a mph and i played college ball and tried out for a few mlb teams but i ended up taking a liner of the skull and i quit playing for a few years if you rely on your arm to generate the power you will end up having a very short career do to arm problems legs are the key you can have skinny legs just as long as they are strong i can lift more then a lot of guys with thicker legs then me so actuall leg size doesn't make a difference hell i will listen to what nolan ryan told me over anything the guy was still throwing at years old andhe said legs are the most important part for a power pitcher Nolan Ryan Pitcher Baseball Sandy Koufax Professional wrestling holds New York Mets Professional wrestling throws Randy Johnson 2005 World Series Softball No-hitter Baseball statistics Negro league baseball World Series Cricket 1957 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Chicago Cubs Roger Clemens Swingout Piccolo Junior Saga Stolen base Baseball Stars Major League Baseball Tris Speaker Satchel Paige Hal Trosky David Wells Equine conformation Doom enemies Volleyball 2004 American League Championship Series Cy Young Professional wrestling attacks Ichiro Suzuki Angel Stadium of Anaheim Win (baseball) Pedro Mart__nez Greg Maddux Ty Cobb June 8 in baseball Fielding (cricket) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Texas Rangers (baseball) Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) 2003 World Series Hank Aaron Babe Ruth Minor league baseball Rugby union positions Barry Bonds Water polo Vegeta Glossary of American football Batting average Brian Close Cincinnati Reds Designated hitter Atlanta Braves Sammy Sosa 2004 World Series Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Sin City Leg before wicket 1919 World Series Tyrannosaurus rex Types of bowlers in cricket Bodyline Earned run average 1987 World Series Bryan Robson Glossary of ballet terms American football Windows XP Strike zone Hit by pitch Rugby union Pete Rose Jim Palmer Weight training Bo Diaz Breaststroke Sport rowing English cricket team Side pass (dance move) New York Yankees Chicago White Sox Diving Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tag Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases
