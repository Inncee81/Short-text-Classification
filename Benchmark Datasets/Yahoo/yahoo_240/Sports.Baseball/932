mlb schedule can some one tell me how do mlb teams play games over a month period how many times a week or month would they have to play to fulfill this schedule because games over months seems a little more complicated than an game month schedule in the nba or a game month schedule in the nfl i'm not so sure but i think the reason mlb teams have so many games is baseball is not as physically demanding ad football or basketball no offense to baseball players i think it works out to games over days baseball players work a very hard year as spring training begins in february and many players participate in winter leagues throughout the world as well as tournaments a baseball player will arrive at the ballpark between hours pregame and stay an hour after travel days sometimes bring players into town at odd hours combined with obligations such as signing after games public appearances and media sessions all star break provides most players their only relief hats off to those who participate they are the true fan favorites Major League Baseball National Football League Playoff Baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game International League Major League Baseball television contracts National Basketball Association 2004-05 NHL lockout Toronto Blue Jays American Football League Minor league baseball Home team Playoff format Exhibition game Salary cap NBA Finals Baseball statistics Las Vegas metropolitan area Los Angeles Clippers Interleague play Negro league baseball Deion Sanders Japanese baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Hank Aaron Willie Mays Norway national football team Texas Rangers (baseball) Super Bowl XXXVI EA Sports Ichiro Suzuki Sudden death Lou Gehrig Babe Ruth Pittsburgh Pirates Milwaukee Brewers American football Andr__s Galarraga Satchel Paige Sports timeline Wrigley Field Jackie Robinson McAfee Coliseum Women's National Basketball Association Arizona State University Ty Cobb San Francisco Giants Chicago Cubs Michael Jordan Detroit Tigers Wild card New York Yankees MLB on FOX Ultimate (sport) New York Giants Jim Thorpe Basketball January 2005 in sports Georgia Institute of Technology World Baseball Classic Seattle Mariners Atlanta Braves Yao Ming Major professional sports league Continental Basketball Association National Hockey League All-Star Game Florida State University 2001 World Series Chicago White Sox 1994 baseball strike College basketball Canadian Football League Oakland Athletics MLB on NBC 1919 World Series Alex Rodriguez Cinergy Field University of Houston World Football League San Diego Padres History of baseball in the United States Mois__s Alou Reserve clause Barry Bonds Darryl Strawberry 2005 World Series Sandy Koufax
