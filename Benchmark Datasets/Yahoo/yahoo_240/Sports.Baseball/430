who do you think had to over come the most odd in baseball history my three players personally would be jackie robinson st black player hank aaron when he was passing babe ruth record lots of others coudn't choose but maybe barry bonds passing hank and babe while accused of using steriods sadly many african american players had to overcome odds and sometimes still do i think jackie robinson is the obvious choice for reasons we already know he turned out to be a great player by the way and i think that adds to it also hank aaron death threats stuff like that the whole world was on his shoulders when he broke ruth's record and he did just fine i have all the respect in the world for aaron and i'm sad to see his record being in danger by a cheater Hank Aaron Barry Bonds Home run Babe Ruth Baseball Atlanta Braves Reggie Jackson Hank Greenberg World Series Ty Cobb St. Louis Cardinals History of baseball in the United States Boston Red Sox September 20 in baseball New York Yankees Jackie Robinson Lou Gehrig Negro league baseball Major League Baseball titles streaks Cincinnati Reds Sports timeline Los Angeles Dodgers June 12 in baseball Baltimore Orioles October 7 in baseball October 20 in baseball October 5 in baseball September 6 in baseball Top 500 home run hitters of all time Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Stolen base October 16 in baseball 2004 World Series San Francisco Giants Polo Grounds Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth's Called Shot Major League Baseball Jimmie Foxx Major League Baseball All-Star Game Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Stars October 4 in baseball Mark McGwire Hank Stram Eddie Mathews David Ortiz American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Detroit Tigers Roger Maris Oakland Athletics Rogers Hornsby Tris Speaker Bowie Kuhn 1957 World Series Seattle Mariners Rickey Henderson November 2 in baseball Baseball (documentary) June 8 in baseball Nolan Ryan Major League Baseball titles leaders Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939 Roger Clemens Hank Thompson (baseball player) Toronto Blue Jays Cleveland Indians Wrigley Field Alex Rodriguez Manny Ram__rez Ted Radcliffe Chicago White Sox Bobby Charlton Mickey Mantle Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Priesthood (Mormonism) Leo Durocher Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Major League Baseball television contracts Jacky Ickx New York Mets Kansas City Chiefs Don Hoak Dixie Walker Perfect game Troy Glaus Batting order (baseball) Old Time Baseball October 3 in baseball Ted Williams Ken Griffey, Jr. Rafael Palmeiro Pee Wee Reese Sandy Koufax Minor league baseball Baseball color line October 8 in baseball
