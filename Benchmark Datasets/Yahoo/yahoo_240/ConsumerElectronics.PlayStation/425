can the ps pick up a wireless signal i'm getting a playstation and i was wondering if it can pick up a wireless network signal yes we pick up all our neighbors wifi networks and some are unsecure and we've used them to go online the only problem is when cars with gps drive buy we'd loose the signal for a second and it creates lag so after we tested the neighbrors connection we used our own and found that it picks up ours great as long as the router is in the same room now the only thing that interferes with the connection is when i set my blackberry somewhere between the router and the ps when i get an email the signal to the ps for some reason gets interference and creates a little lag Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth Wireless LAN Voice over IP Wireless access point Universal Serial Bus Global Positioning System Communications protocol Radio Xbox BlackBerry Cable television Mobile phone Router Nintendo DS Broadband Internet access Wireless Telephone Lag Local area network PlayStation 3 Loudspeaker PlayStation 2 Modem Code division multiple access Embedded system Television Multiplayer PlayStation Portable Software-defined radio Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Differentiated services Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Internet Group Management Protocol Wardriving Hotspot (wifi) PowerPC Nintendo Revolution Password Telegraphy Mobile ad-hoc network Amateur radio E-mail WiMAX Global System for Mobile Communications Verizon Wireless Quality of service Denial-of-service attack Border Gateway Protocol AppleTalk Prodigy (ISP) Antenna (radio) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Nintendo GameCube Spread spectrum Morse Code Grand Theft Auto III History of radio Communications satellite High fidelity Super Nintendo Entertainment System MAC address Network address translation Cisco Systems Cellular network Radio clock Internet protocol suite Mobile phone radiation and health Grand Haven, Michigan Federal Standard 1037C SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Research In Motion Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Link-state routing protocol Burglar alarm Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Gmail VHF omnidirectional range TGV Covert listening device Internet SCART Routing Wireless mesh network Turbocharger History of the Internet Streaming media Surveillance Email authentication Wardenclyffe Tower Mouse (computing) Skype ZigBee RS-232 Computer surveillance 9-1-1 Enhanced 911 Wireless network
