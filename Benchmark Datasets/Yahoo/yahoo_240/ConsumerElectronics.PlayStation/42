do u need a hd tv to benifit from the ps 's blue ray feture no you do not need an hdtv to benefit from blu ray sorry for putting that in bold but all of the people above me are idiots and hdtv will certainly make it look better but if that was the only advantage to blu ray then it would not be necessary the most important part of blu ray is to give game makers more space to program games are already starting to show compromise because of the limited space of dvds forza had to cut out day night cycles lair is gb rage will be on one disc on the ps while it will be on multiple discs on the pc and recent look it up the tech development tool will be big big deal right so you have discs instead of one for games like rpgs this is fine as there would only be one point in the game where you would need to switch discs for sandbox style games racers shooter sports games etc this creates a huge problem if half of the tracks teams maps etc are on one disc while half is on the other then it just doesn't work an gb game just can't be put on two gb dvds data has to be repeated for character models physics etc blu ray means no compromising on graphics gameplay scope or anything that is why blu ray is beneficial not just because it allows you to play hi def movies although that is a plus Sega Dreamcast High-definition television DVD Computer and video games Computer role-playing game Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 Computer and video game genres Laserdisc Machinima Blu-ray Disc Game programmer Nintendo GameCube Television Robotech Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega Chrono Trigger MMORPG Extreme Programming Team Fortress Classic Counter-Strike First-person shooter PlayStation Portable SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Gran Turismo (game) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Modchip Console game GP32 Collision detection Super Nintendo Entertainment System Unreal Tournament 2004 Karaoke Mouse (computing) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory RISC Digital rights management CPU cache Xbox Poker jargon Bicycle Baseball Sega Saturn Hard disk Neverwinter Nights Ren and Stimpy Xbox 360 Double Dragon Floppy disk Blackjack Computer Ra (board game) CPU design Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ultimate (sport) GunZ The Duel Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Visual Basic RollerCoaster Tycoon Quake Chess Cheating in Counter-Strike Amstrad CPC Compact disc Atari 8-bit family Game engine Beast Wars PlayStation 2 Starsiege: Tribes Central processing unit Georgia Institute of Technology Wheel of Fortune Level (computer and video games) Pok__mon Colosseum Final Fantasy VI Mach kernel Zerg Copy protection ATI Technologies Movie projector Technology Paper Mario Wild ARMs 2 Metropolis Street Racer Final Fantasy Betting (poker) MAME Nintendo Pok__mon Chronicles Blockbuster Video Guild Wars Natural Selection (computer game) Table tennis Macromedia Flash Half-Life 2 Jet engine Half-Life
