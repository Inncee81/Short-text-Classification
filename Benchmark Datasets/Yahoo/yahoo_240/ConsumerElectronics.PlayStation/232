is the playstation worth the money is the playstaion really worth the hundreds it costs plus the bucks for each game at this moment i have to say no the ps is still the most expensive console on the market yet there's almost nothing to justify its price graphics wise the ps has yet to show itself capable of doing anything that the can't worse still the ps actually has a slightly older and slower gpu than the which might mean as developers learn each hardware platform later games might look better than the ps 's however where the ps is really hurting is in the games department there just aren't a lot of good games for the ps that are exclusive to the ps most of the ps 's library is shared with the for instance oblivion is available on both consoles and looks nearly identical however the is cheaper worse still some games that were originally going to be exclusive for the ps have since gone multi platform such as devil may cry metal gear solid katamari damacy and dynasty warriors gundam this is because developers aren't sure there's enough of a market for the ps to insure enough sales to make a ps exclusive title profitable while there are a whole slew of games to be released for the ps this fall and winter the isn't standing still in fact this year's most anticipated title halo is due in just a few months and will be only on the the ps has nothing in its lineup for the next months that even comes close to the hype and excitement halo has generated it could be that will be the ps 's year to shine and i certainly hope that's true otherwise the ps is going to be in real trouble as for games i don't feel any game is worth i'll definitely be waiting for game prices to come down to something reasonable like PlayStation 2 Computer and video games PlayStation 3 Xbox Radeon Nintendo Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Video game music Sega Sega Dreamcast Console wars TurboGrafx 16 Video game crash of 1983 Katamari Damacy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IBM PC compatible PlayStation Portable Nintendo Revolution First-person shooter Handheld game console Halo (video game series) Intellivision Atari ST 3dfx Resident Evil 4 MAME History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Sega Saturn Super Robot Wars MMORPG NVIDIA History of video games (Sixth generation era) Rockstar North Microeconomics Double Dragon Inflation Nintendo Entertainment System Metal Gear Solid Atari Handheld video game Computer role-playing game Resident Evil Microsoft Laserdisc Atari 2600 Rare (video game company) Halo 2 Atari 8-bit family FIFA Series History of computer and video games Killzone Paintball PC Engine Tax Mach kernel Graftgold GeForce 4 Electronic Arts Golden Axe Graphics processing unit Console emulator CPU design Technos Japan Corporation Game development RISC Machinima Gradius GeForce 6 Series Overclocking Computer and video game packaging Game programmer Microsoft Windows Health insurance Dead or Alive (video game) EA Sports Nintendo DS Computer and video game industry Halo: Combat Evolved Video game console Computer and video game genres Amiga Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ra (board game) GamePark Neo-Geo
