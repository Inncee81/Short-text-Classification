is there a deadline to sign draft picks in the nba if so what is it because i want to know when yi has to make a decision there is no deadline there is usually no problem in the nba because the first round picks are slotted to make a certain amount of money according to when they were drafted it is a rule in the collective bargaining agreement therefore there are usually no hold outs because you are going to make the same amount of money this situation is different because yi doesn't want to play and will just stay in china instead of milwaukee i don't think he will sign unless he gets traded so i wouldn't count on him being in the nba any time soon NBA Draft National Basketball Association New York Knicks Los Angeles Clippers Salary cap Indiana Pacers 2004-05 NHL lockout New Jersey Nets National Football League 2004 NBA Finals San Antonio Spurs Women's National Basketball Association Toronto Raptors Minnesota Timberwolves Poker jargon Portland Trail Blazers Chicago Bulls Reserve clause 1986 NBA Draft Cleveland Cavaliers Steve Nash New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Orlando Magic 1957 World Series Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Shawn Kemp June 2004 in sports Atlanta Hawks NFL Draft Karl Malone NBA Finals Terrell Owens Golden State Warriors Milwaukee Bucks Larry Bird 1994 baseball strike Pat Garrity Detroit Red Wings Winning Streak Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong Minor league baseball $ale of the Century Utah Jazz Pat Riley Glenn Robinson Blackjack Slot machine Cotton Fitzsimmons Betting (poker) Philadelphia 76ers July 2004 in sports World Trade Organization Wilt Chamberlain Moses Malone Allan Houston Houston Rockets Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bush v.
