who is better iverson or nash must read i keep hearing ppl say nash is better than ai and can do more for a team one guy even said had nash played for philly they would have been better when i hear this i laugh nash is a great player but ai is much better you cant compare ai career of dominating for yrs and leading a weak philly team with no other allstars to a finals in which philly played the lakers tough for every game if ai played for the suns this year they would have won it all nash couldnt win it with two all stars plus the best role players in the league and for those who said nash would have made philly more sucessful because he can pass and make his teammates better please pass the ball to who who can score on philly who was there to pass the ball to when iverson tooked them to the finals and as far as iverson style of play they said all that junk about jordan in the s the bulls will never win because he takes too many shots thats just bs nash cant make a grown man hit a open shot ai is arguably better than nash standing at a towering ' ai has had an amazing career lead his team to the finals was an mvp all star mvp plays through injury and has also lead the league in scoring smallest man to do that in allan's last complete season as a sixer he average just short of points and assists per on a team with less talent than any team nash has ever played with ai has also been a exceptional team defender who can get in the lanes quickly and make numerous defensive plays with his speed and readiness ai has averaged steals in his career and nash a measly nash's assist averages were comparable to iverson's until he began playing with the suns the suns have two of the best finishers in the game in amare and marion not to mention now with barbosa if ai played consistently with these guys i think they would fare better than nash's lack luster playoff performances in which he continues to fall short especially against tony parker whom owns nash ai is better in my opinion Los Angeles Lakers George Mikan Basketball NBA Finals National Basketball Association Boston Celtics Philadelphia 76ers Utah Jazz San Antonio Spurs Larry Bird New York Knicks Houston Rockets January 2005 in sports Phil Jackson Jerry West Pat Riley New Mexico Lobo Basketball Golden State Warriors College basketball Los Angeles Clippers Indiana Pacers Chicago Bulls Karl Malone Robert Horry National Basketball League Julius Erving Dream Team Detroit Pistons 2004 NBA Finals Kobe Bryant Denver Nuggets Emanuel Gin__bili David Robinson (basketball player) Michael Jordan Magic Johnson Minnesota Timberwolves 2005 NBA Finals Milwaukee Bucks Hakeem Olajuwon Yao Ming Reggie Miller SBC Center New Jersey Nets Shaquille O'Neal December 2004 in sports Rasheed Wallace Gary Payton (basketball) 1986 NBA Draft Tim Duncan DePaul University American Basketball League 1961-63 Dikembe Mutombo NBA Draft Steve Nash Clyde Lovellette February 2005 in sports Dennis Rodman Lakers-Celtics rivalry Three-point field goal Larry Brown Wilt Chamberlain Harlem Globetrotters Moses Malone University of Utah November 2004 in sports NBA Live series Playoff format New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Sam Barry American Football League Charles Barkley University of Minnesota Atlanta Hawks Bobby Knight Syracuse University Orange University of Arizona Women's National Basketball Association Calbert Cheaney NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Arkansas Razorbacks Sam Perkins John Salley Phoenix Suns St. John's University, New York July 2004 in sports University of California, Santa Barbara Maurice Lucas Allen Iverson Albany Patroons Orlando Magic Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bill Russell (basketball) Mike Krzyzewski Chinese Basketball Association Dwyane Wade Danny Manning Chick Hearn Pete Newell Vlade Divac NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship
