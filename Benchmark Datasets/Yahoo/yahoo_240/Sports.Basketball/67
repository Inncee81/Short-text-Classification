what are some reasons for the changes in the nba from the 's 's era to right now what caused the big change today's league is corrupted with people like david stern and tim dohangy what happened i think one of the reason for such change that not many people have noticed is the change of team management from 's to the presence before you had better management running nba organizations like when jerry west ran the lakers and red auerbach ran the celtics these guys knew how to run the business and were able to accumulate great teams that work together after that period we entered the jordan era and mj took us on a ride for most of the 's the problem was after jordan retired you had many former nba stars retiring and taking over as either coach gm or president of nba franchises like larry bird in indiana danny ainge in boston isiah thomas in new york joe dumars in detroit john paxson in chicago michael jordan in washington and then charlotte only dumars so far was able to have some success winning a championship once with detroit after taking over as president of operations mchale has hit so many bumps in the road in minnesota jordan screw'd up as management in washington and his legacy in charlotte remains to be seen ainge didn't have much luck in boston until his former teammate mchale hooked him up with the big ticket bird had a great thing going in indiana until artest decided to blow up the team i don't think i need to mention the mess that isiah has made in new york mismanagement by these former nba players to management individuals paired with the retirement of great fundamental and quality team players like barkley stockton malone mj pippen robinson olajuwon ewing really escalated the nba into the new unknown era's the league received a new crop of talent who lacked fundamentals and played the sport for the wrong reason iverson kobe artest arenas carmelo are great individual players but they do not exactly possess the unique ability to elevate the level of plays of their teammates like how magic bird or jordan were able to deliver shaq and duncan were the only standout players of the new millenium to carry their teams towards a championship just like how the former nba greats used to do it however these players all seem to lack a certain ability to make basketball fun to watch like how bird and magic used to display and they never delivered in the finals moments like how mj did what we have today are players who play for the spotlight and the big bucks most of these players are self center with the exception of few and don't always have a team first mentality basketball has fallen off so far in the new millenium but hopefully guys like lebron james and dwyane wade will be able to carry on the torch left by mj in the 's and helping the nba reclaim some of it's glory days Charles Barkley Toronto Raptors January 2005 in sports 2004 NBA Finals Phoenix Suns Hakeem Olajuwon 2005 NBA Finals Allen Iverson Tim Duncan Danny Ainge Continental Basketball Association Basketball ESPN25 Los Angeles Kings December 2004 in sports LeBron James Jerry Krause College basketball Julius Erving Yao Ming Minnesota Timberwolves New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets NBA Rookie of the Year Award Phil Jackson New York Yankees Boston Red Sox Reggie Miller Denver Nuggets Chicago White Sox New York Giants Joe Dumars New Mexico Lobo Basketball David Stern Boston Bruins World Series Golden State Warriors Shaquille O'Neal February 2005 in sports International League Gary Payton (basketball) Detroit Tigers Syracuse University Orange Toronto Blue Jays Kevin McHale Major League Baseball television contracts Bobby Knight San Francisco Giants Miami Heat Montreal Canadiens Moses Malone National Football League Lakers-Celtics rivalry San Francisco 49ers Milwaukee Bucks United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Stanley Cup The NBA on NBC Carolina Panthers David Robinson (basketball player) 1984 NBA Draft Babe Ruth NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Al Michaels Oakland Athletics June 2004 in sports Indiana University Bloomington Dwyane Wade Detroit Red Wings
