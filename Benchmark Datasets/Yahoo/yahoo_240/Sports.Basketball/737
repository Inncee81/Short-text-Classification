why can't the suns win the big games they suck so bad i hear people calling them the bills of the nba but the bills actually won conference championships unlike the suns it's weird isn't it they have great talent in nash marion and stoudemire as a 'big three' add to the mix bell barbosa and diaw and one would think the sky's the limit but they run through the regular season and get knocked off by the spurs mavs and spurs again they have poor defensive habits that kill them in the playoffs the mvp point guard has a warped sense that playing defense means taking a charge nash ranked th in the league for charges flops and bell ranked th stoudemire has great power and strength to his game but lacks smarts and finesse as he piles up fouls because he doesn't move his feet he ranked second in the league for fouls shrug maybe when their fans quit blaming everyone else on the planet and start holding the coach and players accountable things will change Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant Los Angeles Lakers Shaquille O'Neal NBA Finals Detroit Pistons Steve Nash January 2005 in sports Tayshaun Prince 1986 NBA Draft San Antonio Spurs July 2004 in sports 2004 NBA Finals Indiana Pacers Rasheed Wallace Orlando Magic 2005 NBA Finals Kareem Abdul-Jabbar New Jersey Nets Karl Malone Larry Bird Robert Horry Miami Heat Pat Riley Gary Payton (basketball) Minnesota Timberwolves The NBA on ABC June 2004 in sports Chicago Bulls Emanuel Gin__bili Utah Jazz Philadelphia 76ers Derek Fisher Chris Webber Portland Trail Blazers New York Giants Phil Jackson 1984 NBA Draft Houston Rockets December 2004 in sports Detroit Red Wings Yao Ming Julius Erving New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Boston Celtics Bill Walton Golden State Warriors Scottie Pippen Phoenix Suns National Basketball Association Detroit Tigers Michael Jordan Maurice Lucas Los Angeles Kings Pittsburgh Steelers February 2005 in sports Charles Barkley Moses Malone The Malice at The Palace Basketball NBA Draft Boston Red Sox National Football League Los Angeles Sparks Katelyn Faber Tracy McGrady St. Louis Rams Glen Rice Dikembe Mutombo David Robinson (basketball player) Luke Walton Chauncey Billups Vince Carter Slam Dunk Contest 1985 NBA Draft Boston Bruins ESPN25 Michael Cooper Jerry Krause Allen Iverson New Mexico Lobo Basketball Chick Hearn George Mikan 1977 NBA Finals Memphis Grizzlies Super Bowl XXVII College basketball Jerry West Grant Hill (basketball player) Magic Johnson
