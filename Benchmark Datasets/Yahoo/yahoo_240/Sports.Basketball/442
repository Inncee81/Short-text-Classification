is kobe he best player today does anyone here think kobes the best player right now air peace kobe is not he is i think he is the best today it's not just how many points he scores it's how he scores them look at him getting cornered on the baseline dancing around a triple team chucking the ball high into the air and making a beautiful swish points was just surreal so was etc look at all those times in the last seasons when the lakers were down by at halftime and then kobe caught fire and they went on to win the game kobe used to be a ballhog but not anymore assists is passing not to mention that he tries to assist his teammates a lot but about of those potential assists fumbled out of bounds interchange kwame brown and amare stoudemire and watch kobe's assists skyrocket at no expense to his shooting and the lakers will win games a lot of people also make the argument that he only scores big against weak teams false did he not score points against the mavericks also when he scored points for consecutive games each one of those games was on the road kobe may not have the cleanest character but you must love his game you also have to give him credit it certainly looks like he's trying to change but the older fans who saw his ballhogging days aren't ready to forgive him and his colorado scandal which i think was a hoax the only evidence the prosecution had was the accuser's testimony her boyfriend's testimony and some injuries on her body that could have been done by her cat didn't help his image either Kobe Bryant NBA Finals Yao Ming Los Angeles Clippers Steve Nash Basketball Free throw Orlando Magic Indiana Pacers Ben Wallace George Mikan New Jersey Nets National Basketball Association Michael Jordan Allen Iverson Los Angeles Lakers Tim Duncan San Antonio Spurs NBA Draft Houston Rockets Gary Payton (basketball) Charles Barkley David Robinson (basketball player) Larry Bird Miami Heat Dream Team Dikembe Mutombo Toronto Raptors Karl Malone Center (basketball) Bobby Knight Penny Hardaway David Stern Robert Horry Nick Anderson Reggie Miller Chick Hearn Dwyane Wade Phil Jackson SLAM Magazine Hakeem Olajuwon Jerry West 2005 NBA Finals Julius Erving Pat Riley Dennis Rodman 2004 NBA Finals January 2005 in sports NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Portland Trail Blazers Detroit Pistons New York Knicks LeBron James Jermaine O'Neal Oscar Robertson Moses Malone Emanuel Gin__bili Salary cap SBC Center Volleyball Louisiana State University College basketball Continental Basketball Association NBA Rookie of the Year Award The Malice at The Palace John Salley Harlem Globetrotters Vince Carter Women's National Basketball Association Philadelphia 76ers Chris Webber December 2004 in sports Walt Frazier Lakers-Celtics rivalry Phoenix Suns Ron Artest Chuck Cooper 1986 NBA Draft Personal foul Street basketball Chicago Bulls 1990s Georgia Institute of Technology John Calipari Golden State Warriors Derek Fisher Minnesota Timberwolves University of Missouri - Columbia Jerry Lucas EXpanded MultiPlayer Isiah Thomas Utah Jazz Major League Baseball television contracts Three-point field goal Slam Dunk Contest Donovan McNabb Tony Parker Cleveland Cavaliers Tracy McGrady
