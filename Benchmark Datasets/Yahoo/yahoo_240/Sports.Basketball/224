would this be a good trade to make the boston celtics win it all this year tony allen and brian scalabrine for tyronn lue and solomon jones from the hawks i know the celtics need a point guard but i would keep tony allen and scalabrine i think tony allen is underrated he is a good defender at both wing positions and is actually quite athletic considering ray allen's ankle injuries and average defense it helps to have a more physical defender backing him up especially during the final minutes of the game when you need a stop also scalabrine is a decent role player when he doesn't need to play big minutes lue and jones are average players at best but i think there are still veteran free agents out there that can be better pickups at their positions and a pickup from the free agent pool will not cost the celtic any more of their players Orlando Magic NBA Finals Chicago Bulls Tyronn Lue New York Knicks Larry Bird Indiana Pacers Basketball New York Giants Water polo Gary Payton (basketball) New Jersey Nets Boston Celtics Michael Jordan Toronto Raptors Detroit Red Wings Philadelphia 76ers Volleyball Chicago Blackhawks Houston Rockets Los Angeles Clippers Steve Nash American football Dennis Rodman Wilt Chamberlain January 2005 in sports Boxing Ice hockey Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays Boston Bruins Rugby union positions National Basketball Association New England Patriots New York Yankees Yao Ming Pittsburgh Steelers Rugby union San Francisco 49ers Glossary of American football Wayne Gretzky Leeds United F.C.
