kg trade a few things i think oden durrant will be benefitted by this trade this is due to the fact that people will be so interested in seeing the 'all stars' in boston it has overshadowed the two future all stars i am more looking forward to boston playing than seattle or portland also on another note i was wondering who will be t wolves goto guy foye still young green poor fg and if ricky davis is the go to guy then you are destined for top lotto pick i dont think there is another team in the nba that does not have an all star as clearly as this team minnesota could become a team similar to the detroit pistons whom are made of good players but not great ones if the wolves could find themselves a good coach who is able to mesh all the pieces foye brewer green jefferson then you could probably be looking at the next well rounded team ricky davis will be the veteran to lead the young wolves but he has never been a great team player so eventually they would have to trade him to open up more shots for the younger players i think eventually minnesota's go to player would be al jefferson if he develops properly and injury free he should become the anchor in minnesota like how dwight howard is in orlando and chris bosh is in toronto foye will have to learn to become a better distributor more than just a scoring point guard green will have to become a better shooter than a field goal percentage guy all these factors are just maybe's and who knows if it will ever mature Chicago Bulls Toronto Raptors Orlando Magic Los Angeles Clippers Utah Jazz Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Finals January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Toronto Blue Jays San Antonio Spurs Dream Team Carolina Panthers Detroit Red Wings December 2004 in sports Rasheed Wallace New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago Blackhawks November 2004 in sports Portland Trail Blazers Yao Ming 2004 NBA Finals Montreal Canadiens Miami Dolphins Boston Red Sox Larry Bird Steve Nash New York Giants Michael Jordan Clemson University Kobe Bryant Boston Bruins St. Louis Blues (hockey) Atlanta Flames Detroit Tigers Cris Carter Three-point field goal Gary Payton (basketball) Denver Nuggets NBA Draft 1984 NBA Draft Shaquille O'Neal Continental Basketball Association National Hockey League 2002-03 NHL season Super Bowl XXVI National Basketball Association Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim National Hockey League All-Star Game World Series Qu__bec Nordiques Buffalo Bills David Robinson (basketball player) Wayne Gretzky National Football League National Football League Lore Pittsburgh Penguins St. Louis Rams Carlos Arroyo Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl IX Norway national football team February 2005 in sports Luther Head Golden State Warriors September 2005 in sports Cleveland Cavaliers Water polo Super Bowl I Stanley Cup Salary cap Basketball NHL Entry Draft 2005 NBA Finals Georgia Institute of Technology Karl Malone Charles Barkley Reggie Jackson Chauncey Billups Ice hockey Super Bowl XI
