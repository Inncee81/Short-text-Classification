sea stars i have a school project and wasn't able to find sea star help this something out so can anyone tell me what the eyes of a sea star look like what does it feel like when the tiny pincers along their body pull on your hair we're supposed to put it to our arm what happens if you throw some sand particles on their back hint the reaction to the sand particles has something to do with the tiny pincers along their back sea stars have a light sensitive region at the tip of each arm but not a centralized nervous system to sustain actual eyes the tube feet which you would feel on your arm would feel like suction if the animal were allowed to be submerged in sea water along with your arm they use their water vascular system to create a vacuum and subsequently release the hydrostatic pressure they can open oysters this way i don't know about throwing sand on their back seems that they wouldn't mind too much as they actually have endoskeletons although it doesn't seem like it that's because their skeleton is of mesodermal origin and they have an epidermis on top of that hope i helped Sea star Echinoderm Siphon M16 (rifle) Shark Brittle star Skeleton Naruto jutsu Dredge Brewery Bladderwort Eye First Battle of the Atlantic Vacuum tube Vacuum cleaner Planetary nebula Professional wrestling holds Root Electrophysiology Anchor Sun Antiparticle Volleyball Fluid pressure Stoma Arthropod Equine conformation Diode Terminal ballistics Sense Spacecraft propulsion Solar system Cosmic Era technology USS Sand Lance (SS-381) Cavitation Flood geology Trigun Sewage treatment Sponge Bong Vacuum Temperature Aerial (dance move) Thermal power station Autonomic nervous system Professional wrestling throws Photon Suction Carburetor Tetrapod Submarine Animal Light Ecology of Hong Kong Conspiracy (TNG episode) Particle accelerator Carnivorous plant Drowning Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pitaten Snake Suplex Kodocha Combine (Half-Life 2) Professional wrestling match types Gravity Star Wars Water (molecule) Central Asia Hydraulic machinery Torpedo Akatsuki (Naruto) Fluid statics Double bass Professional wrestling aerial techniques Stellar evolution Tenshinhan Rave Master Glossary of firefighting equipment Namsos campaign Bottlenose Dolphin Oasis (band) Horseshoe crab Supernova Welding Obi-Wan Kenobi The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Galileo spacecraft Universal Century Technology Zuiderzee Works Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Internal ballistics Marine aquarium
