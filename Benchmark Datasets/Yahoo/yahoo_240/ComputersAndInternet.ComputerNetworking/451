is there any way to make your home network act as a proxy server i have a netgear wgr v wireless router and i was wondering if it would be possible to connect to it from another computer to use my internet connection basically make my home network a proxy i would rather not have to connect to my computer to do it i have already used remote desktop connection to basically do this but that was rediculously slow and a serious security risk so is it possible and how might i do it i just have to ask anthony how could it possibly be illegal to use your home network as a proxy it might be against some rules at school but illegal i only want to do this because my school just made it against the rules to access your email no matter what you use it for if i wanted to hide something why in the world would i want to use my home network which would be easily traceable to me you can't turn it into a proxy that would require broadband connections each with fixed ip addresses the cost is prohibitive Proxy server Network address translation E-mail spam Router Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse Internet Wi-Fi Password Windows Server 2003 Transmission Control Protocol Wireless LAN Tor (anonymity network) Virtual private network Internet privacy IP Multimedia Subsystem Firewall (networking) Data retention Secure Shell Denial-of-service attack Internet Relay Chat Broadband Internet access Modem Satellite internet E-mail Gmail Bluetooth X Window System Skype Cisco Systems Surveillance Computer Local area network Internet security Internet censorship in mainland China Open mail relay America Online Danger Hiptop Streaming media Virtual Network Computing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Microsoft Telegraphy MDAC BlackBerry Web crawler Computer security Grid computing Xbox Distributed computing WiMAX Pseudonymity Digital Subscriber Line Windows 2000 Ajax (programming) History of Microsoft Windows Whois Computer virus IP address Internet service provider Anonymity Anonymous remailer Spam (electronic) MSN Messenger Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Novell NetWare Wget File Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista Wireless access point Apple Open Collaboration Environment Lag Computer insecurity Onion Routing Server PowerPC Squid cache Pretty Good Privacy Quality of service I2P Data center IMac Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telnet Spyware AppleTalk Multiplayer Apple Macintosh Communications protocol Dial-up access Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Internet Message Access Protocol HyperText Transfer Protocol Telephone
