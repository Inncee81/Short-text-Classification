how many people can access my computer at one time though cable internet i'm thing a bough starting a internet business and i would like to find out how many people can access my computer at one time through cable internet that would help me determine how many computers i will need i'm guessing what you want to do is use your cable internet to provide internet access for other people you will need to be a registered business and you will need to use a special business account with your isp using a consumer account this is illegal i'm also pretty certain you have no idea how to implement this judging by the question you're asking anyway you can have as many people as you want theoretically realistically each one will only get a fraction of the bandwidth so it will depend on what kind of speeds you're selling to your users also your pc will only be able to handle a certain number of connections before it gets overloaded and crashes this will depend on the power of your servers and involves a lot of guessing and stress testing Internet service provider Broadband Internet access Password Ethernet Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cable television CPU cache Domain Name System Modem Web traffic Steam (content delivery) Voice over IP Microsoft E-mail spam Computer insecurity Computer E-mail Digital Subscriber Line CPU design America Online Database management system Network address translation Web hosting IP Multimedia Subsystem Dial-up access History of the Internet PlayStation Portable The Internet Movie Database RISC Etisalat Bluetooth GSM services Telegraphy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Internet protocol suite Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Trademark Extreme Programming Gmail File system Copyleft Computer security Mach kernel Stopping e-mail abuse Internet privacy Cable modem PlayStation 3 Skype Floppy disk IEEE 802.11 Internet Relay Chat Windows XP MP3 Universal Serial Bus CompuServe Copy protection Password cracking Expert system Satellite internet MAME Windows 2000 Pretty Good Privacy Spam (electronic) Streaming media Datatype Mainframe computer AppleTalk Prodigy (ISP) Usenet Server Message Block C plus plus Polymorphism (computer science) Game programming Supercomputer Turing machine Redundant array of independent disks AT&T MMORPG Public-key cryptography Internet IBM PC compatible Enterprise content management Transmission Control Protocol Common Unix Printing System SETI@home Embedded system DVD Public domain Microsoft Windows RuneScape cheats Server
