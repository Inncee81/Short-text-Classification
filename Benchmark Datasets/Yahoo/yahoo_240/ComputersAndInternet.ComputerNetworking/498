using motorola v xx as a modem is there anything in the att tos that says that i cannot use my phone to dial up into aol server while tethered to my notebook and use it as a modem i don't want to get on wirelessly while connected to my notebook because eventhough i have unlimited internet because i know they'll hit you for some money if you use it too much i just want to dial up is that allowed i am a sales rep for att and happened to stumble on your question while looking for something on google att policy is that you are allowed to use your phone as a modem if you add the proper feature to your account which is the unlimited data connect which is only a whopping a month sound reasonable right lol now i have seen people use the media net unlimited or the media max which has messages and unlimited internet and get away with it while using a pda or using a phone as a modem but you didn't hear it from me now i don't know if this is true or if this is just a scare tactic from the company but supposedly they do constant sweeps of accounts and remove these features if they see that you are using an extreme amount of data that would normally not be drawn from a cell phone to be honest i think its a crock of sh t i recently took care of a lady who was using a pda for years with the media net unlimited and she never had a problem with it hope this was helpful by the way using a g phone as a modem is great for web browsing on a laptop very fast speeds unfortunately if you are looking to download stuff it is not that fast it is very very very slow Voice over IP America Online Broadband Internet access BlackBerry Internet General Packet Radio Service Bulletin board system Windows XP Laptop Internet fraud Verizon Wireless GSM services Skype Surveillance Opera (web browser) Cable television Spyware MSN Messenger Mobile phone Prodigy (ISP) Computer Handheld game console Universal Serial Bus RISC PlayStation Portable IPod BitTorrent Web crawler Phreaking Hard disk Softmodem Apple Newton IP Multimedia Subsystem AOL Instant Messenger Secure Digital card Nintendo MMORPG Tungsten Handheld Password Telegraphy Spam (electronic) Microsoft Sharp Zaurus ITunes Music Store E-mail spam Desktop computer Danger Hiptop Internet service provider Game programmer Cheating in Counter-Strike CompuServe Online music store Virgin Mobile Mac OS X Google Wireless Application Protocol ITU-T Federal Standard 1037C Apple Macintosh PowerPC Atari ST Dialer Phishing ZX Spectrum Digital rights management Online service provider Quake III Arena 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Call centre Computer bus File sharing DeviantART Starsiege: Tribes Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Web traffic GNU General Public License MDAC Digital Subscriber Line Game.com 9-1-1 Electricity meter Instant messaging Apple Computer Vertical service code Live 8
