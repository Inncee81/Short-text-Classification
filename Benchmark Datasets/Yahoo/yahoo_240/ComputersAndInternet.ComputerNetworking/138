is a network key the same as a password i was told that my wireless network would be safe from people trying to use my connection as long as i had a password for it i thought i had one as if i connect manually i have to type something in however i checked what it was and it says its a network key and not a password is this the same thing not the same thing although the network key is sometimes called a password the password you're talking about is a login password the same as for logging in here on yahoo the network key is password like but it's used by the router and the computers on your network to encrypt transmissions between them this is the one that prevents outsiders from hopping on board and hides what gets sent by the way by connect manually i take it to mean you log into the router via your browser to run the admin pages for security you should confine this ability to wired links only and prohibit it from wireless links you can do this from the admin pages themselves this won't affect your usage but will keep a neighbor from hijacking the router from you Password Wi-Fi Password cracking Malware Windows XP Router Federal Standard 1037C 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Wireless LAN Novell NetWare Secure Shell Internet USB flash drive Onion Routing Wireless access point Two-factor authentication Surveillance Skype Computer security Bluetooth Spyware RuneScape cheats Windows 2000 Freenet MDAC Passphrase Cryptography IEEE 802.11i Kerberos (protocol) Telegraphy Streaming media Wireless mesh network Rootkit Denial-of-service attack Transmission Control Protocol Internet fraud GameFAQs NSA encryption systems Ethernet Wardriving Virtual Network Computing Internet protocol suite Enterprise content management Internet security Rlogin Buffer overflow Dictionary attack Pretty Good Privacy Global Positioning System HTTP cookie One-time pad File Transfer Protocol Friend-to-friend Voice over IP Computer virus Intrusion-detection system User (computing) AirPort Uniform Resource Locator Enigma machine Control-Alt-Delete Computer forensics Cryptographic hash function Stopping e-mail abuse Embedded system MAC address Neopets Digital Subscriber Line System/36 Email authentication Telephone tapping Computer surveillance Proxy server Internet Relay Chat Cisco Systems Database management system IEEE 802.11 Extensible Authentication Protocol Universal Serial Bus Computer insecurity Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Telephone Google Talk PunkBuster Routing Wired Equivalent Privacy Computer network General Packet Radio Service Btrieve Internet Message Access Protocol Key derivation function Apple Open Collaboration Environment
