do i lose bandwidth because my internet connection is spread throughout the house using a wlan router even when using only one computer is is just as fast id i don't run it through the wlan router the good news is that most wireless routers support faster speeds and more bandwidth than your internet service provider can actually give you and a computer will only use as much of the bandwidth as it needs the bad news is that it is possible for a single computer on a wireless network to completely hog all the bandwidth from your internet service provider but it takes work as long as everybody sharing the wireless connection is only using the internet for one or two standard tasks you shouldn't notice any major slowdowns however if everybody is trying to access the internet with high bandwidth tasks like streaming video or downloading large files then you can use your available bandwidth up pretty quickly let's use an example to understand how the internet and the home networks interact if you have an g router then your wireless router can transmit at up to mb every second in comparison most broadband providers only offer download speeds of between mb per second and mb per second what this means is that if one computer is streaming a kbps internet radio channel and downloading a movie at mbps and chatting it up on skype there isn't going to be much outside bandwidth left for any other computers trying to reach the outside world over the internet within the home wireless network however only mbps of the available mbps are being consumed therefore a second laptop on the network may only be able to download a song at kbps from the internet but they'll be able to stream video from their local media center pc at mbps and it'll still flow smoothly i hope that helps clarify things for you gl Wireless LAN Broadband Internet access Wi-Fi Voice over IP Streaming media Skype Bluetooth Modem PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 General Packet Radio Service Internet service provider Internet Universal Serial Bus Asynchronous Transfer Mode Digital Subscriber Line Windows XP Network address translation Universal Mobile Telecommunications System BitTorrent Router IP Multimedia Subsystem ITunes Telegraphy WiMAX Ethernet Power line communication Differentiated services Video on demand Transmission Control Protocol Nintendo Revolution Peer-to-peer Verizon Wireless Internet protocol suite Wireless Warez PlayStation Portable Wireless access point Xbox Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Digital television Wireless mesh network Satellite internet Session Initiation Protocol MP3 High-definition television Broadband Networks Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting GSM services Federal Standard 1037C Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mobile phone File sharing Broadband Web crawler Mapua Institute of Technology Telephone Television Computer and video games Radio Podcasting Instant messaging Telkom PCI Express Internet Group Management Protocol Morse Code HIPERLAN Lag Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet pornography Mac OS X Now Broadband TV Vorbis IBM PC compatible Broadcasting Floppy disk DOCSIS Mobile ad-hoc network Apple Computer Prodigy (ISP) AT&T Nintendo DS MSN Messenger MDAC Nintendo GameCube Newsgroup Windows Vista Digital audio broadcasting Frame relay Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks
