what is the difference between dhcp and dhcp relay agent a dhcp relay agent is a router or computer that is configured to listen for dhcp or bootp broadcast from dhcp clients and then relay those messages to dhcp servers on different subnets dhcp clients use broadcasts from a dhcp server to secure a lease network routers do not pass broadcasts unless they are specifically configured to do so his means that a dhcp server can normally provide ip addresses to clients which are located on the same subnet many organizations want to centralize their dhcp servers as they find it easier to manage these organizations must configure their network so that dhcp broadcasts will be passed from the client to the dhcp server this can be done in any of the two ways by configuring the routers which connect the subnets to forward dhcp broadcasts or by configuring dhcp relay agents the routing and remote access service under microsoft windows is able to function as a dhcp relay agent dhcp relay agent vs dual dhcp servers to provide fault tolerance you should have at least two responders to dhcp client requests on every subnet if you have two or more subnets you can use dhcp relay agents to provide fault tolerance and to keep management overhead at a minimum for this you should assign a dhcp server to each subnet and then create non overlapping scopes for both subnets on both servers then you should deploy a dhcp relay agent on each subnet that is configured to forward packets with a slight delay to the dhcp sever in another subnet this configuration will allow you to designate one dhcp server as the primary responder to dhcp requests and to provide a backup route to another server if needed how a dhcp relay agent works the following steps describe how a dhcp relay agent works the dhcp client broadcasts a dhcpdiscover packet the dhcp relay agent on the client's subnet forwards the dhcpdiscover message to the dhcp server by using unicast the dhcp server uses unicast to send a dhcpoffer message to the dhcp relay agent the dhcp relay agent broadcasts the dhcpoffer packet to the dhcp client's subnet the dhcp client broadcasts a dhcprequest packet the dhcp relay agent on the client's subnet forwards the dhcprequest message to the dhcp server by using unicast the dhcp server uses unicast to send a dhcpack message to the dhcp relay agent the dhcp relay agent broadcasts the dhcpack to the dhcp client's subnet using the microsoft dhcp server as a dhcp relay agent configuring a dhcp relay agent open routing and remote access console right click the server and then click configure and enable routing and remote access on the welcome page to routing and remote access setup wizard page click next on the configuration page select custom configuration and then click next on the custom configuration page select lan routing and then click next on the completing routing and remote access setup wizard page click finish in routing and remote access warning dialog box click yes to start the service on the remote access vpn server page click finish in the options of console tree expand the server expand ip routing and then select general right click general tab and click the new routing protocol in the new routing protocol page click the dhcp relay agent and click ok configuring a dhcp relay agent with the ip address of the dhcp server open routing and remote access console in the options of console tree select dhcp relay agent right click the dhcp relay agent click properties on general tab server address field type ip address of the dhcp server that you wish to forward dhcp request to click add then click ok enabling the dhcp relay agent on a interface of router open routing and remote access console in the options of console tree select dhcp relay agent right click the dhcp relay agent click new interface select the interface on which you want to enable the dhcp relay agent and then click ok in the properties dialog box of dhcp relay agent general tab make sure that relay dhcp packet is selected configure the boot threshold seconds and hop count threshold if needed and then click ok the dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp is a set of rules used by communications devices such as a computer router or network adapter to allow the device to request and obtain an ip address from a server which has a list of addresses available for assignment dhcp is a protocol used by networked computers clients to obtain ip addresses and other parameters such as the default gateway subnet mask and ip addresses of dns servers from a dhcp server the dhcp server ensures that all ip addresses are unique e g no ip address is assigned to a second client while the first client's assignment is valid its lease has not expired thus ip address pool management is done by the server and not by a human network administrator dhcp emerged as a standard protocol in october dhcp is a successor to the older bootp protocol whose leases were given for infinite time and did not support options due to the backward compatibility of dhcp very few networks continue to use pure bootp as of rfc dated march provides the latest dhcp definition as of the latest non standard of the protocol is rfc dated july which describes dhcpv dhcp in an ipv environment Visual Basic Microsoft News server Freenet Pretty Good Privacy Spring
