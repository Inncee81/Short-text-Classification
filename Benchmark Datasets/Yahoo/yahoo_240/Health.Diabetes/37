i am diabetic with a sweet tooth so to satisfy my dessert cravings after dinner i bought a bunch of hard candy to eat i am doing about or after dinner instead of say chocolate but someone said today that hard candy is used to spike sugar levels if low in some cases so i am thinking hard candy bad choice as alternative correct hi if you want to end up like me with amputations because of uncontrolled diabetes just keep right on eating those candies seriously get off the candy trick for you it should be an absolute 'no no' it is possible to get sugar free candies ice cream and the like but you need really need to avoid extra carbohydrates as these will raise your blood sugar level and eventually cause you all the problems that beset diabetics in later life i fooled myself into thinking i was controlling my diabetes well for more than forty years but fell victim to an infection which wouldn't clear and which led eventually to gangrene and amputations not nice not necessary and relatively easy to have avoided i didn't have a sweet tooth just a large appetite for high carbohydrate foods in when i was diagnosed i was advised to drink coffee without sugar and was offered saccarine instead i used to have several spoonfuls of sugar in coffee i didn't like the taste of the sweetener so tried it without anything ugh but only for a couple of days then i began to realise i could actually taste the coffee and not just the sugar same with tea after a few weeks i could identify one cup out of a dozen which had the sugar in and still can the coffee tasted better and the cups were easier to wash my 'sweet tooth' had vanished for ever i vastly prefer to eat savoury items now and though they can still be fattening and high in carbohydrates which can raise blood sugar levels they are far less addictive than high sugar desserts etc please try to curb your 'sweet tooth' i would not recommend you follow my path it is filled with pain disfigurement and loss of ability don't do it you will get all the help you need if you actually follow their advice from your health care professionals who will be very pleased to have someone who actually listens and obeys rather than merely paying lip service guilty to what they say good luck anyway it can be hard but it will be worth it believe me cheers bobspain Diabetes mellitus Atkins Nutritional Approach Coffee Sugar Soft drink Hypoglycemia Tooth Sugar substitute Dieting Breakfast Breastfeeding Tea Hyperglycemia Sucrose Food Cuisine of the Philippines Insulin Nutrition Obesity Hamster Japanese cuisine Chinese cuisine Fancy rat Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aspartame Cuisine of Denmark Happy Tree Friends Folic acid Cocaine Pancake Microeconomics Coeliac disease Cinnamon Ice cream MRE Addiction Penis Tooth enamel Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Shit Rice pudding Chronic fatigue syndrome Cotton candy Cancer Veganism Crohn's disease Neighbours Domestic rabbit Caffeine Soy milk Guinea pig Maple syrup Alcoholic beverage Polyols Bulk vending Jewish cuisine Cha chaan teng Glycemic index Diabetic neuropathy Hong Kong-style milk tea Wine German cuisine Coca-Cola French cuisine Kit Kat Rocky Mountain spotted fever Ron and Fez Word of Wisdom Oral sex Champagne (beverage) Cheese Cuisine of Singapore Adjustable gastric band Methamphetamine First aid South Beach diet Tofu Hypertension Alcoholics Anonymous Codename: Kids Next Door Diabetic retinopathy Pneumonia Terri Schiavo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters of Naruto
