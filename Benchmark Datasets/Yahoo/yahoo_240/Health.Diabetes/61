your are supposed to test hours after you eat am i supposed to give my self insulin w high numbers i assume you have diabetes you haven't given us any information such as what type of insulin s do you take and in what amounts also what were the instructions your doctor gave you you need to call or go see your endocrinologist or diabetes educator no one here knows your personal situation and since we're not your doctors we are not qualified to tell you what to do the most we can do is share our own experiences and hope we are being helpful in some way i have diabetes type and i do tight control which is where i keep my numbers between this requires frequent testing of my glucose levels i test about times a day i take types of insulin at bedtime i take lantus glargine units lantus is a slow acting insulin that lasts hours during the day before each meal i take novolog asparte units this is a fast acting insulin that lasts about hours long enough to process my meal at this point in my life since my numbers are stable my doctor allows me to adjust my own insulin i do not adjust the bedtime lantus that is my baseline insulin that basically keeps my numbers in the range but during the day i can adjust the amount of novolog i give myself for example if i know i am going to eat a larger than usual meal or the meal will have a very high amount of carbs i increase my insulin to about units conversely if i'm only going to eat a yogurt i lower my insulin to about units it also depends on what my glucose level is before my meal in addition i generally inject times during the day for meals but if i check my numbers at other times and they have crept up i will inject a few units to get back in balance it is a form of tightrope walking to keep my levels from getting too high or too low but i am used to it i don't have to give it much thought now because it has become second nature i didn't start out this way and i didn't have permission to take control of adjusting my insulin for a long time i had to have my levels in a good range for a long time before my doctor let me be in control ultimately we all need to take control of our health it's our bodies we need to take care of them that means working with our doctors doing what they say or discussing any changes we might want to make so again i say to call your doctor maybe you could read one or two books about diabetes at some point you may want to use an insulin pen or even go on a pump who knows best of luck Intensive insulinotherapy Gastroparesis Nutrition Glucokinase Insulin resistance Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperglycemia Glucose meter Growth hormone treatment Blood sugar Atkins Nutritional Approach Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Fasting Growth hormone deficiency Weight training Glycemic index Supply and demand Low-carbohydrate diet Polycystic ovary syndrome Dieting Diabetic nephropathy Glycogen storage disease type I Glycogen Insulin pump Sleep Stroke Endocrinology Obesity Hypertension Diabetes mellitus type 2 Inflation Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Dialysis Glucocorticoid Diabetes mellitus type 1 Anorexia nervosa Dog agility Diabetic hypoglycemia Sulfonylurea Clinical depression Glycemia Dietary fiber Atherosclerosis Growth hormone Extreme Programming Diabetic retinopathy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chlorpromazine Japanese tea ceremony Diabetic coma Transformer Insulinoma Fuel injection Urinary incontinence Medical prescription Labour economics Electrophysiology Stomach cancer Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Homeostasis Physician Acromegaly CPU cache Compiler optimization Gastroesophageal reflux disease Graduate school Milton H.
