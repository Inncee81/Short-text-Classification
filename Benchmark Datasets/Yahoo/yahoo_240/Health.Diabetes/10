if a non diabetic is injected with insulin can they counter the effects by eating sweets i saw it in a movie the guy injected the girl and went out in the balconey she ate chocolates and jumped off the balconey and ran i meant balcony well it depends i wouldn't put too much faith on hollywood depictions of medicine as it's much more likely to be shaped by what the director feels is dramatically correct rather than factually correct however to an extent taking more sugar can reduce the effect that insulin would have on a person the function of insulin and i'm oversimplifying here it has other effects as well is to direct the body to take sugar out of the bloodstream and put it into tissues mostly muscle and fat tissue this is a normal response to eating sugar and healthy the complete lack of insulin will without treatment cause a fairly quick death due to a condition called ketoacidosis now if there is too much insulin say caused by injecting a large amount into someone then they body will take too much sugar out of the bloodstream which can cause hypoglycemia which can lead to unconsciousness seizures coma and death so if someone was injected with a large amount of insulin and then immediately put more sugar in the bloodstream although a lot would be removed the remainder might be enough to allow the person to stay in the normal range and escape the worst effects now this is the part that depends what will happen will be determined be the amount of insulin and the amount of sugar as well as how fast the sugar gets into the bloodstream if you get injected with hundreds of units of insulin taking a chocolate bar isn't going to do anything you need iv sugar in sterile saline and in large quantities immediately so would a scene like you're describing play out the way it did in the movie probably not but in principal it's not completely wrong just mostly Diabetic ketoacidosis Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stroke Insulin resistance Diabetic coma Glucokinase Glycogen storage disease type I Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Diabetic hypoglycemia Hyperglycemia First aid Stomach cancer Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Endocrinology Traumatic brain injury Growth hormone Obesity Memento (film) Growth hormone deficiency Prostate cancer Insulinoma Growth hormone treatment Low-carbohydrate diet Intravenous therapy Fuel injection Clinical depression Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glycogen Urinary incontinence Intensive insulinotherapy Protein LSD Carbon dioxide Polycystic ovary syndrome Milk Gastroparesis Glucocorticoid Aspartame Epilepsy Dialysis Acromegaly Cocaine Dieting Lethal injection Chlorpromazine Puberty Coma Hormone Soft drink Anorexia nervosa Ketosis Psoriasis Route of administration Terri Schiavo Diabetes mellitus type 2 Panic attack Cystic fibrosis Acne Group A streptococcal infection Tooth Ketoacidosis Scar Anti-diabetic drug Maprotiline Decompression sickness Enzyme Pneumonia Weight training Ferret Protein-energy malnutrition Cholesterol Kidney Tooth enamel Paracetamol Allergy Carpal tunnel syndrome Hyperthermia Vitamin C Congenital hyperinsulinism Hamster Adjustable gastric band Homeostasis
