diabetes and lantus i was diagnosed with diabetes two weeks ago and i'm taking units of lantus every night at pm last night an hour after taking my lantus i checked my blood sugar and it was which is way too low i think they have me on too high of a dose i'm afraid that at night my blood sugar is going to drop to dangerous levels i'm not overweight my next appointment with the doctor isn't until the th any advice is appreciated hi i think you need to call your doctor right away don't risk waiting for your next appointment i take units of lantus at bedtime during the day i take novolog asparte units before each meal that is a fast acting insulin that lasts about hours long enough for me to process my meals these amounts types of insulin work fine for me but i've had diabetes for years type in the beginning it was a bit of a roller coaster ride with doses and or types of insulin changing every few days weeks finally we got my glucose levels settled down just fine of course there is the occasional time i will become hypoglycemic by now i usually know before checking that i'm too low hands start shaking heart races back of neck gets sweaty feel nauseated or feel unusually hungry or i get spaced out you've been diagnosed only weeks ago you'll have to expect a certain amount of changes until the doctor you find a good balance with your insulin for me at this point i make my own adjustments with my insulin not my lantus since that is a hour baseline insulin but the novolog that i take before meals i can change if i know i am about to eat a much larger meal than usual or a meal that is heavy on the carbs i will raise my insulin to or units conversely if all i'm going to eat is a yogurt then i drop my insulin to about or don't just wait for appointments if you see your insulin is not lowering your levels enough or if you are in the situation you are now medically you technically become hypoglycemic when you go under which you did but in reality you are likely to experience hypo symptoms anywhere from down you should have on hand near your bed some glucose tablets or gel which can be bought in any pharmacy or store that sells diabetes products this way if you see your levels are too low you have fast treatment if you see you are hypoglycemic take mgs of glucose gel one tube or tablets wait minutes check your levels again if you are out of the woods you want to stay that way so you then need protein eat one half of a sandwich peanut butter does it for me the protein from the pb combined with the carbs of the one slice of bread keep my numbers from falling down again it's very likely that your level of lantus is too high for you let me just throw out a question for you did you eat dinner that night if you didn't then it may not be that the lantus is too high if you did eat well also you didn't mention if you take a fast acting insulin during the day before meals i don't know anyone who only takes lantus but if that's all you need at this point well that's great how often do you check your glucose levels i check mine times a day that's because i do tight control where you keep your levels between and that's not for beginners though you should check as soon as you wake up before each meal hours after you eat hrs from when you start eating and at bedtime also you need to check before you exercise do sports and after you finish excuse me if i'm repeating stuff your doctor already told you don't worry about calling the doctor every day if you have to at this point the doctor won't mind diabetes is serious and it will be up to you to control it i would suggest keeping a diabetes journal between now your next appointment and the next few after that in it you want to put your glucose levels the time of day the situation dawn before breakfast hours after breakfast and the other meals before lantus and whenever else you check it many doctors ask you to do this it gives her him and you a picture of how your numbers are doing maybe the levels will show you need less lantus but something before meals for example who knows yet since you are newly diagnosed i would strongly suggest you buy one or two books about diabetes i learned far more from the books than i did from the doctors it's sad to say but if i did learn something that i felt applied to me would be better for me i brought the information to my doctors they always went along with what i learned you can call the ada american diabetes association and they will send you a catalogue of books or any good bookstore should have some just a thought if you were just diagnosed weeks ago i hope you have an endocrinologist because they are the experts on diabetes all the types of insulins dosages equipment insulin pens and insulin pumps etc also they will be connected to a diabetes educator who can help you with any lifestyle changes i e food exercise best of luck to you Hyperglycemia Glycogen storage disease type I Non-Hodgkin's
