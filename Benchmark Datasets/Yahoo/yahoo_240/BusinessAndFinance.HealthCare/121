do rn's have access to anyone's private medical information here's the situation my wife had a lesbian stalker back in college the lesbian recently graduated as an rn from the same university's health science center that my wife first saw a doctor for the pregnancy we never told anyone the due date but the lesbian called up my wife's brother lesbian had the number because she stole my wife's phone and asked if my wife is having a baby in days on august th aug was the exact due date my wife already had the baby but it was still really weird because we didn't know how she got that information my question is this can an rn look up medical history for anyone they want to or just medical history from a person at a certain hospital or what if so and if she did that this is a serious violation and i want to report her for doing it it's possible she could get access to your wife's information if she worked at the same hospital but technically speaking she is supposed to have access to the records of only the patients for whom she has direct care responsbility someone gave her access or someone looked up your wife's medical information and shared it with the rn there are federal hippa privacy laws that very specifically dictate who is to have access to records and with whom the information can be shared if this nurse has moved on from the university hospital it might be difficult to track her down but you should be able to find out who gave her the information all activities in an information system can be tracked and it would be a simple matter to track where the rn was and when and who logged onto the system and looked up your wife's information i would file a complaint with the hospital in fact i would ask for a meeting with either the ceo or the don director of nursing bring your brother who can discuss first hand the phone call conversation explain to them the background situation stalking and tell them you want some action taken against the rn if they still have some control over her and the person who allowed her to have access to the information tell them you are aware of the hippa laws look them up and be well versed you can also contact your state's nursing board and file a complaint against her the hospital will have done their investigation by then and will know when and how she got the information it could lead to her losing her rn license it's imperative that you take some action against this woman because that's the only way to stop the stalking harassment and invasion of your privacy Plame affair Medical record HIPAA Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Medical prescription Terri Schiavo Privacy Classified information Health insurance Infantilism Knots Landing Medicine Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Surveillance Fair Game (Scientology) Telephone tapping Neighbours Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Abortion in the United States Abortion Breastfeeding Rape Medicare (Canada) Childbirth Publicly funded medicine Roe v.
