is this even relevant rn lpn or cna's please i am emabarking on a career change i worked as a speech therapist assisant in a public school and want to become an rn i want to work as a cna while i am in nursing school i just completed my training and am writing my resume to start applying for jobs where i live they hire cna's in hospitals w o experience so this is where i am focusing my job search efforts i included my previous speech job as part of employment history on my resume but i wonder if i should include some volunteer work i did related to speech and hearing i provided free hearing screenings to industrial workers and also volunteered in a preschool speech language amd pre literacy program should i include this on my cna resume or would a don feel that i don't know how to identify relavent experience to put on a resume since these experiences aren't directly related to health care let me say that i think it is marvelous that you devoted so much to the community yes there is a spot on your resume for which you may mention these things volunteer work commitees not everyone puts it on their resume as many of us are taught not to be too wordy or too lengthly when applying however as a rn myself with over years of experience in acute care working with many different kinds of patients including those who are speech impaired i consider it an asset to have someone on staff who may be able to offer insight and experience while putting together a plan of care for such individuals you could also mention it during the interview process if you aren't comfortable putting it on your resume if i may also add that anyone who volunteers for anything shows enthusiasm for the needs at hand if i were the nurse mgr or don i would take note of this and be glad to have you i wish you well Nurse Milton H.
