what should i do it is my dream to be a doctor but i have a really big passion for singing i'm afraid that when i am a doctor i won't have time to sing or perform i know i want to be a doctor but i kinda feel like all the years i have spent training in singing and acting will go to waste if i become a doctor will i still have time to pursue my passion in performing arts or should i just give up my dream on becoming a doctor don't ever give up your dreams but be realistic what is the potential for your becoming a star but being a doctor is a pretty sure thing and it is needed pretty badly in a lot of places your singing would no doubt give people a lot of joy but your medical skills may give families longer lives together be the best singing doctor you can be hugs Cliff Richard Jon Secada The Emancipation of Mimi Theory of conduct Star Wars: Galaxies Blood on the Tracks AFI 100 Years series Dream Job (Season 2) Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Jazz Singer Noel Gallagher Rich Mullins The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind The Supremes Care Bears One Tree Hill (TV series) Garth Brooks Theatre Roxette Iron Maiden Le Malade imaginaire The Cure Norway national football team Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Highway 61 Revisited Doctor (Star Trek) Alena Doctorate Ben Johnson (athlete) E.
