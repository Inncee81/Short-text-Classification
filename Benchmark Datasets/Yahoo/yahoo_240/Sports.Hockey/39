i heard a rumour about marian hossa is there truth to the rumour that hossa may be on his way to vancouver sshueman if i was into guys hossa wouldn't be one of them i think he's butt ugly btw i care more about winning not what a guy looks like in my team's uni i can't see why the thrashers would trade hossa to vancouver when he led their team in goal assists points and sh goals he is set to make million this season in atlanta as his contract comes to an end this season but they are a solid team already and still have million cap space for this season in addition the trade would have to be for a player of somewhat equal salary where vancouver only has left before they hit the cap for the season in all honest i just really don't see atlanta parting ways with their top producer and one of three assistant captains Atlanta Thrashers Mari__n Hossa Atlanta Flames Vancouver Canucks Ottawa Senators Los Angeles Kings Salary cap 2003-04 NHL season 2002-03 NHL season Wayne Gretzky Boston Bruins New York Islanders National Hockey League Oakland Athletics Atlanta Braves Houston Astros Orlando Magic 1992-93 NHL season Boston Red Sox New York Knicks Mario Lemieux David Beckham Toronto Raptors Calgary Flames Minnesota Timberwolves Pittsburgh Pirates New England Patriots Chicago Bulls Washington Capitals Chicago Blackhawks Detroit Red Wings San Francisco Giants Essendon Football Club Florida Marlins Chicago White Sox New York Yankees International League Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
