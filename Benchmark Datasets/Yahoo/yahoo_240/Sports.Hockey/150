field hockey questions hi i'm staring field hockey in a few weeks and i have some questionsss for starters how do you play is it like lacrosse except on the ground is theyre hitting whats better a wood or composite stick why whats a good not tooo expensive brand and anything i should know you could write too thanks so much it is similar to lacrosse but i'm not sure if i'd say it's lacrosse on the ground there are players from each team on the field at any given time you have field players and one goalie the purpose is to use passing and drives hard hits to get the ball into the cage once you get down on to the other teams half of the field you will notice there is a yd circle you must be inside of this circle in order to score a goal also if you are inside this circle and a defensive foul occurs your team will get a corner a corner gives your team an advantage and is usually a great time to try and score no there is not hitting if you hit you will get carded by the ref carding consists of green warning yellow kicked out of game for mins red kicked out of entire game the type of sticks totally depend on your personal choice generally composites and made to drive better and that is more necessary for defensive players however i am a forward and i use a composite stick i recommend getting either a tk or a gray's they are both really good brands and you can get some pretty good cheap sticks whatever you do i would say stay away from brine their sticks tend to not last as long and are not worth the money you should have the following on the first day of tryouts cleats sneakers shin guards mouth guard stick practice ball these are just the necessities and you will know more after the first day good luck and i wish you a great season Field hockey Lacrosse Ice hockey Water polo Softball Glossary of American football American football Football (soccer) Billiards Floorball New York Giants Goaltender Canadian football Roller hockey Indoor soccer Volleyball Rugby league Goalkeeper Snooker National Football League Lore Rugby union positions National Football League Ultimate (sport) Poker jargon Batting (cricket) Tag Rugby union Broomball Golf Comparison of Canadian and American football Tris Speaker Goal (ice hockey) Football (soccer) positions Super Bowl XXXIV American football strategy Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVII 2005 World Series Paintball National Hockey League Fast bowling Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Cricket Table tennis Super Bowl IX Hurling Origins of baseball Sandy Koufax Super Bowl I Super Bowl XVIII Rink hockey Super Bowl XII GunBound The Joker's Wild Super Bowl XVII Cleveland Browns Table football World Series Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXIII St. Louis Cardinals Laws of cricket Hockey rink Super Bowl XXVI Playoff Super Bowl XXV Babe Ruth Harrow Football Chicago White Sox Women's lacrosse Carolina Panthers San Francisco 49ers Teen Girl Squad Fielding (cricket) Ty Cobb San Francisco Giants Baseball scorekeeping Arena football Major Indoor Soccer League New England Patriots Toronto Maple Leafs Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXIII Polo Super Bowl XXXII Michael Jordan Bicycle lighting Four square Chicago Blackhawks Football Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Los Angeles Clippers
