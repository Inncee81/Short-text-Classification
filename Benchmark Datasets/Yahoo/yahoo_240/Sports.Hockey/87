my goalie skates keep rusting help ok i got ccm goalie skates and i wipe them off with my shirt hockey socks every time i get off the ice i store them in a little bag inside my hockey bag to keep them seperated from the rest of my equipment every time like days later they will have rust all over the bottom of the blades what's up with that i've gotten them sharpened like twice but the rust keeps on comin back and i'm like sure that i always dry them off realy good anyone have a soloution to my problem thanks sometimes even wiping them off wont stop them from rusting first they do make protective covers that go over the blades and they do not cost much ask your local sporting good store about them secondly humidity in the air can cause rusting and oxidation try keeping them in a cool dry spot and dont wipe them off with your socks your feet sweat right sweat has salt in it right and salt causes oxidation when you wipe the blades with your socks your just covering the blades with your sweat always wipe them off with a clean dry cloth and store them in a zipped carrying case which can also be purchased in a sporting goods store Ice hockey Knife Figure skating Shoe Sock Rink hockey Climbing equipment Wok Hiking Ice skating Glossary of climbing terms Ice Coffee Floppy disk Thermal power station Lacrosse Wind turbine Roller skating Fencing Dairy Protective clothing Sento Japanese tea ceremony Rust Water polo Food preservation Compulsory figures Social aspects of clothing Corrosion Caving Vacuum cleaner Professional wrestling slang Field hockey Hyperthermia Goal (ice hockey) Carbon dioxide Humidity Textile manufacturing Miracle on Ice Goalkeeper Car washing techniques Hard disk Fossil fuel power plant Artistic roller skating Bulk vending Japanese toilet Edmonton Oilers Indoor soccer Sauna Sterilization (microbiology) National Hockey League All-Star Game Clothing Breathing gas Sport Woodworking Glossary of wildland fire terms Ammunition Fire fighting Plastic Tank Genericized trademark Welding Water Mattress Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chicago Blackhawks M16 (rifle) NHL series Bong Hockey rink Volleyball Olympic Games Drill bit Stainless steel Stanley Cup Ammonia Winter Olympic Games 2005-06 NHL season Potassium Hot air balloon Computer forensics Tofu Glossary of firefighting equipment Rocket Power Skateboarding Boxing training Table saw Desert Mark Messier Paintball Bus models used in New York City Transit Diving suit Motor oil Michelle Kwan Equine conformation Brewery Megadeth
