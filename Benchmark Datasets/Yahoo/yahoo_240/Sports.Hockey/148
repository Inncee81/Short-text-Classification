where do the saint louis blues stand are the blues done with free agency are they getting ready for a trade so far i think the blues are off to a slow start tkachuk is a joke and a waste of money and kariya can only be as good as the players around him weight is o k but no superstar and legace is no marty broduer so where do the blues stand going into the new season see above honestly though the blues arent at a complete loss but they are not quite at their year they have a lot of quality young players and a bright future to look forward to manny legace right now has to prove that he is a quality netminder yes true in detroit he was great but is he saying he cant win without quality around him all the time realistically they pieces arent going to fit they dont have a lot of scoring punch and just kariya can not carry this team they have a young defesive core but they need a littl more experience and some solid offense in front of then to win games i think they did a good job by picking up toivenen he is going to be good but isnt devolped enough yet here is what they need some strong centermen another winger and a leadership defenseman trades would most liekely be the answer but i thin st louis will look at that later in the season they have to see what they are putting on the ice first i think they should look at trying to get a guy like norstrom out of dallas where they are over stocked and solid defnsemen a steven weiss or nathan horton out of florida and a ryan smyth could place then where they want to be sorry but this year is not their year and with a division of detroit and nashville is going to make it very tough also dont be suprised if chicago pulls it together this year they are young and talented and almost have all the right pieces Detroit Red Wings St. Louis Blues (hockey) New York Giants Boston Bruins Manny Legace 2003-04 NHL season Detroit Tigers Chicago Blackhawks Pittsburgh Steelers World Series 2002-03 NHL season New England Patriots Toronto Blue Jays Toronto Raptors St. Louis Rams Montreal Canadiens New York Knicks Boston Red Sox Toronto Maple Leafs Pittsburgh Penguins Cleveland Browns New York Islanders Indiana Pacers Miami Dolphins Chicago White Sox Wayne Gretzky Buffalo Bills 1992-93 NHL season Stanley Cup San Francisco 49ers Atlanta Flames Chicago Bulls Oakland Athletics Colorado Avalanche Utah Jazz National Football League Dallas Cowboys St. Louis Cardinals Washington Capitals Carolina Panthers Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Newcastle United F.C.
