my yr old daughter has adhd is their any alternatives to help her cope besides medication my son is almost and has adhd we researched the diet thing very thoroughly and were told by our son's specialist that the food allergy theory has nothing to do with true adhd my mom told me to watch for food dyes my best friend said get rid of wheat another friend said take out milk and eggs but adhd isn't diet related it's a chemical condition in the brain a good healthy diet is important and we stay away from junk food we don't use medication although if he were worse i would keep an open mind to it but only as a last option his life is quite structured he goes to bed early even on weekends or in the summer because he wakes up early and he burns so much energy during the day that his body needs to sleep he has jobs to do every day with a schedule posted on the fridge he knows what is expected of him and he does better with a set routine he's a smart boy but he feels stupid because his grades don't reflect what his brain could really do if he could make it focus he compares himself to his older sister and doesn't feel like he measures up my job is to make sure he has opportunities for success and to remind him of his strengths his self esteem is so low and that breaks my heart he doesn't handle pressure very well gets frustrated and emotional i try to keep things level and i try to organize our life so we're not running late or having to scramble to get somewhere on time there's a really good book called taking charge of adhd by russell a barkley our doctor recommended it and it helped us a lot i've loaned it to a few of my friends as well so i guess my suggestions are pretty basic encourage her support her love her be so so so so patient with her give her structure and predictability and find things she can succeed at work with her teachers because i've found that most of them are very willing and open if you approach them with a positive spirit and understand that you're going to second guess yourself wonder if you're doing this right and wish someone could just tell you what to do to fix her i question myself when things get tough am i using the adhd as an excuse to go easy on him sometimes should i have higher expectations am i actually too hard on him oh my goodness i lost my temper i'm not supposed to lose my temper but it's so frustrating sometimes i'm sure you know what i mean good luck we'll get them through to adulthood because we're moms Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Dieting Kodocha EastEnders Neurofeedback Social rule Milton H.
