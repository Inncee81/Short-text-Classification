pregnant and teaching school i am a junior high math teacher and school starts in a week and a half i've been sick on and off for the last few weeks about weeks pregnant i've found that the more i stand and do things the more likely i am to get sick when i teach i am constantly on my feet i just wondered if any of you have any tips on how i can be a good teacher and not be sick all the time because of the pregnancy thanks in advance i used a bar stool a lot when i was at the front of the room i also stopped walking around the room to answer questions and had the students walk back to my desk for help under my desk i had a foot stool to elevate my feet when i was able to sit i wore really ugly comfy big shoes to help with the swelling that i always had by the end of the day then i went home and wrapped my tootsies in a cold towel and put them up for the whole evening on the bright side the kids will love watching your baby grow and ask so many fun questions and be so excited for you i loved it Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Sento Irish dance Friends Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boston Public Sin City Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Obstetrics Japanese tea ceremony The Catcher in the Rye Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
