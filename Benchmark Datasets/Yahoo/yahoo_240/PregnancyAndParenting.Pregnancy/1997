first ultrasound i got to see the baby the heartbeat and a cyst my concern is the cyst my doctor says not to worry about it but in the same sentence he said that he is a little concerned over how large it is he said that the good thing is that it's actually producing progesterone which helps maintain the pregnancy i feel the pain from it didn't realize that's what it was until the ultrasound but it's not so bad that i can't live with it just usually hurts when i stretch i know that it is on the same side that i ovulated from i had to have ultrasounds prior to being pregnant as we had artificial insemination and there was no cyst previously anyone had this happen before and what did they do i have a follow up ultrasound scheduled for was it a corpus luteum cyst this is a cyst on the ovary where the egg was released it aids in the pregnancy progressing for the first several weeks it is normal sounds like yours might be a little larger than normal but it also sounds like he is aware of that and monitoring you if you used any fertility medications they could have overstimulated your ovaries and might have played a role in this i hope this helps congratulations Menstrual cycle Ovary Ovarian cyst Obstetrics Pregnancy Polycystic ovary syndrome Progesterone Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Puberty In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Human chorionic gonadotropin Fertility awareness Ectopic pregnancy Estrus cycle Infertility Guinea pig Spina bifida Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cephalic disorder Ovarian cancer Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Breech birth Medicine Prenatal diagnosis Birth control Syringomyelia Radiation therapy Gynaecology Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Ultrasound Abortion EastEnders Toxoplasmosis Stomach cancer Sexual reproduction Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Urinary incontinence Ovum Emergency contraception Breast cancer Psoriasis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Turner syndrome Multiple birth Prenatal care Stroke Intact dilation and extraction Medical ultrasonography Rush Limbaugh Embryo transfer Chemical abortion Atherosclerosis Abortion debate Uterine fibroids Tobacco smoking Vitamin C Medical prescription Testicle Acne Sexual abstinence Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Prolactinoma Midwifery Ben Johnson (athlete) Female reproductive system (human) Tsetse fly Luteinizing hormone Adoption Abortion in the United States Diabetes mellitus A Course In Miracles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Loudspeaker Abortion in Canada Pregnancy test Chronic fatigue syndrome Intraocular lens Medical imaging Sharon Tate Traumatic brain injury Multiple sclerosis Heartbeat (television) Renal cell carcinoma Maprotiline Polycystic kidney disease Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Erectile dysfunction Blood pressure Chiropractic Estrogen Fertilisation Jon Secada
