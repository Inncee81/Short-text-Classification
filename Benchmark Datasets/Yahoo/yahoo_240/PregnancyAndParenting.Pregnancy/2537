okay questions about pregnancy tests in nd or rd trimester should they be positive or negative okay so here i am thinking of every possible thing that could be wrong with me and i can't come up with nothing but i thought of an interesting question when you are like months pregnant will it still show up on a pregnancy test or is there a certain amount of time you have to take a test for it to show up i was asking because not too long ago a woman gave birth to a baby boy and didn't even know she was pregnant until she went into the er with horrible stomach pains they then told her she was in labor so just thought it would be a good question to ask and see what everyone thinks better than worrying about my own problems for awhile lol yes it would show up positive the hormone stays in your body that causes a test to show up until about weeks after you give birth i know a girl that went to the er and thought she might have kidney stones and found out she was in labor she had no clue that she was pregnant she looked up at the doctor and said the last time i had sex was months ago around christmas he said well there's the father then Pregnancy Abortion debate Obstetrics EastEnders Miscarriage Abortion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Breastfeeding Neighbours Prenatal diagnosis Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Friends Melanie Wilkes Turner syndrome Fertility awareness One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Premature birth One Life to Live Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Days of our Lives Tocopherol Coeliac disease Oral contraceptive Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transsexuality Knots Landing Stomach cancer Pregnancy test Intact dilation and extraction Spina bifida Folic acid Babe Carey Cytomegalovirus I Married Marge Psoriasis Endometriosis Jam (TV series) Sex and the City Child sexuality Roe v.
