w d and still no baby ive been losing my plug slowly but no strong contractions just menstral like cramps i am scheduled to be induced on thursday but all i hear are horror stories about inductions does anyone have a good story to share i just need to see a light at the end of this tunnel i was induced times and went through natural labor with of my children given a choice i'd much prefer to be induced my doctor permitted me to have an epidural as soon as i wanted one while being induced instead of having to wait until a certain point during natural labor i wasn't able to have one during the natural labor i was already cm by the time i reached the hospital i was able to take naps while going through the worst of labor during induction because of my epidural as well i never had any adverse reactions to the pitocin or epidural either i don't know if you're planning of having an epidural it's completely your choice obviously but i would recommend it during induction since the labor pains tend to be stronger best wishes Childbirth Anesthesia Caesarean section Abortion Breastfeeding Induction (birth) Milton H.
