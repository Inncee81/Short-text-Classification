is there such a thing as a false positive pregnancy test i have hashimotos thyroiditis and i do not have regular periods in fact i have only had one in over a year and that was on june rd the one before that was december of i was hoping my period would come back at the end of july and when it didnt i wasnt worried because that happens well i started feeling really naseous about days ago and it hasnt gone away so i took a pregnancy test just to be sure well it was the kind with lines and the line that indicates pregnancy was really dark but the line that just shows up anyways was really light i took in days and they both read the same way are these bad tests or am i pregnant the 'best' answer i can give you is that it's now time to go see the doctor for a good 'pelvic exam' and a blood test for pregnancy i'd say the 'odds are in your favor' that you are pregnant but if you aren't perhaps the doctor can 'explain why' your two 'home tests' were so 'definitive' and so 'wrong' and because you have hashimotos thyroidits you will need to be 'followed carefully' from the 'very beginning' of your pregnancy good luck Pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Abortion debate Turner syndrome Endometriosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Pregnancy test Fertility awareness Human sexual behavior HIV test Childbirth Friends Prolactinoma Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Coeliac disease Miscarriage Tocopherol Human chorionic gonadotropin Thyroid 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prenatal diagnosis Bernice Summerfield Hyperprolactinaemia Drug test Gonorrhoea Goodness and value theory Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Scientific method Days of our Lives Twin Urinary incontinence Philosophical skepticism Obstetrics Lucille Ball Kender Breech birth Infertility Pitaten Polycystic ovary syndrome Notable lines in the Star Wars series 1957 World Series Ovarian cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crossing Jordan Sharon Tate Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fecal incontinence Folic acid Cancer Social rule AFI 100 Years series Diabetic retinopathy Abduction Phenomenon Stomach cancer Time Out of Mind Psoriasis Big Brother UK series 6 Abortion in the United States Boom Town (Doctor Who) Chlamydia Tobacco smoking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pro-choice Bart Gets an F Panay incident The Ashlee Simpson Show Birth control EastEnders Taken Scientology beliefs and practices Cytomegalovirus Leviathan (book) Endometrial cancer Rosa Parks Brian Close Autoimmune diseases Phoebe Halliwell Game show Ectopic pregnancy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Contract Bayesian inference Melanie Wilkes Oral contraceptive Neighbours Breastfeeding The Subtle Knife The Star Wars Holiday Special Darryl Strawberry Chronic fatigue syndrome Sex education Normal distribution Origin belief Jeopardy!
