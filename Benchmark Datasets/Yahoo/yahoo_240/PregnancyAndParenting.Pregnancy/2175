probably a stupid question ah well counting from my lmp i will be weeks on monday when i was weeks i had an early ultrsound due to some bleeding they didn't mention anything about dates i had my doctor appointment the other day and she looked at the ultrasound and changed my due date which will make me weeks on tuesday since a due date is only an estimate and can be weeks out either way is it really a big deal if i stick with my calculations i like my original due date better valentine's day lol and don't want to go back a week i am so excited about this pregnancy and ready up every week how my bub is developing etc i know that in the long run the doctor is right but sooner or later it's all gonna be the same or close enough right told you it was a stupid question yeah go with whichever you like best the bub is unlikely to be born the exact day anyway even the week prdicted especially if its your first lol your baby is the only one who knows for sure when it is going to be born lol good luck with the pregnancy and a safe and healthy delivery Pregnancy Obstetrics The Ashlee Simpson Show Miscarriage The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie EastEnders Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal care Breech birth Garfield 24 Hours of Le Mans Abortion Roman calendar Slow Train Coming Billboard Hot 100 Bowl Championship Series Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Cancelled Apollo missions Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Menstrual cycle Hall & Oates Blonde on Blonde UK Singles Chart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prenatal diagnosis Joke Holiday Intact dilation and extraction Doomsday rule New York Giants She Loves You Stomach cancer Paul Is Dead Jennifer Lopez Bleed Like Me Brian Close Breastfeeding Humphrey Bogart Gregorian calendar Frankie Laine Futurama (TV series - season 3) Hey Arnold!
