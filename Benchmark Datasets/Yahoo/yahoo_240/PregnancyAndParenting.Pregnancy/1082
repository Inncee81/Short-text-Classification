i have a question i am weeks days pregnant have my first prenatal doctor appointment on august th i was just wondering how the doctor actually figures out exactly how far along you are because what if i was wrong about the first day of my last period also my lower pelvis area has been feeling really crampy achey every once in a while what is it from something with my uterus maybe since i am pregnant first time pregnancy so just looking for some advice they measure the length of the baby via ultra sound that is the determining factor they will go by that before dates b c dates aren't always accurate the lower abdomen part could be completely normal so long as you have not started bleeding bright red blood many times what feels like cramps are just the uterus growing and the ligaments holding the uterus stretching to accommodate growing baby hth Pregnancy Obstetrics Endometriosis Breech birth Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Childbirth Uterus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prenatal diagnosis Ectopic pregnancy Premature birth Abortion Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Ovarian cancer Endometrial cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual differentiation Breastfeeding Caesarean section Twin Sexual reproduction Gynaecology Puberty Cramp Equine conformation Oral contraceptive Dialysis Cervical cancer Cancer Folic acid Infertility Intact dilation and extraction Human height Friends Chemical abortion Cervix Prenatal care Stenberg v.
