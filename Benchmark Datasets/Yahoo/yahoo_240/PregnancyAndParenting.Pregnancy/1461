what would you do extremely long story i thought it was it was cool that my best friend and i are pregnant at the same time until she started telling me about the way her boyfriend has been acting what do you think they have been friends since jr high about years now and they have both been with other people he has been married she cheated on him so they divorced and he had a one night stand almost a year ago and got the women pregnant she just recently had the baby here is where it gets crazy my friend found out she was pregnant only days before his baby was born and they were only together a lil over a month used condom and she was on the pill she says now that he doesnt spend that much time with her because he wants to see his baby and he doesnt want his family to know about their baby yet to top it off she said she found a letter his step dad wrote to her bf lawyer fighting for custody saying that he should be w the other women even though my friend is pregnant what should she do about him she doesnt want to leave him but i dont know how to help her i feel that i dont spend alout of time with my bf either but i heard its common for pregnant women to feel this way ok its really hard to figure it all out from one perspective his baby and the mother of his baby need him to be there but from your friends perspective she is pregnant with his child and needs him he has a really hard juggling act to try to figure out if he only sees the baby once a week he is a bad dead beat father but if he is there to much your friend feels abandoned and the other mother might get ideas that they are going to become a family she needs to ask him to go to all of her appointments so if nothing else he is there for the baby she is going to have to give him some time the truth is once the baby is a few months old he will start being able to take him like over night it makes perfect since that his family thinks he should be with the mother of his child and also im sure he feels like he is still trying to explain the first pregnancy to his family but to have to admit to them that he did basically the same thing again they are going to give him he she needs to set down some ground rules and talk to him and explain what she needs from him good luck that is why if you get someone pregnant you should hold off on dating until the baby is a few months old i know i know easier said than done EastEnders Knots Landing Kodocha Pregnancy Neighbours Friends Social rule Atomic Kitten One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives Sex and the City History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Boston Public About a Boy One Life to Live Jennifer Lopez Charmed Avenue Q Melanie Wilkes Divorce Pitaten Abortion debate Hollyoaks Alois Hitler Eddie Guerrero Birth control Sharon Tate Married... with Children Paranoia Agent Kimi Finster The Amber Spyglass Luke and Laura Spencer Phoebe Halliwell Jon Secada The Lovely Bones Oral contraceptive Breastfeeding Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Kill Bill Past characters (Neighbours) Miscarriage Fred Phelps Elvis and Me Liza of Lambeth Sleeping Murder Glen Jacobs John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Empty Child Origin belief Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Clint Eastwood Aida (musical) Kim Possible: So the Drama Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Theory of conduct Maury Sami Brady George Costanza Jam (TV series) Everwood Virgin Mary in Islam Alanis Morissette Hey Jude Coronation Street The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Marilyn Monroe Childbirth Romulus and Remus Tupac Shakur Dorothy L.
