any advice to give about abortion from a christian standpoint i have a relative that is years old her career is finally going in the right direction she has two young boys and has recently divorced the problem is she had a one night stand with someone that was a casual friend and now she's pregnant she is talking about an abortion and wants my advice now she knows that i am a christian and pro life i don't want to come across like i'm judging her i love her and really feel for her situation she realizes she made a huge mistake even before she found out she was pregnant there is absolutely no possibility that she and the father would be together two wrongs don't make a right what do i tell her that would help her but also keep my convictions surely your friend knows your feelings but whatever your feelings are you cannot make her choice for her tell her you love her and will no matter what but don't assume you can tell her what she should do knowing that she has love and support from her friends no matter what her choice might be could be a deciding factor in what choice she makes and thats the most you can offer i do not think that this is going against your convictions jesus taught us to love one another as he has loved us not to try to control or convince others god gave us all free will after all and only he can take it away Theodicy Friends Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Days of our Lives Theory of conduct Evil God Sex and the City Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Appeal Homosexuality and Christianity Pitaten Cliff Richard Jon Secada Knots Landing Fancy Crane Avenue Q C.
