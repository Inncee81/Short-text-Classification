being given to state and pregnant there's a high possibility that i may be pregnant and in days or so i will be handed over into the states' hands because my grandparents are terminating their guardianship of me and my sister long story im moving to my other grandparents so what would happen if i'm pregnant and i'm under control by the state if you have any questions please write email me because people always leave a question check with the laws but im pretty sure they cannot take your child away from you if your under the care of the state they will also pay for your medical expenses take care and after you have this baby go back to school and get a good job for your new family good luck to you Pregnancy Abortion debate Adoption Knots Landing Pitaten Kodocha Triage Heartbeat (television) Everwood Melanie Wilkes Medicare (Canada) Miscarriage Roe v.
