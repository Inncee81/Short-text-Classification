weeks and pain question this isn't simply a question about pressure in my pelvis for the past two days i just can't comfortable my back is hurting in waves i get bh contractions across my belly yesterday i did have such intense pressure i was afraid my water would break at work at my desk haha i go to my weekly doctors appt today they haven't checked my cervix for weeks is it out of wack for me to ask them to check and what i've listed is just the tip of the iceberg in symptoms i'm going through that are just getting worse over the past days any advice i hate it that doctors intimidate me but they do am i just overreacting and should i just wait you can always ask them to check you but honestly what difference does it make knowing if your cervix is closed or if you are cm labor starts when it is ready and knowing what your cervix is at isn't going to give you any more of a predictor on how close you are most docs and midwives these days have favored not doing routine cervical checks until you are due weeks or have actually started labor because every time you have an exam you run the risk for infection despite sterile technique and there is no medical benefit at this point in knowing what condition your cervix is in they would be checking merely to satisfy curiosity and that's not necessarily the best reason to be risking infection even if the risk is relatively small you are obviously getting very close and yes it is common to feel more aches pains and pressure in the last weeks of pregnancy as your body readies the cervix and uterus for labor it can go on like this for days or weeks before active labor finally begins hang in there your baby will be in your arms before you know it congrats in advance Childbirth Abortion Miscarriage Breech birth Obstetrics Premature birth Prostate cancer Cervix Breastfeeding Pregnancy Cervical cancer Fertility awareness Menstrual cup Intact dilation and extraction Gonorrhoea Urinary incontinence Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stomach cancer Ectopic pregnancy Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
