i'm curious about labor ok so i have had children and have my th on the way but all my babies have to be delivered by c section i am so curious as to what it feels like to be in labor i see people talking on here all the time about being dilated and effaced and a bloody show what is all this i have delivered all my babies at weeks weeks and weeks and never had any signs of labor can you give me some of your labor experiences details to if your comfortable with that thanks in advance no i will be having another c section my last one but i am curious because i have never had vaginal birth what it is like and because i will never get to experience it when you're effacing and dilating you don't usually feel it although you definately feel that the baby is low in the abdomen as i'm sure you've actually felt especially when you were weeks pregnant there's no actual feeling of being dilated though and if a woman isn't told that she is after an exam she'd never know it i'm suprised you might ask your doctor if you may have had this happen with at least one of your children few women make it weeks without effacing or dilating even a little bit the mucous plug is a little more common than bloody show in on coming labor basically the cervix acts like a cork holding the baby the amniotic sac and the placenta in and protected as the cervix begins to thin out and dilate the plug starts to come out as early as a few weeks before the plug can start to come out it looks like snot basically everybody's labor experiences are different and even labor experiences can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy for the same woman for me i had my kids a teeny bit early not enough to be premature but they were very small lbs and lbs oz when my sister asked about labor when she was pregnant i told her that it hurt it was hard but it wasn't as bad as everyone says it is i mean my kids just kinda popped right out then she went almost weeks pregnant was induced labored for nearly hours and eventually had to have a c section to remove the child we affectionally nicknamed hoss because he was nearly eleven pounds her second son was a planned c section and she did not miss the laboring part my other sister had a planned c section with her first child because she was breech she's now weeks pregnant with her second and she's trying to go into labor naturally she's an rn in the labor and delivery wing of a hospital and i think helping hundreds of women through labor kind of caused her to resent not getting to have her own labor experience she's familiar with the doctors who would be caring for her and with the nurses they're all her coworkers so even though they rarely do vbac vaginal birth after caesareans they are planning to do one for her but she can't be induced she has to go into labor naturally Intact dilation and extraction Abortion Premature birth Breastfeeding Caesarean section Urinary incontinence Partial-birth abortion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertility awareness Abortion in the United States Strap-on dildo Ectopic pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Sexual reproduction Amniotic sac Cytomegalovirus Knots Landing Birth weight EastEnders Diethylstilbestrol Birth control Twin Gonorrhoea Humphrey Bogart Friends Spina bifida Theory of conduct Placenta praevia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetic retinopathy Cervical cancer Sexual intercourse Menstrual cup Gynaecology Turner syndrome Menstrual cycle Midwifery Pitaten Psoriasis Fecal incontinence Kodocha Endometriosis Prenatal diagnosis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Progesterone Puberty Milton H.
