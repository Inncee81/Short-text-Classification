how much should baby movement slow down in the last trimester i am weeks and over the last two days the baby's movements have drastically slowed down my doctor said i would notice less because the baby was running out of room but i didn't think it would be quite so much i got worried and did the test where you drink cold water and lay down for two hours and hope for kicks i felt movements though most were barely noticeable and very mild i guess that still counts just wondering if this sounds normal and if everyone else experiences this your baby may be moving into your birth canal and you will a lot less movement Pregnancy Obstetrics Breastfeeding Childbirth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Miscarriage Urinary incontinence The Curse of Fenric Breech birth EastEnders The Contender (television series) Abortion in the United States G-Man (Half-Life) Knots Landing Slow Train Coming StarCraft Secret Missions Fertility awareness Drowning Fecal incontinence Social rule Mercury 4 AFI 100 Years series Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Swingout The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Rod Stewart Ben Johnson (athlete) K' Blood on the Tracks House of M 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Humphrey Bogart Backstroke Narcolepsy Tupac Shakur Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada The Tomb of the Cybermen Milton H.
