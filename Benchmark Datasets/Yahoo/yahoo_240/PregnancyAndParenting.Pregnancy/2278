stress or early labour my husband and i had a bad fight today it's the first time during this pregnancy that i've felt unstable and i took it out on him unfortunately he's in a bad mood too today and he yelled back and as you can imagine the whole thing turned into something bad which could've been avoided if one of us managed to control ourselves anyway he refuses to talk to me and yes it is my fault i went looking for a fight and it upsets me even more he said sorry doesn't fix everything and i'm now on his ignore list for the past hour or so i've been feeling stabbing pains in my sides and over my lower abdomen i'm hoping it's the 'stress' caused by the fight and not early labour now is certainly not the best time to go into labour could it just be stress or signs of labour i have no idea what early labour is supposed to feel like but it doesn't feel like contractions to me i'm weeks my advice would be to keep an eye on it and if it gets worse then ring your hospital for advice pains in that area at your stage of pregnancy are not uncommon anyway and may just be more noticeable because your worked up try to relax and give your husband a bit of space i hope all goes well for you good luck and just so you know most women have times when they go looking for arguments while they are pregnant it does not make it right but your not alone i think we all do it from time to time Childbirth Breastfeeding Pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Goodness and value theory Social rule Premature birth Theory of conduct Equine conformation Stomach cancer EastEnders Haloperidol Milton H.
