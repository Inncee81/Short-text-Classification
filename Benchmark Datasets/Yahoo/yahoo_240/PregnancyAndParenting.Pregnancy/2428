ok how else can i if this is true labor i have been timing the contractions and they are about every to mins and about to seconds long i took a shower drank a glass of water and walked around should i call my dr first or call my husband and tell him to come home i am an days pregnant and this is my second kid if you are not so uncomfortable that you have to stop to breathe and really focus on getting through them and if they are all consistently short seconds then chances are good you are not in active labor do as others have suggested drink a glass of water and lie down preferably on the left side as this improves uterine blood flow odds are your contractions will ease up or stop you will know true labor because they will become increasingly more uncomfortable and they will last at least seconds definitely call your doctor just to let them know and they might want you to head into l d to be evaluated but at this point from the sound of it they'd probably send you home unless you were really working on keeping control over the pain or if there has been significant change to your cervix which it doesn't sound like there would be with these short weak contractions generally speaking if you have to ask is this labor it probably isn't or at the least it is too early to be running to the hospital this could be early labor which unfortunately for some women could go on for hours or days but your baby is definitely near congrats in advance Childbirth Premature birth Prostate cancer Pregnancy Social rule Menstrual cycle Breech birth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Myocardial infarction Miscarriage Triage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Endometrial cancer Humphrey Bogart Caesarean section Stroke Cramp The Catcher in the Rye Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Poker jargon Cervix Theory of conduct Friends Weight training Stereoscopy Elephant Menstrual cup Oral sex Customs and etiquette of Japan Marathon (sport) Mattress Abortion First aid Age of Mythology Dog training Massage Hitman (computer game) Kodocha Knots Landing Swimming Fertility awareness Trade union Abortion debate Sin City Insurance Intact dilation and extraction Tea Hiccup Labour economics Endometriosis Fecal incontinence Inflation Shen Gong Wu Diabetic retinopathy Stuttering Niddah Japanese toilet Sento Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Dundas Square The Death Gate Cycle Ben Johnson (athlete) Apollo 8 Sleep apnea Scuba set USS Tunny (SS-282) Professional wrestling holds Gonorrhoea Water polo Nancy Witcher Astor Dialysis View camera Human sexual response cycle 1957 World Series Tourniquet Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Debate Days of our Lives Sailing Atherosclerosis Hiberno-English Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Ocean's Twelve Drowning Traumatic incident reduction Whose Line Is It Anyway?
