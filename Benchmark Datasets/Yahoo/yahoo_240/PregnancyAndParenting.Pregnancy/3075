could i be pregnant already i had a miscarriage early last month i had sex weeks after i checked my chart and it said that i might have been ovulating at the time my fiance and i were together i didnt think anything of it until this week im due for a monthly cycle and i have been soo tired and had a crazy dream last night is it possible and safe to be pregnant so early after a miscarriage my doctor told us to wait cycles but it sort of skipped our mind whilw we were away lol but im nervous about calling my gyn dont wanna be scolded when i say scolding i mean it nicely not that my gyn would disrespect me in any way i like my dr very professional and kind just might give me that didnt i tell you to wait look the only symptoms i have so far are tiredness and urinating a lil more than usual during the day last time i had a runny nose that just wouldnt stop but not this time yet take a pregnancy test then schedule an appointment to go in to your gyn if this gyn does scold you go to another dr don't put up with a dr that is cruel towards you but your body could also be tired due to the fact that you miscarried and that you need to recuperate from the miscarriage take care Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Fertility awareness Obstetrics Marilyn Monroe Pregnancy test Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Medicine Polycystic ovary syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Neighbours Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Niddah Coeliac disease Twin Birth control Rod Stewart Emergency contraception Stomach cancer Ebola Jam (TV series) Cytomegalovirus The Inside EastEnders Gonorrhoea Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cephalic disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Prenatal care Knots Landing Doxepin Abortion Spina bifida Humphrey Bogart Morning sickness Ovulation Dog training Singlish Human chorionic gonadotropin Abortion debate Chlamydia Psoriasis Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Gregg Alexander Hip hop collaborations Usher (entertainer) Triage Ocean's Twelve Sharon Tate Laura Schlessinger Shaggy dog story Drug test Billboard Hot 100 Aaliyah Stillbirth Intact dilation and extraction Caffeine Jon Secada Breastfeeding Sexual abstinence Ben Johnson (athlete) Apollo 8 Guinea pig Oasis (band) Clomipramine Premature birth Tobacco smoking Housebreaking Dinah Marler Futurama (TV series - season 5) Endometriosis Gynecologic hemorrhage Jennifer Lopez Social rule CPU cache Saga (band) Prolactinoma Van Morrison Nuclear fallout Haloperidol Diabetes mellitus Ja Rule Chronic fatigue syndrome Big Brother UK series 6 Opioid Theory of conduct Hall & Oates Cancer Avenue Q Pelvic inflammatory disease Autism Boom Crash Opera The Ashlee Simpson Show The Contender (television series) HIV
