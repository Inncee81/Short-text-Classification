what is the best way to help push out the baby when giving birth when i had my first baby it was what they call a difficult delivery first baby was three days late then bad contractions came less then five mintutes apart went to hospital they said my water broke but i did not feel it nothing came out until the nurse checked then i felt it come out then they asked when my water broke which is dumb they gave me pitocine to induce labour cause for some strange reason i would not dialate on y own finally when i did dialate centameters the nurse had me push which seemed to fine until they gave me an epidural then i could not push they put a vacume on my babys head and still could not get her out so finally when the dr gave me an epesiatamty the baby came right out i wouldnt tear so what could i do to have my next expected baby come out easier hate to tell you this but that nurse broke your water accidentally or deliberately i don't know the easiest way to get your baby out is to avoid the interventions you had last time don't allow them to break your water if necessary don't allow examinations artificial ruptur of membranes can easily bring baby down into a bad position for birth pitocin just exaggerates that by causing artificially strong and frequent contractions that wedge the baby further into the bad position epidurals restrict your movement and disconnect you from your body which would tell you how to move to help to reposition your baby and allow him to descend you were never given a chance to dilate on your own if you want to help this next little one out don't accept induction without medical need ruptured membranes isn't a medical need even the american college of obstetricians and gynaecologists recommends waiting hours from rupture to start of induction i'd personally wait as long as it took don't labour on your back research active birth keep mobile stand squat get a birthing ball don't get an epidural make sure you get perineal support during the pushing stage to support the episiotomy scar don't allow another but be prepared that it may reopen under pressure do not allow anyone to tell you how long and when to push go with what your body tells you for optimum results i urge you to look into this further and commend you for starting to plan your birth experience ahead of time congratulations on your pregnancy and i wish you all the luck in the world Abortion Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Episiotomy Breastfeeding Caesarean section Breech birth Miscarriage Midwifery Prostate cancer Induction (birth) Epidural Abortion debate Knots Landing Equine conformation Intact dilation and extraction Menstrual cup Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Social rule Stroke Birth control Friends Medicine Amniotic sac Wound healing phases Abortion in the United States Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Weight training Stuttering Sydney Riot of 1879 Turner syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction EastEnders Shaggy dog story Herpes simplex virus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Condom Hypnosis Poker jargon Emergency contraception Triage Certified Nursing Assistant Vernon Schillinger Jon Secada Ben Johnson (athlete) Prenatal diagnosis Dialysis Alexander Technique Roe v.
