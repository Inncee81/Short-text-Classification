waterbirth or normal birth with epidural i have an average tolerance for pain i like the idea and the benefits of having a waterbirth but how much pain are we talking about has anyone ever delivered both ways thanks i have had one child naturally and it wasn't as bad as i had imagined my second child was a section since she was breech i am now weeks with number i am a nursing student and last year i witness my first water birth needless to say i have decided to have a waterbirth this time the mothers i have seen were relaxed and the delivery seemed so natural the entire atmosphere was calm and perfect to bring a new life into i spoke with both mothers and like you they had normal tolerance for pain i expect to deliver the st week of november so if i deliver before you i'll let you know how it went if you go with waterbirth and pain is too much you can alway get out and go with an epidural if you go right with the epidural you cannot try the waterbirth i would go with the waterbirth and if it is too much try normal with epidural but you do have to change your mind before you reach cm good luck Childbirth Obstetrics Epidural Caesarean section Pregnancy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Breech birth Midwifery Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Intact dilation and extraction Theodicy Aikido Scientology beliefs and practices Hypnosis Milton H.
