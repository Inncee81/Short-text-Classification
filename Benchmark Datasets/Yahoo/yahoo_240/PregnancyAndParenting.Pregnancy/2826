i'm weeks today and went to my dr today for my st internal exam i'm just curious on what you guys think there is protein in my urine he didn't tell me much about it just took some blood work and i gotta collect all my urine in a jug for the next hours yuck anybody got a clue what's up i'm not dilated at all but i'm effaced i've felt no contractions what so ever yet but i'm very anxious to have her i would like to start walking soon this wasn't my normal dr today he's on vacation this week the doctor is most likely testing for preeclampsia due to the elevated levels of protein in the urine it is normal to have some protein in the urine but if a doctor notices elevated levels there may be a concern to be preeclamptic you would also have to have an elevated bp what was your bp reading at this appt even if it was not high the doctor will order a hour urine test to check definatively for protein in the urine this test gives a more accurate idea of whether you are having this symptom of preeclampsia Prostate cancer Hypoglycemia Obstetrics Pregnancy Diabetes mellitus Insulin Urinary incontinence Multiple myeloma Kidney Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
