what to do with this pregnant friend my friend is wks pregnant with her rd so you'd think she'll know better by now she drinks yesterday she had brandies and glasses of wine smokes like a chimney weighs over pounds doesn't take prenatals she says they make her feel sick i bought her the kind i use they worked well for my 'sickness' she says they work but i don't know if she's taking them she still hasn't been to see a proper dr i offered to take her to mine this wk i'll even make the appt but she doesn't want to go they have med ins so money isn't the issue i think she's afraid the doctor will have a go at her because of her weight i feel that's exactly why should go diabetes all that i'm worried for her baby the drinking and lack of medical care worries me the most she drank with her first too it's obvious the kid's not right i know i have to do something for the baby's sake but i'm afraid i'll alienate her completely if i try any advice btw they wanted the baby it's a planned pregnancy which makes her 'bad' behaviour so much harder to understand her husband and mine were friends first from work that's how i know her funnily enough she's not a bad mother or person she's just a bad pregnant person i'd say she's ignorant but she admits she did damage to her first because of drinking still she seems to think if she doesn't get drunk she doesn't do harm so she drinks until she feels light headed and then stops right now my friendship comes second i'm thinking of the baby i'm wks pregnant myself and i suppose it's my protective instinct kicking in drinks until she gets lightheaded oh dear can you explain to her that the baby is much smaller than she is and therefore it takes less alcohol to get the baby drunk i read somewhere i believe from what to expect when you're expecting that enough to make you tipsy can cause your baby to pass out in your womb perhaps you can talk to her husband if it's a wanted pregnancy he wants the baby as well does he have an opinion on the way she's acting you're in a tough spot i admire you but think you should tread lightly can a woman be reported for child abuse for these actions i'm just curious what the laws are i don't think you should report her without doing everything else in your power Breastfeeding Pregnancy Abortion debate Knots Landing Theory of conduct EastEnders Friends Miscarriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcoholism Trainspotting (novel) Premature birth Abortion in the United States Boston Public Roe v.
