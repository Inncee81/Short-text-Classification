how early could you hear your baby's heart with a doppler i just rented a doppler and i am nine and a half weeks pregnant i couldn't hear the heartbeat yet had an empty bladder though oops but it did give a couple of reading of and they were in different spots the machine gives three kinds of readings none at all not constant and constant these numbers were in the non constant which means i have no idea if it was my baby or something else can anyone give me any idea oh and how early did you hear baby's heartbeat i am aware of how to find the baby's heartbeat which is why i am frustrated it does say from ten weeks as for not wanting to rush things believe me after eight years of ttc you'd be anxious to hear a heartbeat too they are probably your baby's heart rates there can be reverberation from the baby's heart in other places this may explain the higher reading my doctor couldn't hear my baby's heart beat with a doppler at my week appointment we had an ultrasound scheduled and the baby's heartbeat was as clear as day during that we didn't get to hear the heartbeat with the doppler until weeks Miscarriage Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Breech birth EastEnders Doppler effect Medical ultrasonography Obstetrics Traumatic brain injury Street-Legal Heart Heartbeat (television) Left-handed Prostate cancer Blood on the Tracks The Contender (television series) Spice Girls Childbirth Hall & Oates Knots Landing Jon Secada Cardiac arrhythmia Sampling (music) The Inside Aliens of London Daryl Hall In vitro fertilisation Cardiac output The Empty Child Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Curse of Fenric Neighbours Max Martin Breastfeeding Sharon Tate Amy Grant Humphrey Bogart RISC Van Morrison King Crimson One Tree Hill (TV series) Treasure Planet SMTV Live Charmed Radiation therapy Days of our Lives Hey Jude Eddie Guerrero Ben Johnson (athlete) CPU cache Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Milton H.
