following on from the abortion and adoption threads of late why does such a lot of people think that for a mother to go ahead with an unwanted pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption is always a better alternative to an early abortion i do not agree with abortion but i do see that in some circumstances it can be a much better option than the alternatives of mothers risking their own lives very young woman having babies they do not want and could end up neglecting or resenting people who are stuck in abusive relationships people who have been horriffically raped individuals who themselves have special needs and are not able to care for themselves let along a baby i could go on and on the thing is carrying a baby to term and then putting it up for adoption is not by any means an easy option very disruptive in many peoples lives and there are already childrens homes full of children who cannot get adopted and a lack of foster carers and adoption parents out there so if every baby that had been aborted last year say had been born and put up for adoption what then surely it is not as balck and white as well you had sex so tough you have to carry this baby and that is your punishment words are easy as far as what people would do but they mean nothing unless you have been through that sitaution youself yes its simple just leave your abusive husband oh if only it was that simple for the thousands of woman who fear for their lives very judgemental bunch of people around so if it was your or year old daughter who got pregnant would you stand by your comments and risk screwing up her exams her future plans prehaps her life by forcing her to carry and adopt a baby which was the result of some stupid teenage one night stand sorry but some of your comments are just so selfish more selfish than those who chose to abort i would say to any woman who is in this position to seek professional advice and counselling from an impartial person know what your alternatives are first before you make a decision i believe it's a personal choice for a single woman as you mentioned there are all sorts of extenuating or mitigating circumstances a woman will have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life whatever she decides to do where a couple are involved the decision to have an abortion has to be taken together if my partner was seriously ill because of the pregnancy i would have to think of the health of my partner above that of the foetus i'd rather have my partner and choose to adopt than bring up a child alone broken hearted and quite possibly resenting this child who took my partner's life that's one example and there are many many more based on various circumstances where the mental health of the woman has to be considered or whether it was an accidental pregnancy through casual sex i'm not going to get into a whole bunch of arguments here but where health and mental health issues exist abortion is acceptable and she should be fully supported if it just a 'mistake' through carelessness then she should carry to full term and accept responsibility just because abortion is a straightforward procedure nowadays compared to the back street clinics of yesteryear doesn't mean it should be like a trip to the shops each case will be different and will have to be judged individually i don't believe that pro life supporters and do gooders have the right to tell anyone what to do and to use words like 'murder' and 'assassination' are just plain wrong even if they speak from experience and regret their decision all those years previously and the circumstances are identical as to how this woman became pregnant the one thing that will never be the same is the mental anguish that woman must be going through for which she needs support Roe v.
