can someone please explain the benefits of lamaze classes during pregnancy i dont see the point in taking them i know how to breathe but my fiancee has had a child with someone else and thinks we should go i had my first class tonight and i learned alot of things that i didn't know even my mom who has had three children learned some new things i learned alot about relaxing and learned that the techniques used can really be used anytime during the pregnancy not just while in labor and i felt very relaxed when i came home which was an unexpected but nice surprise i actually had fun and i had some preconceived idea's because i've never heard anything but negative my suggestion is to try it out for a couple classes if you don't like it or feel you need tell them you want your money back if it isn't free at least that way you'll have seen for yourself if it will be beneficial for you or not good luck Pregnancy Friends Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis The Smoking Room Theory of conduct Malcolm in the Middle Alexander Technique Urinary incontinence Singlish The Shining (film) Pitaten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Microeconomics Childbirth Tai Chi Chuan Parkour Ranma __ characters Breastfeeding Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
