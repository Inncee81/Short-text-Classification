induction opinion question do you think that a woman who has had two normal pregnancies and deliveries both deliveries right at weeks and now on her third pregnancy should be made to wait to be induced at weeks i know the date of conception exactly and i'm not sure if i would choose to be induced i just don't like the idea of feeling like the baby is ready and having to wait weeks longer than my other babies i don't want this one to be 'overdone' that can cause problems too i'm at weeks and a week ago by 'fundal height' if that really does mean anything was measuring weeks next appt tomorrow frankly yes i do every pregnancy is somewhat different but your body has told you twice that weeks is your incubation time why are you sweating what'll happen at weeks however keep in mind that due dates are always guestimates even for most people who measure basal body temps so it is healthier to think of your edd as an edm estimated due month which depending on how you count it is between weeks or weeks there may not be any need to induce even as early as weeks trust the timing of your body and your baby often the body is smarter than the mind i know that you're likely impatient especially if you're in that last tri but keep in mind that any intervention can lead to more invasive interventions consider that if your induction fails my sister in law's failed and she was supposedly past her edd you are at an increased risk for having a c section recommended or required when the doc pulled my niece out of my sister in law's incision she was covered in vernix therefore she was likely premature even though she was past her due date crazy eh consider the short term and long term risks of interventions how will you feel in years or or if you end up with a cesarean scar do you know the risks both for you and baby involved in having major abdominal surgery i'll get off my soap box now but please do try to be patient and trust the wise clockwork of your body which is in perfect harmony with the baby growing inside of you good luck to you and enjoy Childbirth Pregnancy Abortion Obstetrics Breech birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Caesarean section Abortion debate Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Cancer Cytomegalovirus Psoriasis Coeliac disease In vitro fertilisation Ectopic pregnancy Intact dilation and extraction Infantilism Prenatal diagnosis Lung cancer Gonorrhoea Pneumonia Partial-birth abortion Multiple sclerosis Doxepin Folic acid Milton H.
