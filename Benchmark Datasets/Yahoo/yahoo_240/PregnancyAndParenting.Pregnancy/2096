weeks pregnant this is for my sister she seems really sick and she works alot and she smokes is there a chance she would miscarry or would u just be born early would it be considered a misscarage i really want her to hold on to it she gets great prenatal care but i dunno she doesnt really take care of her self or watch what she eats or anything but we went for a us when she was weeks and the dr said everything looks fine what do u think she is increasing the chances of a premature birth which in turn increases the chances of the baby having development problems which only show up later in life smoking is obviously not a good idea and it damages the baby but if she too selfish to give up her baby will just have to suffer the consequences you can't make people take care of themselves she is lucky to have you around to look out for her Premature birth Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy Obstetrics Twin Prenatal care Cerebral palsy Breech birth Hollyoaks In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Congenital disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Breastfeeding Multiple birth Health insurance Postpartum depression Stroke Prostate cancer Altruism Left-handed Theory of conduct Midwifery Morning sickness Coeliac disease Melanie Wilkes Homer's Enemy Cephalic disorder Causality Alois Hitler Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Paradox Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lung cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fasting Goodness and value theory Schizophrenia Babe Ruth Jam (TV series) Birth weight EastEnders Atomic Kitten Infantilism John Howard Yoder Abortion in the United States Friends Infant Sudden infant death syndrome Vampire Qiang Full House Tocopherol Humphrey Bogart Fecal incontinence Psoriasis Characters of Lost Neighbours Leo Wyatt Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Charmed Transsexuality Social rule Fetus Eating disorder Norway national football team USS Trigger (SS-237) Cancer Abortion Pok__mon Abilities Arguments for and against drug prohibition Evil Jon Secada Sexual differentiation Folic acid Oral contraceptive Origin belief Tobacco smoking Cancer of the larynx Cigarette Smoking Man Incest Toxoplasmosis Postnatal Egg (food) Anne of Great Britain Cytomegalovirus Mental retardation Kodocha Liquid breathing Joni Mitchell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Divorce Romulus and Remus Tobacco advertising Paroxetine
