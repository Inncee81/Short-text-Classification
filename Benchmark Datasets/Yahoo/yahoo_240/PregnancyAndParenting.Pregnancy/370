confused a little ok we went on a tour of the hospital the other day and they showed us the rooms and in the bathroom of the recovery room that they take you to right after birth there is a whirlpool bathtub she told us that a lot of mom's like to sit in the bath after birth and relax in the labor rooms they only have showers i thought that after birth you start to bleed is the bleeding not right away and that would give you time for a bath or what i would have asked the nurse but i didn't think about it until after we left i have heard that people use the whirlpools during labor to lessen the pain do they not have birthing rooms give birth in the same room you are in during your stay you might ask your hospital about this as most hospitals now a days have birthing rooms a tub in the birthing room i'm suprised they only have a shower because often you are so tired after labor the last thing you want to do is stand up in a shower water births are awesome less pain easier more natural birth the hospital where i had my babies did water births if you wanted in the whirlpool tubs what an awesome experience baby starts to swim to the surface if your hospital does not do water births ask them if they allow you labor in the tub there are some restrictions as to how far into labor you have to be before you can get in the tub if they don't allow you to use the tub during labor then you could make due with the shower if adjustable put it to stream or jet or pulse point it at your lower back this helps ease the pain because it helps the nerves get used to the pain so it doesn't register as a severe pain just as if you pinch yourself on tap on an area before you or your children get a shot it won't hurt as much the bleeding does start as soon as you give birth but you can still take a bath just as you can when you are menstrating it is very relaxing some people choose to shower off after a bath they feel cleaner that way i would certainly check into your options of using the tub during labor Childbirth Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan Breastfeeding Bathing Fecal incontinence Sauna Social rule EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Kodocha The Shining (film) Hot tub Blood on the Tracks Japanese toilet Hyperthermia Shaggy dog story Triage Swimming pool Milton H.
