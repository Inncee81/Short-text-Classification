question about the hours following labor and birth i'm currently weeks pregnant with my first i've been reading reading reading on labor and birth i've been asking questions and watching shows and getting a general idea for what to expect but i notice that there is little knowledge of what happens in that period after you have the baby but are still in the hospital what are some things a first time mother should know for that first day or two while still in the hospital with a new baby what sort of discomforts are there what sort of procedures will you undergo if any your advice and stories are all appreciated in advance i'm just trying to arm myself with knowledge of good and bad so i feel more prepared thanks bring your own shower stuff you're going to be in quite a bit of pain once your epidural wears off but they'll give you vicadin or the like for that just having your baby to hold and love takes the edge off everything a nurse will come massage your tummy to help get out anything that's left yeah gross i know you're going to be experiencing a lot of bleeding at least i did and cramping i brought my own pajamas but spent my time in the hospital ones as i was bleeding pretty bad i didn't even care though just holding my baby was enough they will provide you everything you will need for baby you're probably nervous as soon as i was left alone with mine for the first time i was terrified i had never been with a baby that small before it all comes naturally it sounds cheesy but it's true if you're unsure about anything a nurse will be there to help you i'm sure there's a lactation consultant if you're nursing and if not you'll get free formula to last while you're there and the nurse will show you how to feed burp and such you'll have to fill out paperwork for the birth certificate doctors and nurses were in periodically to check on me and the baby they prick baby's heel and all the other stuff which means they'll be taking him her four or five times the first day this upset me because she came back crying every time the hospital food wasn't so bad p i was really really thirsty and the hospital i was at happened to have the chewy ice yum also dad can stay with you and the baby if he wishes the bed is pretty small but it'll probably be one of the fold y ones that you can move all around and you won't care if it's really uncomfortable anyways you'll just be happy to sleep with your little family for the first time congratulations i love being a mommy and i'm sure you will too one more thing take care of your stitches do everything they tell you to and healing won't be half bad don't be afraid to ask for pain medication Childbirth EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
