day outings with grandparents breastmilk hi if your breastfeeding and you get the lovely offer of a break from your newborn by grandparents etc how do you feed the baby i bottlefed my daughter as i was in intensive care for days after her birth with a collapsed lung so they wouldnt let me breastfeed her so its new to me im hoping to breastfeed when i have another baby soon so any advice i just used to make up bottles and send them out with her what do breastfeeding mums do or dont hi would feel wierd giving it to her in a bottle i suppose shame womens boobs arnt removable to take away so i would have to decide if id be prepared to do bottle and breast or just not have a break from baby gutted you express milk either by hand or using a breastpump and send them out sadly my mum is elderly and in poor health and other half's parents live miles away so no offers of day outings for us but i have done a bit of part time work since my son was born and i'd leave a bottle of expressed milk for him with my other half or childminder the only problem is as a previous poster said many breastfed babies won't take bottles my son refused all bottles and teats and would only take a sippy spout so it can be a battle trying to get them to take a bottle of expressed milk start offering them a bottle of expressed milk from an early age to get them used to it my son took a bottle of expressed milk at week old but the next time we tried him with a bottle he was months and wouldn't have it anywhere near him Milk Childbirth Infant Baby bottle Infant formula About a Boy Breast milk Dairy Fertility awareness Knots Landing EastEnders Breast Nestl__ boycott International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Little Britain Indianapolis 500 1957 World Series Prolactin Social rule Cytomegalovirus Alois Hitler Premature birth Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vitamin D Folic acid Nestl__ Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Melanie Wilkes Poker jargon Elimination communication Mastitis Parenting Everwood Nipple piercing HIV Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Toilet humour Nipple Atomic Kitten Characters of Lost Neighbours Alex Ferguson Kodocha The Apprentice 2 Teat Battle of Chancellorsville Trailer Park Boys Charmed 613 mitzvot Tenshinhan Prenatal diagnosis Tocopherol Emperor Xuan of Han Obstetrics Escherichia coli O157:H7 The Family from One End Street Family Sharon Tate Oxytocin Phoebe Halliwell Tea Operation Market Garden John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Chu-Han contention Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ayyavazhi mythology Yoko Ono Prolactinoma Hollyoaks Newborn screening Piccolo Junior Saga 2004 World Series Juliana of the Netherlands Swingout Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Jon Secada Bong John the Baptist Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Kat Moon Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Mammary gland Breast cancer Hera Make money fast Abortion debate Hey Jude Panay incident Cyprus dispute Neville Chamberlain Plame affair Katharine Hepburn The Death Gate Cycle Neonatal intensive care unit Sugo
