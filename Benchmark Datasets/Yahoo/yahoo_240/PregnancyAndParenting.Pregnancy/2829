excercise during pregnancy i am weeks pregnant and i really don't want to gain too much weight what kind of excercises can i do to help me keep my weight down do jumping jacks really work or do i have to go walking i am looking for some excercises i can do at home because it is super hot outside to nicki why would you even suggest that i would want to lose my baby doing jumping jacks is something i heard from someone else i wouldn't have asked what is good if i wasn't worried about my unborn baby it's way too hot outside where i live to go walking in my opinion that and all the smoke and smog alerts have been horrible lately the most i do outside is swim which is a great exercise by the way but i've stuck to the prenatal yoga dvd pretty religiously it's been super nice not only with weight gain but with giving me more energy and stretching out all my aches and pains of just general pregnancy i doubt you would ever want to do jumping jacks far into pregnancy i haven't tried to jump in months but it doesn't seem like something that would be easy and i've only gained lbs so far at weeks Pregnancy Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Abortion Prenatal diagnosis Miscarriage Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Marilyn Monroe Sharon Tate Obstetrics Charmed Abortion in the United States Prenatal care Childbirth Piccolo Junior Saga Blonde on Blonde EastEnders Super Size Me Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Characters of Lost Avenue Q Neighbours Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Eddie Guerrero Exercise Coeliac disease Super Mario 64 Kodocha Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb The Inside Guinea pig Spidey Super Stories Blood on the Tracks Diving Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fetus Roe v.
