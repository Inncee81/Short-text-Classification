know anyway to help get labor started i am cm's but still kindof thick i know sex and walking any other ideas i've probably heard them all i just wanted to see if anyone knows any 'new' ways i guess or any personal experiences thank you they say there are pressure points on the back of your calfs about finger widths above your ankle bone if you massage these its supose to help you go into labor dont know if its true or not i heard it on tlc the show house of babies good luck try the link below to see more of what i am talking about hope that baby comes soon how can you speed up the whole waiting for the water to break thing i'm ready for my baby now waiting for your baby to be born can be awfully difficult especially when the all the aches pains and difficulty getting comfortable for a good nights sleep accumulate close to your due date unfortunately a medical induction that is not medically necessary can lead to a cascade of interventions that may increase the chance of complications and or the need for a cesearean section legitimate reasons to induce labor include a pregnancy that is weeks overdue with fetal surveillance testing that is non reassuring to treat pregnancy induced hypertension and to minimize infection after rupture of membranes without labor however there are several gentle non pharmacologic and even enjoyable ways a woman can stimulate labor to begin these techniques may start labor if the cervix has already undergone changes to become shorter softer and a centimeter or two dilated if these techniques don't start labor they at least should help ripen the cervix the process by which the cervix becomes shorter thinner and dilated so that the uterus does not have to work as hard once spontaneous labor begins sexual intercourse helps ripen the cervix as prostaglandin rich semen bathes the cervix thereby breaking down cervix collagen in addition orgasm causes uterine contractions as long as membranes are intact and the woman has no vaginal infection sexual intercourse should not be risky it is commonly prescribed for couples when the woman is weeks gestation and beyond nipple and breast stimulation cause uterine contractions the women can roll her nipple or provide stimulation by suckling a baby or a partner or by using a breast pump she should stop stimulation during a contraction then resume women should stop breast stimulation when contractions are minutes apart or if the stimulation causes contractions that are more than minute in length too much uterine stimulation and thereby fetal distress is a potential concern stimulate gently herbs to start labor include evening primrose oil mg three times a day for week black and blue cohoshes and red raspberry leaves a tea made with red raspberry leaves used throughout pregnancy strengthens the uterus so that it will work more effectively take cup daily in early pregnancy and cups daily the last weeks drink lots of this tea in labor homeopathic remedies to initiate labor or to help ripen the cervix include caulophyllum x every minutes for hours and caulophyllum c doses during the day after weeks gestation castor oil and enemas result in increased intestinal activity which may result in promoting prostaglandin synthesis the naturally occurring chemicals that promote the breakdown of cervix collagen a castor oil cocktail includes ounces of oil with ounces of orange juice concentrate drink and chase with a glass of water take in early morning stay close to the toilet starts working with stool evacuation and uterine contractions in hours acupressure or shiatsu can help with the enhancement of labor there are main pressure points used including spleen and large intestine see a knowledgable acupuncturist for more specifics striping membranes refers to the procedure when a doctor or a midwife inserts her his finger into the cervical opening and rotates it degrees separating the membranes from the lower uterine segment this action facilitates the release of prostaglandins from the membranes and from the cervix stripping membranes is a technique that is most useful in a woman having her first baby by helping her cervix which has never been stretched and dilated before by labor and a baby's birth to ripen finally artificial rupture of the membranes when the doctor or the midwife chooses to break the bag of waters which should be done with the woman's knowledge and permission is a non pharmacologic way to start labor this procedure releasing prostaglandins stretches the cervix which increases contractions of the uterus and brings the baby's head directly against the cervix to provide pressure on the cervix thereby helping with dilation it is a procedure associated with potential risks infection prolapsed cord and
