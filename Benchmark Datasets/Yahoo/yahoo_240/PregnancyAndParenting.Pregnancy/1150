uncomfortable braxton hicks hi all im weeks preg and have been getting bh from when i was about weeks just lately like the past couple of days they have become really really uncomfortable now before people tell me they r unlikely to be bh and more likely to be my ligaments stretching well this is my second pregnancy in years so i no the what bh feel like and these are bh and for the same reason i know that dispite it being really uncomfortable it isnt labour anyway like i say they are very uncomfortable and they do come quite often at times like when i do get them i get them like evry mins for about mins or so and they really do take my breath away then they go for a few hours but then they r back i have tried out everything that is recomended to help stop these bh such as drinking plenty of water going for a walk warm bath liying down etc but nothing seems to work it doesnt help that this baby is a very active baby any experienced this and if so how did you ease them for those who have asked y i am having bh so early firstly this is my second pregnancy so i am bound to feel them earlier than i did in my first started feeling my first borns bh when i was weeks and secondly please do reasearch you get bh throughout your pregnancy from start to finish but you tend not to fell them til after midway through pregnancy have a read on baby centre on them just to let you all know i am aware that it could be cause of dehydration but i do drink a lot of water a day so i feel that this reason would be doubtful and as i say earlier i know what a bh feels like my stomache starts tightening and then goes rock solid thhis is the point it becomes uncomfortable hi first of all the previous answerers who answered a with a are wrong i don't think it is too early because it is throughout pregnancy and some women just have them stronger than others i doubt you are dehydrated and also agree that walking and resting don't ease it much i had bad bh with my first daughter the entire pregnancy they made me flinch sometimes which really scared the heck of my hubby who knew nothing about pregnancy and thought i was in labor or having some serious problems anyhow i realized that since the bh is generally muscular tension the best way to deal with it is to not fight it whenever i felt them coming on my first reflex was to tense up so i learned to not fight them and when they were particularly strong i would do the pelvic floor tightening and loosening exercises along with it i also had a mid wife that came to my home and gave me a massage whenever i was feeling too rough it helped a lot anyhow that is pretty much all i can advise you for now it doesn't cure it and really there isn't an out and out cure for them other than labor itself round ligament pain will come up much later weeks believe me breathing exercises and relieving your tension is the major thing also when it happens try occupying yourself with a busy task so you can't focus on it much everything will be fine Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Theory of conduct Milton H.
