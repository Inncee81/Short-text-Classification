ladies do you think public breast feeling should be banned and prosecuted since only women can do this i was wondering what your opinion of it is sorry breast feeding i sincerely apologize to all you for my typo yes it must have been an unintentional freudian slip public breast feeling well i can see how that would be awkward i think a public banning of it would surprise most women enough to make doing it a statement or taboo if you meant breastfeeding then i could see how it might be uncomfortable for a guy to feel like he's being flashed by a random stranger however that's not why a woman is breastfeeding in public she has a hungry baby who will not understand why he she has to wait to be fed its nice when a mother uses a blanket or towel to cover herself while feeding her child but many new moms find it difficult to juggle a hungry infant shirt bra and blanket if she remembered to bring one its easy to forget after diapers wipes etc frequently people comment that a woman should just use a bottle while out in public but some babies refuse to drink from bottles to actually ban breastfeeding in public would place undue hardship on moms as they would have to completely center their lives around their baby's ever changing schedule or have their baby scream until they could find someplace private to feed him her so yeah public breast feeding is generally considered impolite and kinda freaky by the young single population but it is also generally accepted as part of life by many of those with kids as long as the mom is considerate of those around her i don't see a problem Breastfeeding Infant Breast Brassiere Social rule Infantilism Customs and etiquette of Japan Recurring South Park characters Baby bottle Breast pump Sento Nestl__ boycott Nudity Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kyle Broflovski Breast milk Abortion debate Jon Secada South Park Stewie Griffin Milk Pregnancy Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Phil Hendrie International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes AFI 100 Years series Stuttering The Marshall Mathers LP Sharon Tate Diaper Sexual revolution Internet troll Little Britain Teresa Heinz Kerry Transsexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Shaggy dog story About a Boy Comanche Political correctness Trailer Park Boys Futurama (TV series - season 2) Madonna (entertainer) Undergarment Sigmund Freud Menstrual cup Social aspects of clothing Milton H.
