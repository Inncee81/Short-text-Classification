terrified of baby being breech okay so far i have plenty entering rd trimester tomorrow of time for my baby to turn the right way and i am just freaking out because i'm scared she'll never turn head down i read somewhere that sitting too much during pregnancy makes it harder for the baby to turn head down are there any certain things i should be doing to insure that the baby has every oppertunity of turning head down when she is supposed to i work at home on my computer but i'm not lazy i would love to walk everyday but i live in florida and every day there is a heat index of about my mom says i should go to the mall and walk every morning like the old ladies do but i'd have to drive all the way to it and have no ac in my truck any suggestions also can't really afford a treadmill but would sooo love to have one lol my doctor had me lie down on an ironing board tilted against the couch head down another idea is to lie down with headphones near the bottom of your belly where you would want the baby's head to be and turn some music on these may have moved my daughter not sure but she did flip over before birth some doctors will attempt a 'version' nearer to birthing time a manual way to turn the baby from the outside i am not sure how many still do that though Pregnancy Breech birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Childbirth Professional wrestling holds EastEnders Abortion debate Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Obstetrics Intact dilation and extraction Breastfeeding The Beatles discography Abortion in the United States Skateboarding trick Sin City The Time Machine Floppy disk Le Malade imaginaire The Shining (film) Sharon Tate Jon Secada Search for Tomorrow Miscarriage Humphrey Bogart Friends In vitro fertilisation Professional wrestling throws Manual transmission Professional wrestling aerial techniques Charmed Birth weight Soap opera Shaggy dog story Treehouse of Horror V Professional wrestling attacks Euphemism Suplex The Inside Everwood Rock Follies Ron and Fez Rose (Doctor Who) Angelina Jolie Tire Cher (entertainer) Love and Theft Poker jargon Paul Is Dead Midwifery IPod Milton H.
