majorly sore ok the clinic i go to is part of a university hospital so sometimes there will be students doing clinicals so they get hands on experience well the main dr was showing his student dr how to tell the babys presentation position and so forth by feeling around so my baby got poked and pushed and squished alot today which i paid for the whole ride home anyway is it normal to feel sore after that becayse its been hours and im still aching all over my belly from it im weeks so i guess i was a little afraid he mightve been too rough it didnt hurt at the time but it sure hurt once i got home i would imagine that everything around your belly is pushed to the limit and tender anyway you probably will be sore for a day or two if it continues you might want to call your dr Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Pregnancy Childbirth Jon Secada Group A streptococcal infection Cocaine Paracetamol Milton H.
