was anybody else nervous to tell their parents about your pregnancy ok i've been married for almost years i'm graduated from college and i have a great job my husband is graduated from college and has a great job so why was i terrified to pick up the phone and tell my parents that i was pregnant anybody else experience that they were overjoyed when they found out by the way first congrats i had the same reaction when i had to tell my parents exactly the same history as yours too too only we'd only been married for a month i think for me it was that i had always had such high expectations placed on me by my parents that i was scared of disappointing them somehow like i wasn't going to live up to their life plan for me and having a baby is such a life changing thing if they weren't supportive it would be very difficult i think it's normal to be nervous of how people you love are going to react to huge news in your life especially if it wasn't planned if your mom and dad had no idea that you were even thinking about kids and you had no idea about their thoughts on the matter its normal to be a scared about what they'd say and just for the record mine were thrilled too EastEnders Friends Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Charmed Great Teacher Onizuka Baby Blues Everwood Pregnancy Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q Knots Landing Recurring South Park characters Sharon Tate Days of our Lives Abortion debate Carl Barks About a Boy Yoko Ono The Smoking Room Grief Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intelligence quotient Characters in the Smurfs Good Times Saved by the Bell History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Marriage Malcolm in the Middle Kurt Cobain One Tree Hill (TV series) Psychosis Anxiety Autism Freeters Miss Saigon Rugrats Mystique (comics) Doug Melanie Wilkes Timmy Turner Mr. and Mrs. Turner Hillary Rodham Clinton Piper Halliwell Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Stillbirth Blonde on Blonde Cultural Revolution Steve Jobs Neighbours Dead Like Me Married... with Children Springfield Elementary School Series finale Phoebe Halliwell KaBlam!
