are these broken capillaries or the start of stretch marks yesterday i developed these small reddish marks on my breasts that look to me like broken capillaries i searched images on the 'net the markings are in a pattern that seem to coincide with my bra on one breast but i know the bra fits well i just went up a cup size it fits comfortably on the other breast i've got the same reddish markings that look like they're parallel to my veins or milk ducts or whatever i'm not really sure they don't hurt or anything but they seemed to come out of nowhere what's going on is this how stretch marks start or is it something else i'm weeks pregnant thanks stretch marks have texture and they tend to itch or sting usually they aren't comfy they also tend to be quite a bit wider than broken capillaries and less squiggly and larger i hope that helped a bit at least Brassiere Breast Spider Lymphatic system Undergarment Equine conformation Mosquito Birthmark Germaine Greer Dog Caprice Bourret Marilyn Monroe Drill bit Leopard Cat Strap-on dildo Puberty EastEnders Tofu Mammary gland First aid Hash table Glossary of ballet terms Tire Liver Nipple Lung Jet engine Violin Human penis size CPU cache Androgen insensitivity syndrome Backstroke Tarantula Malaria Hermione Granger Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Madonna (entertainer) Obstetrics Kidney M1 Helmet Leaf Opportunity rover Pregnancy Psoriasis Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mastitis Alan Turing Pulmonary alveolus Milk Breast implant RISC Breast milk Swimsuit Breast cancer Bicycle frame Respiratory system Napoleon Dynamite Butterfly Douglas DC-8 Metastasis Anamorphic widescreen Cheese Mary Phelps Jacob Eyepiece Wood Hematophagy Computer numbering formats Bird Breast fetishism Internal ballistics Ron and Fez Trish Stratus Knitting Fertility awareness Glass Social rule Discus (fish) Nintendo GameCube Blood pressure John Lennon The Price Is Right Shotgun shell C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Casting History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Weight training Punt (boat) Professional wrestling match types Menstrual cup Breakfast Cirrhosis Dairy Screw Blushing Inkjet printer Starbucks
