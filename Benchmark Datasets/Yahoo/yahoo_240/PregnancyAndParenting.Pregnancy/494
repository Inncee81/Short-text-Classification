what is the point of ultrasound scans my wife is planning not to keep her appointment for a scan next week when she will be weeks pregnant she says there is no point as she feels that she and baby are in excellent health and even if there was something wrong with the baby she could never consider abortion she also says that ultrasounds have never been proven to be safe and it is not worth the risk for a glimpse of the baby when she can can feel it move inside her i was quite taken back from this as i thought all women looked forward to seeing their baby on screen apart from reassurance what else does an ultrasound do an ultrasound is the easiest way to check for adnormalities such as heart defects and see if the baby is developing well it is usually done as a precaution and for reassurance and a chance for bonding for the mother however the majority of defects can be detected with the old fashioned ways such as fundal measurements fetal heart dopplers and blood tests ultrasounds have never been proven to be safe it is noted that babys tend to move alot more during the scan perhaps this shows discomfort to the baby for discussions between midwifes about ultrascanning see http www radmid demon co uk scans htm about bonding i'm sure feeling your baby kicking inside her will do more for bonding than some silly shadow of a picture i do not agree with doing scans for 'the sake of bonding' and i feel this is vain that you need to see it to believe it however i feel your wife should go for this scan and get it over and done with and not have it hanging over her at the end of the day this is your wifes decision it is her body afterall Obstetrics Miscarriage Pregnancy Medical ultrasonography Breech birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion debate Birth weight Breastfeeding Prenatal care Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical imaging Abortion Childbirth Anencephaly Days of our Lives Turner syndrome Abortion in the United States Knots Landing EastEnders Chemical abortion Atrial septal defect Midwifery Cytomegalovirus Prolactinoma Malaria Computed tomography Colorectal cancer Cephalic disorder Eugenics Cancer Traumatic brain injury Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Fetus Friends Lung cancer Bondage (BDSM) Infant Coeliac disease Alcoholism Vampire Menstrual cycle Sharon Tate Roe v.
