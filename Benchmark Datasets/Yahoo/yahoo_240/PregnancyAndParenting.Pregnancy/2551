when did you first feel the baby moving on your first pregnancy i am just wondering when i could start to expect it i think it's normal to start feeling the baby between and weeks yeah i know a pretty wide window but i felt my son move at weeks i was wearing blue jeans for the first time in about a month i was too bloated for anything but stretchy pants bt not showing enough for maternity and when i sat down i guess the waistband bothered him because he started kicking at it it felt like little twitches or muscle spasms Pregnancy Breech birth Childbirth Urinary incontinence Cephalic disorder Obstetrics Marilyn Monroe Kyle Broflovski Jeans Breastfeeding Milton H.
