for all the pregos ok so i really don't understand this week thing i thought pregnancy was months since weeks is months i'm very confused does the first month not count or something i've never heard anyone say they were months preggo so if i'm weeks am i really months pregnant sorry this may seem really dumb but it just doesnt make sense to me thanks it's not a really dumb question at all pregnancy lasts days a lunar month consists of days hence week months and x is weeks so yes you are pregnant months if you are weeks you are really months and weeks you are correct i know it is confusing hopefully you wont give birth at the beginning of the th month because you would only be weeks very best wishes Pregnancy Abortion debate Miscarriage Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Gregorian calendar Sharon Tate Melanie Wilkes Computus Julian calendar EastEnders Obstetrics Friends Marilyn Monroe Childbirth Chinese New Year Folic acid Spina bifida Liturgical year Psoriasis Abortion Twin Maya calendar Shavuot Roe v.
