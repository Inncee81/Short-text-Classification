when is it advisable to go for scanning to know if one is pregnant am suspecting that am pregnant for two weeks plus but not too sure so please help me as an experienced sonographer please don't go for a scan any sooner than weeks more often than not the results are equivocal and can cause unnecessary concern wait until there is something there that can be definitive one way or the other so that you can have one scan and be reassured instead of going so early that you have to have repeat scans and then get to weeks to have everything be fine and you will have worried for nothing and that can be all avoided patience waiting on the news is the first test of patience for becoming a mother and how you respond to that waiting period is a great indicator of how patient you will be as a parent if you suspect that you are pregnant than you need to treat yourself and your body as if you were pregnant until you can get confirmation it's not going to hurt you or your body or your potential baby to eat healthier drink more water and start your vitamins especially folic acid if you wind up not being pregnant than you haven't caused any harm to anyone and if you are pregnant you will have a great head start to a fit and healthy pregnancy Folic acid Breastfeeding Pregnancy Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Abortion debate Cytomegalovirus Abortion Coeliac disease Psoriasis Stomach cancer Diarrhea Omega-3 fatty acid Isotretinoin Chronic fatigue syndrome Haloperidol Multiple sclerosis Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Egg (food) Paget's disease of bone Vitamin C Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Insulin Menstrual cycle Acne Spina bifida AIDS Nutrition Clinical depression Anemia Tocopherol Vitamin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cystic fibrosis In vitro fertilisation First aid Prenatal diagnosis Infantilism Primidone Electroconvulsive therapy Growth hormone treatment Syringomyelia Migraine Childbirth EastEnders Androgen insensitivity syndrome Osteoporosis Alzheimer's disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Methotrexate LSD One Tree Hill (TV series) Stroke Radiation therapy Botulism Alcoholism Diabetes mellitus Milk Thimerosal Cephalic disorder Drug abuse Premature birth Paroxetine HIV test Tobacco smoking Herpes simplex virus Veganism Anorexia nervosa Baldness treatments Sharon Tate Health insurance Cyanide Bipolar disorder Healthy eating Dieting Diabetes insipidus Autism epidemic Congenital disorder Eugenics Abortion in the United States Wal-Mart Terri Schiavo Stem cell Gonorrhoea Gout Malaria H5N1 Pregnancy test Medicine Atkins Nutritional Approach Roy Meadow Lung cancer
