what would happen if you got a tattoo around your belly button and then got pregnant i don't think i want children most likely will adopt but i can't be sure you cant predict the future but i want to get a tattoo around my belly button if i did get pregnant would it shrink back with my belly or would it stay streched even if my stomach got small again no matter what you do the skin is going to stretch if you get pregnant and that will effect how the tattoo looks later on and as you get older the skin will sag a little and change how it looks also if you want something that is still going to look good when you are older go for areas of the body that tend to age later like shoulders and ankles Tattoo Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Treehouse of Horror XV Suplex Human anatomy Abdomen Stomach cancer Earring Professional wrestling throws Crash test dummy Undergarment Diving suit Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Scarification Pregnancy Drowning Acne Violin Leopard Angelina Jolie Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Namie Amuro Belly dance Crocodilia Head Mattress Tightlacing Scar Umbilicus EastEnders Puberty Shirt Sento Human penis size Body modification Diaper Baldness treatments Bondage (BDSM) Fantastic Four Stomach Brassiere Recovery position Leech Abortion debate Medical astrology Criminal tattoo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Spanking Alcoholism Fecal incontinence Antiseptic Thimerosal Breast reconstruction Rayden Irezumi Weight training Vanilla Ninja Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Diving Equine conformation Psoriasis Hogtie bondage Decompression sickness One Hundred Years of Solitude Ecco the Dolphin Swimsuit Adjustable gastric band Ilse Koch Dandruff The Shining (film) Powerbomb Vestment Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Timpani Keloid Skin Nintendo GameCube Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Genital wart Chester Bennington Body painting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Comanche Homeostasis Unreal The Terminator Speculation Platypus Pneumonia Tattoo gun Cancer Exercise Rais massacre Professional wrestling attacks Human Seppuku Swimming
