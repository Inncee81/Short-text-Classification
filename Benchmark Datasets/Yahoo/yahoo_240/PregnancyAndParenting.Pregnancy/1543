regret abortion i had an abortion its all i seem to think i about it ruined my relationship w my boyfriend and i have uncontrollable episodes of crying and feeling helplessness mainly at night time is this normal to feel so badly and how long will it take for my pain to ease away i didnt want to have an abortion i knew it was the wrong choice but i did it bc i was selfish i cant seem to forgive myself first hugs second that is the sad reality of abortions that women don't realize until it is too late i would recommend counseling many places like birth choice catholic social services etc will offer it free and you don't have to be catholic it is important that you make peace with yourself i don't believe you will ever forget but it is important that you forgive yourself they say only time eases the pain but i am not so sure that is true i think it is time that helps one deal with the pain and it becomes a part of you every thing we do in life effects who we are and who we will be use this as a learning experience to trust your gut and do what you know is right you can't change the past but you can always change the future hang in there EastEnders Abortion Scenes from a Memory Abortion debate Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Knots Landing Sex and the City Hillary Rodham Clinton Clinical depression Ex-gay Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Opus Dei Sin Friends Jon Secada Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.
