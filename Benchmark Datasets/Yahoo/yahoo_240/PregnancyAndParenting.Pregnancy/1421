breast are leaking milk and i am only weeks and days prego today i dropped my money on the floor of my car and i bent over to get it and my left breast leaked out some milk all over my shirt then after that my breasts have been leaking all day is this normal since i am weeks pregnant or is it maybe a sign that the baby is coming sooner than expected since i have more weeks to go i dont go back to the doctor until next friday thats why i am asking this on here now thanx this is either lack of tone in your breasts in which case i would invest in a bra that supports you better something described as firm control or it is your hormones working overtime i would ask if your dates could possibly be a month wrong if the child is big for dates then that could easily be a possibility it is a lot commoner than it used to be to carry on having light periods for the first month or two after you become pregnant and that can cause you to be a month or more out on your dates the calculation of edd even in these days of ultrasound is a very inexact science based mainly on the length of the child's leg so if your baby has slightly short legs then he or she could be due very soon indeed you do not say if you have had any other signs eg braxton hicks contractions or a slightly uncomfortable dull ache in your lower abdomen either of these and i would consider packing my bag for the hospital as a precaution my eldest girl was weeks and days early so it can and does happen she still weighed lb oz so was not that tiny i hope that you are planning to breast feed as it is better for both of you and it does not seem that it would be too difficult it is not only the best fot baby it reduces your chances of getting breast cancer later in life whenever your baby is born i wish you a safe and easy labour and every happiness for your future Pregnancy Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Equine conformation Prostate cancer EastEnders Childbirth Premature birth Puberty Milk Obstetrics Abortion Breast cancer Breech birth Breast Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Dairy Stomach cancer Aerial (dance move) Testicular cancer Miscarriage Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Spice Girls Cryptorchidism Brassiere Oral contraceptive Radiation therapy Psoriasis Days of our Lives Sharon Tate Intact dilation and extraction Fast bowling Infant Cancer Diabetic retinopathy Sex assignment Professional wrestling throws Prolactinoma Strap-on dildo Neighbours Clarinet Fecal incontinence Jordan (model) Guinea pig Acne Social rule Hollyoaks Madonna (entertainer) Endometriosis Rais massacre Wal-Mart Sexual differentiation Mammary gland Short selling Life insurance Emergency contraception Dialysis Nuclear power John Edwards Amiodarone Chair Backstroke Sex and the City Bowl Championship Series Welding Wheel of Fortune Kodocha Heracles Vitamin D Spina bifida Butterfly stroke Professional wrestling holds London Congestion Charge Otakon Ed, Edd n Eddy Intersex surgery Traumatic brain injury Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fusion power Microeconomics Cytomegalovirus Friends Inflation Jam (TV series) Social Security (United States) Comanche Lorraine Baines McFly Cephalic disorder Skateboarding trick Left-handed Tocopherol Frogman Insulin Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans
