pregnancy and pet store ok so im almost weeks pregnant the last week in august i am going to start working at a pet store i use to work there a year ago before i got pregnant and now im going back anyways is there anything dangerous about working in a pet store while being pregnant anything i should or shouldnt do at work the pet store does sell animals no dogs or cats but small animals like mice hamsters ferrets fish reptiles and birds anyone know anything about this situation thanks in advance not anymore likely to get sick while pregnant than not the difference is if you get sick it can harm to pregnancy as long as you use common sense wash your hands often and take normal precautions you will be fine they say pregnant women shouldn't change the catbox or eat fresh cheeses but almost everyone i know has done something like this while pregnant and none of them miscarried or had problems i can guarantee you that it is safer for you and your baby's health to work with mice and reptiles than in a bar or restaurant with cigarette smoke just use common sense and caution in what you do Pet Guinea pig Pet store Tobacco smoking Miscarriage Pregnancy Breastfeeding Dog Cat Cigarette Fancy rat Vitamin C Pet skunk Taboo food and drink Friends Kangaroo Twin Hedgehog Domestic rabbit Coffee Neighbours German Shepherd Dog Obstetrics Abortion debate Abortion Folic acid Cytomegalovirus Roe v.
