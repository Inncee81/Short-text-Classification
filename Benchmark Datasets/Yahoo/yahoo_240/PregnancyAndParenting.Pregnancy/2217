getting pregnant right after you have a baby i am still pregnant with my first but i have had soo many people tell me that after this one we should start trying right away for the next one has anyone done this and if so would you recommend it just wondering thanks thank you all for your answers it's always nice to let your body recover a bit between pregnancies they really drain your calcium folic acid and other nutrient levels and low folic acid can cause birth defects also waiting gives you a chance to bond with your new little one without throwing morning sickness and the other joys of pregnancy on top of learning the routines with your baby if your childbearing years are limited then you may want your break between babies to be shorter but otherwise i would highly recommend waiting a little while and settling into your new routine Folic acid Spina bifida Obstetrics Pregnancy Breastfeeding Anencephaly Anemia Milk Primidone Premature birth Cytomegalovirus Congenital disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Psoriasis Vitamin C Coeliac disease Childbirth Fertility awareness Tocopherol Egg (food) Miscarriage Osteoporosis In vitro fertilisation Infant formula Cyanide Turner syndrome Veganism Abortion Prostate cancer Days of our Lives Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oily fish Methotrexate Abortion debate Mental retardation Syringomyelia Prenatal diagnosis Nutrient Guinea pig Birth control Human skin color Human sexual behavior Birth weight Urinary incontinence Insulin Nutrition Iron Abortion in the United States Friends Morning sickness Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Infant Colorectal cancer Breech birth Teenage pregnancy Eutrophication EastEnders Phosphoric acid Thimerosal Elephant Twin Kender Chlorophyta Migraine Dog Anne Boleyn Knots Landing Prolactinoma Intact dilation and extraction HIV test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive And Maggie Makes Three Autism epidemic Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral sex Hypoglycemia Carpal tunnel syndrome Pregnancy fetishism Alois Hitler Human chorionic gonadotropin Thrombocytopenia Cystic fibrosis Thalidomide Paroxetine Acne Antiretroviral drug Fatty acid Tooth enamel Phenylketonuria Hydatidiform mole Roman Catholic Church Hydrofluoric acid Lucille Ball Prenatal care Melanie Wilkes
