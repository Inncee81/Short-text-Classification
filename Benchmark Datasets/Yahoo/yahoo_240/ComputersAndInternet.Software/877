opening digital prints from folder with windows picture fax viewer i'm not sure exactly how to explain this but i'll do my best i have a lot of digital pictures in folders on my laptop and i had never had a problem opening them with windows picture fax viewer until recently i had added some new pics from my digital camera a week ago and i always view them when they are done loading well this last time i wasn't able to see the pics i tried several times to open them but it didn't work then my laptop seemed like it was running really slow i did a disk cleanup and i also did a defrag which made things run better i have no viruses on my laptop today i tried to open the pics up again to send through an email and everything started messing up again the digital camera i have is a aiptek if that matters any as i said before i have never had a problem uploading the pics from the camera to my laptop until recently i'm wondering if the camera software has anything to do with this problem i can't remember if there was a cd that i used when i first got the camera will i have to uninstall the software and reinstall it again this is really bothering me because i have all these pics and don't want to loose them i will be transfering them onto cd's shortly also i have videos that i can't view because of this problem any help would be appreciated if there's any more info you need from me just ask and i'll get back to you thanks i'll try offering something if you right click on the image or the icon that represents the picture since you can't see the picture try open with that should give you a list of all the things that might open it select another program to open it i personally like microsoft picture manager good luck IBM PC compatible Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Windows XP AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Linux Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family Hard disk DOS Atari ST History of the graphical user interface Commodore 64 Windows 2000 X Window System IBM PC Apple IIGS Mac OS X ATI Technologies Timeline of computing 1990-forward MS-DOS Apple II family DirectX Windows Server 2003 Knoppix Booting History of computing hardware (1960s-present) TRS-80 Redundant array of independent disks OpenGL Personal computer NeXT Acorn Electron Windows Me Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Blue screen of death TRS-80 Color Computer Video Graphics Array Windows API Windows 1.0 Amiga ZX Spectrum IMac Amstrad CPC Windows 95 History of computer and video games Commodore 128 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis System/36 Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Graphics processing unit BBC Master History of operating systems System 7 (Macintosh) Computer virus Virtual memory MAME Thread (computer science) 64-bit Video game controversy Commodore International OS/2 Grand Prix Legends Original Amiga chipset PowerPC Sound Blaster BIOS Java programming language TurboGrafx 16 BBC Micro Apple Computer Pretty Good Privacy 3dfx ReactOS Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Visual Basic Kernel (computer science) Emacs X86 Computer and video game genres SAM Coup__ Portable Document Format Mandriva Linux Texas Instruments TI-99/4A System/34 Power Macintosh G3 LiveCD PC Engine File Allocation Table
