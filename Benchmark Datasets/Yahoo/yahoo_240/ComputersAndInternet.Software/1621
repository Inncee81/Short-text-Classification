my computer is slow i already ran a virus scan antispyware registry cleaner and everything is allright i do not have that many files or music and my computer is relatively new everytime i start a program such as word or excel or internet explorer it takes a long time to start but once i start using the programs they work perfectly the problem is the time it takes for them to start how can i fix this without reformating my computer ps i already defragmented the drive this could be because you have many 'left overs' from other programs that is causing your computer to go slow or could be windows updates because i hear they also cause your computer to slow down 'left overs' are files or programs that are left in your computer even though the original program that uses those files is already removed they might be there to retain compatibility or to prevent errors in the computer run chkdsk to see if there is any problem with your harddrive or errors in the file system Object Desktop Mozilla Application Suite Windows XP Internet Explorer Component Object Model Comparison of web browsers NPAPI Macromedia Flash Dialer Windows 2000 IPod HTTP cookie Mouse (computing) Browser Helper Object Browser wars Microsoft Windows Gmail Microsoft Last.fm Minesweeper (computer game) Rootkit Ajax (programming) Microsoft .NET Halo: Combat Evolved Winamp ITunes DesktopX Stardock Wiki Avant Browser Stopping e-mail abuse Traffic light Internet Explorer for Mac Kazaa Digital rights management P__li Java programming language System 7 (Macintosh) Netscape Browser Xbox 360 Google Desktop ADO Control Panel (Windows) AmigaOS E-mail NTFS Guitar Windows Explorer Trillian (instant messenger) Microsoft Paint Opera (web browser) MDAC Konqueror Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Fire alarm control panel Nintendo Revolution Amazon.com BlackBerry Common Unix Printing System OpenBSD Digital audio workstation Expos__ (Mac OS X) Screenshot Microsoft AntiSpyware Twm MSN Messenger Thumbnail gallery post Combo box Blue screen of death Uploading and downloading Mandriva Linux Steam (content delivery) Windows API Pretty Good Privacy Tab (GUI) MAME Computer security Option key Vertical service code Outlook Express Multimedia Fusion NetCaptor Need for Speed VBulletin Jumpstart 3rd Grade Information Technology Infrastructure Library Windows Vista Cheating in Counter-Strike Password Apple Open Collaboration Environment Palm OS Gecko (layout engine) Internet fraud Warcraft III Information Services Procurement Library International Phonetic Alphabet Prank flash
