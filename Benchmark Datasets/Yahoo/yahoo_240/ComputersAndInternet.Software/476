cant get drums playing off my midi keyboard in reason i can play other instruments but not the redrum redrum is kind of weird when using a midi keyboard because as it only has ten sounds loaded at one time it doesn't use the full key range i'm a little rust with reason but i believe that the redrum key range begins on c and extends chromatically up to a i may be wrong about the key range so just experiment play every key on your keyboard and if you have a small keyboard try transposing to different key ranges i hope this helps Windows XP Virtual Network Computing Remote Desktop Protocol Linux X Window System Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Citrix Presentation Server NTFS Secure Shell Linux distribution Computer security Operating system Virtual memory OS/2 Windows Server 2003 Proxy server Common Unix Printing System Streaming media Digital rights management OpenBSD Wi-Fi Server File system Library (computer science) Microsoft .NET Control-Alt-Delete Port numbers Trusted computing GNOME Mandriva Linux Macromedia Flash USB flash drive Skype Network File System Thin client GNU Novell NetWare IBM PC compatible Bluetooth Computer virus Internet ITunes PlayStation 2 Free software Linspire FreeBSD Forth programming language Spyware Buffer overflow Unix Windows Vista Linux kernel Plan 9 (operating system) IPod Operating system advocacy Security-Enhanced Linux Mainframe computer Wget Java programming language Andrew Tridgell Timeline of computing 1990-forward Common Lisp Security focused operating system Modem Digital video recorder Gmail OpenOffice.org OpenGL NX bit Steam (content delivery) Rootkit BASIC programming language Apple Macintosh File Allocation Table AOL Instant Messenger Software bug History of the graphical user interface Mydoom Windows 3.x Web hosting Fritz-chip Sun Microsystems Password Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing DOS SUSE Linux Mozilla Firefox ReiserFS DragonFly BSD Windows registry PHP Partition (computing) Federal Standard 1037C Backdoor Device driver AirPort Local area network Superuser
