pen drive problem file removing problem in linux i have a pen drive gb that i use to take data from my working place to my room pc but the comp in my work place linux has a mysteious problem when i transfer some files to my pen drive it can not be removed from the pen drive even as 'root' now i took it to my room pc open suse there when i try to see those files it shows these kind of wierd looking file names ed fkm ar lx m etc when tried to remove the files by rm rf it shows rm cannot lstat n ' input output error please help thanks for your suggestion actually i have dual booting pc windows open suse but in windows also the file names are showing the same wierd way i shall try to format the pen drive first in ntfs and then in fat actually the files have back ups already not a lot of hardware software is compatible with linux so it's a little difficult to work the pen drive you have on linux since most companies make their hadware for windows mac os so when you try to insert your pen drive the os can do some pretty stupid things to the pen drive's file system most likely thanks to incompatibility the os messing the file system on the pen drive can result in your problem now and much much more stupidity you cant access your files and they become corrupt i can suggest that you connect to a computer compatible with the drive most likely a windows computer and see if you can recover the file in the windows computer if you can back it up on that pc and reformat the pen drive as ntfs put the files back in and try it on your linux computer if that doesnt work try the solution again only format it as fat which was the original file system return your files and connect to linux what you did here is sort of refresh your drive sorta like buying a new pen drive i hope it works for you as for finding a windows computer it sounds like you dont have one ask a friend who has windows if you could borrow their computer because friends are there to help right alright good luck it worked for me i had the same problem as you only on ubuntu Anti-virus software Computer virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Trojan horse (computing) Quarantine Spyware Legacy Virus H5N1 Rabies Malware Rootkit Ebola Avian influenza Yellow fever Cytomegalovirus Computer security Colorectal cancer HIV West Nile virus Progress of the SARS outbreak McAfee Coliseum Public policy Virus Encephalitis Trojan asteroid Smallpox Botnet Citrus canker Firewall (networking) Back Orifice Moira MacTaggert Introduced species Troy Chronic Wasting Disease Spanish flu Marburg virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lung cancer Singaporean measures against avian influenza Antiviral drug Lara Roxx Metroid Prime AIDS origin Nietzschean .hack (video games) Stopping e-mail abuse 28 Days Later Antibody Safe sex 1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia Foot-and-mouth disease Windows XP Cybercrime Influenza Steam (content delivery) Borna disease Angel One (TNG episode) Kaposi's sarcoma DNA SV40 Liberty Island Meme Covance Public health in mainland China Melissa worm Simian immunodeficiency virus AIDS Zinc Political views of Lyndon LaRouche Epstein-Barr virus Hepatocellular carcinoma ReBoot Port scanner Fritz-chip Pet skunk The Way to Eden Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal Kangaroo Island Hackers (short stories) Thyroid cancer Australian constitutional law USS Saufley (DD-465) Mary Mallon USS John W.
