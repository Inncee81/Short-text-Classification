how can i create a list of my baseball cards by player last name using the card collector software it seems as though i can make almost any other type of list with it is it even possible please help never mind the answer is no because this is a worthless product use beckett com it has a free section that has checklists of every set you can mark which you have or which you need organize them by player number or name the nice part is that the names numbers are already there they want you there assuming that eventually you'll shell out the per month to get the value of each card but it's not required i use this for printing want lists before going to card shows Mouse (computing) Windows XP IPod History of the graphical user interface Stardock Macintosh Finder IBM PC compatible USB flash drive Hard disk Minesweeper (computer game) Partition (computing) Xerox Star The Sims 2: University Gmail Halo: Combat Evolved Icon (computing) MMORPG Laptop ITunes Linux Apple Computer NTFS Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh File Allocation Table AmigaOS File system System 7 (Macintosh) Mathematics Floppy disk Google Unicode Mozilla Firefox Computer forensics Spy Hunter Macromedia Flash IMac Compact disc Computer storage Object Desktop Computer Spacecraft propulsion Digital photography Atari ST Virtual memory PowerBook Logo programming language Cubicle desk Plaintext Xbox Desk Memory (computers) Redundant array of independent disks IPod mini Bill Gates Personal computer Diablo II Flat file database The Sims 2 DOS Cyberspace Iron Monopoly (game) Apple II family Emergence DR-DOS NeXT Stopping e-mail abuse QuickTime Web traffic Quantum computer Go (board game) PostScript Hydrogeology Amstrad CPC Steam (content delivery) System/36 Diablo (computer game) RuneScape cheats Mac OS X Twm Desktop computer Turing machine Computer and video games Teen Girl Squad Library Windows 3.x System 6 BIOS Widget (computing) Screenshot Fractal Xbox 360 Klik Opera (web browser) FreeDOS Nintendo GameCube City of Heroes
