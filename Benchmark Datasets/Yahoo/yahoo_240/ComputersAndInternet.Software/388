is mac os x leopard worth waiting for points for all questions answered its july rightt now and that ipod free offer is going around however i don't really care about that i just want to know if mac leopard os x will it be as smooth as tiger and not as earthshattering horrible when windows vista came out should i wait for leopard to come out or go with tiger this is my first time getting a mac and i am just wondering also throughout the history of mac's from different osx to tiger was it stable when it came out for ex was tiger stable when it first came out thanks in advance tiger did have some quirks when it first came out but nothing horrible as far as i remember and they were smoothed out in due time there will be several prominent new features in leopard when it comes out but personally few of them really struck me as amazing having an automated and easily navigable backup system like time machine will be nice but i won't die without spaces or the new d reflective dock right now tiger is a perfectly mature operating system and will serve you well take a look at the list of leopard's new features linked below and compare them with a current mac if you can play around with one in a store the upgrade will cost you if you buy it separately from the mac so if you feel this isn't such a big expenditure you can buy leopard after it's had a few updates cranked out for it in fact the only reason leopard isn't already out is because they're still ironing out bugs leopard will open up some exciting possibilities for mac developers they'll be able to make programs that do things that would've been difficult to code before but for a normal user like yourself tiger will more than likely suit your needs hope this helps BitTorrent File sharing Peer-to-peer Internet Explorer Internet Warez Opera (web browser) Mozilla Firefox EMule General Packet Radio Service Netscape Navigator Web browser Web hosting Spyware Bulletin board system Web design Extreme Programming File Transfer Protocol Ajax (programming) World Wide Web Mozilla Application Suite Mouse (computing) Online shop Browser wars Web 2.0 Netscape Communications Corporation Windows XP Azureus PlayStation Portable XML Cascading Style Sheets Common criticisms of Microsoft Web page Uploading and downloading Timeline of computing 1990-forward Modem Internet pornography MySpace Computer virus Domain Name System Password MSN Messenger Social software GIF Mandriva Linux IPod LimeWire NeXT Pop-up ad Python programming language The Internet Movie Database Web application Enterprise content management Internet forum Sun Microsystems Voice over IP Web crawler Commodore 64 Gnutella Kazaa Debian Flickr Distributed computing Website Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Phishing History of Microsoft Windows Proxy server Unicode MAME Comparison of web browsers Internet Explorer for Mac Knoppix Sega Dreamcast Greasemonkey Mozilla Server MMORPG Open source culture Broadband Internet access Cross site scripting HTML element Stopping e-mail abuse Danger Hiptop Java programming language Make money fast DeltaAnime Digital rights management Trusted computing Copyright KDE Uniform Resource Locator Blogger Debugging Outlook Express PNG Thread (computer science) Linux distribution Cable television
