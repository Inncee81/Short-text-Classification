there is an itunes download if i download this will i lose all my songs no it will not cause you to lose all your songs but be aware if you do not keep a backup copy of your music you probably will lose all your music within years this is because sooner or later your hard drive will crash someone will a accidentally erase the files a virus or other problem will prevent you from booting and require you to format and reinstall without the option to backup your files backing up your files to an external drive is an improvement but you still run the risk of a virus infecting all the drives

do not touch the surface of the disc bend the disc use adhesive labels store discs horizontally for a long time years open a recordable optical disc package if you are not ready to record expose discs to extreme heat or high humidity expose discs to extremely rapid temperature or humidity changes expose recordable discs to prolonged sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light write or mark in the data area of the disc the area the laser reads clean by wiping in a direction going around the disc for cds especially do not scratch the label side of the disc use a pen pencil or fine tip marker

digital magnetic tape neither optical discs nor magnetic tape however is as stable as microfilm or paper with proper care microfilm and non acidic paper can last for centuries while magnetic tape lasts only a few decades van bogart just as film types can vary in years of usefulness one disc type can also last longer than another temperature and humidity conditions can markedly affect the
