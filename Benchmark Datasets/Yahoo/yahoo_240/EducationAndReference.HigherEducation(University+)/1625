should i stay with what i love to do as a career or should i try to get to where the money is on jobs i work as a day care provider and really love my job i was thinking of going to college to get my teacher degree and work in the schools to make more money but college is so expensive and i cannot afford it i can get loans but they are so hard to pay off been there once and done that i have about two years to go to finish my teaching degree i work in a day care that is part of the school system so i have the same benefits and retirment as the teachers but of course the pay is less what do you think thank you i should add that if i get my teaching degree that i live in a small town and cannot see very well to drive far so it will be hard for me to get a teaching job in the school system here i wonder if it would be very helpful if i did if teaching is what you love to do then i would suggest just taking a class at a time at night or whatever you can afford and finishing off your degree it may take a little longer but it's easier than having to worry about paying off a bunch of student loans on the other hand my personal opinion is that you should always pick a career that you enjoy and love money should never be the deciding factor if you pick a career based on money chances are in the future you won't love what you do you will always be a much happier person if you have a career or a job that you love Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Tuition Education in the United States Avenue Q Life insurance 401(k) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Unemployment Professor Social rule Student loan Freeters Education in Portugal Community college Pitaten Education in Romania Economic inequality Health insurance College Annuity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Great Teacher Onizuka Education Teacher College admissions Reiki Kodocha Unemployment benefit The Amazing Race Tripartite System Inflation Blackjack Capitalism Satchel Paige Money supply Prostate cancer Alex Ferguson No Child Left Behind Act Publicly funded medicine Knots Landing Socrates Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jon Secada EastEnders Pittsburgh Steelers Credit card Boston Public Hogwarts subjects Education in England Social Security (United States) Anarchism and society Extreme Programming Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education in Australia Tai Chi Chuan Brian Jones (musician) Knife Japanese tea ceremony Insurance Bond Wah Yan College, Hong Kong Franklin W.
