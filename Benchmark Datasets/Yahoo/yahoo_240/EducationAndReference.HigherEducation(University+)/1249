do kids in medical school ever throw up or anything embarrassing or are they all cool about cutting bodies open i am jsut curious as to how i would react i think i may get a bit green but nothing like pass out or vomit how many people do this does anyone ever drop out because of it first there's nothing embarrassing about physiological responses to new stimuli medical students are expected to exhibit professional behaviors so this means that the other students should not feel anything but sympathy for their classmates who have difficulties adjusting to the situations they encounter in medical school so no worries about being embarrassed at my institution we've had one or two students each year who choose to leave the room for a few moments during gross anatomy to the best of my knowledge none of them has ever actually vomited rather they typically step out and compose themselves for a few minutes returning later committed to getting the job done this type of visceral reaction has never caused any of our students to drop out and everyone has the capacity to adjust to and live with the stimuli that cause these sorts of reactions in other words don't worry about it you'll be fine Hypnosis Social rule Milton H.
