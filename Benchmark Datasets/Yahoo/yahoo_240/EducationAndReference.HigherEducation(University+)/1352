is the lsat hard like a lot of things it depends on how comfortable you are with the subject matter and the format the test is based on logic not law but it is timed and so even though a lot of people can answer the questions they have a hard time answering all the questions under time pressure plus the test lasts for several hours so fatigue plays a factor one way of telling the difficulty of the test is to look at how it is scored to score in the top or on the test you can typically miss about out of questions see http www powerscore com lsat help correct targeted htm that's a lot of questions you can miss to still score that well as far as i can tell to get an average score of you can miss about out of questions in my book if missing out of makes you average then the test must be pretty hard i know you can prepare for the test i took a powerscore course and that helps negate the difficulty of the exam people use different methods for preparing from courses to self study to tutoring but the rule is that since the test is generally considered difficult you should do some significant preparation beforehand how much time and effort you put into preparing will probably determine how difficult you find the test with two tests in the next several months though you have plenty of time to get started and end up with a high score Law School Admissions Test SAT The Princeton Review GED Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Law school Graduate Record Examination Extreme Programming Education in Romania Graduate school Theory of conduct Grade (education) Prostate cancer Test (student assessment) Juris Doctor National Certificate of Educational Achievement Advanced Placement Program Scientific method Expert system Password Halting problem Medical College Admission Test Stomach cancer Victorian Certificate of Education Second language acquisition Social rule Bar examination Science $ale of the Century Supernatural Laws of cricket Autism In The Groove (game) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Multiple sclerosis Standardized testing Family Feud Mathematics DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Fast bowling Mattress Fielding (cricket) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Domain Name System Lie Complexity classes P and NP Cricket General intelligence factor ELO rating system Baseball Education in the People's Republic of China Science Bowl Sex and intelligence History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Causality United States Academic Decathlon Logic Golf Computational complexity theory Species Diving Victor Cousin Explosive material History of Test cricket (to 1883) Kaplan Factor analysis CPU cache College admissions Education in Hong Kong 2005 English cricket season Debugging Principal-agent problem Coercion Current teachings of Prem Rawat Physics SmartAsk Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Taiwan International Mathematical Olympiad Mental retardation Ravi Shastri Identity and change Decision theory IB Diploma Programme Batting (cricket) Microeconomics Scientology beliefs and practices Martial art Bowl Championship Series Jeopardy!
