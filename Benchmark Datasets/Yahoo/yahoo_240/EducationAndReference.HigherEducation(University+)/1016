how much do humanities phds make supposing one holds a phd in a field like comparative literature religion history etc from a top program at a big name graduate school like berkeley harvard yale princeton stanford chicago michigan how much should one expect to be paid at a university or liberal arts college i know there are alot of out of work phds but at the top humanities programs it looks like of doctoral students manage to find employment by the time they receive their phd so i'm specifically wondering about that portion of phd students that find employment it depends on several factors most critically whether you are hired at an urban or rural college a poorly funded state university poorly endowed private college or a well endowed private college a history dept or a religion dept or another dept the ranking prestige reputation of said college in your discipline the amount of pull the department chair has with the college's administration urban colleges will pay more because of the higher cost of living associated with their location well endowed colleges will pay more because their endowments support higher faculty salaries history usually but not always pays better than either religion or lit departments with stellar reputations are sometimes better funded than their less stellar counterparts chairs who are owed favors by work well with suck up to are treasured by the administration can sometimes leverage salary caps depending on a combination of these factors a beginning salary for a newly hired professor on the tenure track beginning at assistant professor could range from k to k most often somewhere in the k range is a reasonable expectation your best bet is to check out the upcoming first week of september i think salary edition of the chronicle of higher education your library and maybe even your department has a subscription this edition will provide average salaries in every discipline at every level in both state and private institutions Education in the United States College and university rankings Ivy League Doctor of Philosophy University of Michigan University of California, Berkeley Yale University Education in Australia Columbia University College Duke University University of Southern California Academia Juris Doctor Student loan Princeton University Master's degree University of Toronto Charter school Education in Portugal Harvard University Stanford University University of Central Florida Johns Hopkins University Vanderbilt University Chinese University of Hong Kong San Diego State University University of Pennsylvania Law School University of Notre Dame California Institute of Technology University of Virginia University of Melbourne Ross School of Business University of Illinois at Chicago Emory University Rice University Education in Germany Massachusetts Institute of Technology Open access Bates College Emerson College Tianjin University Texas A&M University Education in Japan University of Rochester Brown University GED University of Pennsylvania University of California, Santa Cruz Anti-intellectualism Trinity College, Dublin Doctorate Institute for Christian Studies Washington University in St. Louis Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences New York University Blackjack Brigham Young University Oregon State University Insurance Lawyer SAT Financial endowment Erasmus Universiteit Physician Pennsylvania State University University of California University of Santo Tomas Virginia Military Institute University of North Carolina at Charlotte Cooperative education Private school Life insurance Uppsala University American University San Jos__ State University University at Albany College admissions Williams College Indiana University Bloomington Education in Scotland Charles William Eliot Pharmaceutical company University of Arizona Imperial College London University of Hong Kong Jewish studies
