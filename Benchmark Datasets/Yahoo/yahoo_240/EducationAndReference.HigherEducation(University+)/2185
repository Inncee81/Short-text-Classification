law school and criminal record to make a long story short i used to be a total screw up when i was i was convicted of a dui and in addition i was convicted of a felony assault for hitting a guy in the nose after he spit in my face his nose was broken and he had to have plastic surgery i have since gone to college maintained a at a top university and i am doing high 's to low 's on practice lsats what are my chances of getting in to a good law school thanks it may be an issue basically because the bar may not accept you you'd be wasting the law school's space so they may reject you based on that however if you've been clean since then and have basically turned your life around i wouldn't worry too much just disclose it and then explain that it was a long time ago and show how you've changed since then the easiest way is to find whichever state you plan on practicing go the that state's bar's website in the admissions or bar exam section find the section that talks about rules for admissions and criminal history you can search moral turpitude to make it quicker not your situation but all that stuff is in the same section it should have a list of factors that show how you're rehabilitated just pick from that list and show how they apply to your situation the main thing is to just disclose and explain they care more about crimes involving moral turpitude typically fraud or dishonesty than violent crimes that's why you want to be honest and disclose it and not try and hide it you should be fine Law school Theory of conduct Plame affair Witness impeachment Ethics Capital punishment SAT Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution College admissions Sin City Surveillance Privacy Columbine High School massacre Social rule Murder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Probation officer Education in the United States Jury Knife Scientology beliefs and practices Tom DeLay Police Juris Doctor Criminal record Florida Central Voter File Divorce Law School Admissions Test Prostate cancer Grade (education) Burglary GED Lawyer Capital punishment in the United States Pardon Rape United States district court Illegal drug trade Education in the People's Republic of China Due process Unlawful combatant Sexual orientation Notary public Drill bit Three strikes law The Dark Knight Returns Court system of Canada Hearsay Katelyn Faber 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Judicial functions of the House of Lords Physical therapy Contract Felony Economics Polygamy Treason Miscarriage of justice Ronnie Earle Cour de cassation Appeal The Book of Five Rings Volkert van der Graaf Medicine Double jeopardy Determinism Bayesian inference International law Wind turbine Crime Education in Romania Insanity defense Enron Corporation Carburetor Jury trial Microeconomics Paragraph 175 Knight Rider Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Legal research Arguments for and against drug prohibition Chiropractic British national identity card Torture Poker jargon Patent Health insurance Human sexual behavior First Amendment to the United States Constitution Transsexuality John Lott Concealed carry (USA) Karla Homolka Scientology controversy European Convention on Human Rights Prohibition (drugs) Classified information Richard Feynman
