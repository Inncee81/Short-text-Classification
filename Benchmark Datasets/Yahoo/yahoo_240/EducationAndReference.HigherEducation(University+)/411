what are some good topics for college essays something you learned from or something that influenced your life in some way do not choose anything that could be controversial at all you might be able to write the best paper ever for your belief but if the person reading it happens to have a different belief or disapproves of your belief you are going right into the trash can so stick to something neutral that no one would mind reading you only have a couple seconds to capture their attention and keep it my dad died of liver and lung cancer in september of my senior year so by the time i was applying to colleges by end of october into november i decided to write my essay about how it had affected my life and how i would never drink or smoke after seeing first hand how it affected him as well as his loved ones it wasn't sappy and all poor me or anything it was very tactfully written and everyone that i had proofread it really liked it normally on the application they give you a couple topic ideas but there's always an option to write your own you can use the same essay for every school rather than write and proofread a whole bunch of different ones colleges don't really care so much about what you write about just how well you write it so make sure you put a lot of time into your essay it should only be about one page double spaced the first sentence or two really needs to grab your reader make absolutely sure everything is worded the way you'd like it to be there's no grammar mistakes and certainly no spelling mistakes or careless typos like i just typed not spelling instead of no spelling and didn't catch it until the rd time i re read it it sounds petty to reject you because you spelled a couple words wrong but they would look at it as if you were too careless to even proofread your own essay how good of a student could you really be if they are going to accept people and give them scholarships and stuff they want the cream of the crop so make sure you're up there so take your time and have people proofread it for you and remember it's not all about the essay they focus on other stuff too so make sure you put the same time and effort into the application too write everything out on lined paper before you fill in the application they don't want to see white out and eraser marks all over and don't be afraid to brag a little you need to stand out start writing stuff down now so you don't forget to include anything important good luck i answered a question for someone before and gave a ton of tips on writing really well you can check it out if you think it would help http answers yahoo com question index qid aa l zt pa fzb nxxtfwmw clwwuic pmy kp pkvgqxqcgkx yaqm na zgiawwuh kyhmicqhdr y gqqouznnu paid add watch i give a lot of people help with college stuff i gave links to all my college related questions to this person yesterday you can go to this question and look at my previous answers http answers yahoo com question index ylt am ukhhygj imwnrm dcnvrty ix qid aaqkhh Theory of conduct Social rule Singlish GED American and British English differences Socrates Hey Jude The Apprentice 2 A Course In Miracles Plame affair Chinglish Wheel of Fortune SAT Empire Burlesque Scientology beliefs and practices Quizbowl Psychology Extreme Programming Objectivist philosophy Whose Line Is It Anyway?
