what is the best prep course for the lsat's i live in ny and i am not sure if i have to take the exam in sept for fall admission or can i wait until dec will taking the test in dec be too late for a fall admission i'm one of those powerscore fans the material we used in class was really good with lots of drills and practice questions and the instructor for my class was on the ball it just seemed very well done and it definitely helped my score a lot aside from kaplan and princeton i don't know much about other courses but regardless when making your choice choose a class that uses a lot of real lsat's and find out who your instructor will be try to get someone with a lot of teaching experience and a high score having a good instructor makes a big difference addressing your timing question you can take either the september or december lsat for fall admission some of the lower ranked schools will even accept the february lsat whatever test you choose make sure to take it when you feel comfortable and ready because all the scores stay on your record good luck Law School Admissions Test SAT Education in the United States Law school The Princeton Review Graduate school Kaplan Medical College Admission Test GED College admissions Education in Romania Advanced Placement Program Bar examination Education in Taiwan Drill instructor IB Diploma Programme Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Graduate Record Examination Prostate cancer Education in Australia Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Affirmative action Test (student assessment) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lowell High School (San Francisco) Professor Pitaten A-level Education in Portugal Education in Malaysia National Certificate of Educational Achievement Hunter College High School Stuyvesant High School Physician Brooklyn Technical High School United States Naval Academy Past teachings of Prem Rawat History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) English cricket team Community college Current teachings of Prem Rawat New England School of Law Juris Doctor Scientology beliefs and practices Education Yale Law School Secondary education in France Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Brown University Economics Welcome Back, Kotter University of Michigan Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Franklin W.
