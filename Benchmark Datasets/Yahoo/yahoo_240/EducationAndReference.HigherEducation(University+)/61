what are some good west regional law schools i am interested in eventually practicing in southern california after i go to law school hopefully i have heard that it is crucial to go to a school in the region in which you want to practice what are some good schools in the western region it's not crucial the more important thing is to just go to a school in the state b c you'll be better prepared for that state's bar exam if you want to practice in southern cal i'd choose based on ranking more than location take san diego for example univ of san diego is the best law school in san diego might be the only aba approved school go check the us news rankings to be sure while usd graduates are going to be fine looking for jobs in san diego if i can get into a much high ranked school i'd rather go there instead it'd be a no brainer to go to ucla or berkeley over usd even if they're not in san diego as a general rule of thumb i say if the out of area school is two tiers higher than the local school go to the out of area school if it's one tier difference then maybe consider the local school if they're in the same tier than definitely go with the local school Juris Doctor University of California, Los Angeles University of California, San Diego University of San Diego Lawyer Southern California University of California University of Southern California State university Education in the United States San Diego State University Affirmative action Law school University of California, Berkeley California Polytechnic State University San Diego, California Master of Laws California Education in Australia State Bar of California California State University Pacific Ten Conference College and university rankings University of California, Davis Hastings College of the Law Education in Germany California Western School of Law San Gabriel Valley High school Paralegal Interstate 405 (California) NCAA Men's Soccer Championship Cal Poly Pomona University of California, Santa Barbara University of California, Riverside California government and politics Carlsbad, California Interstate 5 Western United States San Diego Chargers Arizona State University Bowl Championship Series Education in Portugal Graduate school Poway, California Smoking ban Endgame College admissions College football Marylhurst University Case citation Stanford University San Francisco State University Silicon Valley San Francisco Bay Area Los Angeles County, California Grade (education) Regions of England Moreno Valley, California USS Wahoo (SS-565) California State University, East Bay USS Williamson (DD-244) San Diego International Airport Ulysses S.
