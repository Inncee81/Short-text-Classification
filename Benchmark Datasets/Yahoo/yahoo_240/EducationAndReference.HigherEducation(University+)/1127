can you explain why this answer is correct lsat study for some reason i'm just not getting this one question i tried to have someone explain it to me but it's just not making sense for some reason the link is http www getprepped com get prepped sample lsat pdf and it is question in section about ship in atlantic ocean the answers explanations are at the bottom of the test will someone tell me a quick explanation of why that answer is correct i keep getting hung up on the ship sinking around not hundreds of years after that you are looking for something which breaks the conventional wisdom that any wrecks in the sedimentary layer could not have been ships which sailed earlier than ad even holding all of our scientific knowledge true i tend to solve these by process of elimination a this actually is the tricky answer even if it is determined that some of the ships in the sedimentary layer were built before ad that does not mean that this is when they actually sailed thus those ships were probably ships that sank when they were old after ad the trick is the difference between when the ship was built and when it sailed b if this were true the ship would have sunk too early to be in the sedimentary layer c this branch is unrelated to the question talking about the carbon dating of fish not ships d this is the correct answer it would be possible for the ship to have sunken in ad if it did not immediately sink into the sedimentary layer and get covered up if it is true that some ships only fell into the sedimentary layer or more years after they sank then the date of sinking is not the relevant one what is relevant is the date at which it fell into the sedimentary layer if this was after ad then it is possible that this could be the viking ship they are talking about e this one actually reinforces the original reason they said it could not be that ship but implying that it sank before it reached its destination in ad if that were the case and the information given in part d were not the case it would have sunken too early to be in the sedimentary layer Flood geology Scientific method SAT Abiogenic petroleum origin Law School Admissions Test Expert system Water (molecule) Opportunity rover Psychology Standardized testing Creationism Origin of life Geology Geology of the Moon Logic Philosophy of science Global warming Bayesian inference The Princeton Review Sedimentary rock Noah's Ark GED Atlantic Ocean Philosophy of mathematics Philosophy of language Science Solar variation Ice core Lake Plate tectonics Carbon dioxide Tuff Species Sailing Rigging Radiocarbon dating Snowball Earth Internet protocol suite Religion Naval mine Sea level rise Creation science CPU cache Geology of the British Isles Epistemology Evidence of evolution Causality Historical method Normal distribution Anchor Theodicy Intelligent design Cognitive science Uniform Resource Locator Artificial neural network Determinism G__del's incompleteness theorem Many-worlds interpretation Ethics Extreme Programming Intelligence quotient Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Free will God Emperor of Dune Meaning of life Geology of the Grand Canyon area Paleoclimatology RMS Titanic Domain Name System A New Kind of Science Plame affair Supernova Ultra USS Anderson (DD-411) Race and intelligence Crossword Radiometric dating Medical College Admission Test Karl Popper Democracy Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fermi paradox Monty Hall problem Second language acquisition One-time pad Creation-evolution controversy Radical behaviorism Strategic management Permian-Triassic extinction event Diatom Occam's Razor
