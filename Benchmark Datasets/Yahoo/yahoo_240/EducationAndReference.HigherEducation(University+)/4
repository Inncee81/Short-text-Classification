the best way to spend a productive summer i am considering a trip to spain that my spanish honors class is doing this next summer which includes spanish lessons everyday to develop fluency as well as living with host families to take in the culture my question is how will this look on a resume according to prestigous universities like rice university of chicago princeton etc will it merit anything besides a good experience the reason i ask is because i have to pay for it i have a part time job and am saving and it's thousand dollars if i don't go then what are some things to do that will have a tremendous effect on university applicant reviewers granted i know how many outstanding applicants they receive each year thanks by the way i spelled prestigious wrong just noticed that take charge of something the volunteer idea above was great see if you can head something up in your community travel is always great however lots of rich kids travel and that's who'd you be competing against you need to differentiate yourself in other ways like making a big difference by getting yourself in the local newspapers etc for your efforts you'll be able to make a fantastic portfolio for submission i was accepted to great schools and the portfolio was the name of the game Education in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the People's Republic of China Affirmative action Microeconomics New Deal Appeal Open Directory Project Software engineering Advanced Placement Program Esperanto as an international language Second language acquisition Academia Ethics Scientific method College and university rankings Extreme Programming Tlingit Physics Software patent debate Discworld MUD Supply and demand Education in Portugal Capital accumulation Irish language Football (soccer) Spanish transition to democracy Capitalism School of Salamanca Boston College Zhao Yun Duke University Economics Intelligent design movement Cuba W.
