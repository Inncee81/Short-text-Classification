what would you do if you know that a student impersonated another student for an exam i'm taking my last class for my business admin undergrad it's a strategic management course it's a large class of or so students we only meet once a week as such the instructor doesn't really have the opportunity to get to know the students' names we had an oral exam yesterday this one girl pretended to be someone else she pretended to be mable smith i'm thinking to myself you're not mable smith mable smith is that girl sitting on the corner of the room i recognize the name because i've been in other classes with mable the real one in previous courses what would you do if you know that someone took an exam for someone else if you are really sure that this person wasn't just another person named mabel smith i would definitely let the instructor know what you do it is not true that everyone cheats and those who do hurt not only themselves but others as well you can either talk to the professor or send him her a note don't extend it any farther by saying why you think this happened just give the facts something like i was very bothered by something which happened in class during our oral exam yesterday when mabel smith was scheduled to present another individual spoke in her place i know mabel smith well because we have taken accounting management and statistics together and mabel was sitting in the back of the classroom while this other person whose name i do not know spoke mabel is the tall brunette woman who usually sits in the back of the classroom the person who took the exam as mabel was shorter and a redhead i just thought you should know at my school our online records have pictures of each student so this would be difficult for someone to do when i first started teaching though i had an odd experience with that a lot of my colleagues at my first jobs had serious racist tendencies when i started i was told watch out for the chinese students they send other people in to take their exams for them because they know you can't tell them apart i ignored it thinking this was more racist nonsense then on the day of the final exam an asian woman came in and sat down and she looked completely unfamiliar to me i take pride in knowing my students by name but i didn't even recognize this person and the old warning popped into my mind at the end of the exam this person came up to me and said something and her voice was immediately recognizable as that of one of my regular students it seems that she usually wore a huge amount of makeup but by the end of exam week she hadn't slept wore no makeup and had not done her hair and she honestly looked like a completely different person i was so ashamed of myself for even having entertained the thought that that racist warning might be true EastEnders Pitaten Education in Germany Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Salad Fingers Boston Public Theory of conduct Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Friends Time Out of Mind Paul Is Dead Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Russian joke Welcome Back, Kotter Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Beavis and Butt-head Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Education in Romania The Catcher in the Rye Law school Milton H.
