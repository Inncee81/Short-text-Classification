what should i look for in majors at colleges im thinking of becoming either a psychologist for children or a nutritionist type for children i say type because i mean like a person kids can go to for help in losing weight based on their diets etc but i dont know if u would call that a nutritionist im a senior in high school and looking for places that could help me in either of those goals because im not sure which one i want to be yet the problem is that most colleges i look at im looking at smaller liberal arts colleges not those huge uc places have psychology as a major but nothing like nutrition could i major in psychology and still have a possibility of becoming that nutritionist type for kids what if i change my mind in the middle of college and the place im going to doesnt have a major for the other career i want to have also right now im looking at whitman reed and evergreen in oregon washington im in california though im not interested in community colleges my college counselor says that he thinks a year university college would be the place for me looks like you are making progress in narrowing down your choices of schools good work i would suggest writing to the departments at the colleges that you are interested in attending and explain to them your interests they can probably help you tailor your program you could also consider a double major i suspect that many of the required courses could overlap and this is where feedback from the school would be a big help to complicate your life a bit more but another topic to include in a letter to the universities if you are going to go into psychology you will probably want to get at least a masters degree it is likely that you would go that route working in nutrition so you could possibly major in one area as an undergrad and get a masters in the other i think the universities can give you good advise of course then there is always a phd but i will not go there in addition to the advise the universities can give you their answers may help solidify your choices of a school one last thought is when you visit the schools arrange to talk with the department heads or others in the departments you are interested in Education in the United States Psychology University of Central Florida Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Connecticut Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Academia Juris Doctor Education in Australia Master's degree Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Nutrition Doctorate Education in Germany Scientology beliefs and practices Georgetown University Cornell University School counselor Hunter College High School College admissions High school Strategic management Stomach cancer University of Notre Dame Extreme Programming Quizbowl Tufts University College and university rankings Sexual orientation Homeschooling Medicine Parapsychology Developmental psychology Drew University Coercion Liberal arts college Hampshire College Economics Omega-3 fatty acid Education in Romania Franz Boas College GED Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences University of Chester Obesity Psychoanalysis Education in Portugal Chronic fatigue syndrome Francis Crick University of Massachusetts Amherst Clinical depression Northeastern University, Boston Logic Education in Taiwan Aristotle Psychotherapy Washington University in St. Louis Theory of conduct Weight training Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in the Republic of Ireland Prostate cancer Reed College Doctor of Philosophy Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences Alexander Technique Peter Singer Theodicy Atkins Nutritional Approach University of Maryland Baltimore County Bachelor of Arts Pitzer College U.S. Electoral College Florida Institute of Technology Carl Jung University of Santo Tomas Teacher Hypoglycemia Professor Degrees of Oxford University Student loan Yearbook Controversies in autism Neuro-linguistic programming University of Michigan Smith College Plame affair Jewish studies New York State College of Human Ecology Food Stamp Program Lawyer Folic acid
