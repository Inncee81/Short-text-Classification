can i get into law school with a misdemeanor ironic question but i had a little implication with the police over a year ago and felt i should check before beginning to study for the lsat it was a misdemeanor for smoking pot in a state park in ohio license was suspended for six months and i paid a fine should i be worried about this information being accessible by law schools most applications ask for any offense which you have been arrested for so getting it expunged will not matter as far as getting into law school yes you can just make sure you include an addendem that owns up to the mistake the bar will do a character and fitness review when you graduate and if that is all you have and you do not mess up in law school it will have been years old you will have to explain to them you screwed up but they will probably let you in only about percent of cases they say no to they are mostly looking for felonies and a pattern of behavior good luck on the lsat Felony Law school Law School Admissions Test Jury trial Court system of Canada Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Magistrate Ohio county government Franklin County, Ohio Paragraph 175 Lawrence v.
