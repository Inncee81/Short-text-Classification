good colleges i live in new york and was wondering if any of you have good advice on choosing a college i'm kind of afraid about choosing a college too far from home because i'm and i'm still a home body i plan on majoring in spanish or english and was wondering if you had any advice i don't know if a suny college is as good as a big university i now universities are very expensive and i dont really have all that much money i have around a average and have no idea how to calculate a gpa and my sats are this coming year could you lead me in the path of a good college not too far from home with an excellent spanish english course preferably one that you study abroad spanish thanks and also if you happen to know of any reaally good scholarships you can send a shout my way ok first of all let's tackle the money issue if you don't come from a wealthy family many people choose the state schools unfortunately the ny state schools are on the crappy side still check out private schools' financial aid departments the ivies like columbia are doing a much better job of making things more affordable for those with lower incomes nyu is lacking in that area imo maybe intentionally you're a home body now but that may change in a couple of years it's good for a lot of people to go outside their comfort zone and get new experiences since you have a good gpa start looking around for scholarships there are all sorts of scholarships and many might be local just go to your local public library and see if they have anything on scholarships ask your school maybe even call up a local college and talk to their financial aid department now secondly your majors you say you don't have a lot of money so don't waste what you have pursuing a useless education what are you going to do with these majors you have planned english has some use if you intend on being a writer or something like that what about spanish plan on working for some public interest group you're going to have to work a bit and be creative in trying to find a job with those majors versus something like engineering it's better to have an idea of some kind of job you'd like to do then pick a major that will help you get that job Education in Germany Education in the United States Scholarship SAT Education in the People's Republic of China Ivy League Graduate school Student loan University of Michigan University at Albany Grade (education) Columbia University Stern School of Business College and university rankings Tuition College admissions Law school Inflation American University Mutual fund New York University Cornell University W.
