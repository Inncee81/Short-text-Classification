what can a person do with a bachelors degree in psychology what can a person do with a masters in psychology can a person just get a general masters degree in psychology or do you have to have a specialty i am wanting to have a private practice to just talk to people i don't necessarily want to perscribe anything is that possible with a masters with a bachelors in psychology you can pretty much work anywhere although you won't come into good money this is because with only a bachelors in psych you really can't get a job that involves psychology you will need at least a master's i am going into school psychology you should look into that field to become a sp in texas you have to have at least your master's degree which is years all together year is an internship so really it is a specialist degree you can work in the school setting but be a psychologist the lifestyle of a sp from my perspective is very fun you work the same days teachers work that is if you work in a public school and you get much higher pay than teachers that means summers off weekends off holidays off hour work day which honestly i believe is the best type of work schedule one can have being off during the summer gives you extra time to start of family of your own while not having to worry about being at work and even though you are not working you are still getting paid plus you get great benefits i know a woman that is a sp and she works with elementary age kids she tests them and sees what they are capable of learning wise during the next years there is going to be a big demand for sps because the baby boomers are going to be retiring and that means it will be easy for us to find jobs because there will be a shortage when can negoiate to get a higher paying salary also schools will always be around so we will never come to a point where sps aren't going to be needed especially with all the terrible things happening in schools these days hope this is helpful Graduate school Education in Germany Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Portugal Infantilism Professor Medical school Juris Doctor Master's degree Unemployment Physician General practitioner Education Social rule Lawyer Freeters Architect Nurse Psychology Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Australia Social psychology Librarian Breastfeeding Teacher Economic inequality Health insurance No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania Contract The College of New Jersey Education in Japan 2000 Australian Grand Prix National Football League Intern Microeconomics University of California, Los Angeles Dentistry College Great Teacher Onizuka Supply and demand School counselor Anarchism and society Homeschooling Generation Y Political economy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stevens Institute of Technology Theory of conduct Aesthetic Realism A Course In Miracles Medicine Daylight saving time Altruism Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Humphrey Bogart Philosophical skepticism Walt Disney World College Program EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete Joke Amway About a Boy Air traffic controller Education in Finland Enneagram Shaggy dog story Apprenticeship Robert L.
