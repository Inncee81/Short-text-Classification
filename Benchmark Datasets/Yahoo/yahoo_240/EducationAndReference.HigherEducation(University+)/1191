what kind of students are they looking for to go into medical school is it exceptional academic ability or participation in different activities because i have a very strong academic record but im now going into year and havent really been involved in many after school activities or anything like that and im getting worried i do do music though but i need to know if i should participate in more extra curriculum activities well they like to see smarts dedication to the effort that means you need to hang around the biology and chemistry labs pick the professors brains do some outstanding projects with the hope of getting some letters from biology and chemistry professors raving about how hard working and good you are see medical school is going to work you to death you're going to be doing hours a week of work and it never lets up clear through internship and residency you're going to work weekends holidays as a med school student you may not get spring break they may on call rounds you for part of it or for christmas or thanksgiving day week ends and you better not moan heart attacks don't ask if today is a holiday or not the staff at that teaching hosital is climbing over each other based on time in to get out of there on friday at noon and so they need hands and bodies to stay all night the next day the day after that the holiday until the key staffers return tuesday morning you low man on the totem pole you and the student nurses and the st nd and rd year residents and the interns all you pieces of nothing get to bail the basement out when the flood comes now you have an idea what they are looking for not a party person but someone who is there to sleep on a cot so they can be avaiable when when a bridge falls and they bring in the injuried people one day as a thoractic surgery or cardo vascular rd year resident or maybe as a generaly sugery resident you will be chief of hospital services over memorial day weekend that means you basically are the boss of the hospital at least for part of that time now that's a pretty awesome job and you have to have to stuff together to really do it most teaching hospital have waiting rooms that never empty it is a steady stream of people going in and out of the doors on a daily basis many don't speak your language they will have all sorts of problems there will be one or two senior nurses to triage the whole process but in emergencies on a holiday weekend you call the shots you call in the reserves all the avaiable residents any staffer who is foolish enough not to vanish the head of medicine might come in and take over and do the press pieces there might be a junior administrator who is allso on call and they might come in and handle the press briefings but until then you the rd or th year most advanced surgical resident are god at that hospital that is what they are training you to do and that is what they are looking for in a medical student they are looking at you and asking can this person run the show here do they have the right stuff because that is what they are training you to do be a lead doctor they don't teach wannabe and nd class doctors that's a waste of time and resources they have applicants and or spots to fill bill frist a us senator and md when to new orleans to treat patients there yeah maybe it was a little grand standing but it is also his duty as a federal officer and a doctor to render assistance in great tragic occurances Medicine Physician Triage Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Stroke Medical school Traumatic brain injury Emergency department Urinary incontinence Nurse Prostate cancer Professor Education in Portugal Scientology beliefs and practices General practitioner Hurricane Katrina timeline Columbia University Emergency Medical Services Education in Germany Sin City Childbirth University of Michigan Traditional Chinese medicine Michael D.
