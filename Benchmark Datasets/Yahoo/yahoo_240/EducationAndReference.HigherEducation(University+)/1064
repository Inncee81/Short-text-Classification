could anyone tell me about living in living out at college i'm starting to look into colleges i'm leaning towards nyu and i'd like to try living in however it would be my first time living away from home and i'm afraid that it'll be too much i e that i couldn't handle it and i'd want to start living at home again still going to college just living with my parents for the first year or so the thing is if i chose to live away from home would that be it for a year would i have to just stay there could i try it for a few months and then if it didn't work out could i just leave the dorm but continue attending classes what's the procedure please help me first thing you need to do is not try to borrow trouble you'll be so busy over there with studies and social life that you likely won't miss home as much as you think i missed home a lot too when i first went to college but i got over it after a few weeks try living away from home just for one term but plan for a visit back for a weekend sometime in october that's what i did and it helped a lot you'll make a bunch of good friends and please take advantage of the counseling services at nyu there are plenty of students who feel as you do and all sorts of support systems on campus that you can use just ask at the health center for referrals if you find you still can't live on your own don't sweat it you would be allowed to move out at the end of the term if you really feel you needed to they have ways of making special exceptions but if you really don't think you'll make the year sign up to live in off campus housing they are a lot more flexible and much more like regular landlords remember that you're paying a lot of money for the school to give you the best education possible and it's up to the school to do everything they can to provide that for you in the way that suits your needs best New York University Education in Germany Education in the United States University of Massachusetts Amherst One Tree Hill (TV series) Freed-Hardeman University Franklin W.
