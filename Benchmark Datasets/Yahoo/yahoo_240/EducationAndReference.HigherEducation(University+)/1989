online distance learning colleges need advice i do not have any degree under my belt right now but i have completed year at a community college and i want to pursue a bachelor of science degree in health science because that seems to be only right as far as achieving something within a broad range of jobs can someone pick an online school that only offers a bachelors degree and up and earn an associates there and then keep continuing their education until they have gotten their bachelors degree or do you have to atleast earned an associates degree before you can go to a school that only offers bachelors and up also i have wrote a previous message concerning if anyone knew of accredited pure online schools that offer degrees in health science i would like to find one that is affordable accredited and can get me employment after i graduate i don't want any scams any help is appreciated there are a lot of questions here and not enough information health science is a broad group what exactly are you interested in radiology nursing health promotion health administration bioinformatics genetics lab technology cytotechnology it goes on there is no one degree that will qualify for all of these if a school only offers a bachelor's and up then they won't be awarding an associates degree no you don't always need an associates degree to enroll in a bachelor's program but many bachelor's programs in the health professions do indeed require that you already have a related associates or a license to practice that profession example is a bsn program for nurses that are already licensed and only have an asn or diploma a affordable you need to quantify that what is affordable to me may well not be affordable to you i have paid as much as for one online class how much do you want to invest b accreditation good call this isn't as easy as it sounds though in addition to regional accreditation many of the health professions will require professional accreditation also in order for you to become licensed or certified you need to narrow down your choice of field so that you can explore specifics c employment no legitimate school can promise that very much depends on you and how you perform that said some programs have better placement rates than others if the school is properly recognized employability should be a minimal issue if you will study these questions first and narrow down some the choice of a school will be much easier Associate's degree Paralegal Community college Juris Doctor Education in the United States Education in Australia Education in Portugal Physician Master's degree Lawyer Medical school Education in the People's Republic of China Northeastern University, Boston School accreditation Academic degree Medical University of South Carolina City and Guilds of London Institute Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Germany GED Architect University of Central Florida Chiropractic Kwantlen University College Far Eastern University Florida State University Law school Education in Hong Kong Physical therapy Academia General practitioner Georgetown University Medicine University of Phoenix Florida Institute of Technology Stevens Institute of Technology Memorial University of Newfoundland Mapua Institute of Technology Master of Business Administration College admissions University of Houston Electrical engineering Seneca College Bachelor of Arts Teacher Education in the Republic of Ireland Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Pennsylvania State University Librarian Trinity College, Dublin No Child Left Behind Act Advanced Placement Program Emerson College Social work Bachelor of Laws Columbia University The College of New Jersey University of Maryland Baltimore County Dublin City University Cornell University American University AMA Computer University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Malaysia Baruch College University of Hawaii at Manoa Doctorate Professor Bilkent University Distance education Education in Finland University of Alabama Bologna process Indiana State University Affirmative action Economics Profession Medical Assistant Temple University Insurance Lyceum of the Philippines Education in Canada Cooperative education Education in Sweden Science Marylhurst University Education Intelligence quotient University of New England, Maine
