could anyone answer some of my questions about getting into pharmacy school i am currently a college sophomore at the university of north alabama i have been trying to find as much information on pharmacy school as i can but i would love a first hand account from people who have been there and done it i am most interested in what it takes to actually get into pharmacy school for instance is it important to have pharmacy technician experience in order to get in or are grades and volunteer work more important what types of things would look good on a resume i currently have a gpa so i know that i can keep the grades up but if i need work experience how do i get certified to be a tech also are there any companies out there that pay for your pharmacy school if you work for them any information will be greatly appreciated thanks also will i be better off to get a bachelor's degree before applying to pharmacy school or will i still have a chance of getting in with all the required pre requisite classes note i plan on applying to auburn university's harrison school of pharmacy in auburn al pharm tech experience is not required i wouldn't even recommend it it gets too hard to go from working as a pharm tech to going back to school grades and other extra curric stuff like volunteering but not necessarily are more important get a good pcat score that will be important to help show that your grades aren't because you went to an easy school you don't need a bachelors to get into pharm school if you've fulfilled all the pre req courses go ahead and apply if you don't get in than finish up your degree and apply again after you have a bachelors some companies pay for your pharm school but it's usually a loan repayment program you're going to have to take out loans and pay for pharm school the loan repayment programs don't start until you're out of school and have already got the debt to your name sometimes they don't kick in until you've worked for a couple of years for the company veterans affairs and some retail pharmacy companies have these programs Education in the United States Doctorate Student loan Education in Portugal Medical school Education in the People's Republic of China Master's degree Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Grade (education) Law school Architect Bond Mortgage Auburn University College admissions Advanced Placement Program Juris Doctor Education in Sweden Bachelor's degree Bowl Championship Series Education in Australia Kwantlen University College Internet fraud Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Chiropractic No Child Left Behind Act Money Northeastern University, Boston GED University of Southern California Scientology beliefs and practices IB Diploma Programme Bologna process Chinese University of Hong Kong Credit card Pharmacy SAT Debt Education in Canada Georgetown University Athabasca University Iron Bowl Teacher Academia Paralegal University of Houston Librarian Bachelor of Arts Grade (climbing) Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tulane University Temple University University of Michigan State university Extreme Programming Stock Theory of conduct Law School Admissions Test Marshall Plan Georgia Institute of Technology Tertiary education fees in Australia Education in Romania Islamic banking Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Software engineering Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets University of Central Florida Annuity Affirmative action Associate's degree Education Economics Lend-Lease Auburn, Alabama Pharmacist Michael Griffin Oregon State University Standardized testing University of Tennessee Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Economy of Pakistan United Kingdom corporation tax Education in Japan Illegal drug trade Massachusetts Institute of Technology Opelika, Alabama City and Guilds of London Institute Anarchism and capitalism A-level United States Army Syracuse University Orange
