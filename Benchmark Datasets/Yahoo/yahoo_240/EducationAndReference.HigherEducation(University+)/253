nyu should i lie about my major i want to study finance at nyu stern when i go to college but since stern is so hard to get into even as an undergrad should i fib and tell them i want to study liberal arts like history or something in order to get accepted then once i am accepted can i switch into finance interesting how people think that when i say 'lie' i mean cheat i'm saying should i choose a major i dont want as a way to get in go for it it isnt actually lying most colleges don't even ask you to declare majors and anything can happen in a year of th grade high school suppose you took an economics class and fell in love with the subject or a finance class etc it was honest of you you had intended to study liberal arts but changed your mind as many college students do but you absolutely have to make sure that you're allowed to transfer many colleges allow you to only transfer to their college of arts and science not to their specialized colleges so call the admissions office anonymously and ask them that question i know upenn allows students to transfer into their arts and science but not into wharton engineering or nursing to transfer into their specialized schools you would have to reapply but generally it is easier to get into a different college in th same university as a transfer student than as a freshman i'm not sure how nyu works you will have to get details on that yourself if they allow you go for it you will not be accused of lying good luck Stern School of Business University of Pennsylvania New York University Education in the United States Graduate school GED College Education in Taiwan Advanced Placement Program Trinity College, Dublin A-level High school Johns Hopkins University Seneca College California Polytechnic State University SAT The College of New Jersey Harvard University Education in Germany Secondary education in the United States University of Michigan Education in Romania Education in Portugal Brown University Grade (education) Quizbowl University of Central Florida Community college Ivy League Northeastern University, Boston IB Diploma Programme Master's degree Duke University University of California, San Diego The Catholic University of America Student Hunter College High School Associate's degree Tulane University Franklin W.
