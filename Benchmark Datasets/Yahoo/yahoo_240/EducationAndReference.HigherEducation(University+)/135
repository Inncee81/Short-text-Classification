is communications a good major i want to major in communications my school does not have a definite pre law program and advises students to pick a major that will be helpful towards law school i picked communications because i figured there is a lot of writing and public speaking involved and will prep me for law school plus i can take political science and debate classes as electives people say it isn't a good major so i have three questions for you do you think communications is a unrespectable major and what jobs are out there for communications majors besides radio and is it a good paying major i have a lot of cousins majoring in communications but personally i haven't heard whether it's unrespectable or not but if you're on your way to law school take any major that you are fully interested in because law schools like to see that you're well rounded and not just taking the pre law path hope this helps Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Teach the Controversy Lawyer Law school Independent school (UK) Social rule Theory of conduct Lincoln-Douglas Debate Paralegal Economics Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Debate Professor Caulfield Grammar School Pitaten Education in Australia Intelligent design movement Lyndon LaRouche Graduate school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Community college Plame affair Democratic Party (United States) The Sims 2: University Extreme Programming No Child Left Behind Act Human sexual behavior Rosa Parks Republic Public policy Law School Admissions Test SAT Grove City College Software engineering University of Central Florida Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 6 Homeschooling Juris Doctor Vanderbilt University Miami, Florida American University Grand Forks, North Dakota Medical school Education reform Anarchism and society Bosniaks Phillip E.
