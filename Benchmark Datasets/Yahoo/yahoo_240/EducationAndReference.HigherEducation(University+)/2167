what is a good major to take before going into a physical therapy program i am going to become a physical therapist and the courses available in nebraska are all graduate programs so what could i major in and get my bachelor's degree in prior to entering the physical therapy programs well there are many majors that you can take before you go for a graduate course in physical therapy i am a major in computer engineering and minor in psychology and biology this helped me to get into many different fields of the medical line you could take bachelor of science first and you can focus on biology and chemistry because all of this courses you need to understand the basic of human anatomy and physiology before going further you can also focus on psychology this is another major you can focus on first due to the fact that in the medical line many of the health professional do not take the time to understand or care enough for their patients that they see because they are preoccupied with their own problems and then misunderstands the problems of their patients that is why in today's medical professional many are so poor in diagnosing their patients and provide the best medical support for their patients another part is that it is better to focus on what your patients really want you to answer when you understand the psychology of their thinking this way it makes your job much more easier in my health practice i tend to do the psychology on my patients first to find out what is their main problems then get into their illnesses this way your diagnostic of their symptoms and cause will be more accurate and then you will see them more often for other problems they have then seeing them for repeated problems if you see this is the way you want to go for physical therapist way of helping people then this is what you should do think about it and make the right choice for your major choices are again biology chemistry physics psychology kinesology anatomy and physiology hope this helps and sorry for the long winded reply some might be repeating as i am falling asleep writing this hahaha Physical therapy Nurse Chiropractic Physician Science Traditional Chinese medicine Psychiatry Clinical depression Psychology Autism Psychotherapy Chinese University of Hong Kong Prostate cancer Pharmacist Reparative therapy Education in Portugal Addiction Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome University of Maryland Baltimore County Palliative care Sexual orientation Software engineering Ethics Psychoanalysis Massage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drug abuse Occupational Therapy Far Eastern University Homeopathy Traumatic brain injury Bipolar disorder Doctorate Osteopathy Borderline personality disorder Anorexia nervosa Dissociative identity disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Abortion Asperger syndrome Narcolepsy Stomach cancer Emergency department Rudolf Hermann Lotze Schizophrenia Sleep Sexual dysfunction Involuntary commitment Georgetown University Stevens Institute of Technology University of Connecticut Biology Reflexology Naturopathic medicine Reiki Pneumonia Neuro-linguistic programming Traumatic incident reduction Malaria Medical school Infantilism Hypoglycemia Meditation Alexander Technique Gender identity disorder Cytomegalovirus Hypnosis Stroke Scientology beliefs and practices Diagnosis Fibromyalgia Eugenics Mental health Dentistry Memorial University of Newfoundland Hormone replacement therapy (trans) False memory University of Central Florida Transgender Electroconvulsive therapy Gestalt therapy Ex-gay History of science Post-traumatic stress disorder Sociology
