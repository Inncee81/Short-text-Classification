what's the difference between an architect and an engineer trying to figure out what i want to do with my life also do these career options involve a lot of math i love math and what other careers involve math thanx also what are the best colleges for these fields architects actually design structures engineering is a very broad term but usually refers to someone who designs and builds systems or components architects tend to design buildings and bridges maybe bridges engineers will review the design and approve based on analysis another way i look at it is that architects have a personality engineers don't don't worry i'm an engineer so i can say that as for math either is intense but depending on what field of engineering it may be more intense and likely will be in any field of engineering also engineering will make you learn some complex physics typically also this all holds as long as you don't add the key word technology at the end of the engineer degree this means it different and tends to be a bit easier because its all hands on and not theoretical Mathematics Software engineering Phase-shift keying Architecture Orders of magnitude (numbers) Database Central processing unit Electrical engineering Product Lifecycle Management Computer science Construction Massachusetts Institute of Technology Engineering University of Waterloo Temperature Reliability engineering Field-programmable gate array Computer numbering formats Game programmer Philosophy of language Homeschooling Cryptography Specified complexity W.
