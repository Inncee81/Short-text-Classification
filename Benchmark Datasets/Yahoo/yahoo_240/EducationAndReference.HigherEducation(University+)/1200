what school has a good phd program for taxonomical microbiology i plan on pursuing my phd in microbiology but i would like to focus on microbial taxonomy or polyphasic taxonomy but recently i have been finding it hard to find a program that is either focused on this or has a similar focus do you know of any or could you recommend any schools i am unaware on any ph d programs that focus on polyphasic microbiology take that with a grain of salt as i am not familiar with most graduate programs however in my experience most microbiology departments have general programs with each faculty member having expertise in a specific sub field my advice would be to do a little research to see who is working in the field of polyphasic taxonomy and contact them to tell them that you are interested in pursing a ph d in that field Graduate school Doctor of Philosophy Physician Medicine Professor University of Central Florida Master's degree Microbiology Chinese University of Hong Kong Puerto Ricans in NASA Nurse Science Soil science Juris Doctor Taxonomy Washington University in St. Louis Species Education in Australia Lawyer Franz Boas Electric motor Cornell University Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences University of Ottawa Scientific classification Linnaean taxonomy University of British Columbia University of Maryland Baltimore County Oregon State University Polyphasic sleep Stanford University Binomial nomenclature Computer-supported collaboration Max-Planck-Gesellschaft California Institute of Technology Pasteur Institute University of Bristol Expert system Mathematics Electrical engineering University of California, Santa Cruz Massachusetts Institute of Technology Law school University of Michigan Cladistics Simon Fraser University American University Erasmus Universiteit Medical school University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Notre Dame NHH Sleep Economics University of Santo Tomas Cooperative education Evolutionary biology New York State College of Human Ecology Myxobolus cerebralis Candidatus Barrister Hwa Chong Institution MP3 Librarian University of Hong Kong University of Connecticut Organic farming University of Queensland Barbara McClintock Bipolar disorder Thimerosal __cole Polytechnique Paralegal Chiropractic Experiment Carolus Linnaeus Biology Formal methods Linus Pauling Jewish studies University of Maryland, College Park Nikola Tesla History of evolutionary thought Education in the People's Republic of China Chimpanzee Institute for Christian Studies Game theory Duke University University of Southern California Johns Hopkins University College and university rankings Martial art Indiana University Bloomington Ross School of Business MIT Media Lab Object-oriented programming Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences University of Alabama Unidentified flying object
