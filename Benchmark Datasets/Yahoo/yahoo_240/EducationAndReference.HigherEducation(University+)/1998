phd programs why is it that phd programs are so inaccessable for working adults i was in one but they had all of their classes and professors office hours during the work day amd even at as a part time student i was required to read over pages a week yes per week and that didn't count the reading for the term's project a friend of mine decided to do it full time and he is now years down the road and he still doesn't have his this is stupid and unfair i would love to pursue a phd in a meaningful program but haven't been able to find anything anywhere reasonable i already have three masters degrees and a dozen years teaching at the collegiate level what am i to do it depends on the fields i would say what fields of study are you and your friend doing well i only know of two phd students who are working and stuff one is in engineering and the other is mathematics in my program we have a lot of master students who are working adults i say phds in the physical sciences are easier to get Graduate school Master's degree Doctor of Philosophy __cole Polytechnique Doctorate Education in Australia Education in France College Chinese University of Hong Kong Juris Doctor Software engineering Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Portugal Nurse Columbia University University of Notre Dame W.
