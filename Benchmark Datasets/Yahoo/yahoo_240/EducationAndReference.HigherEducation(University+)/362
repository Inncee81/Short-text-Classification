how does college work i'm barely in th grade i just want to know more about college for example how do you become a mechanic or a nurse or something else i was like you and probably even a little more the best advice i would have for myself at that age is to not worry about it and just put all your effort into the grade that you are in don't be afraid to dream because if you are willing to put in the sweat anything is possible and about occupations listen to your heart even when i was a junior in high school i kept on trying to listen to my parents and become a doctor but now i'm going to follow my heart and pursue a career in journalism and i'll see where that takes me be happy that you still have time to be a kid i'm sure you are like i was and are way mature beyond your years just take a deep breath and find comfort in the fact that you have your whole life ahead of you and that you are already in the right direction by thinking about your future get good grades and read a lot but don't forget to laugh and love and enjoy everyday good luck Avenue Q Milton H.
