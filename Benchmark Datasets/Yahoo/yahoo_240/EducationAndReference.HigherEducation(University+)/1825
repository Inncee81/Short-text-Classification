senior year i heard its ok to slack off during senior year after college admissions applications as long as you don't get c's or d's will taking extra ap's during senior year help me much in college admissions or am i wasting my energy for a lost cause taking at least a few aps during your senior year will help you with college admissions and slacking off could hurt if you have been making straight a's all through high school the college will notice in the end if you start pulling in a lot of bs during the last semester really it will depends on what college you are attending but if you are attending a really prestigious university you will not want your performance to drop at all at a less prestigious school you might be able to get by if you get a lot of bs but if you get any scholarships you could lose them due to bad or mediocre performance in your classes but since you are bothering to take ap classes you might as well make the most of your work and take all the ap exams seriously it kind of feels pointless to take ap classes and do a lot of work for them without getting any credit for it so keep continuing to work hard during your second semester of the year Education in the United States Juris Doctor Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in Romania Education in Taiwan Education in Australia Community college High school Grade (education) Affirmative action Education in Portugal College admissions Academic term Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Physician Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Advanced Placement Program Lawyer Brown University SAT Hunter College High School Texas A&M University Middle Tennessee State University Education in Hong Kong Princeton University Franklin W.
