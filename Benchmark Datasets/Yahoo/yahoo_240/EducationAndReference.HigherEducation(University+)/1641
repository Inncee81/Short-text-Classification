is going to summer school going to ruin my chances for college i am currently re taking a semester course because i failed it and well i've been doing really well i have an a in the class and my last day is thursday but i'm just wondering will this affect my chances for college acceptance i mean will this show up on my transcript even though i did a lot better do you think colleges will deny me now i am a very good student i just sort of slipped up this one time please someone respond i am so worried because i'm gonna be a senior and i want to get into a good college thanks it really depends on your school and their policy on these retake courses most likely the new grade will replace the old one in that case you should be fine because your transcript should only show the new grade again you need to check with your school to be sure what will show up on your transcript Grade (education) Graduate school Education in Romania Education in Germany Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy A-level Education in the United States Juris Doctor Franklin W.
