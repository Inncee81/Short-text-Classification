transfer student public vs private universities letters of recommendation i've noticed that it's mostly the private schools that want letters of recommendation for transfer students why is this i'm a straight a student and i write good essays what purpose is a letter of rec going to serve why don't most public universities want them you are correct to make this observation the reason many but by no means all public universities do not require letters of recommendation is because they have a state mandate to educate in state students beyond a year community college and in many cases are set up to take in transfers from state community colleges they have in general but not in all cases lower standards of admission for all students the reason most private colleges want letters of recommendation is because it is entirely up to them whether or not to admit a transfer student and they have no way of knowing the standards to which each student was held at their previous college letters from reputable scholars in the field are very helpful to private colleges as they can be relied upon to inform the admissions committees about the level of work to which this student is capable of rising as a matter of fact some private institutions accept no transfers whatsoever princeton for example Education in the United States Graduate school SAT GED Juris Doctor College admissions Affirmative action Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Community college Education in Portugal Law school Ivy League Grade (education) Education in Australia High school Medical school Education in Malaysia College Equal Protection Clause Appeal Trinity College, Dublin Private school Physician Higher education in Japan College and university rankings Harvard University City and Guilds of London Institute Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement A-level University of Bristol Academia Public education Associate's degree Master's degree Law School Admissions Test California State University Education in England School accreditation Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Homeschooling Administrative law of the United States Statutory college Education in Germany United States Postal Service Motion picture rating system Numerus clausus Cornell University Education in India Redundant array of independent disks Intelligent design movement Homosexuality and Judaism PNG Middle Tennessee State University Education University Student loan University of Alabama Teach the Controversy Culture of the United States Independent school (UK) Education in Romania Professor Lawyer Public domain Vanderbilt University Boarding school Supply and demand Secondary education in Japan Bilkent University Unicode Students' union Scientology beliefs and practices Johns Hopkins University IB Diploma Programme Test (student assessment) Doctorate Israeli Arab Boston College Texas Woman's University Graduate Record Examination Coeducation Teacher First Amendment to the United States Constitution Regents of the University of California v.
