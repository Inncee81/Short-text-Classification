question about ph d degree i think i'd like a ph d in african american history or literature but my master's degree is in bilingual communication can i still earn a ph d in a totally different field i'd say that it's up to you to show the folks running the ph d program that you've got the background to hack it after all many ph d programs take students in after undergrad i e with no master's degree in between not sure what your languages are but if you can make the argument that your master's is relevant to potential doctoral thesis work and it very well could be given your interests then that master's degree might be a strong asset think of your job here as a little bit of marketing figuring out how your background helps in preparing you to meet the goals associated with a ph d program of course since you already have your master's you know the importance of personal contact before applying i'd spend some time contacting potential doctoral advisors and talking over possibilities with them getting one or more of them on your side can be critical to getting into a graduate program i say do some prep work on this above and go for it good luck sounds like the beginnings of a potentially very interesting career Graduate school Juris Doctor Master's degree Doctor of Philosophy Lawyer Education in Australia Thesis Paralegal Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Portugal Professor Software engineering Plame affair Logic Academia University of Central Florida Academic degree Social rule Rabbi Master of Laws Second language acquisition NHH Keynesian economics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Hacker Doctorate Education in Taiwan Economic inequality Master of Business Administration Electrical engineering Undergrads Education in Germany Medical school University of Ottawa Marshall Plan Mathematics Social psychology Physician Esperanto as an international language Ludwig Wittgenstein Multilingual Franz Boas Bogdanov Affair Drew University Neuro-linguistic programming School counselor GED A New Kind of Science Theory of conduct Privatization Physical therapy Librarian University of Texas at San Antonio University of Hawaii at Manoa Baseball Nurse No Child Left Behind Act Hispanic Supply-side economics Education in Finland Regent University Asperger syndrome Professional Master's degree Martin Heidegger University of Alabama Bologna process Law school Affirmative action MTV Advanced Placement Program Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Memorial University of Newfoundland Bilkent University Education in Austria Pharmacist Christian Brothers University Harvard Division of Continuing Education University of Maryland Baltimore County University of Judaism Philosophy Beijing Institute of Technology Kingston University George Lakoff G__del's incompleteness theorem York University University of Notre Dame UCLA School of Theater Film and Television Honorary degree Ontological argument Warren Buffett Community college Parapsychology Probation officer Education in Hong Kong Year 2000 problem Jewish studies Law School Admissions Test Education Extreme Programming
