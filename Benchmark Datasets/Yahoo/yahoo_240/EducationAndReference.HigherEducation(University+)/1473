college smarts vs non college smarts there are some people that don't haven't gone to college yet claim to be intelligent in the same way there are those that do have gone to college yet they're still doing their dead end job do u know any two people in these situations which of the two has more smarts it has been my experience that people who fall into the non college smarts generally end up being more intelligent than the college smarts people because the non college smart people tend to be involved in the most practical areas of the workforce they're either in areas of business or areas of health or areas of operations and so on areas that call for their demand granted they can't in turn demand much without a degree but at least they have a constant job that pays decently for example i know one person who never went to college but instead started his own successful business that caters to installing home entertainment systems for average to rich people and he's been making some pretty good money out of it see how he found a practical demand out there that he filled the need for conversely i have not one not two but three college friends that come to mind who by picking some of the most inane majors for their degrees are constantly experiencing the headache of either not finding work or being in a career that doesn't end up paying good i mean come on with an anthopological studies degree which one friend had or an english literature degree which another friend had or a psychology degree which the other friend had you're just asking to have a harder time in your career due to the inherent impracticality of these degrees sure there is a demand somewhere for these degrees but i would imagine that it's limited and already oversaturated with all the other graduates out there with these degrees these are prime examples of how some very smart people most of them honors grads too ended up picking not so very smart paths in their life and will more than likely end up falling into the ratio of college grads being in a completely different career years after they've graduated but of course there are also college smart people who picked very practical degrees such as in business or in accounting or in medicine or in engineering and so forth i recently graduated with a major in finance that would be the best imo position for one person to be in to be both smart and intelligent enough to have a college degree that puts the person in great demand Graduate school Unemployment Psychology College Outsourcing Education in the United States Chinese University of Hong Kong Health insurance Paralegal Affirmative action Surveillance Economics Normal distribution Capital accumulation Anti-intellectualism Education in Portugal Academia Intelligence quotient Juris Doctor University of Central Florida Infantilism Motivation Social rule Capitalism Inflation City and Guilds of London Institute Economic inequality Supply and demand Education in the People's Republic of China Master's degree Medical school Theory of conduct Keynesian economics General practitioner W.
