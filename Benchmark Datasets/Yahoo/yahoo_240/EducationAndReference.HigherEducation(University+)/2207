what is the best course to take in college considering the pay and availability of the job personally i would decide first what i really love to do now and what occupations could involve me in that even if what you love to shoot baskets but cannot possibly play in the nba you can find many other occupations that will keep you active and close to basketball the problem with going after the money careers is that you can go all through college and maybe grad school only discover that you can't stand your new job its happened with lawyers and doctors and other high paid professionals i have personally seen how broken these people become who did that personally i picked out an extremely hard career to get into but not for the money and dispite many many people thinking i would never make it into the career i did because i loved what made up the career not the money i would earn if you are motivated and know what you love about a particular career you can make the choice by yourself and the money will follow as has been said do yourself a favor and follow your heart Basketball NBA Finals Graduate school New York Knicks Steve Nash Pitaten Continental Basketball Association Michael Jordan One Tree Hill (TV series) Unemployment Karl Malone National Basketball Association Saved by the Bell Freeters Luther Head Yao Ming Julius Erving Education in the United States Rasheed Wallace Larry Bird National Football League Emanuel Gin__bili Surveillance Economics Playoff Salary cap Education in the People's Republic of China College basketball The Apprentice 2 Mutual fund Jerry Lucas Toronto Raptors Philip J.
