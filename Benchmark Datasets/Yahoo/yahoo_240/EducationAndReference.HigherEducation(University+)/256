sorority yay or nay if i have the opportunity should i do you have to live in the sorority house i live off campus now i want to make friends and be part of the college activities i'm a freshman this year i feel like i'll have a difficult time meeting friends because i won't be living in a dorm not sure about living in a house though either any thoughts from anyone with experience joining a sorority is a personal choice and it isn't for everyone however there are wonderful advantages to sorority membership my best friends are my sorority sisters and i would be lost with out them through my sorority i was able to get involved with many other organizations on campus as well as student government i have sisters who i can call at anytime to go see a movie hang out etc sorority membership is also a wonderful way to get involved in your local community through philanthropic projects etc if you do join you are usually not required to live in the house it is different at every school you will definitely not be able to live in the house until you have been initiated but most likely until you are at least a sophomore you can get involved on campus and make friends without being in a sorority but if it is something you really want to do i would go for it find out when recruitment week is get your application in and have fun recruitment week alone is a great way to meet people give it a try and let me know if you have any more questions good luck Fraternities and sororities Alpha Phi North-American Interfraternity Conference Brown University Rice University University of Alabama Georgia Institute of Technology Case Western Reserve University New York University Carnegie Mellon University Franklin W.
