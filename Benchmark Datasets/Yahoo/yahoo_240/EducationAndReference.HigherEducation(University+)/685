your opinion please do you think i could get into campbell university i want to become a pharmacist eventually i took the sat for the first time in june and made a without any preparation i know this is considered low but at campbell a scholarship is offered for a score of i plan to take it again in october i am number out of at the end of my junior year i have a cumulative unweighted gpa and a cumulative weighted gpa of i am a member of the national beta club and the national honor society i do volunteer work and ran cross country in th grade also i plan to join more clubs in senior year and do more extracurriculars thanks for all the help it sounds like you have a good chance of attending campbell the sat is just one test and their is a lot of evidence to suggest that it is one of the worst indicators for schools to ascertain your abilities as a student harvard university has discounted the weight they lend the sats as a result and i am confident other schools have probably followed suit the high gpa national honor society and school activities are impressive to schools pharmacy is a great field to pursue and let me wish you luck pharmacy students are hard working intelligent and dedicated as long as you are willing to commit to that type of life while in school then i would say campbell or any other pharmacy school would like to have you as a student SAT Grade (education) Education in the United States Law school New Trier High School Graduate school Education in Germany Dr. Michael M.
