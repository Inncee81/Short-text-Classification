whats happening in your body when a body part starts to twitch i always get these random twitches everywhere mostly in my eye but also my arms and legs i was just wondering whats happening in your body to make you twitch twitches occur in your muscles when the neurons over fire each nerve in our bodies is made up of bundles of neurons that all combine together to make the nerve fiber each neuron has a different firing time in other words the neuron cannot fire again until the chemicals have returned to their normal balance when these neurons become over stimulated or over fire it is often caused by stress which causes the neurons to over produce the neuro transmitters dopamine acytecholine which causes a specific muscle to continue firing so you feel a twitch it's harmless but can be annoying Muscle Action potential Brain Post Polio syndrome Multiple sclerosis Motor neurone disease Eye Proprioception Cerebellum Muscle contraction Neurotransmitter Cardiac pacemaker Nerve agent Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Clinical depression Electromyography Puberty Pain Parkinson's disease Synapse Dualism (philosophy of mind) Neuron Cancer Drug addiction Acetylcholine Diabetic neuropathy Motoneuron Reticular formation Myasthenia gravis Corticospinal tract Poliomyelitis Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Cephalic disorder Benign fasciculation syndrome Stem cell Weight training Peripheral nervous system Retina Cocaine Epilepsy Local anesthesia Urination Urinary incontinence Axon Cognitive science Sleep Tetany Caffeine Primary motor cortex Duchenne muscular dystrophy Fecal incontinence Methamphetamine John Carew Eccles 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Human brain Histamine Cerebral cortex Cell growth Rat Park Neuro-linguistic programming Human adaptation to space Facial nerve Signal transduction Autism Mikhail Lebedev Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Reflexology Long-term potentiation Raphe nuclei Enzyme Neuro cybernetics Dopamine Arm Insulin Electroconvulsive therapy History of brain imaging Magnetic resonance imaging Schizophrenia Massage Dyspraxia Chemotherapy Acupuncture Trigeminal nerve Adrenal gland Spinal cord Hypoglycemia Membrane potential Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Narcolepsy Heart Balance disorder Humerus Cardiac cycle Chemosensor
