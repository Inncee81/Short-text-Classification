where did the phrase skinny dipping come from i just don't get it here is one explanation the term skinny dipping originated in the s when soda jerks the guys who scooped the ice cream at the soda fountains skimped on the size of the scoops of ice cream by cleverly creating a hollow air hole inside of the ball of frozen confection thus creating the illusion of massive scoops of ice cream while actually conserving product thereby raising profits when the customers discovered that their large scoops of ice cream were filled with air and not the ice cream that they had paid for they gathered an angry mob and waited for the soda jerk to get off of work grabbed him stripped him buck naked and threw him in the town fountain or lake or river as available and here is another originally this term did not refer to young people swimming au naturel in the local creek if you were a british sailor on a man 'o war you would refer to shallow water as skinny water and you must remember that the british don't swim they go for a dip there were no bathing suits in the 's and on remote tropical islands there was no need for them and so the sailors traditionally went swimming in shallow water in the buff and so today the only thing that is generally remembered about it is that the sailors were swimming naked nowadays we use the term to indicate nede swimming but originally the term skinny dipping refered to the depth of the water not the lack of clothing personally i am not sure that either explanation is correct but Ice cream Sento Soft drink Swimming pool Nudity Drowning Swimming Skinny dipping Fishing Bathing Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 5) Diving Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon Nudism Sundae Tea Water polo Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Scuba set Death Valley National Park Sherbet The Apprentice 2 Skinny Dip Humphrey Bogart Hazing Confectionery Joke Bob and George Customs and etiquette of Japan Carbon dioxide Spidey Super Stories Dairy Buckingham Palace Robot Master Tag Root beer float Milkshake Futurama (TV series - season 4) Japanese cuisine Fountain pen Fountain Little Britain Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Lake Burley Griffin Rebreather Baptism Japanese toilet Shaggy dog story Seabird Bulk vending Solar power Niagara Falls Sauna 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Cloud Casting Ice cream van Ice hockey Pie Glacier Antarctic krill Air Florida Flight 90 Kirby's Adventure Francisco Hern__ndez de C__rdoba (discoverer of Yucat__n) Smelt Cuisine of Denmark Equine conformation Ice Rum Items in the Metroid series Sodium carbonate Spanking Breakfast Desert Coffee Oreo Geology of the Grand Canyon area Ice core Autonomous building Bad Wolf Cuisine of the Philippines Daria Severe weather terminology (United States) Cream (food) Vending machine Magic (illusion) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Geography of Ireland Tokusatsu Ice age Mineral County, West Virginia Body piercing Toa
