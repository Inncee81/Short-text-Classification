how come some turds float and some turds sink it's like with any mass suspended in a fluid if the mass is less dense than the fluid it floats if it's not it sinks ice is slightly less dense than water quick proof it expands when it freezes which is why it floats slightly above the surface but the bulk is below the surface so dense fecal matter has a higher specific gravity than water this is a resultant of the foods consumed and what your body chose not to use Water Water (molecule) Thermohaline circulation Sea ice Density Feces Ice Carbon dioxide Tide Titan (moon) Convection Heat Buoyancy Ocean thermal energy conversion Fluid statics Sewage treatment Gravity Enceladus (moon) Erosion Antarctic krill Moon Bong Cloud Neutrino Solar system Hydropower Fishing Human brain Vacuum Terraforming Autonomous building Sun Brain Lake Divergence theorem Archimedes Star Trek planet classifications Flood geology Hydrogeology Sea level rise Robot Master Relative density Rocket fuel Fluid pressure Terminal ballistics Tofu Ecology Space colonization Helium Fecal incontinence Europa (moon) Roche limit Intravenous therapy Floater Valles Marineris Ice rink Jet engine Buoyancy compensator Mesothelioma Car handling Glacier Soft drink Plate tectonics Sperm Whale Gliding Energy Siphon Quicksand Temperature Sediment Isostasy Planetary habitability Comet Vortex Blood (computer game) Great Lakes Structure of the Earth Physics Solar power Weightlessness Diatom Hydrochloric acid Hydrogen sulfide Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Hydroponics Coriolis effect Luminiferous aether Big Bang Entropy Iceberg Pressure Drowning Iron Geology of the Moon Physical geodesy Sea level Scuba set Soap bubble Lunar Prospector Center of mass
