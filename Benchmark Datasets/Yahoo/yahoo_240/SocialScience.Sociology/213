what is wrong with me i'm young and shouldn't i feel happier i m a college student yrs old and i dont do anything i went to college hours away when i come home my friends here don t make an effort to hang out we keep in touch it's not the same they re all busy with their own lives we ll grab lunch or something but it s not like we re in each other s present lives in high school i was more social then college i don t have a group of friends the only true friend i have is my boyfriend for a year and a half college i have acquaintances not any true friends i come home for a weekend and do nothing social at college i do the same thing other than class i ve joined student clubs and made acquaintances and that's all my family is the same way they used to be involved in my life but now they are all obsessed with my year old sister i don t want to stay in my hometown forever living in the past i wanna move to a city but i just feel like something is missing in my life is this just growing up what should i do this is just growing up yet it's more complicated than that in high school there are so many social support systems that are taken for granted in college you're in class hours per week with nearly all different people also the focus in college isn't really social in the same way as high school if you're going to develop friends you have to do it all on your own everyone is equal in college no popularity really exists and if it does it seems immature for the 'popular' to be concerned about such a status as for your sister well she is only receiving the attention that you already received from here on out in your life you will give much much more than you receive it's adulthood Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Kodocha Friendship Hikikomori EastEnders Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) College The O.C.
