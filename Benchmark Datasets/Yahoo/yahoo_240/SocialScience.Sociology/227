for you what does racism mean does it affect your daily life or are you just trying to sit on the politically correct band wagon of society wow a real question i hope you won't be sorry that i saw it yes racism does effect me every minute of my life i am shocked when people imply that they don't feel racism exist it's still here mostly especially in the us it is so 'undercover' that if you are not paying attention you might miss it but don't be fooled there will always be an 'underclass' i know that's not a good word but it is the only one i can use to discribe what i see whether they are black or poor or other races or homosexuals or prisoners convicts or whatever discrimination racism they both speak to the same problem worst yet is when we know what is being said or done is wrong but we do nothing like it doesn't effect us the next time it just might it was the law order episode about a teen who drinks herself to death at a party hosted by other teans all the kids did everybody else at the part including the host was clean up the house they were in tresspassing and lay the girl on the bed no one tried to call or even to call the girl's family or to take her home nothing my daughters thought that since no one 'forced' the girl to drink that no one should be held responsible or accountable my response was 'inaction is an action' and if we are not held responsible for our inaction especially when it 'does harm' we may as well go back to the dark ages now some might think that might not be such a bad idea but it really is because as bad as we think it is now it would be worst if we didn't have the safeguards that are in place but are not being adhered to in many cases i think we stopped wanting to be 'our brother's keeper' we should care about each other and 'the whole planet of earth' as a people instead of allowing our differences in beliefs or languages to stop us from wanting to do what's right for all this quote continues to come to my mind because everyday i see that it is so very true and we need to all start paying attention to it 'all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing ' i'm so guilty of the doing nothing when others are making jokes about groups of people i laugh i don't speak up and say 'no i can't participate in that' i thnk it's funny why not laugh because i wouldn't like it if something like that was being said about me because in most cases the thing being said isn't true or what's being done is wrong because it's not right and by doing nothing except laughing i am encouraging others to continue this wrong behavior it seems like a small thing but it's a place to start to be more socially conscience you we start and the rest will follow Theory of conduct Social rule Evil Reparations for slavery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goodness and value theory Whose Line Is It Anyway?
