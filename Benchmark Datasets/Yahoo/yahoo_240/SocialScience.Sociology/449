why are teens so obsessed with partying i'm and almost everyone my age is all about going to parties and getting wasted i've tried this for a few years off and on and its not me its a little overrated and i'd prefer a more mature gathering i know a lot of people say these are the years to have your fun blah blah but its not me so what is the obsession with getting hammered every single night i think it has as much to do with peer pressure as with rebellion you know the 'all my friends are doing it' thing you admit that you tried the party and getting wasted scene so you too may have fallen into the peer pressure cycle fortunately for you you seem to have matured faster and beyond your friends you realize there is more to life than waking up the next day and wondering where you are how you got there or what you did the night before i do not understand how or why people drink in excess i prefer to be in control of myself and the situation kudos to you for growing up and realizing it find some friends that prefer more mature socializing and you may even find a few of your old partying buddies glad that you are giving them an excuse not to get plastered every night The Catcher in the Rye Asperger syndrome Alcoholics Anonymous About a Boy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Nicomachean Ethics Paranoia Agent Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 2) Iggy Pop Pitaten Jon Secada Narcolepsy Menstrual cycle Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Social rule Nerd Friends Goth Dilbert Little Britain Dawson's Creek One Tree Hill (TV series) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie W.I.T.C.H.
