used and emotionally abused why aren't i worthy it's rlly long but please help me i was severely depressed a month and a half ago i let myself get sexually taken advantage by my boyfriend and than i broke up with him but to make it worst begged him to take me back he of course did not because he was never serious about me than there was my ex ex boyfriend the one before this one we went out very beriefly but things ended rather abruptly so i called him years later to find some sort of closure he agreed to meet up with me we had our first kiss together that night it was amazing i text him a couple of days later i wish i kissed you longer and he text back ' yea it was good and than text again i wish it was longer now today he text me if i wanted to hang out and i said sure but i have an early curfew but he never got back to me all day he is leaving for college tomorrow i guess i was just a booty call in all honesty i felt like he was the love of my life i never stopped caring loving for him i know its crazy but i felt like he was the one so realizing that i was just a booty call to him made me feel so stupid especially considering i loved him i am going back into the severe depression state again i know because i feel so unloved and unworthy of anyones love i never had anyone love me before i've always been single my whole life i have been way too patient where is the happiness they say all bad thing end in happiness i have yet to see it i've only had two boyfriends in my life and i am this is what they've done to me i don't have much friends either they are twofaced and no one cares enough to call my parents well i never hear i love you from them maybe every years or so they'd say it once i feel so alone i don't know what to do every guy that ever showed interest turned out to only want sex i am so sick of it i always give my all in relationships i show love i buy gifts cook surprise write sweet things what is wrong with me happiness true happiness like the kind i believe you seek can only come from one place within a mistake a lot of people make is they become what i like to call externally motivated meaning they look outside at other people's lives to determine what should run their own the happiest people in the world the ones who are natural and social and even successful in life are internally motivated they have set core beliefs that are unshakable there's so much philosophy that goes into this answer but the nuts and bolts of it is this the only one that can determine how much you are worth is you your thoughts and opinions about yourself show and other people pick up on that you have to love yourself and know you determine your value imagine this for me really for you if you lived a dream life what would be in it who would be in it look passed your current house your current status and use your imagination how would your ideal man see you do this with everything you see and you will begin to love your surroundings and most importantly you will find the deepest kind of love for yourself One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Kodocha Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Past teachings of Prem Rawat About a Boy Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.
