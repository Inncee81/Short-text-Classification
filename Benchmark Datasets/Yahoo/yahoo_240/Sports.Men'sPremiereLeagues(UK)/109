tottenham strikers with drogba most likely out for tommorow's game my fantasy team has a big hole up top i threw in martins from newcastle but i think i'm better off using a tottenham striker as a replacement as they are playing sunderland the problem is i don't know which are going to start berbatov bent keane defoe and even mido could start but i need to know which one of them is definetly starting or is martins a better choice than all of them or is there even a better choice out there and don't say rooney i dont want him i already have van persie and howard from derby tottenham havent ptoved there a good team yet so i think sunderland will pull it off trust me Alex Ferguson England national football team The Football League Coventry City F.C. 2004-05 in English football Teddy Sheringham Torquay United F.C.
