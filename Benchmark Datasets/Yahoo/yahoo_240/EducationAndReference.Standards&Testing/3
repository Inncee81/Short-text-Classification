did you study for the act or was studying for the sat enough to do well on the act also putting into consideration that the act is graded diffrently and that there is a scienceportion does everyone typically do better on that will i do okay on the science part if im taking ap bio and chem also would ucs gladly accept only the act also please tell me what you got on both and what you thought of each of them thanks i guess ill just stick with the sat because of satii subject tests i know where you're coming from because i did essentially what you're asking about i prepared heavily for the sat tutors and the whole nine yards and took it once i got a and decided to get out while i was ahead i reluctantly signed up for the act after much persuasion and took it cold i got a composite which is good but in retrospect i could have prepared better for the act on the act i got a on reading and a on math which shows where the preparation for the sat came in handy but i got a on science and a on writing both of which were different from anything on the sat i should have and could have prepared for these sections which would have improved my score in the end they are different tests which require different skills so if you plan on taking both i recommend you prepare for both even if your primary focus is the sat SAT GED Graduate school College admissions Advanced Placement Program No Child Left Behind Act Graduate Record Examination Education in the People's Republic of China Test (student assessment) Law School Admissions Test Homeschooling The Princeton Review Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the United States A-level Extreme Programming Education in Romania Sex and intelligence Grade (education) Master's degree Psychology Education in Taiwan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Royal Assent Scientific method Contract College Board Education in Singapore IBM PC compatible Charles Darwin's education Education in England Education Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination High school Welding Education in Hong Kong Education reform Intelligence quotient Publication of Darwin's theory Japanese tea ceremony Baseball Deconstruction Secondary education in France Baccalaur__at John Cage Durham University Act of Parliament Heinkel He 100 Tripartite System Apollo 8 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Computer and video game genres Milton H.
