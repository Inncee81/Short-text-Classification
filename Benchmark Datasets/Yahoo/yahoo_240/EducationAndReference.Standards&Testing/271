i took my first act practice test should i register for the real one hi i am going to be a high school senior i decided to take an act practice test to see if i would get a high score but i am unfamiliar with the scoring and what is considered high or not english math reading science ran out of time for last questions but if i didn't it would be average writing composite can range from to since there's no one definite score for the essay is this considered high i really want to get into columbia university but my sat score isn't high enough based on this practice test will my act score be higher than my sat score i'm retaking sat in october thank you i took the downloadable sample test from their website act org your act score will be higher of course i don't know if the fact that you weren't practicing on a real act might have made your score so high i have found when i have done practice tests that sometimes my practice test scores are a lot higher or a lot lower than they would be when i was taking the real test that's probably because someone other than the act writers made the practice test but i think it is certainly worth giving the act a shot if your scores are that high a composite score might be in the range of sat scores the middle of the act composite scores for columbia are SAT College admissions Test (student assessment) Intelligence quotient Education in Romania Education in the United States Graduate Record Examination Grade (education) Quizbowl Supreme Court of the United States United States Academic Decathlon Education in Taiwan Batting average Video game music National Certificate of Educational Achievement Turing machine Medical College Admission Test Appeal Doomsday argument Logan, Utah The Princeton Review Ra (board game) Clarinet ELO rating system Extreme Programming Blonde on Blonde Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Theory of conduct Hearts (game) W.
