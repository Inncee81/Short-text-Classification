where do i get good practice for lsat i was thinking about getting the help books at princeton review and kaplan but i wanted to know if there are better ways to practice i plan on taking the test in september of next year and plan on spending this year planning for it any additional advice would be helpful thanks i actually think taking a prep course is the most efficient way to prepare the main benefits of a class are that a they lay out the strategies for you so you don't have to figure them out on your own you also have a source to go to when you have questions or need help b they provide plenty of study material and that material is directed in a particular way c they structure your preparation in a way that self studying cannot d you meet other people in the same position you are in and it helps to have friends who can motivate you to study the best known classes are probably kaplan princeton review and powerscore do the classes help like a lot of things part of it hinges on whether you put the time in i took powerscore and i ended up scoring well i do know that i worked pretty hard though i also feel that i would have spent a lot more time trying to self study because the course organized things in a way that made sense had i been studying on my own it would have taken longer to arrive at some of the insights i needed to do well if you decide to study on your own which you should definitely do over the next year and before possibly taking the course next year then these were the best books i used and all three use real questions powerscore logic games bible powerscore logical reasoning bible kaplan lsat you will need to practice what you are learning so get actual tests from law services the people who make the test the next actual official lsat preptests more actual official lsat preptests actual official lsat preptests lsat prep tests individually numbered if you work through the first three books you would be in pretty good shape in terms of strategies and then do a ton of the tests from the second group of books after that the following books give explanations for test questions lsat superprep get prepped lsat explained powerscore games setup guide the decision to take a course after self studying probably will rest on how well you are scoring if you are doing well then skip the course if not then maybe a course can get you over that final hurdle i'd play it by ear and see how the self study goes first good luck Law School Admissions Test SAT The Princeton Review Kaplan Logic Game theory Causality Theory of conduct Strategic management Science Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles GED Medical College Admission Test Legal research Religious Society of Friends Economics Biblical inerrancy Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Education in the United States Dog agility Second language acquisition Philosophy of language Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The nature of God in Western theology Avenue Q Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theodicy Infinity Expert system Scientific method Social rule Cognitive science ELO rating system Intelligent design Pseudoscience Capitalism Creationism Altruism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Education in Romania Social psychology Law of value Theology Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Many-worlds interpretation Information Services Procurement Library Unidentified flying object Consensus decision-making Intelligent design movement Law school Strap-on dildo Current teachings of Prem Rawat Phillip E.
