as a junior i'm in ap calculus what math course could i take next year i took ap calc ab as a junior and then did ap calc bc as a senior that's the path i would suggest you to take if your school doesn't offer any higher level math courses my school offered a differential equations class and a linear algebra class one of these or a multivariable multivariate vector calculus class would be the next class to take preferably you'd do the diffeqs or the multivariable vector calc option if you don't have any options to take a higher level math class in high school and only one level ap calc ab or ap calc bc is offered at your high school see if there is anything else you can take at a local university as a community college may not offer everything you need but if you take ap calc ab you should be able to get the next course the calculus course there whether you can take the college level math classes might depend on your ap exam score though if you never intend to take any more college level math after you finish ap calculus during the junior year and if you pass your ap exam you could do ap statistics during the senior year and not be harmed by it Advanced Placement Program Education in Taiwan Education in the United States Calculus Grade (education) High school Mathematics Education in Romania SAT Jaime Escalante Polynomial Junior Certificate Stuyvesant High School Physician Secondary education in the United States Graduate school Clements High School Community college Ordinary differential equation Education in Australia Hunter College High School Tangent space Derivative (generalizations) Tensor field Linear algebra Education in the People's Republic of China Stochastic process Tensor GED Multivariate normal distribution William Rowan Hamilton Hopkins School General relativity Differential geometry and topology Education in Singapore Juris Doctor Function (mathematics) A-level General Certificate of Secondary Education Education in Hong Kong Derivative Education in Germany Determinant Lynbrook High School Victoria University of Manchester Troy High School College Distribution (mathematics) Princeton University Kernel (algebra) Student National Certificate of Educational Achievement Test (student assessment) Finite element method Differential form Professor Operator Mathematics education Dynamical system Microeconomics Clifford algebra Albany High School, Georgia Quizbowl Smith College TI-89 series Differential geometry of curves Vector (spatial) Education in Portugal Education in Austria Cooper Union University of Houston Law school Matrix (mathematics) Product rule Vector field Philosophy, Politics and Economics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Associate's degree Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in France Numerical analysis Del Self-adjoint operator Regents (Examinations) Exterior algebra Turkish education system Covariance and contravariance Integral Oliver Heaviside Education in the Republic of Ireland Electromagnetic radiation Algebra XSL attack NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Student loan North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics
