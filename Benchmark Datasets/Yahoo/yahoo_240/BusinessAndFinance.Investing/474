if dollar cost averaging is a good idea to buy is it a bad idea to sell if the buyer gains the person who regularly sells say k month of some mutual fund stock is probably doing the wrong thing perhaps he should be selling a fixed amount of shares units rather than dollars per month please help it's not strictly a zero sum game but on the other hand despite the other answer above it does not work to your advantage when selling most of the advantage of dollar cost averaging when buying is that when the price is low you buy more shares and when the price is high you buy less the matches up well with the classic buy low paradigm that everyone wants to do when you're selling if you sell a constant amount of dollars worth like you do when dollar cost averaging then you are selling more shares when the price is low and selling less when the price is high which is the opposite of what you should be doing anyway as a pragmatic issue it is easier to put in a sell order for shares then to sell for exactly dollars you can't actually do the latter the better idea is to have a pool of your money in cash or short term equivalents like money markets take your monthly cash disbursement out of that replenish it by selling shares when you judge them to be fairly priced or better Arbitrage Monetary policy Bond Mortgage Supply and demand Inflation Economics Short selling Stock Gross domestic product PE ratio Day trading MMORPG Deflation (economics) Money supply Mergers and acquisitions Commodity Hyperinflation Stock market Rational pricing Dividend Financial markets Enron Corporation Annuity Keynesian economics Price discrimination Closed-end fund Capitalism Poker jargon Margin (finance) Security (finance) Bretton Woods system FairTax Insurance Wal-Mart Gold as an investment Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Illegal drug trade Exchange-traded fund Futures contract Privatization Gold standard Surplus value Life insurance Temasek Holdings Islamic banking $ale of the Century Hedge fund Income trust Dot-com United States dollar American individualist anarchism SCO-Linux controversies Money Citigroup Prices of production Liberty Dollar Bank Bulk vending Internet fraud Labor theory of value Pound sterling Goodness and value theory Fiat money Asian financial crisis Corporate finance Monopoly (game) Supply-side economics Euro Gambling Canadian dollar Exchange value Public transport Call option Predatory lending Debt Law of value Finance Wealth U.S. public debt Arthur Laffer Equity investment RuneScape economy Intellectual property Price Exchange rate The Apprentice 2 Publicly funded medicine Trade
