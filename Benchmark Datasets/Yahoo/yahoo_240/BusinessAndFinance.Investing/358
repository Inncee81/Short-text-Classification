is zecco com any good for trading now i know that they offer free commissions for people who trade less than day month like myself i was just wondering if any one could give me feedback on how the site has been for them is there anything i should know about ie hidden fees bad customer service etc that i should know about before i get involved with zecco the primary reason i am interesting in zecco is due to the fact that i want to start investing and i dont have much money to invest about k so i am looking for a brokerage where commission fees are very cheap and don't cut too much in any profit taking thanks barrons did an article last november called what free trading costs i'll put the link here but you'll probably need a subscription to see it the upshot is that they pay you interest on your cash balances their execution may be slower if you keep in cash on average the lost interest since rates right now are about will be year if your cash balance is higher you get hit worse just make sure that the lost interest is not greater than what your commissions would be Mutual fund Citigroup Short selling Mergers and acquisitions Cable television Credit card Bond Insurance Warren Buffett Investment bank Deflation (economics) Ponzi scheme Finance Tariff Life insurance Microeconomics Bank MMORPG Corporate finance PE ratio Interest Security (finance) Eliot Spitzer Free trade Wal-Mart Hyperinflation Charles Ponzi 401(k) Virgin Mobile Monetary policy Keynesian economics Student loan FairTax Financial services Capitalism Stock Mortgage Variable universal life insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Derivative (finance) Rational pricing Annuity Debt Internet fraud E-mail spam Software patent debate Stock broker Poker jargon Economy of India Ra (board game) Labor theory of value Slot machine Reaganomics Gold standard Broadband Internet access Economy of Russia Islamic banking Euro Flat tax Surplus value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security debate (United States) Predatory lending Economy of Africa United States Postal Service Primerica Financial Services National Football League Air New Zealand United Kingdom corporation tax Education in the People's Republic of China Day trading Micropayment Confidence trick Gambling Donald Trump Bank fraud Intellectual property Law of value Illegal drug trade Supply-side economics SCO-Linux controversies Gross domestic product Say's law Anarchism and capitalism Federal National Mortgage Association Blackjack Income trust Money Economy of the United States Investment Unemployment Personal finance Craps
