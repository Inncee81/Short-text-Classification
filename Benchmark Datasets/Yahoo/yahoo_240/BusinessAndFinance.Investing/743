is it illegal to invest a loan i know a professional forex trader who has been trading for years as his job i was thinking about taking out a line of credit and having him add it to his funds and be my trader he averages a day and takes a commission so i would make profit a month off the line of credit is this illegal there are clearly no legal issues for you you can do whatever you'd like with your money however there may be some legal issues for him he takes a commission sounds like he takes of the profits in order for him to take an incentive fee like that he would probably need to have a hedge fund structure that is he would have an investment vehicle that allows him to take your money if that's true he would need to make sure that you are an accredited investor that is satisfying the following a natural person who has individual net worth or joint net worth with the person s spouse that exceeds million at the time of the purchase a natural person with income exceeding in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year or a trust with assets in excess of million not formed to acquire the securities offered whose purchases a sophisticated person makes if you don't satisfy that he would need to jump through some real hoops to be able to collect that incentive fee and not run afoul of the rules given these issues i recommend that you spend some time talking to him as well as talking to an investment pro before you invest good luck New York Stock Exchange Stock market Short selling Wall Street Day trading Stock broker Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mutual fund Investment bank Foreign exchange market Citigroup Stock Real estate broker Warren Buffett Eliot Spitzer London Stock Exchange Wall Street (movie) Financial markets United Parcel Service Derivative (finance) Financial services Margin (finance) The Wall Street Journal Stock trader American Express Sanford I.
