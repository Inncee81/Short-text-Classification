getting a horse to move off leg i have had a horse that was basically just a pastur epet for about years we bought her last spring and our main focus has been gettin gher in shape now we are building an arena we just recently moved them to our house so we dont have an arena yet but she is going to start some retraining i have ridden her in horse camp and shes great i decided to try bridless riding the other day and i realized she doesnt move off the leg i have always used light rein pressure along with leg so how do i get her to move off my leg while riding she moves off the pressure on the ground but not under saddle ideas what you are doing sounds right you just need repitition daily you are training her to use a different cue for a response use a light snaffle in her mouth with a running martingale ask with your leg first this is important then if you get no response then use the rein to move her over she will eventually realize that the leg is your cue and that the punishment is the rein when i say punishment i'm not talking yanking on her mouth use the least amount of pressure on her mouth in order to get a horse to move completely off your leg you have to teach them starting in kindergarten as per say and moving up if you get resistance back down a grade does this make sense if you still get no response from the leg cue try english blunt spurs to grab her attention practice flexibility exercises asking he to bring her nose to your toe on each side and other drills if you would like more advice i'd be happy to help e mial me at lovesflyinhorses msn com s Horse tack Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Horse Cowboy Horse gait Bridle Drill bit Professional wrestling holds Seabiscuit Parade (military) Milton H.
