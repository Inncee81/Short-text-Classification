could this horse be trained to jump he is a year old non gaited tennessee walker in excellent condition he is hh and is hardly showing signs of aging the previous owner jumped him over logs and i have owned him for one year but haven't jumped him over anything my biggest concerns are his age and he has vision loss in one eye i've heard that horses can't jump the correct height without both eyes so what have you heard i wouldn't jump him high at all and i've been trained in jumping the highest i jumped was feet i just miss it alot what do you think his age isn't really an issue as long as you aren't talking about jumping him day in and day out a few jumps won't hurt him at all and he might really like it the thing about the vision loss is untrue my friend used to have a huge tb that was missing an eye not even in the socket vet had to remove it as a yearling because he got it caught on a bucket clasp and they took him over jumps bigger then feet and he loved it and won a lot of stuff for it too good luck p s make sure you wrap his legs and put on bell boots just in case Horse Equine conformation Professional wrestling attacks Piccolo Junior Saga Pittsburgh Steelers Horse gait Shaggy dog story Eventing Time Out of Mind Sin City Dog agility The Inside Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 High-heeled shoe Theory of conduct Kelly Clarkson Horseshoe Garfield Volleyball Tennessee Walker Paintball Social rule 1957 World Series Skateboarding trick Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pitaten Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Girls Aloud The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dressage Billboard Hot 100 Blood on the Tracks Items in the Metroid series Satchel Paige Hal Trosky The Death Gate Cycle Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Pump It Up Parkour Blonde on Blonde Neighbours Game show Show hunter High jump Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dragon Booster Conker's Bad Fur Day Naruto jutsu Love and Theft Non-native pronunciations of English Professional wrestling match types The Shining (film) Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Ben Johnson (athlete) Pok__mon Chronicles Poker jargon Hall & Oates Fox hunting Professional wrestling holds Lee Atwater Pole vault Parachuting Dr. No Spice Girls Spidey Super Stories Fanny Blankers-Koen Empire Burlesque New York Giants Cleveland Browns Compiler optimization Professional wrestling aerial techniques Stewie Griffin Peter Allen Captain Thunderbolt Plame affair Have I Got News For You Sunday Silence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Baseball Stars Ra (board game) Sly & the Family Stone The Dalek Invasion of Earth Spider Norway national football team Hip hop rivalries Hiberno-English Torquay United F.C.
