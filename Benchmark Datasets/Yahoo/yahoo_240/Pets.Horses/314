correct posting trot which video has the more correct posting trot for hunters how can i teach myself to move like that i know rise with the leg on the wall and do point and all that so just tell me how to move with my hips http www youtube com watch v g bjaae p w http www youtube com watch v twjocwanrjw http www youtube com watch v hu bqrzqyva if you have another video then that would help me a lot thank you all right this was a trick question i am disappointed with the answer the second one has the best posting trot she is with the movement of her horse and she is straight but angled a bit forward her legs are back and still look at the rider in this picture http horses about com od learntoride ht postthetrot htm see the angle of her back and the arc of her hip first of all you have to realize that different disciplines and even different judges different trainers etc have different ideas about how the posting trot should look in the first video she is showing in an english pleasure class most likely at a aqha breed show where it seems like the majority of the riders aren't as concerned with their equitation because the class is mostly judged on the horse hence pleasure class the horse is supposed to be a 'pleasure' to ride and ride on a loose rein etc she's a little too vertical for my taste almost seems like she's posting straight up and down versus posting with her hips forward in the second video she has more of a hunter style post her hips are angled more forward she's not posting up she's posting forward with her hips and not really gripping with her knees so her lower leg is staying connected with the horse's side in the third video she's way over exaggerating her post throwing herself forward almost over the pommel of her saddle plus she's got piano crab hands which is just extremely unattractive her lower leg is too far forward much like a chair seat which could be prevented if she didn't post so forcefully and she's probably gripping with her knees which throws her lower leg forward infront of her rather than underneather of her another thing you can try to practice especially to keep your hands steady you can use one of those big exercise balls straddle it and practice posting that way try videoing yourself that way you can see your flaws and compare yourself to videos like these Horse Dressage Aerial (dance move) Equitation Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Hunt seat Horse gait Professional wrestling throws Show hunter Swingout Breaststroke Boxing Show jumping Fencing Horse tack Backstroke Glossary of climbing terms Fast bowling Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Marching band Bicycle Weight training Professional wrestling aerial techniques Strap-on dildo Casualty lifting Obedience training Milton H.
