whjy are people under the impression that a horse has to be at least before it is broke yes i agree no heavy jumping barrel racing etc should be done before but racehorses are broke when they are y o and the majority end up fine many of those who don't are only bad because of a racing accident that could happen to a y o horse we use ott off the track racehorses as the barn i ride for hunter jumper and they were broke at and they are still extremely active jumping at ages over jennifer if you are under the impression that we drug our horses you are sadly mistaken our horses recieve nothing but water treats sweet feed hay and in lisa i am a bit confused are you with me on this question or against me s lisa thanks fo rclearing that up yo horse as i already mentioned racing accidents that happen to year olds can just as easily happen to or year olds horsejumper you are going to be wasting your breath because most people are uniformed when talking about racing etc and they read some blurb or watch pharlap and then every tb that has ever seen a track has been brutalized drugged etc most tb's that will be flat horses are broken as yearlings but are actually started right before their yr old year it's no different for polo ponies reiners wp etc wp show weanlings on longe line but i don't see half as many complaints or criticisms leveled at them tb's that will go national hunt hurdles or chasing are not usually started until or in both cases if the horse is backward or immature for it's age they are turned away for another months year whatever everyone assumes that every tb foal that hits the ground will be broken and raced as a year old and that is simply not true i find it so frustrating having to explain this to people it's also true that a lot of the injuries that they sustain such as bowed tendons suspensories etc are just as common in reining polo jumping etc as they are in racing i have been involved in racing all my life my father was a steeplechase jockey and now trains i have worked the majority of my life within the racing industry and the fact that people claim all the horses are drugged etc is a bit rude doping and other such cheat tactics are present in all horse sports the racing industry is more heavily regulated than any other equine sport from animal welfare medications race fixing jockey riding and conduct trainer practices everything is scrutinized while i appreciate that not everyone likes racing i do think that people should know a little more about what goes on from personal experience rather making big sweeping blanket statements such as every tb is broken as a yearling Horse racing Thoroughbred Thoroughbred horse race Steeplechase Show jumping Seabiscuit Parachuting Jockey Ben Johnson (athlete) Athletics Show hunter Milton H.
