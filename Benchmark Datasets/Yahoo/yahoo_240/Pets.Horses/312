my medical mystery horses what could cause this pain unrideability long question some of you have seen my posts about my horses that i cannot ride i have literally done most everything medically related to figure this out and my veterinary financial resources are about running out horse has been seen by vets a chiro a pro problem horse trainer and accupuncurist the other has been seen by vets both have had numerous exams xrays to no avail i believe it was the dressage saddle i used but now i am questioning if it was the neoprene girth here's the history horse qh gelding rode for months with no problems in hunter saddle bought dressage saddle and in more months horse became so painful you couldn't sit on him at all bucking like crazy had a moment where his lh leg turned in under itself neurologic looking so painful to touch his back croup he would double barrel you on the cross ties gave months off treated for everything under the sun and successfullly rode him again for months without problems became un sit on able again extremely hypersensitive to any pressure against his sides has now had months off and still cannot be ridden nor have his sides touched back croup is better still does not move around much does not go forward much suffers from severe navicular arthritis lives on daily medications treatments included bute banamine naproxen epm medication shockwave chiro accu massage methocarb and rest had full body xrays pro trainer try to ride him out horse yr wb mare no other problems bought in july last year in mid dec became completely unridebale un sit on able became extremely violent in refusing to go forward cannot lunge will not move about when free became so painful to her back she couldn't tolerate a winter blanket getting put on her rested and laid up until june rode again month of june early july became un sit on able again back not sore but sides are excrutiating cannot tolerate pressure on sides both horses had two constants me and the saddle girth i even used this saddle girth on a rd horse that started having similar issues he was not mine i only rode him x wk so he never got to this point and is still rideable my horses were ridden x wk mostly w t though the mare did regular canter work too no other constants i got rid of the dressage saddle and switched back to my hunter saddle with no positive results now i have a western saddle and was attempting to ride the mare in that neither horse can lunge without pain no more than that neither horse can tolerate even being requested to move forward i've been told it's behavioural by vets the saddle by others behavioural by pro trainer who talked to the vet first the unanimous opinion though from out of vets total is the saddle the true problem has never been figured out because it is their sides where your heel would thump i wonder if the girth did this i've been riding years always in my hunter saddle never had issues like this switched to that dressage saddle ruined horses something is not right here and i know it is not behavioural the mare is more expressive in her displays to get the point across and if you ask her to move forward or thump on her sides she will pin her ears strike bite cow kick double barrel when riding she would rear buck jump off the ground and squeal the gelding will buck like a rodeo bronc when pressure is applied to sides both horses were wonderful before this happened i refuse to believe it is behavioural they dont' just go from great to wretched because they feel like it i am at a loss and the team of vets on these horses university included just shake their heads and say retire them both breed the mare but don't ride breeding is not an option for me nor a desire what i want is to get my two perfect riding horses back the mare has been rested ridden by pro trainer what a nightmare that was on bute naproxen and had been shockwaved xrays were taken she is awaiting the chiro now i am awaiting some to pay him i just love going to the barn to stare at my horses that i am paying board on every month this really sucks and i am at a total loss with this i can't even sit on them bareback as the pressure against their sides is too much continuation they are both outside sometimes the gelding comes into a stall for the winter on the coldest days the mare doesn't toelrate being stalled well they have been moved to a different facility and yes to all of you who have been jumping up about the naviuclar that gelding has been retired haven't you read that he has been off and rested for months so far he has not been ridden save for time in january when the pro trainer came out to ride them both the navicular is being maintained as best as i can and he is one daily medications the gelding was treated for lyme's disease i forgot about that in addition to all the other things i have done i have been an equine veterinary technician for nearly years and have been a rider owner for years i would never put my horses at risk by doing something silly like riding a nav horse he gets xrays of his feet every months to keep track of his condition he is vigorously monitored well i find it hard to believe the neoprene girth could cause such soreness i believe that if a horse was irritated by something like a girth there would be some localized swelling or some type of blistering that would give the area a slight scurf i know what trouble it can be when a saddle fit is not right but personally i have found if it was the saddle my horse would show enough back soreness within a week to let me know this was the problem saddle must be constantly monitored because as horses either gain muscle or topline through training or lose muscle or topline through old age or loss of training the saddle can need adjustment in its flocking also of course tree fit is important but again i would think these problems should have surfaced very quickly and given the time complete rest to recover which you seem to have done and a proper fitting saddle the problem would be gone by now which it isn't in the case of your older horse he seems to have enough other problems arthritis navicular that perhaps it is time to retire him the mare however is lacking in these problems yet still is unrideable you certainly seem to have done it all a good chiropractor may be able to shed some light if the mare has never seen one so as soon as you can afford it i would check it out one other option is to check your horses for lymes disease if you haven't already done so the vet will simply draw a blood this too is worth a try because treatment with antibiotic will solve the problem if they have a positive titer for lymes good luck read a post below mine insisting that this was a severe behavior problem without physically seeing these horses the poster might have gone a little overboard but my one question to you amanda is how long have you owned the gelding if it has been for a very long time i would be less apt to think it is a behavioral problem if you only had the gelding for months before problems started which seems to be the same amount of time the mare went well for you it may be a case where a physical problem has created a behavioral one especially in the mares case as i said earlier the geldings other physical issues even with all your good care and medication are probably not surmountable if it is behavioral horses can certainly take advantage of you if they think they are the ones in control i might look to a less conventional type of professional to evaluate
