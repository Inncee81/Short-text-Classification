rotated coffin bone miracle the year old arab mare extremely energetic acts like she's i used to ride rotated her coffin bone front right leg last december and it has continued to rotated to degrees the last few months it has stayed stable however she coliced mildly a month ago and had to be walked for hours this week her owner got on her and rode her at a walk trot and canter after working her on the lunge line and not noticing any lameness whatsoever the vet came out and took x rays and told us that he had never seen a horse so sound with such a badly rotated coffin bone i will be able to start riding her at a walk and a trot and someday cantering her again what are your thoughts on this and is there any explanation you can offer also does anyone know of anything i should do to help her note this is not a horse that you can leave out in her paddock and expect her to be ok if you aren't working her she's a very well trained dressage horse who is a dream in the arena and on the trails thank you lisa m she has been on a minimum feed diet she gets just enough feed not sweet feed either to add in her wormer and bute powder she gets hay but quite a bit less than she used to her small paddock is almost completely dirt as she paces and runs around a lot the coffin bone rotation was and is rotated farther than most do however it was possible it may rotate back no matter how severe it was estimated at years for it to rotate back however but simply based on how far it is any other horse would be dead right now this horse has several other health problems including being somewhat diabetic at least that's how it was explained to me and having very puffy wind puffs on her back legs forgot to mention she does have a special shoe on it is basically just on backwards the farrier and the vet do work together and that's how they decided how to put the shoe on she also had an abcess on this same foot this summer she is not foundering and does not have laminitis her coffin bone was rotated and the only complication caused by that was the abcess i'm not sure what type of hay she is getting but the people who feed her are well instructed by the vet on what she should be getting fed what hay do you feed her i'm sure your vet has advised against alfalfa but just checking cuz you just said hay if the rotation has stopped and you the vet and farrier are working together then its just a matter of time to let the bone heal and the foot grow around it rotating it slowly back into position do not rush things founder can return in a heartbeat do not feed anything that can refine to sugar no alfalfa no fresh grass no apples no rice bran no sweet feed etc orchard and oat hay are the best for laminitis as was explained to me when i had a horse with laminitis she never rotated though alfalfa even in small quantity would shoot her back into softened lamini keep the exercise going treat her back end with the windpuffs also most likely caused by her putting more weight in back to relieve pressure on front with proper care sounds like your doing that love attention and exercise she'll live a long happy showing life Horse Laminitis Horse gait Dressage Guinea pig Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Hamster Swingout Shaggy dog story Tennessee Walker First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Alfalfa Skateboarding trick Horse tack Dog training Japanese tea ceremony Horseshoe Dairy Seabiscuit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Marching band Hay Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Chicken Swimming Fast bowling Milton H.
