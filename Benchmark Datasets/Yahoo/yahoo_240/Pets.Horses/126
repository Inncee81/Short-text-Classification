why is everyone's answer always to use a tie down don't they know about other riding techniques i come on here to try to help people train their horse in a safe manner there are legitimate horse training questions questions that are great opportunities for the riders to learn more yet the answers are almost always the same get a tie down get a martingale what the heck guys there is such a thing as learning to train your horse without the use of harmful gadgets good classical patient training and riding will do the best for your horse not gadgets is anyone else scared of these novice horse people being given such incorrect answers does anyone else think that a tiedown is harmful and dangerous to both horse and rider more importantly in the few events that a tiedown should be used does anyone else think it should be reserved for qualified trainers bloodhound the fact that you find it acceptable to use the same training aid on almost all of your horses is remarkable training is the adeptation of appropriate tools techniques to individual horses with unique situaitons and personalities the same tools cannot be used on every horse successfully each horse is different as is every rider if you think that a tie down is the answer for every horse you cannot call yourself a trainer a trainer is one who listens to the horse's needs and adapts their training to each horse yup i agree with you also there is tons of junk advice given by people that have no clue how to properly ride a horse let alone train them for some reason they flock to y a horse section and become 'trainers' i went to a ranch rodeo last weekend and watched some of the horses in warm up i realize they are 'roping horses' and need a tie down when doing their job however these horses had no basic training on suppleness and bending at the pole etc their heads were so high up and only held back by the tie down that was just in warm up there is no reason why a roping horse can't have the proper training and i have seen some dang good ones that were what drives me bonkers doesn't take much anymore on here lol is seeing the tie downs used and not run through the breast collar so when the horse does briefly lower its head the strap dangles and they can get their leg hung up it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that wreck coming a mile away i have ppl that board paddocks down from me i have never seen them bit their horses with the bit facing the correct way no kidding you tell them but they still do it i have seen another boarder saddle a horse run the rear cinch around the flank and have a rodeo free for me i can write a book on how not to train your horse by what i see out at my boarding area all i can say is the horses that wind up in the hands of those that want to learn and take lessons and those that are skilled after taking lessons and never stop learning are the most blessed animals on earth i pity all the other ones Horse Horse tack Equine conformation Comanche Dressage Kitesurfing Spanking Bull riding Seabiscuit Glossary of climbing terms Eventing Rodeo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horse breaking Weight training Dog training Dog agility Archery Roller coaster Cattle Motorcycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bullfighting Paragliding Skateboarding trick Horse gait Scientology beliefs and practices Parachuting Professional wrestling holds Alexander Technique Boxing Sin City Milton H.
