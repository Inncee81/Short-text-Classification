how much does a pony cost a month in the uk i really want this pony http www bomb proof co uk details php horseid but am having a hard time convincing my parents that it is not to expensive and there are ways to save money when owning a pony i have just bought a horse and its quite expensive to begin with when your getting use to things but as you get used to it it does settle down suggest you get a pony on loan to begin with and see how it goes i have broken down all the individual costs so you can see where the money goes livery if your thinking about diy livery where you do everything then depending on the yard and its facilities then this can range between per week if your going for part livery then obvioulsy the cost goes up between approx this is where you share the looking after with the yard owners for example they turn him her out on a morning and you do the evening you can say good bye to sleeping in if you choose diy and then theres full livery where all you do is turn up and ride this can cost you can also do working livery where you can offset the cost of looking after your pony by allowing the yard to use him for teaching food you will need hay haylage hay costs around a bail and haylage costs for a small and for a medium size bail how much you need will depend on whether your yard has full year turn out you will also need concentrate which on average must be around the mark per week farrier this will need to be done every weeks or so and costs around equipment if your pony comes with tack then this will reduce your cost if not then you can look at anywhere between for a saddle and around for a bridle depends if you need to have a custome made one this is extremely important to get the right fitting tack as your pony will only suffer if they dont fit correctly and then theres all the different rugs and stuff each rug is around you can go on forever buying all different kinds of things but i reckon i pay around for diy livery and everything else but i only pay per week good luck Equine conformation Dairy British Rail Class 86 Horse tack Cowboy Sailing Credit card Insurance Pittsburgh Steelers Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Hunt seat Capitalism Life insurance Mattress Unemployment Mutual fund Outsourcing Hyperinflation My Little Pony Welding Horse Extreme Programming Education in Germany United Kingdom corporation tax Solar cell Inventory Microeconomics Illegal drug trade American Motors Compiler optimization Law of value Stock Rigging Gold standard Bulk vending Money Capital accumulation Citigroup Tack Surplus value Neopets Anarchism and capitalism Graduate school Pony Transformer Nicomachean Ethics CPU cache Deflation (economics) Betting (poker) Pony Express Leasing Education in the People's Republic of China Tax Economics Horseshoe Cable television Nuclear warfare Wind turbine Sewage treatment Deftones Gross domestic product B-47 Stratojet 401(k) Labour economics Labor theory of value Captain Thunderbolt Archery Health insurance Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Final Fantasy XI Laserdisc Taxicab Best Buy MMORPG EastEnders Craps FairTax British Rail Class 317 Air New Zealand Digital photography American individualist anarchism Social Security (United States) Flat tax United States Postal Service Supply and demand USS Tunny (SS-282) General Dynamics F-111 Diving cylinder Broadband Internet access Personal finance Cruising (maritime) Swedish allotment system
