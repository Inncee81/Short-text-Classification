horse show ok i need to vent here i was at a horse show yesterday it was a local weekend trophy show and i really screwed up i have a young show ring green mare so i only entered her in walk trot classes that wasnt the problem in western and eglish walk trot we placed first then it was show jumping we were in a low rail classes but it wasnt her that screwed up it was me i had the jump course memorized in my head i mean i could look at the ground and go over the jumps in order in my head but then i got in the show ring and consintrated so hard on getting her over in correct form and giving her the encouragement she needed to not duck out at each jump and the last jump i took off course the last jump was at an angle to an outside line and an inside line well i wasnt paying enough attention and took us over the inside line instead of the last jump being the outside line and i didnt even realize it till they were like you know you missed the last jump and i was like what and to really rub it in i found out that i was only one point behind the grand champ at the end of day awards b c of my mistake we took reserve thanks for all your support and by the way i'm not venting b c i am a win win or lose crying person i am ok with not winning anyting i simply hate it when i screw things up but i'm proud of my horse b c she put her whole heart into it even though she was steered off course lol i think i was maybe misunderstood a little bit i wasnt nerves at all i love showing and have been doing it for many years the problem wasnt my horse picking up on nervesness and not acting right she was an angel listening to me perfectly i was the one who didnt consintrate hard enough on my course pattern and got the last jump wrong d i was one in three out of about seven who missed that last jump the line was rather deceiveing if you' re not consintrating enough if i may say so myself lol thanks for all the support don't beat yourself up the best thing you can do is give your horse a treat and tell him you'll do better next time it's all about having fun and if you went there had fun and both you and your horse went home unharmed and safe in all ways you have much to be thankful for so many people do not have the means to own a horse and want one soooo badly so we must appreciate our opportunities best wishes for a better show next time be blessed Horse Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 New York Giants Piccolo Junior Saga Drill bit Horse tack Snooker One Piece minor characters Dressage Horse gait Humphrey Bogart Eddie Guerrero Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Jon Secada Care Bears Show jumping Diving Seabiscuit The Inside Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tenshinhan Milton H.
