if my mare has milk does that mean she is pregnant hi i just bought a year old paint mare like weeks ago but for some reason she has milk the lady that i bought her from said nothing about her being in foal so i started to check all the websites and books just to see the symptoms and it all seems to fit i really need to know i do not have a barn and i sure do not have a nice grassy pasture i know that i need to call the vet but i really am hardly ever home and our vet is always very busy i don't know if i should board her at a barn close by for a couple weeks or just keep a close eye on her she is a wonderful horse i really do not want anything to happen to her what do i do i know nothing about foals and nothing about pregnant mares please help the only reason i said that i was hardly at home was because i have to work on weekdays till pm because like every horse owner know horses cost money but i am home weekends i have had horses for years and been around horses all my life i have horse sense i also train kids to ride but i just have never had a foal i have paddocks just dirt no grass i ride all my horses twice a week and have trained horses everything they know so please don't treat me like i don't know what i am doing thanks you need to have a vet do an exam on her to see if she is pregnant and if she is the vet will also help you set up a good feeding worming and vac schedulle because mares in their last months need a higher protein grain and to be wormed and vaccinated so that the foal will be resistant to these things if she is in foal it would probaly be wise to take her to a boarding facility that has experience with foals and foaling so if need be they can help your mare foal and they'll be able to tell if she's close to foaling or if she's having any problems while foaling good luck and i hope all works out well but usually when i mare bags up full with milk she is to foal within weeks a good horse website where you ask questions and a vet answers then is www allabouthorses com there are many answered questions about mares and foaling check it out Guinea pig Dairy Pet skunk Seabiscuit Livestock Equine conformation Insulin Ferret Milk Ocean's Twelve STS-86 Breastfeeding Thoroughbred Malaria Milton H.
