how do you get a horse to change leads my horse just turned four and i love her to death i have trained her myself and this fall and next summer im going to be entering her in events i want to barrel race her and it is key to have your horse on the write lead to go around the barrel im just not that sure how to make her change her lead i would like too know how to get her to change leads if we are just running in a straight line as well bah simple question no one will give you the correct answer because few horse people actually understand the mechanics of horses you will learn if you listen to my advice that gaming horses are perhaps the most physically tuned horses and by far the best competitors second only to reining horses first thing your horse is too young to be asked for speed when you show next year you should ask for correctness speed will follow it is absolutely key to have your horse on the right lead around a barrel how does one accomplish this well anyone with any brains should know that all leads come from the hip this is why ex reiners make fantastic barrel horses because they have stellar hip movement teaching your horse to move her hip is the basis of barrel racing if you ride a horse with a solid hip it will not drop shoudler it will properly change leads it will not run off a horse with a hip will run correctly consistently and competitively horses with hips learn to curve around barrels with their shoulders lifted not to mention you will blow people away with your amazing ability to cue flying lead changes every two strides okay sounds great how do we acheive hip because your mare is young you have it easy to be most effective you will need a round pen and some ball spurs if you are new to training horses go out and buy a book on reining to learn about the proper way to work a hip begin by doing ground work stand next to you mare and press into her hip with your hand when she steps away from the pressure that is her reward this will teach her to move off her hip go both ways with your goal being to keep her moving off the pressure while her front feet are planted try to complete a circle each way when you are very confident in her movement saddle up and ride in the round pen use the same pressure technique with your spur press into her left hip while slightly tipping her head to the left be sure to keep your right leg off her body if she does not respond cluck to her and tap the left spur when she steps even if its small reward her with a release of pressure continue these steps until you can cue her to make full hip turns in both directions working the hip takes patience and it can be challenging for both horse and rider but the benefits are endless once a horse learns to move its hip the horse becomes lifted allowing it to spring out of barrel turns and stay lifted in the shoulder eventually you should be able to cue your horse to canter by simply sliding your leg back and putting slight pressure on her hip helpful hints to know you're on the right track when you canter a straight line the inside hip should be tipped in if you can see your horse's inside hip tipped into the center of the arena you are moving it correctly second your horse should build up a muscle on both sides of her lower belly it will look like a straight line from her ribs to hip with a slightly upward tilt this is a sign that your mare is lifting herself up when she canters what does this have to do with barrels everything your horse will run like a dream once she has her hip but you still need to spend your show season running to be correct practice really cueing that lead switch coming out of your first barrel which is the only time a switch is required here is my favorite barrel racing drill when you get to the point where you can lope in not run lope practice the switch by working the hip here is a simple drill that you can practice that will keep your horses from getting sour while still stressing the important factors in running a pattern practice this drill at a walk or trot until you are certain your horse can do it during a controlled lope not a run i use it with my mare all the time basically you set up the regular pattern but when you approach the barrel you stop and rate back up a step or two and get your mare's hip this means you pressure with the outside leg until she swings her hip towards the barrel then circle the barrel twice being certain to keep your horse's inside eye watching the barrel while your outside leg is tapping your horse s outside hip keep your pockets about three to five feet away from the barrel and make sure they are round then after circling twice move on to the next barrel and repeat when you come off of your third barrel don't ride the straight away like you would in a show instead finish your horse's pocket by completely closing it and riding off in a line perpendicular to the straight away lots of information but it's worth it if you need extra
