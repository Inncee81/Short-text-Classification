jagged looking horse hooves ok so i stopped taking lessons from an instructor because the lesson horse has the most horrible hooves the last time i went i picked up the hoof and the edge literally looked jagged is this normal am i just naive and too picky i don't own a horse but wanted to take lessons to prepare for owning eventually i also noticed that the bridles bits and saddle pads are always damp and dirty this can't be good for the horse i am a rooky in the horse world so please tell me what ya'll experienced people think thanks for the input so far the bits always have dried dirt and grass it's really gross and the saddle pads aren't just damp they look filthy and one ohter detail that pissed me off was the horse had a inch long deep nasty cut between the chest and shoulder and the instructors reply was that he is fine to ride just hose that area off and we'll deal with it later that instructer of yours is a real f ing a hole pardon the french here are some reasons why its only to get a horses hoves trimmed you are saving that horse alot of pain in his feet if you do get them trimmed the saddle pads and bridles should be put in the sun or someplace airy after a ride because a wet saddle pad will cause a sore on your hoses back same with the briddle but on the face there will be a sore if there is grass and gunk on the bit bacteria will build up on it and the that bit goes in the horses mouth p s i think theat you are not being picky at all i am own horses and are in h and can tell you that you should go to a different instructor because the shape of the horse and the equipment can tell you a lot about the owner and that cut tells you that he and the other horses dont get along or that the guy has barbbed wire which is not good for a horse at all Equine conformation Horse tack Mattress Drill bit Knife Comanche Snowboarding Horse Bridle Cowboy Textile manufacturing Jackass: The Movie Archery Shaggy dog story Horseshoe Woodworking Russian joke Motorcycle Sin City Barbed wire Domestic rabbit Captain Thunderbolt Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mercury 4 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kender Tennessee Walker Horse gait Glossary of firefighting equipment Upholstery First aid Evolution of the Horse Traveller (horse) Humphrey Bogart Horse breaking Theory of conduct Casting Tire Fire extinguisher Fire fighting Show hunter Time Out of Mind Teen Girl Squad Wood router Plane (tool) Lawn mower Seabiscuit Dog agility Compost Social rule Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Minor Harry Potter Beasts Salad Fingers Futurama (TV series - season 5) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Belmont Park Scuba set Dragon Booster Chair Dressage Bicycle Double bass Figure skating Wyatt Earp Fast bowling Electrophysiology Three Stooges CPU cache Chariot Diving suit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Guan Yu The Star Wars Holiday Special Babe Ruth Violin San Marcos Pass Eric Cartman Goaltender B-47 Stratojet Tack Grand Teton National Park Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Paintball Vacuum cleaner Pysanka Digital circuit Wire wrap W.
