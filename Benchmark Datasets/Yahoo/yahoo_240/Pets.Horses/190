suspensory never having dealt with a suspensory injury before i'm not sure what to expect in any case it started about two weeks ago as a hot swollen spot on her right foreleg around the tendons about midway up the lower leg we stayed off her back to see if it would go away and got the vet to come out two days later he ultrasounded it and what do you know she'd blown her suspensory following his instructions we poulticed it for three days on the fourth day we put her out in a smaller paddock by herself by then the swelling had gone down almost entirely and was no longer hot to the touch for three days she was doing just dandy then i went out to see her this morning and the entire lower leg was swollen and hot not just the spot that had been so i wrapped her front legs and put her back in her stall when i went to check on her tonight that leg was slightly more swollen even than it had been that morning so i re wrapped the legs and put her up once again and the vet's coming out again tomorrow anyway the point of all this even though the vet will give us the medical explanation tomorrow i hope why would her entire leg have blown up all of a sudden after four days of little to no swelling don't worry i learned the wrap both legs lesson the first time i dealt with splints dmso good idea i didn't think of that and i even have some sitting on a shelf we dealt frequently with suspensory injuries in polo we cold hosed the leg for mins times per day and then sweated the leg at night using nitrofurazone and dmso you can also wrap the legs during the day with clay or ice tight i'm sure that you are aware of this but when you wrap the affected leg put a support bandage on the other as that one will be bearing more weight as with any ligament injury reducing inflammation is key to healing along with rest i wouldn't turn her out i'd hand walk her she may have simply re injured it they can take some time to heal especially if they are torn or have a hole in them all it takes is a simple twist and you are back where you started Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Carpal tunnel syndrome Anterior cruciate ligament Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick The Contender (television series) 1957 World Series Radiation therapy New York Giants Swingout Paragliding Swimming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Casualty lifting Ocean's Twelve Water polo Traumatic brain injury Seabiscuit First aid Horse gait The Amber Spyglass Chair Milton H.
