noises to get a horse moving okay with most of the horses i've ridden i make a clukking noise and they pick up their feet nicely most people around me have their horses trained to respond to both leg and voice cues i tried this with my ex plow horse and it didn't do a thing but a kissing noise really makes him move and i think i remember the trainer telling me this is a work horse thing something about working with the plow and all anyone else have a draft that was trained like this or know any other noises words that the amish use with their horses in the field or simply why this is used i work with draft horses that are trained in the amish country kissing will get them to move but they seem to also move by telling them to step up they also know the typical back and some usually move quick with a get pronounced louder and different i cant really type it if you continue to use leg pressure and words or noises that you like the horse will get used it the one i work with have gotten used to my common clucking i wish i could remember more but i kinda just do or say them naturally and most of the stuff i do to get them to move is all for driving Horse Cattle Horse gait Equine conformation Hearing impairment Microphone Dog training Glossary of partner dance terms Skateboarding trick Sin City Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Seabiscuit Motorcycle Milton H.
