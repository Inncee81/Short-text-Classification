how big is too big what is the weight limit for a person to ride a horse i know that being overweight can hurt your horse how big is too big for a full size horse spotted saddle horse i am just asking a question not referring to myself i was just wondering if someone else wanted to ride my horse and they were a bigger person they say a horse can safely carry about of their weight so a horse should have a rider no more than on it i would think this would vary depending on what is being asked of the horse my husband weighs a little over and has been on a percheron cross and a quarter horse that was right around h all he did was walk i don't think this was too much to ask for these horses he did trot on the percheron that horse weighed and was hands tall he tried to get on my h paint at the time but it couldn't carry him well probably a result of the saddle not being the best i would imagine if your overweight rider wanted to cowboy into the sunset over hill and dale then this would be a real problem if he was on a horse however even an hour or so of walking around that shouldn't be a problem the rider's weight should be taken in account depending upon the amount of work you are asking the horse to do galloping jumping hills pavement vs grass these are all factors to consider into the equation too Horse Equine conformation Horse gait Horse tack Equitation Eventing Dressage Bicycle Mountain bike Cowboy Arabian horse Milton H.
