how can i take horse riding from a hobby to my life i have decided to have a career in horses and go to a horse university i am but have been rding for only three years besides majorly increasing my personal fitness what else can i do to make my horse riding skills increase and start thinking of competing and having lseeons at least twice a week aswell i will obviously increasing my horsemanship skills as hopefully i will be getting my own horse next halfway through next year during my gap year any tips besides the fact that i will be poor forever thank you in adavnce for taking my question seriously you mentioned that you'll be taking a gap year spend that year immersed in the horse world mostly during your lessons especially if they're group ones like mine think about things that you can improve for example when you're warming up at the walk see how far you can stretch your heels down and at the trot and canter drop your stirrups for one lap and pick them back up for another this increases your leg strength and balance and it helps you practice picking up a lost stirrup at the more jostling gaits don't just stick to the discipline you're riding now find lessons in western if you're riding english now and vice versa spend some time learning about every nook and cranny of the riding styles out there even if it's just a lesson or two or if it's just reading about it in a book this way your that much more knowledgeable about different riding styles horsemanship training methods and riding in general see if you can spend time with a trainer you can learn about different training methods and hopefully pick up things that you can use later on many professional riders also train to keep up the bills before they get that breakout ride see if you can get a job as a groom at a well known showing barn in your area this way you can be in the competition environment and gain the mindset you'll also gain contacts and references for later but i'm assuming you know that this pays nothing which brings me to my last almost xd point find a job in retail etc that you know a little bit about even if you work part time it helps bring in the money i would even go so far as to recommend that you save everything that you get from that job ok last thing save i know it's so obvious but it's necessary eat mac and cheese and ramen noodles don't buy new clothes live at home go to the extreme if you're buying a horse months before you go to college you've got a double whammy of new costs coming your way i told you everything that i could think of because you didn't mention what you want to go into pro rider trainer wow all this talk about horses makes me want to take a gap year myself hmm might have to consider it d Dressage Horse gait Horse Cowboy Horse tack Equine conformation Milton H.
