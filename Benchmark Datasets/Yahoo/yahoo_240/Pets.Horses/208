horse training barn what is it that people want to be able to get freely and more in a horse barn what i mean is like i am starting a horse barn up in the near future and i want to know if barrel racing is something someone would love to learn at a barn but havent found it yet or steeplechasing and such like that do u think alot of people would want to learn things like that or is that something that shouldnt be in a local riding barn awesome note i just loved to learn steeplechasing but there is nothing here to do for it hmm i know barrel racing is popular here they have it at all the local shows maybe i will stick with basics of what i hear that sounds sooo cool i myself am a barrel racer and if i had someone that would have schooled me when i was trying to learn on my own i would have jumped at the chance if most horse people are like me they will jump at the chance to learn anything from medical to feeding to riding and learning multiple disiplines not only would i teach just barrels and steeplechaseing i would teach them pole bending jumping figure key race as well as western and english pleasure classes and the whole yards obviously you would have to ask the rider what she would want to learn but boy if i were her i would probably go broke paying for the classes lol i would definitely give it a whirl and have fun doing it Horse Athletics Cowboy Horse tack Dog agility Thoroughbred horse race Valentino Rossi Cross-country equestrianism Milton H.
