tripping all the time the horse i ride is about or years old and she's an awesome horse and does what i ask of the time but she can be rather clumbsy sp like today we were riding outside and yeah there we little tiny ditches where the water ran through but it wasn't too bad but she was tripping everywhere and had one major trip that scared me half to death she was like down on her knees and it took her like strides to get back up is there anything i can do to help make her more sure footed and yes her feet are in good condition where the waters had run through before dry now and they are very small gullies she doesn't have athritis though she has had a couple health problems she was a rescue horse and had a large kidney stone and was very skinny but she is over that now and has put on a lot of weight even though she's still a little thin she's not lazy but she was half awake today she was sleeping before i got her out of her stall she usually isn't quite so bad but today she was really clumbsy she's not very green though she's been jumping for a while the only aspects of her training that need work that are obvious are her leads she especially has trouble picking up the right lead and her headset i also most hate to say this but have you had her checked for epm a freind of mine went thru the same thing with her mare stumbing and with her farrier telling her that the mare was clumsy it was a tack issue then a back issue and a host of other things that did not sound right when she took her to the vet they discovered that it was in fact epm the mare was treated and is recovering nicely you may just want to check to make sure hopefully she is just going thru a klutz stage good luck Equine conformation Sin City Eventing Horseshoe Horse Little Britain Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Fast bowling Seabiscuit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Pittsburgh Steelers Skateboarding trick Show hunter Apollo 8 2000 Australian Grand Prix Horse gait Urinary incontinence Debugging John McDouall Stuart Great Teacher Onizuka Horse tack Poker jargon Grunge music Mars High-heeled shoe USS Tunny (SS-282) Dragon Booster Shaggy dog story Cross-country equestrianism Futurama (TV series - season 3) Pitaten Jumpstart 3rd Grade Thoroughbred horse race Humphrey Bogart The Death Gate Cycle Blood (computer game) The Contender (television series) Childbirth Futurama (TV series - season 5) Oh My Goddess!
