after qs how long will it for a horse's back to heal i hope you have read the previous two questions about mystic the stocky paint mare that refuses to trot while being independently ridden well i'm pretty sure the answer is her saddle as most people have said what i see that how it doesn't fit is that the tree is too narrow and the back also needs stuffing she is a wide horse she basically would be a quarter horse since she doesn't have any natural spots just a white spot on her butt that's a scar from when she was a foal and got stuck in a fence or something just a abnormal blaze and three socks well anyway if her back is the problem that the english saddle is pinching her then how long do you think it would take to heal and what could we personally do for her even after the chiropractor is out here's some pictures and videos that are kind of old but yeah this is from the beginning of june http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg http i photobucket com albums h appaloosalover pmf and shows hillcrest stables mystic jpg that's me riding bareback see how she is reacting to the left side i think it hurts more there here's my friend riding canter trot in may when she actually would trot http youtube com watch v y vzosctlw http youtube com watch v nxfsdod hfa remember that in the videos this horse does not know a thing about contact she is a western horse and we are retraining her to english that's mainly why she is evading contact those videos are also old mind you that's when we were first starting her out depending on how much damage and soreness to the horse i would back up the chiro with accupuncture when i totally obliterated my mules back unknowingly the saddle fitters were not versed in mules he had mths off with solid accupressure no one did accupuncture at that time and chiro work i had walked him and trotted him to keep him in shape but no weight i would of drove him however but this was prior to his driving training go with how your horse is doing ask the opinion of the chiro healing comes faster with accupuncture and chiro together trust me i just had it done on my mule for a pinched nerve in his shoulder he was usuable a week later it was amazing edit how does this horse move then as a western where is her headset this horse needs to be taught to bend at the pole and i have a suspicion that her head isn't doing that at western also something is bothering this horse whether it be saddle or lack of training on the bit but definately i would have someone check her for soreness which you can do by running your fingers down their back on both sides of the spine etc however sometimes pain masks in other areas like hips and neck too shes a pretty horse tho Horse tack Seabiscuit Professional wrestling holds Dressage Milton H.
