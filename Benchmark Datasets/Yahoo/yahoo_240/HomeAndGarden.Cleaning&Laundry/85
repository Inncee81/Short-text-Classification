how much money have i saved air drying clothes i do about loads of clothes a week just wondering what your estimate is calculating the cost of operating appliances appliances have nameplates that provide information about btu voltage amperage wattage or horsepower these nameplates provide the necessary information for calculating the cost of operating that appliance to calculate the cost of operation first determine the total units of energy used electricity is sold by kilowatt hours for electric appliances multiply the wattage by the number of hours used to obtain the watt hours divide watt hours by to obtain kilowatthours multiply the kilowatt hour usage by the cost you pay per kilowatt hour from your electric supplier if you want to know the approximate cost of operation for one month multiply the answer by the number of uses per month clothes dryer min cycle loads wk kwh Horsepower Wind power Battery (electricity) Electric motor Decibel Electric power Incandescent light bulb Transformer Solar cell Orders of magnitude (energy) Air conditioning AC power Vacuum cleaner Volt Torque Alcohol fuel Labour economics Alternating current Circuit design Solar power Grid energy storage Electricity meter Solar power satellite Voltage source Energy conservation Digital circuit Resistor Operational amplifier Appliance Transmitter Battery electric vehicle Orders of magnitude (power) Fuel injection Washing machine Wind turbine CPU design Light-emitting diode Bicycle lighting X10 (industry standard) Autonomous building Central processing unit Wal-Mart Electrical generator Maximum power theorem Tennessee Valley Authority Thermostat Circuit breaker Ford Ranger EV Renewable energy Fluorescent lamp Personal rapid transit Uninterruptible power supply George Westinghouse Computer Explosive material Vacuum tube Hydroelectricity Daylight saving time High-voltage direct current Hebrew calendar Electrical resistance Linear regulator Mitigation of global warming Phase-locked loop Electric power transmission Electricity retailing Current (electricity) Two's complement Current source Transistor Bussard ramjet Credit card Ton Coal Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Surplus value Galileo spacecraft Major appliance Strategic management Conversion of units Fuel cell Split phase Energy development Impedance Sears Holdings Corporation Thermocouple Mutual fund Refrigerator Call centre Electrodeless lamp Insurance RISC Switched-mode power supply GED Nuclear power phase-out Continued fraction
