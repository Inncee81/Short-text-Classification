how can i get stains from melted wax off of a cotton shirt a long time ago like years i dripped a bunch of melted red candle wax onto one of my favourite cotton t shirts like an idiot i washed the shirt hoping that would get the wax out unsurprisingly it didn't so i threw the shirt in the back of a closet and forgot about it i recently found it and i'm wondering if there's any way to get the wax out some of it is now just greasy stains in a few places you can still see red wax is there any way to get the shirt wearable again meaning no wax and no or very minimal greasy stains should i just give it up and trash the shirt or is there any hope if its been there for a long time you will have a difficult time at it but lets try heat up your iron make it warm not hot now take a piece of paper towel and put it folded under the stain now take another paper towel and put it on top of the stain this one does not have to be folded now apply the iron for a few seconds when you remove the paper towel see if the wax is coming up from the shirt onto the paper towel if so were in business now take a clean piece of paper towel and just keep doing the same thing until you have no more red on the towel now take dish washing detergent cascade and spread it over the stain add a squirt of dawn or what ever else you use and rub lightly rinse in luke warm water now take peroxide and let that sit on the stain for awhile add the detergent again scrub and rinse hope it helps if not you can always tie dye it Textile manufacturing Manicure Motor oil Sento Laundry detergent Wax play Wok Casting Hand washing Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Washing machine Sauna Dishwashing Staining (biology) Towel Hydrogen peroxide Bong Mattress Plastic Gilding Japanese tea ceremony Dishwasher Cast iron Hat Ski wax Laundry Tattoo Clothing Japanese toilet Shirt Soldering Gram staining Dry cleaning Aerial (dance move) Soap Hyperthermia Paper Pysanka Weaving Shroud of Turin Blood Simple Candle Sulfuric acid Batik Diseases of the honeybee Brewery Urticaria Dye Surrealist techniques Cross-country skiing Agar plate Vinegar The Star Wars Holiday Special Poker jargon Textile manufacturing terminology Procter & Gamble Glass Detergent Ironing Sterilization (microbiology) Pottery Customs and etiquette of Japan Western blot Recurring South Park characters Mouth ulcer Psoriasis Necktie The Inside Iron Cotton Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Nunchaku Shoe polish Fire fighting Steel Diving suit Oscilloscope Diaper Sterling silver Coffee Glossary of wildland fire terms Dairy Acne Professional wrestling slang Top-bar hive Turquoise The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Trailer Park Boys Kimono Incineration Internal ballistics Seal (device)
