did i open pandora's box i have always worn pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity about it as i was getting ready for work one day i asked him what the fascination was and he told me that he found it alluring and sensual when i wear pantyhose and that he was curious to experience that feeling so i hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on i let him keep them on for a few minutes and he went absolutely crazy over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat now hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again i don't want to deny it to him because of how fascinated he is and how much he liked it that one time i'm thinking if i can limit it to a few minutes around the time we go to bed we could have fun with it was i wrong to do this how should i handle this i totally agree with endless cherish this there are unfortunately far too many perfectly straight men with wives and children and corporate jobs just like they're supposed to who have an interest that deviates from the norm and it kills them because they don't have anyone in their lives they can trust enough to confide in your husband is very lucky to have you as someone he can truly talk to i would recommend that you two take some time together and explore this send the kids away go to a hotel whatever you have to so you two can be alone play then take some pillow time together and give yourself a chance to get comfortable of course it's going to be strange at first but your relationship will only be stronger for the exploration and who knows you may end up learning a few things about yourself that you didn't even think could happen best of luck Milton H.
