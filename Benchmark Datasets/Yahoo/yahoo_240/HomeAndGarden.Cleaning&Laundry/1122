ok i accidently splashed some clorox on a favorite colored shirt now it has bleach spots on it its still a good shirt but i cant imagine wearing it like that except maybe to the beach or something would it be ok to bleach it totally then or would that ruin it i was thinking dunk it real quick in bleach then rinse is that possible as you can see im not that into laundry and the finer details of life thanks bleach is corrosive if you dunk it you ruin more of the fibers i would suggest keeping it to wear when you have a painting project and don't care if you get paint on it or you could use it to work in the yard etc something that doesn't require you to look your best or you could just cut it up for rags to clean around the house i once wash a white polyester shirt with my red panties pink shirt husband wouldn't wear it lol Textile manufacturing Sodium hypochlorite Menstrual cup Upholstery Car washing techniques Undergarment Paul Is Dead Clothing Dishwasher Menstrual cycle Paper Brush Social aspects of clothing Urban beach The Warriors Diaper Japanese tea ceremony Characters in Bleach series Skinhead Laundry detergent Epoxy T-shirt Joker (comics) Wood pulp Magical thinking Plastic FoxTrot Mario Violin Death rock fashion Technicolor Linen Suit (clothes) Sento Japanese school uniform Fecal incontinence Kilt Photographic film Salad Fingers Textile manufacturing terminology Characters of Naruto Tallit Dishwashing Piccolo Junior Saga Polyester Terry Bogard Diamond Scrubs Sodium percarbonate The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Trailer Park Boys Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Calvin and Hobbes Theory of conduct Panty fetishism The Fairly OddParents Characters in the Smurfs Ultramarine Football (soccer) Washing machine Sinfest Aloha shirt White bread Laundry The Midnight Sun Denim 50 First Dates Dry cleaning Hydrogen peroxide Chemise Rugby union positions Mattress Swimming pool Miyamoto Musashi Chicago White Sox Johnny Appleseed Kenpachi Zaraki Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Contact lens Hair coloring Knots Landing Tennis shirt Microfiber Hard water Singapore Police Force Animal Crossing Clown Pure Pwnage Coir Kurt Cobain Potato Staining (biology) Clorox Weaving Wok Paint Horse Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys
