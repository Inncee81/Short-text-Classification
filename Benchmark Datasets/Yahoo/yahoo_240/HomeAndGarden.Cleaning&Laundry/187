dusting yes or no remember a layer of dust protects the wood beneath it a house becomes a home when you can write i love you on the furniture i used to spend at least hours every weekend making sure things were just perfect in case someone came over finally i realized one day that no one came over they were all out living life and having fun now if and when people visit i don't have to explain the condition of my home they are more interested in hearing about the things i've been doing while i was away living life and having fun if you haven't figured this out yet please heed this advice life is short enjoy it dust if you must but wouldn't it be better to paint a picture or write a letter bake cookies or a cake and lick the spoon or plant a seed ponder the difference between want and need dust if you must but there's not much time with rivers to swim and mountains to climb music to hear and books to read friends to cherish and life to lead dust if you must but the world's out there with the sun in your eyes the wind in your hair a flutter of snow a shower of rain this day will not come around again dust if you must but bear in mind old age will come and it's not kind and when you go and go you must you yourself will make more dust share this with all the wonderful friends in your life i just did it's not what you gather but what you scatter that tells what kind of life you have lived very nice indeed i give you a star but sure your worth more thank you for the nice verse Avenue Q Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Little Britain Blood on the Tracks Humphrey Bogart Social rule Kender W.I.T.C.H.
