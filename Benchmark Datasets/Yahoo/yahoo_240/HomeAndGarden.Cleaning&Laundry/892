house cleaning with kids mothers could you please share your cleaning and organizing tips it seems like everytime i turn around i am stepping in something sticky or wet and i am constantly picking up toys my house is not very big and i am not an organized type of person i really need some tips on how to organize thank you hi the laundry is piled up to your ears the dishes have a funny green funk growing on them and you could have sworn you had a table somewhere in the kitchen sound familiar trust me you aren t alone whether you are a working work from home or stay at home mom the household chores add up with the ever increasing responsibility of after school activities volunteer work or just trying to make some time for yourself the cleanliness of your home seems to be the first to go a little bit of organization and some help from the rest of family will make the problem easier to handle the first thing i would do is enlist the help of your family don t walk around thinking that having a clean house is your responsibility alone all of those other people live there too and are capable of helping to make it a pleasant environment for everyone the man of the house can do more than fix a clogged drain he can do dishes laundry dust and yes even windows tell him if he s worried about dishpan hands to wear gloves seriously talk to your husband about ways he can help out find out what he hates and the two of you set a schedule that limits the amount either one of you has to do your personal hated chore most men aren t sure which job will actually be of help some guidance from you could make all the difference in the world now as far as those little people who live under the stairs go definite guidelines have to be established if you manage to catch your children in that stage where they want to help you have a golden opportunity to teach habits that will stay with them teach them that a family helps each other and their job in that family is to keep their home clean remember to keep their jobs age appropriate and be patient i am the first to admit that organization is not my strong point developing a system that makes sense for your life and home is key to household bliss i usually spend one morning or afternoon a week cleaning the house the rest of the week is spent keeping up with daily chores and laundry it never ceases to amaze me how many dirty dishes and clothes three kids and a husband can make the whole family takes about hour to pick up the assorted clutter before bed that way the house is clean and ready to start the day in the morning that may not work for everyone so adapt the idea to your schedule obviously for events like a family get together or party it will take longer than a few hours to clean during those times i would suggest giving yourself plenty of time and schedule breaks so you don t burn out don t forget lighting and closing doors to messy rooms can do wonders for the overall appearance of your house in my experience keeping up with chores is the best way to prevent them from becoming a bigger hassle than necessary of course if you asked my ceiling fans they would disagree with me the traditions of spring and fall cleaning originated for a purpose it s a good reminder to take care of those out of the way semi unseen tasks that get overlooked in everyday clean ups i am especially fond of the fall cleaning so that i have a clean start for holiday decorating for some reason i don t like the look of sparkling ornaments with a backdrop of dust a tidy organized home runs more smoothly than one that isn t don t take it too far though there is more to life than perfect blinds and windows like family time and enjoying each other of course i do suggest being able to find each other so straighten up at least that much seriously who ever heard of the attack of the dust bunnies narendra Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Milton H.
