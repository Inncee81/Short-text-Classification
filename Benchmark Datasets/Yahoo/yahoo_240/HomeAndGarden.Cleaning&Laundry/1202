i need a little bit of laundry help i bought this nice shirt at sears about a week ago it's purple i was looking at it the other day and where the seam of the arm meets the shirt there's a pinkish orange ish color like somethings wrong with the dye i got a green t shirt from my boyfriend about a year ago that developed the same kind of color on it except it's very spotted and kinda ruined it so i only use it for pj's anyone know how to prevent that little bit of shirt from getting worse it's not very noticeable now but i'm afraid to wash it because i don't want to ruin it i don't have a digital camera or anything or i would've taken a picture oh and it's sort of on the neckline on the outside unfortunately this usually happens because of the dyes that are being used in se asia that are vegetable based and bleed or run very easily you can stop it by setting the dye when you first wash the garment by adding a cup of vinegar or table salt to the rinse water the first time you launder the garment you can use this technique to stop further bleed out as well the only way to repair the bleed out once it happens is to re dye and set the garment in the same color Clothing Textile manufacturing Dry cleaning Tallit Vinegar Dye Alum Kimono Upholstery Laundry Piccolo Junior Saga Technicolor CD-R Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Nintendo 64 First aid Football (soccer) Hair coloring Staining (biology) Starch Sodium chloride Jewish symbolism Cheese Textile manufacturing terminology Fencing Iodine Pysanka Tzitzit Leather Gram staining Laundry detergent Fast bowling The Ashlee Simpson Show Dither 2000 Australian Grand Prix Indigo dye Tattoo Menstrual cup Photography Undergarment Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dairy Rice Salt Tofu Bedbug Social aspects of clothing Color Light-emitting diode Compact disc Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Harp Shroud of Turin RGB color model Cliff Richard Camouflage E-6 process Ironing Sento Japanese tea ceremony Soap Dishwasher Shaggy dog story Acetic acid Photographic film Katelyn Faber Western blot Car washing techniques Color theory Skirt and dress Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Urticaria C-41 process Johnny Appleseed Green Day Paint Diamond enhancement Marilyn Monroe Transcontinental nation Laserdisc Mosquito Digital camera Bleed Like Me Cinerama Milton H.
