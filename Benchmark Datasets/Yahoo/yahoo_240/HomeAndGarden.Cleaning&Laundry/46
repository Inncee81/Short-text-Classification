i just moved and there are nats all over i just moved into anew house but i am having a problem with nats they arein my frige and every ware when i moved in i bleached every thing but it is not killing them i cant even use my fridge cause of them what can i do ok i just moved hear i didnt bring these little arments with me i opened the fridge and it was coverd fill a bowl with apple cider vinegar put some plastic cling wrap over the bowl polk some holes in it and put in your fridge or any area where you have the nat problem use as many as needed should attract the nat's but not let them escape hope that this helps oh if you have any house plants you may want to quarantine them as well by putting them in a large plastic bag sealing it shut and leaving it for a week or two to kill any nat's that may have laid eggs in it if you have a garbage disposal they could be coming from there as well so you might want to make some effort to clean it as well they sell stuff at the store or you can try putting ice cubes in and then running it to clear the food from it Plastic bag Bong Ice cream Plastic Refrigerator Tofu Dustbin Bedbug Textile manufacturing Hamster Sushi Food preservation Vinegar Dairy Kakapo Carburetor Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Menstrual cup Pet skunk Dialysis Japanese cuisine Hard disk Apple Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bagel Coffee Genericized trademark Dishwashing Cannabis cultivation Motor oil Poker jargon Phoebe Halliwell Fish and chips Dishwasher Floppy disk Hong Kong-style milk tea Chopsticks Fancy rat Bulk vending Characters in the Smurfs The Inside Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Objective-C Babe Ruth Japanese tea ceremony Hazing NeXT Christmas tree Cruising (maritime) 1957 World Series Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Vermicompost Johnny Appleseed Tampon Action potential Diseases of the honeybee Tea Waste management Drill bit Energy development Cube (film) Lechaina Brown Bear Pysanka Sluggy Freelance Plumbing fixture Thermal power station Sento Food storage New England Patriots Dow Chemical Company Garbage truck Lego Internal ballistics Rose (Doctor Who) RuneScape skills Apple Computer Steve Jobs The Star Wars Holiday Special John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Aerosmith Cuisine of the Philippines Weed control Data General Sewage treatment Manga Cremation National Football League Star Trek Customizable Card Game Mach kernel Brewery Milk German cuisine Puff pastry Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans
