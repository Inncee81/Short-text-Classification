how should i add liquid fabric softner if my washing machine doesn't have a dispenser when i add it at the rinse cycle i get this film over the higher in the machine clothes use the downy ball dispenser they only cost a couple of bucks you just put your fabric softener in it up to the indicator line toss it in the wash and it will empty itself during the rinse cycle or just mix your fabric softener with some water to dilute it before pouring it onto your clothes you should always avoid pouring fabric softener directly onto clothes anyway or you can do what i do sometimes i mix my laundry detergent with a little fabric softener that way i don't have to worry about adding it at all plus it softens the water which means my clothes get clean easier you can buy detergent with the fabric softener already in it but it's just cheaper to do it yourself Soap Laundry detergent Dishwasher Detergent Dry cleaning Washing machine Plastic Vinegar Glycerin Car washing techniques Hydrogen peroxide Hard water Mattress Dishwashing Diaper Casting Sulfuric acid Fecal incontinence Electrophysiology RISC Brewery Shampoo Sento Tea CPU design Western blot Menstrual cup Urticaria Strap-on dildo Dairy Illegal drug trade Bong Fossil fuel power plant Lionel Corporation Sauna Staining (biology) The One With the East German Laundry Detergent Bulk vending Jute Felt Water purification Sodium carbonate Weaving Hand washing Manicure Soap bubble Citric acid Oscilloscope Wok Sewage treatment Kimono Motor oil Hat Sodium hydroxide Volleyball Fire fighting Mouth ulcer Printed circuit board Eczema Organic peroxide Vulvovaginal health Baptism Wind turbine Japanese toilet Ultramarine Sodium hypochlorite Thermal power station Immortality Japanese tea ceremony Transformer Tide Top-bar hive Hygiene Ironing Nocturnal emission Starch Applique Machine gun Cruising (maritime) Filling station Phosphate Ammonia Collodion process Sodium percarbonate Urinal Agar plate Shinto Sugar beet Natural gas Gilding Sterilization (microbiology) Menstrual cycle Halitosis Snooker Water
