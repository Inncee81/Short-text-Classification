a question about house keeping and maids for you once my wife had a good friend who was old and somewhat handicaped the lady had maid that came in once a week on thursday i think to clean her house well one week for some reason her house was really a mess so she called my wife and asked her to come down on wednesday to get things in order for the maid arrived she did not want the maid to see the house in that condition my question is is that a normal thing that you might do would you ask a friend to get things in order before the maid arrives my wife was glad to do it and seemed to completely understand what do you think my mom has paid somone to come clean her house before and she felt the need to clean up before they came i thought it was crazy but in her mind she didn't want it to be a big mess and the lady think badly of her it really wasn't that bad anyways but my mom is very particular about what she thinks is clean and about what people think of her house and how clean it is she gets alot of her self esteem from that she would not ask a friend to come clean it up though she would stay up late or do whatever to do it herself i think that is normal for some people just not me Social rule Cindy Sheehan Humphrey Bogart My Name Is Earl American Psycho Kodocha Jennifer Lopez EastEnders The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde The Catcher in the Rye Phoebe Halliwell Little Big Mom Blood on the Tracks Le Malade imaginaire Pitaten The Apprentice 2 Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Big Brother (USA TV series) Jon Secada Ron and Fez K' Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pok__mon Live!
