water staines i have deep water stains on my shower door have used glass stripper and i still have the stains please help me oh i see what you are saying this must be limescale that has built up on your shower door okay heat up some white vinegar and sponge or spray on your shower door wait several hours then return to shower door and clean with some baking soda and and some vinegar and scrub with a nylon scrubber then rinse in hot water if this does not work then allow me to recommend another method of cleaning off your shower door limescale stains use liquid fabric softner to remove the limescale stains pour on a small amount of fabric softner on a sponge or nylon scrubber then scrub a little wait for about twenty minutes then rinse off you might however have to clean the shower floor after this as the fabric softner could have left a slippery feel which could cause you to slip just clean floor with baking soda and rinse vinegar works well for this as well just use it undiluted and then rinse with hot water your shower will be clean and disinfected good luck Dishwasher Vinegar Dishwashing Car washing techniques Sento Menstrual cup Acetic acid Brewery Plastic Wok Dry cleaning Laundry detergent Bong Flue gas desulfurization Soda lime Sterilization (microbiology) Water purification Sodium hydroxide Glass Cookware and bakeware Soap Domesticated turkey Hard water Upholstery Casting Mouth ulcer Sodium hypochlorite Hydrogen peroxide Fossil fuel power plant Japanese tea ceremony Urticaria Hot air balloon Mattress Textile manufacturing Scuba set Swimming pool Customs and etiquette of Japan Sulfuric acid Sewage treatment Hand washing Carbon dioxide Agar plate Water Scrubber Incineration First aid Tea Dairy Ethidium bromide Seismic retrofit Carbonated water Hyperthermia Japanese cuisine Sugar beet Plating Washing machine Nuclear fallout Hot sauce Haggis Sauna Jewish cuisine Gram staining Wine Gilding Bathing Sodium Toilet paper Manicure Fluoride therapy Chinese tea culture Coffee Niddah Barbecue Sodium percarbonate Swimming Severe weather terminology (United States) Skunk Laundry Airbag Soldering Central heating Paint White phosphorus incendiary Cocaine Tooth Dialysis Chocolate Cast iron Tissue engineering Fume hood Diving suit Toffee Woodworking Diseases of the honeybee Mercury (element) Changeroom World War Three (Doctor Who)
