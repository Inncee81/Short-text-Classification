soften sheets i bought new sheets and they are scratchy and stiff i washed them with fabric softener but they are still horrible does anyone have any ideas thanks yes first wash them in hot water then once the washer is full of hot water add in some fabric softener and turn off the machine let it stand like that for a few hours then turn it on and finish the whole cycle ' when you put them in the dryer add a tennis ball this will beat up the sheets and really help soften them if all else fails to your liking you can soak them in bleach water for while but only white sheets never soak anything in straight bleach it will eat a hole in it Textile manufacturing Washing machine Dishwasher Laundry detergent Menstrual cup Dairy Tofu Mattress Seismic retrofit Casting Coir Dishwashing Detergent Sento Jute Textile manufacturing terminology Brewery Tanning Manicure Water purification Upholstery Roger Federer Glycerin Flax Wood pulp Plastic Fossil fuel power plant Happy Tree Friends Dry cleaning Textile Weaving Toilet Sauna Bread Comanche Sugarcane Fecal incontinence Lathe Knitting Jewish cuisine Leather Cruising (maritime) Hydroponics Cookware and bakeware Instant coffee Diving suit Clinker (boat building) Table tennis Common bean Polar Bear YuYu Hakusho Wood Paper Sodium hydroxide Onsen Domesticated turkey Coffee Soy milk Poker jargon Andre Agassi Diaper Glacier Volleyball Indianapolis 500 Vinegar Brush Coppersmith Beer Pong Drill bit Cantonese cuisine Procter & Gamble Jazz Wallpaper Linen Towel Carbon fiber Pea Piccolo Junior Saga Lutefisk Shaving Carbon dioxide Norway national football team Recumbent bicycle Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Glastonbury Festival Ramen Soap Wind turbine Sushi Steffi Graf San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Leigh Richmond Roose Printmaking Tire Archery Screw Cheese Rice Cuisine of Brazil Transformers: Armada
