small white bug on my sneakers help please okay it had been a while i had stored a pair of air jordans with suede and nubuck on them from they were definately worn not great condition i took them out today to where them while i was cleaning them a very small white bug was crawling around the inside of the shoe not where you put your foot but inside the actual mold where like you cant see anyways im paranoid now if it was lice or pubic lice i wasnt the only one who wore them and im a virgin lol or scapies someone please help me i vacumed the small portion of carpet they were on they weren't stored in my actual house and i located the bug outside could these bugs have been eating the suede or nubuck in the shoe they are gone now but am i safe they were in my house for about minutes outside the box please help me d thanks in advance and thanks for reading it would help if you identified the bug meaning size texture etc otherwise ther are a million white bugs that may look similar to that one but if you have any pets i would check their fur for lice and if you see any then that's probably what it is if not then i would guess that since it was in your shoe then most likely not since lice like hair but they also like warm places if it's very very small then there is a probability that it could be lice but most likely not since it wouldn't really be that noticable on a sneaker Shoe Hamster Clothing Poker jargon Debugging Hard disk Codename: Kids Next Door Surveillance Salad Fingers Fancy rat Hazing Japanese toilet Software testing Guinea pig Sneakers (film) Michael Jordan Sock Domestic rabbit Menstrual cup Nike, Inc.
