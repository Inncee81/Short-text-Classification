i bought songs on itunes and get an error code error code x or it will act as if it is burning the songs but then there is nothing on the cd i know this is a common problem so has anyone come up with an answer yet i have searched and tried different options for days with no luck very frustrated here btw i am a very slow learner when it comes to computers this one my son gave me when he left for iraq well after doing some research it doesn't appear that error code is specific to itunes but it is specific to burning cd's i've found references to it appearing in at least different programs while burning cds according to one forum where someone was getting both and error messages it may be because the pc isn't keeping up with the cd writer during the process there could be a lot of things causing it but a lot of the forums i read said that changing the burn speed helped also you might try a different brand of cd r discs and making sure you don't have other programs running at the same time none of those appeared to be fullproof answers but at least it's a place to start to change the burning speed in itunes go to edit preferences advanced burning and change the burning speed i'd recommend trying x or slower since almost all cds and burners that have been available for the last years can easily handle x it will take longer though Mach kernel Debugging ITunes Extreme Programming Apple Computer ITunes Music Store Compact disc C programming language CPU cache Gramophone record Copy protection Java programming language Modem Digital rights management Expert system Computer virus Windows 2000 C plus plus Computer numbering formats Mac OS X MP3 Knoppix Online music store Software testing RISC PaX Virtual memory Laserdisc CDC 6600 System/34 IPod Movie projector Scramjet Lisp programming language Opera (web browser) Social rule Variable Quantum computer System/36 Mouse (computing) MDAC Exception handling Gmail Morse Code Hebrew calendar Halting problem Burroughs B5000 CD recorder L4 microkernel family The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Warez Podcasting Redundant array of independent disks Mixtape H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Legal research Apple Macintosh Objective-C Central processing unit Software bug Object-oriented programming OpenBSD Emacs Computer security Linux Computer Billboard Hot 100 Common Lisp Blue screen of death IBM PC compatible Sudoku PHP Copyleft On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Dance Dance Revolution MAME Spring operating system Pump It Up Advanced Audio Coding String (computer science) English grammar Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Surveillance AmigaOS Error Piccolo Junior Saga Welding Electrophysiology Optical character recognition Error correction and detection HP BASIC for OpenVMS Algorithm Web crawler
