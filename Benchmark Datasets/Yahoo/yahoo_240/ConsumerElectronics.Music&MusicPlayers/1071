zune vs zen creative m which should i buy i have had ipods and both died i have no warranty so they're useless now i've been looking at different music players and i found the zen creative m zune is rather popular so those are my top two choices i want to know which to get if either and if there are any better alternatives i want at least gb and i want video playablity i need a reasonable price thank you compared to the zen vision m there are only a few things that a zune has a larger screen though it has the same resolution as a zen which means pics and movies will be washed out scratch resistant body a much better radio w rds rds displays station artist and song playing wireless sharing not a deal breaker here as i've never found another zune to share with a zen vision m is perhaps the most advanced mp player out there much better than an ipod and a zune combined the reason why it isn't as well known is because creative spends their money on make their products technically efficient rather than spending the money on aggressive marketing campaigns like microsoft and apple just take a look db sound rating much better in sound quality than a zune will play more music picture and video formats you wont have to convert anything to the device can be used as an external hard drive you could save a copy of your stuff on the device then transfer it to another computer about times more colors on the display videos and pics will look very good more colors available back lit buttons useful in the dark fm radio recorder voice recorder good for recording lectures and what not password protected photos yes you can even store your private pictures on here w o anyone knowing not limited to zune marketplace downloads can be used on napster rhapsody yahoo music virgin etc can use microsoft windows media player for that matter you could drag and drop files to the device if you dont want to use a software delete your stuff directly from the device no computer needed check it out http en wikipedia org wiki zen vision m http www creative com products mp zenvisionm Apple Computer Creative Zen ITunes Music Store Digital audio player Mouse (computing) Digital rights management Apple Macintosh Vorbis Walkman Windows XP PlayStation Portable Microsoft Windows Laserdisc Atari 8-bit family MP3 USB flash drive IMac Digital photography Commodore 64 Podcasting Floppy disk Online music store DVD Computer virus Computer and video games High-definition television Xbox IBM PC compatible Super Nintendo Entertainment System Microsoft History of Microsoft Windows QuickTime Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis File sharing Warez Opera (web browser) Nintendo GameCube Modem Apple typography Mac OS X Redundant array of independent disks Macromedia Flash Surveillance X Window System Linux ZX Spectrum Sega Apple Newton Video game music Windows 2000 FairPlay Television Trusted computing Copyleft Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Internet HTTP cookie File Allocation Table Streaming media Nintendo DS Nintendo System/36 MSN Messenger Embedded system H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Amiga Console game Game programmer MDAC Windows Vista Rhapsody (online music service) Password Wireless Application Protocol Mozilla Firefox Intellectual property Poker jargon Web browser Movie projector Bluetooth Laptop Ebook Sound recording Nintendo 64 Atari ST Universal Serial Bus
