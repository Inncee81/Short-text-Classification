how do i download movies and videos onto my ipod from limwire or something limewire to an ipod here is advice open up windows media player do a search for music type in the file name of the limewire music add it to your windows media player music then go to itunes and download your media player music to your itunes library then onto your ipod buy the songs you want load them into your computer with xp os then follow the instructions for loading them into your ipod easy in itunes go to the 'add file' or 'add folder' tab under 'file' from there take where limewire stores the files although i have a creative zen it's the same and mine is under the title of 'stored' under program files limewire stored when i had an ipod it often took a few seconds for itunes to convert the songs to their own format but it was more than easy enough once your song has downloaded go to the file where it has gone to then right click and go to cut open up the ipod tunes file and paste read ipod instuctions to download the ipod file you have to have a windows or xp if you don't know where the song has gone once it has downloaded the play the song on windows media player and right click then go to properties and it will tell you where it is stored import the mp files into your itunes library and updated the ipod from there that is the easiest way you go into itunes and select file add files i think and find where limewire put the mp usually in shared folder then hit open and you should be good from there you can download any format that the ipod can read normally most songs are in mp format so the majority you will be able to play however you don't transfer the songs from limewire to the ipod but get the songs from limewire and transfer than via itunes yet another way which is very easy is to first have both the limewire and itunes windows open simply select the downloaded song or songs hold ctrl and click on each song for multiple songs in limewire left click and hold and drag your cursor over the minimized itunes window at the bottom don't release button yet when ituens opens take your cursor over your library or any playlist and then release the click the songs should then drop into that library or playlist finally sync your ipod with itunes easy transfer the songs onto apple itunes this used to work with my ipod i've tried it recently and it hasn't worked but i've since installed a newer version of windows media player you first have to transfer the songs to the media player windows clic library then go to the add button search computer documents settings user shared now transfer to itunes file add folder documents settings user shaered then once the files are in the itunes library update ipod if it doesn't work like i said it used to work for me but not with the newer version Digital rights management QuickTime Mouse (computing) Digital audio player Online music store Apple Macintosh ILife Podcasting FairPlay Windows XP IPod shuffle Mac OS X Windows 2000 LimeWire Object Desktop SonicStage Windows Vista MP3 Screenshot Vorbis Minesweeper (computer game) Unicode Walkman Mozilla Firefox PlayStation Portable AmigaOS WordPerfect Stardock RealNetworks History of the graphical user interface Peer-to-peer Apple typography System 7 (Macintosh) Emacs Spyware Gramophone record Creative Zen File system IPod nano Rhapsody (online music service) Mac OS X v10.4 Dance Dance Revolution Computer virus Cascading Style Sheets Opera (web browser) MDAC Microsoft Windows Video game music Jon Lech Johansen Library (computer science) IMac Mixtape Warez Floppy disk Napster Xcode Microsoft Office ZIP (file format) MSN Messenger Virtual memory Napster (pay service) File sharing Advanced Audio Coding Gmail File Allocation Table IPod mini File format Pretty Good Privacy AppleScript Musical Instrument Digital Interface WordStar Microsoft Common Unix Printing System AOL Instant Messenger HyperCard Forth programming language Commodore 64 IPhoto Internet Relay Chat OS/2 Konqueror Apple II family PHP Domain Name System SAS System
