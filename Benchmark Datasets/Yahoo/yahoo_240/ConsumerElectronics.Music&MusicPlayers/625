why won't itunes let me play or edit songs on my ipod nano i had all of my songs on a different computer but i got a new computer and now the songs that were on the other computer wont play on my new computer i talked to someone at apple and the told there was a way around it but because she worked at apple she couldnt tell me how she just told me to research it so what is the way around it when you connect your ipod to your computer drag the files onto your desktop then add the songs to the new library this is the safe way or you can try syncing your ipod to your new computer and hope it doesnt delete all the songs and transfers them into the library ITunes IPod Apple Computer IPod nano IPod shuffle ITunes Music Store Digital audio player Apple Macintosh Podcasting IPod mini FairPlay ILife IMac IPod photo QuickTime Digital rights management Macintosh Finder Apple typography Advanced Audio Coding Mac OS X v10.4 IPhoto AirPort SonicStage FireWire MP3 Computer History of the graphical user interface Online music store WebObjects Floppy disk Apple Newton Napster (pay service) Disc jockey Creative Zen RealNetworks Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks Mouse (computing) NeXT Rhythmbox U2 (band) Steve Jobs Newline Walkman Library (computer science) Virtual Network Computing Computer virus File system Touchpad USB flash drive GNOME Musical Instrument Digital Interface Unix Mac OS X Universal Serial Bus Apple IIGS C programming language Hard disk Mac mini History of Microsoft Windows Java programming language Apple Remote Desktop Operating system Stardock Dashboard (software) PNG Linux kernel Computer bus Xcode Rhapsody (online music service) HFS Plus Mac OS history Vorbis Atomic Kitten Mac OS X v10.2 Commodore 64 Xerox Star Embedded system Microsoft Traditional animation Sun Microsystems Chicago (typeface) Bluetooth Drag-and-drop AmigaOS Emacs Desktop publishing Desktop computer X Window System Mach kernel Windows Vista Handheld video game Macromedia Flash Apple Desktop Bus Skype OpenOffice.org E-mail Madonna (entertainer) Flash memory
