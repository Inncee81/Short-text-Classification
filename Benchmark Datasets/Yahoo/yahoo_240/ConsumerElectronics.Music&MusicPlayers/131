ipod got a tiny bit of water on it and is now acting screwy my nd generation ipod nano got like drops of water on the wheel of it like an hour ago it was still playing afterwards so i just wiped the face of it off and thought it was ok just now i went to use it and about seconds into any song it starts to skip backwards by like second intervals until it gets back to the beginning also when i shut it off i had to hit the hold button really quick or it turned itself back on right away am i completely screwed or is there a way to get thos drops of water out i dropped my nano in clear kool aide and it acted weird for a while but i read on apple com that you shouldnt touch it for like a day just set it up and let the water run off and out of the ipod that should work just leave it off for a little while a day or so and set it upright it might not work like it used to but it will be better than how yours sounds now IPod nano Apple Computer IPod mini ITunes Music Store Mouse (computing) ITunes USS Tunny (SS-282) Disc jockey FireWire Creative Zen Professional wrestling attacks USB flash drive 2000 Australian Grand Prix Screw Drill bit Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Gramophone record Baseball Swingout Skateboarding trick Rugby union Glossary of American football Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Equine conformation Walkman Mercury Atlas 6 Wheel of Fortune Podcasting Volleyball Guilty Gear U2 (band) Canadian football FairPlay Double bass Apple typography Taikyoku shogi Gregorian calendar Fischer Random Chess Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics USS Trout (SS-202) Ecco the Dolphin Dog agility Mercury 4 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Digital audio player Shaggy dog story Indianapolis 500 IPod photo Suplex Sampling (music) Embedded system USS Trigger (SS-237) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sport rowing Legend of Zelda series songs Beatmania IIDX USS Whale (SS-239) American football Aerial (dance move) Tenjiku shogi Hey Jude Operation Market Garden Violin USS S-30 (SS-135) 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Hip hop culture Quarashi The Amber Spyglass Oscilloscope Sonic the Hedgehog 2 2003 United States Grand Prix A Day in the Life Ravi Shastri Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Compact audio cassette USS Thresher (SS-200) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
