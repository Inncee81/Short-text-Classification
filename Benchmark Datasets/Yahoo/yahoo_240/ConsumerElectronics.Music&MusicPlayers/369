what bitrate should i compress i got songs mostly in bitrate i only have gb on my sd card for my multimedia player and i'm thinking of converting it to however there are also options for converting into or bitrates is that recommended i just want to use it for on the go stuff such as jogging and work commute so i'm not too interested about quality i'm thinking that i can fill it up way more with lower bitrates but then the songs may be incomprehensible hmm i would say the is fine thatll allow you to put more music on ther and i dont think you really need all that much unless you have alot and really wanna put it all in the sd card Vorbis MP3 Bit rate Digital audio broadcasting Video DV Advanced Audio Coding PlayStation Portable MPEG-4 Part 3 Freeview Digital television MiniDisc DivX JPEG 2000 Betacam Nero Digital Gothic metal Ogg SonicStage Musical Instrument Digital Interface ITU-T ITunes MPEG-2 Video codec IPod Speex High-definition television Music radio Blu-ray Disc Dolby Digital A Day in the Life Sound Blaster MP2 (format) ITunes Music Store Digital audio player Sound card Compression artifact Walkman Moving Picture Experts Group Ripping Dance Dance Revolution Stud poker Sega Dreamcast JPEG Musepack Card game Port Authority Trans-Hudson Video game music Sony Betting (poker) Broadband Internet access Card Sharks Exodus (Magic: The Gathering) Mattress Avenue Q Laserdisc Enterprise content management Poker jargon Cable television H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Speech synthesis Gramophone record Electrophysiology DVD MapleStory Modem Remaster Secure Digital card Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Blonde on Blonde Skat WSNI-FM Concrete Blackjack Windows Media Audio Montgomery Burns Brian Eno Bart Gets Hit By A Car ATI Technologies Topps Luminiferous aether FairPlay NVIDIA Music of Ireland Wheel of Fortune Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME John Renbourn Wireless Application Protocol In-band on-channel Alabama (band) Raw image format Neopets Donna Summer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Data compression The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Running I Wanna Dance with Somebody Baccarat Gin rummy
