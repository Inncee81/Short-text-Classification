any mp player yes you can listen to metallica your computer needs to have a usb port some free space on your hard drive for software and an mp player to hook up to i'll tell you my opinion on mp players along with the two types of memory flash and hard drive based remember gigabyte gb on an mp player equals about songs that can be stored on the device hard drive these can store tons of music videos and pics cheaper than a flash based player usually less durable than flash players apple ipod video most popular mp player on the market arguably the easiest to use device and software wise exclusive music store itunes has the best selection of music movies tv shows on the web plays music video photos and games must use itunes software to load songs from your computer to your mp player
