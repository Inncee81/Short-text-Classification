what is mp and how is it different from mp both file types are audio codecs which convert encode unfiltered audio files into reduced data files while preserving the audible integrity to varying degrees of the original unfiltered file both types are ways of using perceptual encoding and masking mp s filter out information after frequency peaks and valleys infractions and infarctions which are indiscernible to our ears in order to reduce file sizes m as filter out information before and after frequency peaks and valleys infractions and infarctions which are indiscernible to our ears in order to reduce file sizes m as are more effective at reducing file sizes than mp s which is why kbps encoded m as sound nearly identical to kbps encoded mp s Audio data compression MP3 Data compression Vorbis Psychoacoustics MP2 (format) Advanced Audio Coding Digital audio NTSC WavPack Loudspeaker WAV Dither Analog-to-digital converter Audiophile Sound effect Low-pass filter ITunes Noise reduction Video codec Modem MPEG-4 Part 3 Aliasing Audio level compression High-definition television Super Audio CD FLAC PNG Lossless data compression Ogg Alternating current Noise shaping Macromedia Flash Musical Instrument Digital Interface Speex JPEG Sound recording File format Equalization Morse Code Unicode Audio system measurements H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Microphone Phase-locked loop Digital-to-analog converter QuickTime Electronic filter Speech encoding Compression artifact Laserdisc Joint (audio engineering) HD Radio MPEG-2 Gramophone record Nuclear magnetic resonance Audio mastering Hard disk GSM services ITunes Music Store TTA Musepack JPEG 2000 Digital Hearing impairment Federal Standard 1037C Streaming media ATSC Bluetooth Hearing aid Electronic amplifier ITU-R 468 noise weighting Stereoscopy NTFS Original Amiga chipset Dolby Laboratories Delta encoding Sound Amplitude modulation Disk image MOS Technology SID Binary and text files Broadcast television system Digital Theatre System DV Software-defined radio Digital photography Decibel Digital signal processing Digital audio broadcasting Myocardial infarction Floppy disk Enterprise content management Satellite navigation system Tar (file format)
