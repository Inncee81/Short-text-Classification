can i add music from my ruckus music player to my itunes player instead i am considering downloading the ruckus music player but only if i can add those songs to my itunes player can i do that i tried the ruckus player from my school basically it does the same thing that yahoo music jukebox does in that it lets you download a song that is drm encoded so that you cannot use it anywhere but in the program i found that it was even more restrictive than the yahoo program in that i couldn't even put it on a mp player it was only to be used on the computer and only with the ruckus program that's what you get for it being free plus it was chock full of ads extremely buggy and slow and very un intuitive for me to use my suggestion is to just stick with other programs ITunes IPod ITunes Music Store Podcasting Digital audio player Digital rights management FairPlay Jon Lech Johansen MP3 ILife QuickTime Apple Computer Mixtape SonicStage Online music store Vorbis Spyware RealNetworks Creative Zen Rhapsody (online music service) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Apple Macintosh Software bug Minesweeper (computer game) GIF Comparison of media players Copyleft Napster (pay service) Gmail Windows Media Audio John Cage Last.fm File sharing Shake It Off Chess Computer virus Remix Sony Macintosh Finder We Belong Together GNU General Public License TiVo GNOME IBM PC compatible Opera (web browser) Doo-wop Python programming language Video game music Billboard Hot 100 MSN Messenger Advanced Audio Coding IPod shuffle Wipeout (game) Final Fantasy BASIC programming language Computer Trusted computing Macromedia Flash Musical Instrument Digital Interface Emacs Napster Half-Life 2 Walkman First-person shooter Digital Radio Mondiale American University Jukebox Counter-Strike Gramophone record MiniDisc Crazy in Love Ecco the Dolphin Snooker Skype Programming language BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Objective-C Quake III Arena Windows XP Nasty Boys Rootkit Star Trek Customizable Card Game Karaoke UK Singles Chart ZX Spectrum Object Desktop Interactive fiction Beatmania IIDX EVE Online Marathon (computer game) Nintendo Revolution Super Audio CD Band Aid (band) Starsiege: Tribes Theory of conduct Ultima Online Timpani Championship Manager Ebook
