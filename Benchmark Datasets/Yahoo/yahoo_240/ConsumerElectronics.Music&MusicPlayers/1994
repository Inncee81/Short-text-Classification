why do my headphones turn mono when i plug them into my tv's jacks well this seems to happen to me on my tvs they have a hole labeled headphones but when i put them in its mono and sound comes out of only one side and even if i put it on another device like my ipod its still mono how do i fix this should i replace the jack to fix the headphones check to make sure that they are stereo headphones stereo headphones have two black non conductive rings on the jack to seperate the left and right channels either this is your problem or the jack on your television is a mono jack not capable of supporting stereo headphones wthout an adapter even with an adapter you will only receive a signal from one channel although you will be able to hear audio through both speakers Jack plug IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Headphones Microphone Binaural recording Stereophonic sound Gramophone record TRS connector FM broadcasting Amstrad CPC Bluetooth Walkman Loudspeaker RCA connector Surround sound Multitrack recording Tungsten Handheld Audiophile Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Compact audio cassette Atari ST Quadraphonic Game Boy Receiver (radio) Television Dolby Digital High-definition television Stereoscopy Musical Instrument Digital Interface HD Radio Movie projector Mixing console Sound Blaster Digital audio player The Pet Sounds Sessions DIN connector Live Aid Game Boy Advance SP Digital audio broadcasting MP3 Atari 8-bit family MiniDisc Xbox Effects pedal NTSC Remote control XERF N-Gage 3D audio effect IPod mini Computer bus Nintendo DS Advanced Audio Coding NICAM Frequency modulation 8-track cartridge 8 mm video format Subcarrier Modem Bose Corporation Sound design Subwoofer Dolby Pro Logic Game Boy Advance InterCity Express Atari Lynx Beamforming Digital audio workstation SCART Ethernet The Flaming Lips IMac Cable television D-subminiature Electrostatic loudspeaker Disc jockey Teletext Dolby Laboratories PC Engine DVD Karaoke Hearing impairment DVD-Audio Synthesizer ITunes Sega Dreamcast Xbox 360 Universal Serial Bus Digital television Tapwave Zodiac GSM services Der Ring des Nibelungen Digital Theatre System United Western Recorders Laserdisc Magnetic cartridge Super Nintendo Entertainment System
