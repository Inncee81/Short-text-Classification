ipod won't switch off my ipod nano's acting very strangely whenever i hold down the 'play pause' button to switch it off absolutely nothing happens the backlight will go after two seconds because this is what it's set to but the moment i stop pressing it the backlight comes on and i'm at the main screen again has anyone experienced this and if so what did you do thanks some people have mentioned that the hold button might be on it's not and something happened when i held both the middle and menu buttons down but even when it rebooted it still wouldn't switch off afterwards sigh but thanks to everyone who's answered press and hold down the menu and middle buttons at the same time for a few seconds when you turn it back on it will show the black apple screen and then reboot IPod Mouse (computing) IPod nano Game Boy Micro IPod mini IPod shuffle Embedded system Apple Computer PlayStation Portable Nintendo DS Windows 2000 Wheel of Fortune Konami Code Danger Hiptop Apple typography Oscilloscope Apple Newton Creative Zen BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Windows XP ITunes Gameking Hello world program Ecco the Dolphin Game Boy Advance Dance Dance Revolution Apple Macintosh Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Screenshot Mac OS X v10.4 Pump It Up Prank flash Computer keyboard Touchpad DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Pinball Gradius Guilty Gear Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Microsoft Windows Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) IMac Floppy disk Handheld game console Jeopardy!
