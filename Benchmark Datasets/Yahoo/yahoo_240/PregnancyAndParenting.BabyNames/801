my cousin is going to be a mom she likes lierin or tempest for a girl and kincade cade devlin or terran for a boy she can't decide and btw when people say these aren't 'normal' names define normal nobody is ever normal they're unique names and she loves them so if you had to choose pick one for a boy and one for a girl everyone who is saying they're ugly or too weird hasn't been around too many people of other cultures then because tempest is a common name among the african american culture and devlin and devin are very common right now in the northern european culture caucasion whites in america really none of that should even matter when naming a child if your cousin likes these names then its her choice if she wants to name her child one of these names personally i like tempest the best for a girl and terran best for a boy tempest kincade or just tempest cade sounds pretty The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy White (people) Friends Teen Girl Squad "Weird Al" Yankovic Joke Gameplay of StarCraft Imperial Guard (comics) Kim Possible Family name The Tempest (play) Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete Child sexuality Recurring South Park characters Pedophilia The Wotch Europe (band) Kodocha Incarnations of Immortality Urusei Yatsura StarCraft Secret Missions Baby Blues El Goonish Shive Sesotho language Spanish dialects and varieties Teacher's Pet (Disney) Kender The Fairly OddParents Cardcaptor Sakura Transsexuality Mnemonic Taboo Tuesday Galactic Civilizations Doug Futari wa Pretty Cure About a Boy The Beach Boys Puberty Hearing impairment Marriage Jamestown, Virginia Xiaolin Showdown Princess Tutu RZA Given name My Life as a Teenage Robot Birthday Phoebe Buffay's songs Terran Confederacy Titans (comics) Mirror Universe (Star Trek) African American Terran Empire Nietzschean Gender role The Outsiders (novel) Skinhead FLCL Whose Line Is It Anyway?
