did you pick your childs name based on his her future i have a friend who recently had a baby she and her husband made sure to name their son something that would also look good on paper as well as being masculine what i mean by this is when he applies for a job someone would hire someone named david tyler white over someone named willie bob bubba white does this sound silly or is this something that crossed your mind when naming your baby yes that was very sensible on your friends part for many reasons a child need to learn to feel a certain type of security and having a name they themselves can identify with makes them feel good about themselves the spelling of a long difficult name takes longer to learn just because it sounds good for a baby doesn't mean it will as an adult you can be judged by your name way before you show your face and it can prevent many opportunities in the future Friends Fight Club Jam (TV series) Infantilism Social rule Charmed Hearing impairment Slow Train Coming Given name Jon Secada Time Out of Mind The Mary Tyler Moore Show I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion debate Baby Blues Fathers' rights Phoebe Halliwell The Fairly OddParents Care Bears Sex and the City Plame affair Breastfeeding All My Children Transsexuality Knots Landing Esperanto as an international language The McGuire Sisters Karl Rove Mama's Family Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Daredevil About a Boy Incarnations of Immortality Rod Stewart Spidey Super Stories Neighbours G-Man (Half-Life) Diving EastEnders Divorce Blonde on Blonde Urinary incontinence Kimberly-Clark Corporation Spice Girls It's Walky!
