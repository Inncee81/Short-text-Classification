follow trends or stay traditional i am noticing an interesting trend taking place with the new babies coming into the american world their names especially those born to celebrities names like seven camera moxie crimefighter apple rocket and audio science are filling up the world you don't have to be a celebrity anymore to have a child with a rather untradtional name one couple in new zealand named their son superman after of course the name real was taken they still call him real what has happened to the brandon rachel chris and ashley's of the world are they gone forgotten when you have children how will you decide on whether to stay tradidtional and give a name with a meaning or follow the trend i think there's a middle ground in there somewhere i think names like apple rocket coco etc are not unique they're just plain retarded but i am also not a fan for the purposes of naming my own child of names like jennifer jessica and christopher they're a little too common many ppl are starting to name their children stuff like madison mackenzie aiden and hunter i think in years they're going to be like the jessicas jennifers and michaels of my school generation what i strive for with my children's name is to find something that is not exactly uncommon everyone has heard it and accepts it as a name and not an inanimate object like apple or rock lol but even though everyone has heard of it and it seems from this generation you very rarely find ppl with the name it has that unique pretty appeal without being totally out there and trying too hard to stand out Friends Remix Days of our Lives Ashlee Simpson The Jim Rome Show AVN Awards Given name Jon Secada History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Chris Benoit Advertising The Bill Neighbours Children of Dune Jennifer Lopez The Ashlee Simpson Show Delta Goodrem Japanese name Skateboarding trick All My Children Jacob Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pitaten Apple Computer Another World (TV series) Unisex name Donovan The Life and Times of Juniper Lee General Hospital The Inside Hollyoaks AFI 100 Years series Alias (TV series) Tenchi Muyo!
