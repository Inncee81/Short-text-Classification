does plato's closet take wet seal items i've never really been there and obviously not sold clothes to them do they take pretty much any brand of clothing as long as it's cute in style and in good condition i just need a litte bit of extra money for school clothes thanks for any answers it's greatly appreciated i called them a couple of days ago and asked what they accepted they cannot tell you on the phone what they will give you for a piece of clothing but they said that the clothes had to be in good condition they said that means that there are no holes stains rips tears etc they also said they did accept stuff that wasn't name brand that was in really good condition so they will take it under those circumstances oh and also they said the texture of the material s had to be they way it came so there can be no bumps from the dryer or anthing you can call and see if they accept wet seal items which they will and then just go have fun PHP Web server Paul Is Dead Application service provider Gothic Lolita The Beach Boys Comanche TLC HyperText Transfer Protocol Barbie Website Microsoft .NET Wheel of Fortune Dorama American girl dolls Undergarment Recurring South Park characters Jennifer Lopez Skinhead Cliff Richard Phoebe Buffay's songs Napoleon Dynamite Madonna (entertainer) Fashion Minnesota Twins Family Feud Charmed Hip hop fashion Mario Visual Basic Sharon Tate The Warriors Major League Baseball television contracts Death rock fashion Grunge music WNNX (FM) HTML element Kimi Finster Web hosting Pet Sounds Scott Storch Sex and the City Spice Girls Calvin and Hobbes Representational State Transfer Monopoly (game) Ajax (programming) XRI Academy Award for Best Art Direction Missing white woman syndrome United States dollar coin H.
