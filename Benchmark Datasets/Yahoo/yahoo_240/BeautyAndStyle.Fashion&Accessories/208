does anyone else hate the 'long in length' shirt fad that is so popular right now i am so frustrated for so many months now everytime i go shopping almost every shirt in every store seems to go all the way down to the bottom of butt i hate this look i think it's really unflattering i just dont get why people like it so much maybe its one of those people wear it just because it's considered fashionable things which i've never really believed in if you actually like it can you try to explain what you see in this style or just make some other comments i mostly want to know what other people really think about this style and hopefully when it will fade away most people preferably girls like this long in length fashion because if you can remember before it started up most shirts were too short girls thought it was cool to show off their belly buttons and i remember that belly button piercings were also in that's why most companies like roxy dickies foxy etc made short shirts because they knew that they would sell more merchandise because girls liked the short length shirts personally i am very proud that someone made the suggestion to turn the style around and make more lengthier shirts because they knew that some girls that can't wear the short shirts as we know of in the past today can now wear the shirts we have in retail stores now i'm sorry to tell this to you but this trend won't fade away anytime soon people are more comfortable in what they're wearing and don't have to deal with the problem of pulling down their shirt everytime they take a seat also on behalf of the girls that do like this trend there's still plenty of retail stores that sell babydoll shirts a k a short shirts such as playboy tillys dickies foxy roxy pacsun luxie forever etc if you don't like the trend then think of it as you finding your own style happy shopping Undergarment T-shirt Social aspects of clothing Beavis and Butt-head Mario Shirt Marilyn Monroe Fashion Napoleon Dynamite Heavy metal fashion Umbilicus Calvin and Hobbes Earring Ron and Fez Retailer David Beckham Spice Girls EastEnders Trailer Park Boys Paul Is Dead Jennifer Lopez Clothing Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
