info on chocolate phones good and bad plz my advice is don't get one i have one and it stinks the touch screen is a big disadvantage it sometimes calls people when you put it in your pocket backpack or purse or sometimes even when you slide the phone up it gets scratched easily after a while it doesn't slide up as well i have a few friends who also have this phone and for or of us the phone has just completely froze up before so you cant get to your contacts or anything you have to go to the cellphone store and they will replace it but the only thing they can save are contacts not ringtones or pictures The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Ashlee Simpson Show Treehouse of Horror III Mobile phone Jon Secada Can't Hardly Wait Little Britain Hey Jude Stuff (magazine) MSN Messenger She Loves You The Star Wars Holiday Special Instant messaging JavaServer Pages Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Billboard Hot 100 Sinfest Empire Burlesque Russian joke Shawn Michaels AOL Instant Messenger Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Steve Jobs Advanced Audio Coding Francis Crick Glossary of climbing terms DNA Cro Cell (biology) Internet Biology Shotgun Signal transduction The End of the World (Doctor Who) Jabber Hip hop collaborations Ed, Edd n Eddy The Inside WebSphere Late Night with Conan O'Brien Garfield Quicksilver Messenger Service Sluggy Freelance IPod Mountaineering My Life as a Teenage Robot The Young Ones (TV series) Jakarta Tomcat Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Single certification Xiaolin Showdown The Pilgrim's Progress Rich Mullins Plastic bag Bicycle messenger Hey Arnold!
