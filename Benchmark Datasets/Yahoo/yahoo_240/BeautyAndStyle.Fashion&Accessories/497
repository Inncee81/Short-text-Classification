can i dye a pair of tan shoes black have you ever done this with any success i'm assuming they're leather you have three choices take them to a good shoe repair place and they'll do them for you it's not that expensive dye them this means they have to be very clean no salt or grease or dirt to start with get a deglazing product and the dye use gloves and work in a well ventilated area the dye's not bad but the deglazer is nasty use the deglazer first to strip off any old polish and to take of the original finish and any sealer this will allow the leather to accept the new dye more easily and evenly using a cotton dauber or a sponge brush and still wearing gloves work your way around the shoe trying to go with the grain of the leather be careful and try to be even you can end up with overlapping marks it's better to do one coat let dry and then do a second rather than doing it all at once after it's dry polish with black polish and use a sealer to get the best colour the easy way buy leather paint by a company called angelus they're in california but they have a good website you still need to clean the shoes first but this gives a beautiful finish its easy to use cleans up with water and dries within an hour i've painted black shoes white with this product they have a sealer in several finishes as well matte satin and glossy touching up scuffs with this stuff is easy and will dry in minutes this is also great for rejuvinating old black shoes you can try the sprays commonly called magix but you have to tape off the shoe to protect it stuff it with newspaper and spray in a well ventilated area i wouldn't recommend it that stuff is truly toxic in fact it's been taken off the market in some areas i hope this wasn't too much information i'm a theatrical costumer for professional dance shows i've dyed more pairs of shoes than i can possibly remember so this is all from personal experience Upholstery Leather Shoe polish Clothing Shoe Paint Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Mattress Dye Chromium Black tie Technicolor Textile manufacturing terminology Oxyacetylene Casting Cochineal Fire fighting Car washing techniques Knife Guinea pig Hamster Wok Common bean Manicure Fencing Fluorescent lamp Kilt Volleyball Tanning Tooth Tefillin Photographic film O.
