a better way to organize autographs from warped tour please tell me i was thinking of getting those white plain tote bag and letting the band memebers and sign it or should i just get a plain notebook without lines for them to sign it or the little booklets in the cds or what i want something unusual no t shirt singing and all oh and also if we ask do the band sign more than one thing you could print off a picture of each band for them to sign the tote bag is a good idea but if more than one band signs it it might get kind of confusing to tell which signature goes with which band if you just want their autographs or want to make your own display then getting plain paper or a plain notebook would be fine as for your question about if a band will sign more than one item it just depends on the band each band has a different policy you can just ask and if they won't they will just tell you most bands will gladly sign two things though unless they are really busy or there are a million fans who want autographs there Autograph Red Hot Chili Peppers Mike Watt Green Day The Rutles Depeche Mode Dream Theater Copy protection Bon Jovi The Ashlee Simpson Show Limp Bizkit Spice Girls Mario Heavy metal fashion Fifth Beatle Dave Mustaine AFI (band) Miles Davis Autopen Blur U2 (band) Chicago (band) Intellectual property John Lennon Philosophy of language Garth Brooks Color Manic Street Preachers Time Out of Mind Quarashi Dixie Chicks Iron Maiden I Am the Walrus Blood on the Tracks Rich Mullins King Crimson Weezer Laptop Therion (band) Trademark Electric Six The Velvet Underground Gorgoroth (band) Sign (semiotics) KISS (band) R.E.M.
