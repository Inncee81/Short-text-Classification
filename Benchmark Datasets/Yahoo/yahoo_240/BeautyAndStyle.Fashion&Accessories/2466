why do you wear revealing clothes n then pretend not to like it or even get pissed off when your attention grabbing outfit grabs our attention n you catch us staring i just wanna make it clear i'm not one who stares and plays with myself in front of you if you're wearing something tight or small and i think you're attractive i might start a conversation with you maybe i'm not the hottest guy but don't you think you girls are rolling the dice when you dress like that as to the attention you'll get i care b c i don't know and i want to so i guess a better question is is it weird to go up and start a conversation with a girl b c of the clothes she's wearing why or why not ya know getting what you women want would be a lot easier i think if you went up and talked to a guy you liked that you caught staring at you don't you think that means he's interested maybe the girl wants to feel sexy so she wear revealing clothes but she doesn't want others to look at her cause she's self conscious or thinks they're thinking pervertedly or maybe she's trying to impress one guy not all the guys that's kind of a good question though hope i helped Little Britain PHP Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
