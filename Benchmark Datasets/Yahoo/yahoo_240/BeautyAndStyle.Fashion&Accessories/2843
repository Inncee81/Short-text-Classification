am i suppose to do who do i ask how do i get my book i like don't know who's going to ride the bus i'm scared b c there is ppl three years older than me do and graders bother graders please help me i'm so nervous i didn't get one of my book i need b c they ran out at registration what am i suppose to do who do i ask how do i get my book who do i ask office teacher okay what would be a good outfit for the first day of school high school nothing too expensive it can be from any store i like everything hollister khols old navy deb etc lol thanks i am a girl step one take a deep breath lol alright here goes if they ran out of books at registration then it is likely that other kids will not have the book either he's what you can do call the school and ask them call the office and tell them how you couldn't get the book and when will more be in call a classmate and ask for the books title author and edition number go to a store or online and buy the book wait until class starts chances are you won't have any huge assignments the first day of class after or before class go up to the teacher and tell them you don't have the book and why you don't have it and ask them what to do next being lost get a map of the school many schools have maps for freshmen yes it will lable you as a freshman but everyone's been there and your not very likely to be harrassed for simply wanting to find your class also some high schools have the freshmen start a day before everyone else so you'll have time to be lost and then find your way with all the other freshmen also in my school the teachers were very helpful to new students and would stand in the hall and help lost kids finally you can ask an upperclassmen keep in mind they were there once too now comes to the teasing some people may tease you're most likely to get teased by your age group tho i wouldn't worry too much about being teased by older kids most older kids are just glad to have gotten out of junior high and have matured a little since then if they do pick on you they're idiots who you should just ignore what to wear some people will tell you to forget stuff like that and concentrate on your school work thats some what true but looking good makes you feel confident so make yourself look good but don't freak out about it a tiny bit of makeup don't over do it if you have boobs some girls feel more confident showing them off don't wear super low tops cause that will bring too much attention to you and you might get picked on by other girls wear something flattering to your figure and some nice jeans make sure you smell good deodorant and bathing every day as that's somethng kids will pick on other kids about and remember to breath also remember that life goes on high school can be rough keep in mind things will improve college is good fun keep in mind that in four years you should be thinking about what you want to study in college what you want to be when you grow up so take classes of all kinds and decide do i like math science child development what do i want to learn more about what classes do i never want to take again and get those foreign langauge classes in now as almost all colleges these days won't take you without them hope that helps good luck Backpack Laptop MS-06 Zaku II Frogman Columbine High School massacre Sleeping bag Scuba set Hot air balloon Imperial Guard
