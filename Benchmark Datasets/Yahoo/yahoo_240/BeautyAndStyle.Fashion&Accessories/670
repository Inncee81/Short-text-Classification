how do you let a friend know that their outfit of accessories don't look good on her without insulting her my friend always asks my opinion on what she's wearing and she tells em to be honest with her so i try but i'm scared of hurting her feelings she is a plus sized woman who sometimes does not dress age appropriate wears clothing that only looks good on thin people or chooses accessories which are not in proportion to her frame thus emphasizing her fullness she wants to wear the latest fashions but some of those things are very hard to pull off even for people with perfect bodies so how can i tell her without offending her that she should not wear some of the things that she does i'm not the type to impose my opinion on anyone but since she asks me to be honest with her then i feel guilty about lying to her and saying that what she's wearing looks good on her when clearly it doesn't what would you do in this case spelling error i meant to say outfit or accessories not outfit of accessories just tell her say those dont go Clothing Shoe Fashion Sin City Kimono Social aspects of clothing Shaggy dog story Social rule Sydney Riot of 1879 Little Britain Theory of conduct Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Black Fashion design Tightlacing One Piece minor characters Gender role Kender Barbie Women in Islam Capital punishment The Apprentice 2 The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Great Teacher Onizuka Suit (clothes) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Jennifer Lopez EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skirt and dress Funeral 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sharon Tate Hiberno-English Pitaten Bicycle Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Blonde on Blonde Sex and the City God Emperor of Dune Religious Society of Friends Humphrey Bogart Brassiere The Silence of the Lambs Domestic violence Treehouse of Horror XV Friends Diving Heavy metal fashion Indian English Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Undergarment K' Transactional analysis Scarlet's Walk Corset Mattress Vegeta American Psycho Johnny Cash Alignment (role-playing games) The Devil Wears Prada Spanking Black Orchid (Doctor Who) Dragon Booster One Tree Hill (TV series) Diving suit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus MTV Video Music Award Skinhead Changeroom Columbine High School massacre Gothic fashion Ann Coulter Kodocha Crinoline Hasidic Judaism Punk fashion Headgear Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Floppy disk The Smurfs Leo Frank Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Singlish The Inside Figure skating Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Fast bowling Doomtown Political correctness YuYu Hakusho Etiquette Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Laura Schlessinger
