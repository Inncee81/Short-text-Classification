crude question how can you keep dress capri's from crawling up in places they shouldn't be i just bought the cutest dress capries and they keep going up my booty i am going to teach and this is unacceptable they are not too tight what can i wear underneath to keep them from doing that panty hoses make my problem go away but the hoses look funny with capris generally if they are riding up it's because the waistband of the pants doesn't fit properly if the waistband is too tight it will naturally move towards areas that are smaller generally near your natural waist which is smaller and higher than the waist where you wear your pants this will cause things to creep up where they shouldn't be i'd try going up a size in the capris and see if that helps good luck Professional wrestling match types Pantyhose Amy Dumas Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ranma __ characters Trish Stratus Garry Kasparov The Contender (television series) Softball Daredevil Ultimate Spider-Man Beavis and Butt-head Anatoly Karpov True Crime: Streets of LA Andre Agassi Buttocks Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Drew Carey Show Double Dragon Boston Public Undergarment Takeshi's Castle Great Teacher Onizuka Funfair Invader Zim The Amazing Race Married... with Children Marching band Vegeta Essendon Football Club Game show Paul Morphy Kurt Angle Rock, Paper, Scissors Steve Nash YuYu Hakusho Jumpstart 3rd Grade Capoeira Big Brother (USA TV series) Roddy Piper Raphael (TMNT) Ripped Pants Martial Badminton Trousers Bj__rn Borg Garfield Opie and Anthony Contemporary culture of South Korea Richmond Football Club Stone Cold Steve Austin Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 2005 Double Dare Xiaolin Showdown Poker jargon Ice hockey Panty fetishism Bonus Stage Susie Carmichael Roswell UFO incident Chicago White Sox The Sopranos Squidward Tentacles Computer chess Kyle Broflovski David Beckham New York Giants Recess (TV series) Michael Carbajal Prisoner (TV series) Characters of Smallville 2005 English cricket season Eric Cartman Real Life (comic) Characters in the Smurfs Codename: Kids Next Door G-string Def Jam Fight for New York Noob Saibot The Warriors Ultimate Muscle Dick and Dom in da Bungalow Bobby Fischer Hippie Australian rules football Tupac Shakur Homestar Runner The Wack Pack Mark Calaway Pitaten Friends Krusty the Clown Stewie Griffin Rice University Michael Spinks Newcastle United F.C.
