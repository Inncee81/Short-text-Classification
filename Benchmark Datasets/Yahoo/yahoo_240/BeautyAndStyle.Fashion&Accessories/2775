man capris i just learned about these my friend kept joking around atleast i thought she was that my shorts were man capris and i found out they actually exists my view is anything that shows your knees are short shorts if you sit down and your knees show they're too short just like to point out i don't' have ugly knees or pretty knees either i mean knees are knees but this isn't the 's further back in history since when did shorts raise back up in height after sorta thinking i guess i'm possibly wearing shorts i'm ' '' and waist size more like hip size of so i buy to add extra fluff might be why they look like man capris but still i do'nt agree with the term man capris i believe that women's shorts have actually gotten shorter over the years whereas men's shorts have actually gotten longer to me shorts are too short if you can see your knees while standing my preferred length is so that the shorts cover my knees as otherwise i think it's just too short Sears Holdings Corporation Wal-Mart Backpacking (wilderness) Cuteness Cardcaptor Sakura Coles Myer Digital photography MS-06 Zaku II Hello Kitty Cosmic Era Mobile Units Backpack Filling station 2005 Bali bombings Zellers Backpacking (travel) ZGMF-XX09T DOM Trooper Kmart Australia Chungking Mansions Backpacker murders Martha Stewart Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Department store Target Corporation Puyo Pop Fever Portable stove Frogman D.N.
