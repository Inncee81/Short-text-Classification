how do you motivate a person who likes to sag his pants to pull up his pants what do you tell them or say to them lol just one man's opinion i didn't ask do you think they will listen i asked how do you motivate don't make me laugh this is a fad it also represents a lifestyle that is very intoxicating to individuals who wear the clothing and walk the walk and choose to go that path my son did for quite awhile and eventually he grew up after a few years his priorities changed and he know longer felt the need to set himself up for attention it is for attention give this person as much support and do not put them down believe that this person will come around be their friend if possible it won't last forever The Notorious B.I.G.
