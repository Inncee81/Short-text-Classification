why do girls judge each other it seems like girls always judge other girls and some get mad if a girl is pretty and they don't like a girl if they find her unattractive and they want to change each other and make them wear a bunch of makeup i get really frustrated when girl mate of mine bitch and gossip and spread rumours about other girls it's just pure jealousy i really dont get involved in it ive never been like any of my group of mates i've always been quite individual i don't like gossiping about others and sometimes i'm proud of being like that but sometimes i kind of feel like why dont i act more like them you have so much of a better time with girl mates that just wanna have a laugh rather than sit there and point out everyone else's bad points when all girls like this are doing is hiding their insecurities i prefer people that point out there bad points as much as their good that way you know there real Hip hop collaborations Cliff Richard Transactional analysis Spice Girls Totally Spies!
