whats wrong with my ears i got my first ear piercings in th grade i'm now i have a second pair since th grade for a couple years now they felt like theres bumps inside my ears around the holes i dont even take my earrings out ever unless its to change them becuse i'm scared my holes will close up sometimes they itch too i haven't really cleaned them like some people do used to put stuff on them once and awhile and the holes look black or dark when i do take them out i wear real gold because anything else will bug them they aren't crusty if that would mean anything one time a post earring with press on backings made one of them bleed i stopped wearing those i will only wear fish hook or ones that go through and snap in the back when i got the first pair i never rotated them either and they were very hard to get out after the so many weeks u need to wear them ok well first off mine do the exact same things i have had my first holes for years and my seconds for mine have the bumps inside two but the only difference is that i never wear mine but they never close up if they are to get back in after not wearing them for a while just rub water over the holes i really dont think there is anything wrong with them just that our ears are more sensitive i hope this helps cuz i have never had anything bad happen with mine and even tho it looks dark on the inside mine have never bleed and i have never had a ear infection i think our since they are more sensitive had to build up more around the hole to keep them there so that is why the balls are there Titanium Stainless steel Niobium Knife Welding Teen Girl Squad Bicycle frame Golf club (equipment) Screw Eddie Guerrero Goaltender Drill bit Corrosion Vacuum Steel Kroll process TI-89 series M16 (rifle) Gas metal arc welding Metallurgy Tungsten carbide Absorbing Man Beretta 92F/FS Ultra high vacuum RX-78 mobile suit series Solar cell Ford Crown Victoria 24 Hours of Le Mans Undergrads Spice Girls Geology of the Moon Taurus Raging Bull Freedom Tower Accuracy International AWM Titanium nitride Sapphire International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Forge F-16 Fighting Falcon Cookware and bakeware Weldability Space manufacturing Spork Projection screen Scandium United States Navy Mark 12 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle Mokume-gane Mithril 1986 NBA Draft Bulletproof vest Diamond Piccolo Junior Saga Wedding ring The Stainless Steel Rat Hydraulic machinery Horseshoe Big Bad Beetleborgs Gas tungsten arc welding Passenger car Harry Harrison Iron Ring The Empty Child AR-10 MS-06 Zaku II Massachusetts Institute of Technology Titanium dioxide Pioneer Zephyr Flight data recorder Love Hina main characters Donald Rumsfeld Motor oil Carole Lombard Shawn Michaels Unobtainium Bank Circuit design Dishwasher Akhenaton (rapper) De Lorean DMC-12 Metal Tenshinhan Blacksmith Surgical instruments Press Your Luck De Lorean Motor Company Pitaten Manganese Whitewater The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film) Brewery Mark Calaway Professional wrestling match types Boy Meets World Chobham armour Ear piercing instrument Duplicate bridge John Layfield Heckler & Koch USP Double bass Tanya Donelly
