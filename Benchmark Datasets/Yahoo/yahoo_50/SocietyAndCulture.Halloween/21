need help with a halloween costume yes i know its only august i'm planning ahead of time okay when watching invader zim i suddenly got a thought it would be cool to dress up as gir for halloween i mean gir's green dog disguise not the normal robot form so here are some good pictures of gir for reference http members lycos nl finalfantast gir jpg http www achituv com a googlepages com gir png http www jeboavatars com images avatars gir jpg http www oafe net yo art zim gir jpg alright now people i'm not exactly on an unlimited budget in fact kind of a tight one so please don't be like well i saw this costume on ebay it was like dollars or something like that thank you so much i appreciate any help also my friend wants to be the piggie alongside me those of you familiar with the show should know what i mean by the piggie but to jog your memories http www ridethepig tk images gir and pig gif any suggestions for a piggie costume oh i loved that show jhonen vasquez sigh how much can you aford and can you sew not like expert sewing but do you know how i'm no expert sewer myself but i made a bart simpson costume one year and it looked neat you could maybe try the same thing i did for the costume go to a fabric store or a thrift store or heck look at home for old clothes in the colors you'll need you'll need green black grey and red for your friend i'd look for pink i think black grey and red felt would be good for this costume for the ears tongue and zipper you'll also need old white tights for the eyes get the tights so you'll be able to see i purchased white kids tights at walmart fora dollar to make my bart costume walmart sells those tights on sale all the time just simply sew the fabric into a gir costume it's actually kinda easy just use actual clothes and the images of gir as your guide for your friend i'd suggest doing the same thing and be a stand up human type pig it'd be hard to look like that i reckon perhaps you could also find a green hoodie cut the arms off wear a black shirt under neath use white red black felt and either hot glue or sew the eyes on the hood same thing with the tongue and nose and ears use a black marker to make the stiching on the top look more apparent like girs wear black pants try and pull the hoodie down on your face as you can but to where you'll still be able to see get your friend to wear pink pants and a pink hoodie use pink felt to make her a tail and sew that to the back of her pants also cut a circle of pink felt and using a black marker or tiny pieces of black felt make the little nose holes and glue or sew that the hood do the same with the eyes this might be easier then my first suggestion just try thrift stores like goodwill r anywhere with cheapy clothes you can get the felt and whatever at craft stores and the crafts department at walmart good luck with your costumes i wish i could see the finished products GIR (Invader Zim) Zim (Invader Zim) Clothing Jhonen Vasquez SpongeBob SquarePants Teen Girl Squad Upholstery Gaia Online The Warriors Textile manufacturing terminology Sewing machine Undergarment My Life as a Teenage Robot The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Totally Spies!
