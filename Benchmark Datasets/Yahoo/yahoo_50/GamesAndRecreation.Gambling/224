what do you think of rebuy tournaments i've noticed there are a number of low buy in rebuys tournaments available what do you think of rebuys is it worth it to enter if i don't have enough to make a rebuy i've managed to survive a few low limit rebuys without rebuying but it's tough three is a lot of maniacal play during the rebuy period you have to play extremely tight and avoid connectors and suits in favor of solid hands drawing hands that usually can pay off well in big pots with a lot of players will quickly fall by the wayside since so many players are just taking shots if you have a few bucks i'd recommend at least taking the usually offered add on or the bonus chips they offer at the start of the tournament it's good to frontload your stack to be able to keep up with the frequent large bets best thing about not taking rebuys is the huge payback you can get if you hit the top or if you don't tilt easily and can handle watching some insane hands take huge pots i'd say go for it they payoff can be too big to ignore for such a low outlay Betting (poker) Craps Draw poker Blackjack Poker tournament Snooker Stud poker Texas hold 'em Omaha hold 'em Slot machine Poker $ale of the Century Paintball Contract bridge Team Fortress Classic ELO rating system Video poker Volleyball Cheating in Counter-Strike Fischer Random Chess Norway national football team Billiards Extreme Programming M16 (rifle) Star Trek Customizable Card Game Tournament Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Dominoes Cheating in poker Hearts (game) Card Sharks Winning Streak Sheepshead Football (soccer) Tennis Draw (poker) Guilty Gear Grand Theft Auto (game) Diving Andre Agassi Satchel Paige Baccarat Community card poker Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Blood (computer game) Piccolo Junior Saga Counter-Strike Ravi Shastri GunBound Pinball The Championships, Wimbledon Wheel of Fortune Major League Baseball television contracts Unreal Mahjong PGA European Tour Canasta Car handling Five-card draw CPU design Ra (board game) RuneScape weapons Hand (poker) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Unreal Tournament 2004 Universal Serial Bus MMORPG UNO (game) Knife Magic: The Gathering Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Atari 8-bit family K' Double bass Leeds United F.C.
