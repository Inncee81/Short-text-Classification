can any gamblers answer this looks at the typical problem of the 'gamblers lament' a gambler plays a game with a cost of where the chances of winning are percent the return or loss is if the gambler wins and then loses he ends up with if he loses first sending him down to and then wins he also ends up with so he wins as often as he loses but he's still on the fast track to the poorhouse how do you account for this alejandro you're on the right track but thats not right alba sure your scenario makes sense but the scenario here involves a return or loss its not double or nothing thats something you've added for your convenience there is a very good answer by the way nice tries guys and some of you were close win lose and lose win will happen only half the time chance of lose lose end result win win end result add up the losses amount when you win then win each is equally likely overall expectancy however like the last responder mentioned you're very close to and betting your entire stack each time random walk says you're going to hit most likely when this method start with a bankroll of units and bet unit each time and you wont move that much in the long run any problems with my answer how do you account for what you are only setting up a scenario the way you want it to happen so if you lose first drop to and then win you are at you are just as likely for this to to win in a row or lose in a row the only thing different here is that you are betting differently every time Gambling Poker jargon Gambler's fallacy Sports betting Craps Slot machine Betting (poker) Roulette Monty Hall problem Martingale 1919 World Series Backgammon Wheel of Fortune $ale of the Century Chess terminology 2005 World Series World Series ELO rating system Dice Ra (board game) Microeconomics English cricket team Card Sharks 1957 World Series Random walk Draw poker Theory of conduct GunBound Press Your Luck West Indian cricket team Prisoner's dilemma Badminton Natural Selection (computer game) Ken Jennings Risk management Radar Spread betting Winning Streak Computer chess Pinball Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Civilization III 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Super Bowl XXXVI Probability Dynamic random access memory New York Giants History of Test cricket (to 1883) Volleyball Table tennis Laws of cricket FA Cup Transformation problem Chicago Cubs Drag racing Bayesian inference Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Tic-Tac-Dough Objective-C Ethernet Deflation (economics) Counter-Strike Stud poker Tic-tac-toe Halting problem Norway national football team Strategic management Online gambling Kasparov versus The World Scenario planning Inverse gambler's fallacy Shogi Detroit Tigers Family Feud Game show Bowl Championship Series Shen Gong Wu Baccarat Pete Rose Community card poker Theodicy Chess strategy and tactics The Price Is Right 2005 English cricket season Insurance Ruy Lopez Redundant array of independent disks Transmission Control Protocol Solar cell Remix Brian Close
