why is it that when i download anti virus programs it asks me if i want to restart i know its's not a problem with the computer i am just curious is the company trying to download something when the computer is most vulnerable no hurry just curious thanks most programs require you to restart in order for the software to register in the bios no one is trying to sneak anything by you just make sure any downloads or software installs are from reputable companies with proven track records and you'll be fine restart when it stays to restart Computer virus Malware Booting Blue screen of death Anti-virus software Spyware Linux Software bug Windows XP Copy protection Computer security Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Windows Computer insecurity Virtual memory Microsoft Trusted computing Internet Explorer Knoppix Patch (computing) Computer surveillance CPU design Computer program Software cracking Classic RISC pipeline Commodore 64 Rootkit Opera (web browser) Kazaa Kernel (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy OS/2 Floppy disk Adware Skype Fritz-chip Mach kernel MDAC GNU General Public License Computer programming Melissa worm IBM PC compatible X86 CPU cache Debugging Computer worm Application programming interface Stopping e-mail abuse OpenOffice.org Thread (computer science) Spam (electronic) Podcasting Digital rights management Calculator BIOS Browser wars HyperCard Grokster ITunes Cheating in Counter-Strike Copyleft Trojan horse (computing) Wget File sharing AMD64 Common criticisms of Microsoft USB flash drive Comparison of web browsers Windows Genuine Advantage CP/M Exploit (computer security) Bluetooth Computer science Outlook Express Web crawler LimeWire Software engineering Computer and video games Windows registry Internet security Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Public domain Object Desktop Emulator Buffer overflow Dot matrix printer Steam (content delivery) Motorola 68000 Blaster worm Modem Warez SQL slammer worm 64-bit Addressing mode Programming language Assembly language Perl ZX Spectrum Database W.
