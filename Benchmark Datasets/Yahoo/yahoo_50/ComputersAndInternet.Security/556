i think i activated a computer virus what do i do now ok last night my labtop was running slow and so i ran spybot and it found items and was able to remove all but one for the last one it told me that i had to restart my labtop so i did now the thing goes from the dell black starting window to windows xp's black starting window to windows is starting window my labtop is a dell labtop i am really not sure what i can do here to get it working again is there anything i can do a program or something dell wants to charge me for them to fix it i swear i have never had as many problems with a computer as i have had with this dell i'm not quite sure i understand if your computer is still working but bypassing the dell spash screen who cares it's only an ad the reason why spybot asked you to reboot was because it found a malware item in memory hopefully when you rebooted the item was lost from your machine for good it may have attached itself to the splash screen and that went too spybot is pretty harmless so i can't see it damaging your computer some malware can however if your computer is not working i can't help you through this forum you can contact me if you wish items is a lot i suggest you use a slightly more cautious approach when surfing the web i surf for hours daily and may catch or two nasties through spybot every month or so don't listen to ravenhon the advice he gave you isn't really good advice at this early stage Spyware Malware Spybot - Search & Destroy IBM PC compatible Booting Kazaa RuneScape cheats Trojan horse (computing) Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mach kernel Filename extension Blue screen of death Warez Extreme Programming Host file Social rule Computer forensics Computer insecurity Internet security Linux Software bug Stopping e-mail abuse X Window System Windows registry Control-Alt-Delete Kernel (computer science) Screenshot PaX Opera (web browser) GunBound Computer multitasking Anti-virus software Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Sims 2 Amiga ReBoot Prostate cancer Computer security Screensaver USB flash drive Computer Floppy disk Cheating in Counter-Strike WordStar Pretty Good Privacy OS/2 AmigaOS Emacs Windows Server 2003 Gmail Von Neumann architecture Operating system CPU design E-mail spam HyperCard Component Object Model 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Roswell UFO incident Linked list Sudoku Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma CPU cache Debugging Theory of conduct Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Palm OS Timeline of hacker history System 7 (Macintosh) Rootkit NeXT Mydoom Universal Serial Bus IPod Expert system USS San Francisco (CA-38) Macintosh Finder Mac OS X Apple II family RISC Oscilloscope Hash table World Wide Web Cyberspace About a Boy Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Trusted computing Surveillance Windows 95 Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Windows 3.x Iraq and weapons of mass destruction FreeDOS Digital rights management
