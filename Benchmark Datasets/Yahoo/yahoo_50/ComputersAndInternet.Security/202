can someone please explain unified authentication to me in easy to understand terms i am not a computer expert nor do i know all the jargon associated with computer security but i need to know what unified authentication is every website i find about it speaks way over my head think of it this way it's like going to a guardhouse showing your id and getting a key that opens every house in the neighborhood it means that you enter your id and password once and this lets you login to other software programs web sites whatever without having to enter your id and password again a good example is microsoft passport any web site that accepts a passport will not ask for your password once you've logged into your passport for offices activedirectory and ldap are common examples Password Password cracking Two-factor authentication Windows XP Stopping e-mail abuse Uniform Resource Locator Cross site scripting Secure Shell User (computing) Cryptography Telnet Authentication MSN Messenger Phishing Windows 2000 Spyware Malware Database management system File Transfer Protocol Public key infrastructure Proxy server Passport Passphrase Novell NetWare OpenSSH Trusted computing Kerberos (protocol) Database Microsoft Extensible Authentication Protocol Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Control-Alt-Delete Website Computer security Digital rights management Backdoor Microsoft .NET Internet Single sign-on Rlogin Wi-Fi Protected Access Computer insecurity Apache HTTP Server RuneScape cheats Common Unix Printing System HTTP cookie Computer forensics Buffer overflow Web design S/KEY Use case Perl Software bug E-mail spam Shibboleth Software engineering Slashdot Dictionary attack Web service Public-key cryptography 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Java programming language Rootkit Trojan horse (computing) Wi-Fi Hacker Skype Hotmail PHP Online shop Windows Server 2003 Cryptographic hash function Internet slang Computer virus IEEE 802.11i Pretty Good Privacy Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing System/36 Password-authenticated key agreement Debugging Enterprise content management Internet Message Access Protocol Surveillance Server Independent Media Center GameFAQs Internet forum RFID Internet fraud Ontology (computer science) Web server SHA hash functions MDAC Object-oriented programming Free software British national identity card Challenge-response authentication Software agent Open Directory Project
