do we vegans and vegetarians really make a difference in the end i have been wondering about this for awhile there are many meat eaters in this world and from the way i see it so few vegans and vegetarians do we really reduce the killing of animals even though almost hundreds are slaughtered daily i believe we make a difference perhaps not int he number of cows right now but the more ofus there are the more that big business wants to please us the more products there are geared towards us on store shelves the more awareness it brings to the average shopper the more people there are tht are educating others on the health and cruelty aspects of why we don't eat animal products the more people might join the cause the more of us there are that push to make change the more people will be willing to accomodate that change being vegan has become a lot more popular these days than it was twenty years ago the more popular it becomes the more change will happen and you are definitely making a positive change in your health guaranteed stick with it kid you are part of something very important and i believe that many generations from now people will look back on the days when humans butchered animals for food as days of barabism and stupidity you know because animal protein causes cancer and heart disease and all that nasty stuff and yet people keep eating it duh Vegetarianism Veganism Dieting Kashrut Dairy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Livestock Taboo food and drink Vegetarian nutrition Egg (food) Slaughterhouse Milk Animal rights Factory farming Chicken Raw food diet Soybean Environmental vegetarianism Nutrition Meat analogue Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Vegetarian cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Animal Liberation Front Peter Singer Sausage Meat Vitamin C Fruitarianism Buddhist cuisine Gelatin Whaling Genetically modified food Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Cyanocobalamin Coronary heart disease French cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vegetarianism and religion Natural Hygiene Unclean animals Dairy cattle Cat Food guide pyramid Folic acid Punk ideology Ferret Domestic rabbit Hindu Atkins Nutritional Approach Pizza Protein Traditional Chinese medicine 613 mitzvot Hamburger Soy milk Cuisine of Brazil Kosher foods Binge eating disorder Hot dog Barbecue Barry Horne Soy protein Food storage In vitro meat Unreal Chocolate Escherichia coli O157:H7 Foot-and-mouth disease The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Guinea pig Prostate cancer Goat Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Time Out of Mind Shark Brain Marshmallow Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Korban Ecology Healthy eating Aspartame Korean cuisine Word of Wisdom Neolithic Revolution Ramen Horse meat Growth hormone treatment Fiddler on the Roof Tai Chi Chuan Christian Vegetarian Association Manual transmission Dog Human skin color Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
