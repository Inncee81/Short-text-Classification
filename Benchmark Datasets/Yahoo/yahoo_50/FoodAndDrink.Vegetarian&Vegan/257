i am a newby vegan i am also overweight lbs and ' but i do carry a lot of muscle because of my job so i don't look as heavy as i am will i lose weight i will stay true to my animal friends regardless but what has been your experience from what i've seen others experience diet alone will not be very affective it will likely work but very slowly unless you go on a fast or drastic reduced diet etc not a good idea that will ruin your already poor metabolism i have seen some huge people go healthy vegan but it took them a long long time to finally slim down to a more natural level of body fat but on the other hand i being a bicycle racer and etc know of some huge people who took up bicycle racing literally their fat just melted away in a year they were unrecognizable from when i first met them being so well normal looking they looked like a bicycle racer see diet does not really make you thin very affectively it is your metabolism that really determines whether or not your food get stored or gets put into your system waiting for you to do exercise if you train your body to expect that you will do exercise it will not be stored as fat doing bicycle racing for so many years when i eat i literally get so hot i usually have to take my shirt off my food simply goes to energy because my metabolism is very high you can be thin and on a bad diet if you do enough exercise but your health and performance will be better on a quality diet once you start intensive exercise and i mean trying as hard as you can going for the gold so to speak the fat storage will melt away exponentially it will start slow but gather speed as it goes along like a ball going down a hill your arteries will open up blood will flow faster they they will open faster and faster exponentially as the flow increases with this your performance will improve and you will go faster and further each time you head out to train vegan is the way to go i became one for athletics but i am the exact same weight after my diet change as before because i had already been bicycle racing for many years beforehand intensive exercise will force your body to it's optimum settings you will gain muscle but lose fat you will get to a point where you are actually gaining weight because muscle weight much more than fat but throw away the scale and just look in the mirror it's not about weight it's about health metabolism quality food less stress natural body fat levels etc etc obviously i'm an advocate for intensive exercise one more example every day on my way to school i crossed the track field there were these very fat women who where there every day walking at a quick pace around and around the track years went by and i never saw a difference in their body shape why because they always went at the same pace they never went as hard and as fast as they could never pushed themselves to their mental and physical limits if you would like to look like a slim trim buff athlete for example then become an athlete make goals join a racing club everyone will cheer you on you will likely be dead last at first but not for long hope what i said puts some spurs into ya and offers some encouragement Obesity Equine conformation Anorexia nervosa Insulin Hypoglycemia Swimming Bodybuilding Super Size Me Tocopherol Diabetes mellitus Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Low-carbohydrate diet Nutrition Triathlon Urinary incontinence Tai Chi Chuan Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Bicycle Marathon (sport) Drag racing Binge eating disorder Coronary heart disease Cancer Vitamin C Protein Chocolate Internal ballistics Vegetarianism Jet engine Stroke Growth hormone treatment Puberty Fast bowling Thermoregulation Milk Recumbent bicycle Folic acid Raw food diet Redundant array of independent disks Natural Selection (computer game) Trans fat Body mass index Osteoarthritis Electrophysiology Bicycle frame Chinese martial arts Weight loss Sugar substitute Babe Ruth Swingout Climbing specialist (cycling) RISC Domestic rabbit Explosive material Hamster Aerobic exercise Aikido Fusion power Terminal ballistics Fancy rat Action potential Handloading Poker jargon Inflation Homer Simpson Protein-energy malnutrition Sport rowing Piccolo Junior Saga Eye Personal rapid transit Stuttering Physical attractiveness Clinical depression Fanny Blankers-Koen Food Dairy Growth hormone deficiency Human height Carbon dioxide Team Fortress Classic Hiking Fecal incontinence Garfield
