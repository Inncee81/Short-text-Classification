how do i use tofu i have never before used tofu and i'm very low on money i'm what do you expect i'm not quiet sure what to do with it truth be told i've found recipes online but i'm weary of trying them because i can't go out and buy tofu all the time also some people i've asked say it tastes horrible and other's say the it depends on how you cook it and there's so many different kind the recipes i look at use tofu in replacement of chicken so basically how do i find the right kind of tofu for what i'm cooking and how should i go about the whole process i'm sure you guys are much better at it than me i know it's not the only way i can get protein but since i don't know how to use it at all i figured that i should at least learn how to use it and see if i like it etc ok so i've never had tofu before is there anything that it tastes like what should i expect from it tofu is mostly tasteless but that's a good thing it means you flavor it however you want i love the stuff could eat it times a day the easiest type of tofu to cook with is extra firm you'll find it in the refrigerated section near the produce in your supermarket it will be a block of tofu in a package with water labeled extra firm try this recipie i love it take the tofu out of the package drain it well mash it up with a fork until it looks like feta cheese put it in a non stick frying pan with maybe a little oil set the pan on medium add black pepper a couple dashes of soy sauce some chicken flavored seasoning if you can find some made without actual chicken and nutritional yeast flakes if you can find them if not try adding some garlic powder onion powder and tumeric watch the salt if you use soysauce or chicken flavor seasoning both those things are salty so if you use them you don't need to add salt let it simmer in those seasonings stirring only often enough to keep it from sticking to the pan when all the moisture extra water is gone and the tofu doesn't look so raw anymore then add some salsa my favorite original style pace picante mild and or some chopped diced tomatoes be sure to wait till tofu is almost done to add tomato products tomatoes can make other ingredients stop cooking let tofu cook with salsa and tomatoes for a couple more minutes remove from heat eat this scrambled tofu with a spoonfull of sour cream on a warm tortilla yum another maybe even easier recipie drain the block of tofu well cut into cubes whichever size you want put the cubes of tofu in a bowl large enough to stir them in add some soysauce and ginger powder stir gently you don't want to break the cubes up too much but you want to make sure the soy sauce and ginger powder gets on all the tofu let it sit in this mixture for a few minutes maybe fry in a non stick pan or with a little oil until you see hints of brown on the tofu it is super yummy on rice with sweet and sour sauce or you can add it to your stir fry vegetables asian noodles whatever asian food you want Pancake Nabemono In-N-Out Burger Basic taste Natt__ Brewery Sauce Cuisine of the Southern United States Soybean Pot Noodle Vegetarian cuisine German cuisine Cuisine of Africa Seitan Gumbo Pasta Soup Hot pot Potato Kraft Dinner Chinese cuisine Veganism Dumpling Cuisine of Cambodia Stir frying Stock (food) Soul food Rice Polish cuisine Cincinnati chili Tea McDonald's Food Coffee Miso Food preservation Dim sum Chicken Soy protein Cha chaan teng Rum Taiwanese cuisine D__ner kebab Risotto Cuisine of Greece Potato chips Canadian Chinese cuisine Beer Fish and chips Sake Beef noodle soup Domesticated turkey Chocolate Fried rice Ginger Meat analogue Milk Vegetarianism Kebab Cholent Porridge
