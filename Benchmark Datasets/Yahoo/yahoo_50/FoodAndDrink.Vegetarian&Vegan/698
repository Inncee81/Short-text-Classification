do you have many family and friends who are vego like you vego meaning either vegatarian or vegan i only know vegetarians not close friends of mine and not a single vegan as a vegan myself i think it would be benefitial to have at least one person in my life who shares my beliefs because it's hard getting people to understand me they all think i'm some sort of tree hugging hippy who is just going through a phase i'm not taken seriously i have no support it doesn't bother me so much i'd just like to have an intelligent conversation with someone about the meat and dairy industry without the other person becoming all defensive and disregarding all the facts i tell them operative word being facts it would also be great to learn from them because i know i have a lot left to learn can anyone relate well we are hare krsnas so my mother is vegetarien as well as my two sisters and my brother in law my uncle has been vegan for many years but i don't have much contact to him by now my brother is not a vegetarien and he is always complaining when he is visiting us because of the foodstuff he is so intolerant when i visit someone who isn't a vegetarien i am not acting like this some people really have problems with it espacially if you are vegetarien because of your religion for me it's not the only reason but thats something else in general i just ignore those people because i know that being a vegetarien is much more healthy than eating meat i knew some one who was really upset that we didn't eat meat because we could get sick and we need protein etc there are so many ways from where you can get protein you don't have to kill for it it is just important that you keep on goin don't listen to tghem some just want to challenge you but its not worth fighting it is just a waste of time Vegetarianism Veganism Dieting Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kashrut Peter Singer Animal rights Hindu Punk ideology Taboo food and drink Raw food diet The Smoking Room Friends Dairy Buddhism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Lisa the Vegetarian 613 mitzvot Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Phoebe Buffay Plame affair People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Intelligent design Kosher foods Meat analogue Animal Liberation Front Egg (food) Buddhist cuisine Vegetarian nutrition The nature of God in Western theology Cheese Vegetarian cuisine Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pizza Factory farming Year of the Spider Camp Lazlo Ron Weasley Epistemology Religious Society of Friends The Marshall Mathers LP Social rule Kodocha Fasting Soybean Family Protein True Crime: Streets of LA Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Tlingit Eastern Orthodox Church One Tree Hill (TV series) Whaling Christian anarchism Infantilism Prem Rawat Controversies in autism Paul of Tarsus God Emperor of Dune Cult Livestock Sharia Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Fairly OddParents Estoppel Singlish Goodness and value theory Chronic fatigue syndrome Abrahamic religion Food guide pyramid Religious conversion The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sola fide Social psychology McDonald's One Piece minor characters Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Yoda Animism Soul Person Meat John Howard Yoder Donald Davidson (philosopher) Non-cognitivism Sausage Socrates Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Coronary heart disease The Catcher in the Rye
