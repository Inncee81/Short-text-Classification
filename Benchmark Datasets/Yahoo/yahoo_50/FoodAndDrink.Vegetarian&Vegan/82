how come vegans can't eat honey just curious is honey vegan again it depends on one's definition of vegan insects are animals and so insect products such as honey and silk are not traditionally considered vegan many vegans however are not opposed to using insect products because they do not believe insects are conscious of pain moreover even if insects were conscious of pain it's not clear that the production of honey involves any more pain for insects than the production of most vegetables since the harvesting and transportation of all vegetables involves many 'collateral' insect deaths the question remains a matter of scientific debate and personal choice however when cooking or labeling food for vegans particularly vegans you don't know it's best to be on the safe side and not include honey Veganism Vegetarianism Kosher foods Food Animal rights Peter Singer Foodborne illness Korean cuisine Hard-line Vegetarian cuisine Kashrut Raw food diet Livestock Sausage Insect Ethical consumerism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Organic farming Vegetarian nutrition Taboo food and drink Dieting Factory farming Ecology Spider Abortion debate Unclean animals Buddhist cuisine Chocolate Human Gelatin Wine Breakfast Cuisine of Brazil Organic food Pancake Manna Paleolithic diet Traditional Chinese medicine Hamster Pesticide Egg (food) Pizza Rice Diseases of the honeybee Tofu Meat analogue Artificial consciousness Fruitarianism Soul Genetic engineering Nutrition Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Terri Schiavo Bee Rapeseed Genetically modified food Death Fugu Cuisine of Africa Dairy Porridge Animism Culture of Africa Acorn Sustainable agriculture Fast food Scientific method Food preservation Stomach cancer Food guide pyramid Healthy eating Green Revolution Alcohol fuel French cuisine Soy milk Guinea pig Food science Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Whaling Cochineal Addiction Jewish cuisine Fairtrade labelling Global warming and agriculture Chicken Capital punishment Aspartame Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Maize Freeganism Atkins Nutritional Approach Meaning of life Gaucho (insecticide)
