why vegan i have to say that i can understand being vegetarian for ethical reasons such as being against animal slaughter but i will be honest and say with respect that i don't really understand the vegan viewpoint milk eggs honey none of these things are products that hurt the animals i mean what's wrong with healthy food like yogurt and free range eggs and honey so why choose a path as tough as veganism why are you vegan would love to have some light shed on this interested in hearing answers well yes of course i understand in the case of lactose intolerance this question is for people who have reasons behind it other than medical ones some very good points no one has addressed honey or free range eggs yet though i am vegan because i don't think animals are on this earth to produce food for myself or any human they are sentient creatures that do not deserve to be treated as property most dairy cows and chickens must endure miserable lives and are killed once their production of milk and eggs are considered no longer as profitable their lives mean nothing more than the products they produce being vegan is not a tough path at all i wouldn't trade it for the world ok let me try honey bees are killed in the honey harvesting process but even more compelling for me is the fact that bees do not make honey for humans it does not belong to us the bees make that for themselves i haven't eaten honey in years and i am healthy as a horse free range eggs if you are buying these from the store and have never visited the farm who knows what conditions these chickens really live and you must deal with the fact that all the male chicks that are hatched are destroyed some chicks are hatched to replace the older hens if you know the farm or get the eggs from your own chicken i still have a problem with it since that egg doesn't belong to you you don't need to eat it so why take it plus the thought of eggs is just gross thanks for asking an intelligent thoughtful question we don't get alot of those around here Dairy Livestock Theory of conduct Animal rights Chicken Egg (food) Factory farming Kosher foods Kashrut Agriculture Honeybee Food Organic food Lactose intolerance People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Vegetarianism and religion Peter Singer Cheese Alignment (role-playing games) Taboo food and drink Yoghurt Vegetarian cuisine Dairy product Chocolate Honey Goodness and value theory Dairy farming Ecology Dieting Dairy cattle David Hume Ethical consumerism Simone Weil Raw food diet Bird Guns, Germs, and Steel Omega-3 fatty acid Pizza Person Religion Utilitarianism Diseases of the honeybee Economics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bee Buddhist cuisine Buddhism Abortion debate Creationism Shark Hard-line The chicken or the egg Snake Microeconomics Tofu Crohn's disease Breastfeeding Cat Ethics Meaning of life Beehive (beekeeping) Paradox Scientology beliefs and practices Unclean animals Kodocha Sant Mat Determinism Pysanka Theodicy Causality Raw milk Ice cream Philosophical skepticism Insect Nicomachean Ethics Organic farming Punk ideology John Howard Yoder Intelligent design Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Animal Liberation Front Socrates 613 mitzvot Lisa the Vegetarian Famine Africanized bee Traditional Chinese medicine Human Escherichia coli O157:H7 Roman eating and drinking
