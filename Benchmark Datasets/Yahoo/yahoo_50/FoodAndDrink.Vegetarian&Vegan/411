what happens when we dont eat carbohydrate this is for a peice of work im doing thanks true you don't need carbohydrates if you want to live for at least a while anyway your brain unfortunately likes to exclusively use glucose from carbohydrates as an energy source unlike other organs it cannot fully utilize fats and proteins as an alternative energy source once you have depleted your carbohydrate reserves glycogen which sometimes can be as quickly as an overnight fast your brain will start to look for alternative sources of fuel either from glucose formed by new synthesis ok for a while or eventually from the breakdown of fat into what are called ketone bodies this will happen in the liver unfortunately the catabolism or breakdown of ketone bodies for energy is incomplete and over time the buildup of ketone bodies will lead to ketoacidosis or ketosis a situation where the elevated amounts of ketone bodies in the blood if this continues for long term a slew of problems may start to develop eventually leading to symptoms of starvation or diabetes this is why high protein high fat diets must be done carefully with a full understanding of the diet involved most of these diets may call for the absence of all carbs early for a short time with then a reintroduction of good carbs high in fiber and complex nature personally i would try to avoid it unless you're really in a situation where the benefits of weight loss are going to offset any risks from the diet Diabetic ketoacidosis Carbohydrate Low-carbohydrate diet Glucose Insulin Glycogen storage disease type I Ketone bodies Ketoacidosis Weight training Ketone Glucokinase Protein-energy malnutrition Biochemistry Glycogen Protein Liver Nutrient Nutrition Hyperglycemia Glycemic index Cirrhosis Fatty acid Fasting Bodybuilding Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Veganism Food Coronary heart disease Anorexia nervosa Cancer Glucocorticoid South Beach diet Acetone Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Growth hormone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milk Vegetarianism Citric acid cycle Hypercholesterolemia Tocopherol Hemoglobin Fatty acid metabolism Omega-3 fatty acid Haemochromatosis Folic acid Diabetic neuropathy Marathon (sport) Muscle Sugar substitute Metabolism Diabetic hypoglycemia Blood sugar Dietary fiber Binge eating disorder Coenzyme A Guinea pig Stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep Stomach cancer Alzheimer's disease Calorie restriction Caffeine Sugar Hypertension Obesity Obstetrics Dialysis Exercise Mitochondrial genetics Traumatic brain injury Action potential Glycemia Lac operon Epilepsy Kidney Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoporosis Decompression sickness Starch Diabetic retinopathy Cell (biology) Vitamin
