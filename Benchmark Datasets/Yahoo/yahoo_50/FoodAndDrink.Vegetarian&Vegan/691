push me over the line please i'm a vegetarian and i am really trying hard to be a vegan but i can't do it because i'm always hungry and i don't have time to make special meals every day to ensure i'm getting adequate amounts of protein and a few essential vitamins and minerals it's also hard socially because i'm going out a lot and there's never anything vegan friendly i'm someone who can't go hungry without getting irritable and i hate the feeling i'm not a nice person to be around once i eat something vegetarian i just tell myself well i've already screwed up i may as well make the most of it and start again tomorrow in other words i'm a lazy vegan wannabe i guess what i'm asking for you to do is just reinforce the reasons why i should become a vegan i'm being stupid and lazy and need a kick in the head to wake up i don't eat meat never it's just small things like dairy and products containing eggs those sorts of things i'm not taking it seriously and i wish that i could cupcake it's not about me it's about saving the animals and the environment i care about that but i don't have enough self discipline to stop myself from making the wrong food choices i'm asking for encourgement if you don't have the answer then rack off i don't want to hear about your eating habits if thats not my question second that to all three of you there's no point answering a question with jibberish when it's not relevant i'm not asking whether i should eat meat or not go enjoy your steak and leave others be once i eat something vegetarian i just tell myself 'well i've already screwed up i may as well make the most of it and start again tomorrow' that is an absolutely terrible way to think even if you eat something with dairy or egg in it you should not let that sabotage the rest of your meals for the day i'm sure you can do it i don't have a lot of time for special meals either i make them as i go they really don't take long to cook i'm not sure if you are asking a question about good protein sources or not but nuts nut butters leafy greens tofu soy milk soy products and protein bars all provide protein and none of which take a long time to prepare if you eat a well balanced varied diet you are almost guaranteed to get all of the vitamins and minerals you could even back that up with a multi vitamin as for getting irritable when being hungry that isn't good think about all of the starving children in africa you have little reason to get irritable start carrying around snacks for when you get hungry i e fresh veggies fruit nuts it would help to get rid of all of the dairy and egg in your house that way you can't eat any of it and ruin your day you need to take this seriously all lives should be taken seriously Dieting Food Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarian nutrition Cheese Kashrut Healthy eating Guinea pig Korean cuisine Soy milk Meat analogue Dairy Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence Hamster Food guide pyramid Cuisine of the Philippines Milk Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Brazil Japanese cuisine Kosher foods Bengali cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sausage Organic food Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Buddhist cuisine Crohn's disease Meal Chinese cuisine Chicken French cuisine Peter Singer Ice cream Nutrition Pizza Garfield Vegetarianism and religion Vitamin C Soy protein Ramen Protein Tlingit Stomach cancer Baldrick Bodybuilding Domestic rabbit Coronary heart disease Cat Cantonese cuisine Chili con carne Coffee 613 mitzvot Little Britain Anorexia nervosa Peruvian cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian German cuisine Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Folic acid Peanut Japanese tea ceremony Snack food Cake Cuisine of Singapore Fruitarianism Peanut butter Cyanocobalamin Cuisine of Africa Rickets Livestock Hypoglycemia Taiwanese cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Acorn Fancy rat Factory farming Natt__ Comanche Jewish cuisine Breastfeeding
