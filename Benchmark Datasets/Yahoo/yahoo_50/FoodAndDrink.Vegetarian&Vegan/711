vegetarianism any suggestions for a big meat eater that is about to make the jump anyone else went from few veggies to only veggies any suggestions on doing it successfully it is not as hard as some meat eaters make it out to be before i went vegetarian i was a major meat eater i hated vegetables i would only eat carrots and corn one day i decided to become vegetarian and haven't looked back since i think the key is knowing what to cook and i'll admit at first i was not happy with what i was eating as my recipes were limited when i found more recipes i just collect them from everywhere books friends internet etc i discovered that i wasn't missing anything taste wise by not eating meat if i really liked a meat based dish i found a way to make it vegetarian it wasn't the meat i missed but the dishes themselves i loved chicken and broccoli so i found that tofu and broccoli was just as good when i missed tacos i replaced the meat with taco seasoned rice sloppy joes i used lentils it all about creativity i also found that the more vegetables i ate the more i liked them i used to hate broccoli unless it was chicken and broccoli now it is one of my favorite veggies the same with cauliflower asparagus for some of the veggies it took a few times mostly experimenting with cooking steaming times etc there is nothing in meat that you cannot get from a vegetarian diet remember to eat a large variety of fruits vegetables beans and grains to make the switch some do it all at once and others do it gradually there are different benefits from both ways all at once is more final no way to tell yourself tomorrow i'll cut out the i don't feel like doing it today while gradual gives you a chance to find recipes and get used to not eating meat over time cutting out a different meat each week Vegetarian cuisine Tofu Veganism Japanese cuisine MRE Cuisine of Denmark Chinese cuisine Food Cuisine of Singapore Bengali cuisine Soup Ramen Mexican cuisine Barbecue Cuisine of Malaysia Chili con carne Russian cuisine French cuisine Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Africa German cuisine Taiwanese cuisine Soul food Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Southern United States Cajun cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines American Chinese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Bread Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Buddhist cuisine Chicken soup Meat analogue Curry McDonald's Cuisine of Cambodia Cheese Potato Dim sum Hot dog Roman eating and drinking Kashrut Sushi Raw food diet Minestrone Egg (food) Cat Dumpling Kosher foods Pizza Burger Domesticated turkey British cuisine Sandwich Idli VeggieTales Cholent Cuisine of Laos Dieting Vitamin C Chicken Polish cuisine Gumbo Food guide pyramid Broccoli Culture of India Swedish cuisine Shabu-shabu Lisa the Vegetarian Hot pot Couscous Food storage Snack food Sausage Agriculture Kebab Meat Loaf Cuisine of Ethiopia Fried rice D__ner kebab In-N-Out Burger Paella Miso Street food Pickling Antioxidant Taco Stuffing Cuisine of Greece
