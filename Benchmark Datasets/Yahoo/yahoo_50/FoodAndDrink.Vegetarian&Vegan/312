anyother one of my many questions ok im asking this because i think if this were to happen i would ok my questin is if a cow was to die of old age would you eat it i would if it died without beging killed would you no unless there was an autopsy performed you really don't know what the cow died from he could've had cancer or something not safe but i do understand what you're saying and the answer is no for me the only way i could see me doing that is if i was deserted with no food but the cow and he was my last option even then i don't know how to create fire without matches so i would probably just starve to death because i sure as heck wouldn't eat him raw Abstraction (computer science) Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cattle Livestock Glen Jacobs Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Escherichia coli O157:H7 Buddhism Growth hormone treatment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Horse meat Hitler's death Philosophical skepticism RuneScape quests Dairy Kurt Cobain 28 Days Later Anorexia nervosa Diablo II: Lord of Destruction John F.
