teen vegan i have been a lacto ovo vegetarian for almost a year now and really want to become a vegan i don't want to wait until i turn when i am out on my own i've seen how animals are treated and i don't want to support it i also want to become a vegan to help me lose weight and be healthier and of course for the animals i already use a lot of soy milk and i have a whole foods near my home but can't go a lot so i normally shop at target and wal mart the thing is i don't think my parents would approve and they buy my food what are good ways to transfer to a vegan diet should i cook them stuff and show them how much easier it is for me and healthier at one house my parents cook at my other house i normally am left to cook for myself any tips would be very helpful thank you because i really need advice d explain to them in a rational manner your reasons contrary to popular belief it is not more expensive to be vegan as long as you aren't buying lot of meat and cheese substitutes the only thing you really need substitute wise is soy milk and you can get gv brand organic soymilk at wal mart for per gallon its the same thing as silk all gv products are made by national brands if they buy healthy food it shouldn't be that hard just some tofu a few extra fruits vegetables and grains all of which are cheaper than meat if you want some treat from whole foods then just buy them with your own money if your parents won't get them for you and don't think that just because your parents make the rules that they are always good for you parents aren't perfect and they don't always know best i see a lot of parents become downright hostile when they're kids decide to go veg and i think it's absolutely stupid and nothing but a power trip on behalf of the parent Veganism Vegetarianism Soy milk Soybean Tofu Meat analogue Vegetarian cuisine Cheese Milk Dairy Food Egg (food) Dieting Healthy eating Buddhist cuisine Wal-Mart Kosher foods Japanese cuisine Ice cream Vegetarianism and religion Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of Brazil Chocolate Vitasoy Animal rights Atkins Nutritional Approach Domestic rabbit Korean cuisine Food guide pyramid Ramen Crohn's disease Theory of conduct Ethical consumerism Organic food Livestock Factory farming Guinea pig Soy sauce Dog Environmental vegetarianism Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Soup Fecal incontinence Pizza Breastfeeding Taiwanese cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Pancake Microeconomics Breakfast Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Peter Singer Cuisine of Denmark Lactobacillus acidophilus Cuisine of Malaysia Gelatin Lactose intolerance Prostate cancer British cuisine Value added Punk ideology Nutrition Cuisine of Singapore Low-carbohydrate diet In-N-Out Burger People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Burger Mayonnaise Soy protein Vitamin C Tooth Paleolithic diet Food preservation Fermentation Chili con carne Coronary heart disease Health insurance 613 mitzvot Barbecue French cuisine Quorn McDonald's Animal Liberation Front Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Infantilism Chinese cuisine
