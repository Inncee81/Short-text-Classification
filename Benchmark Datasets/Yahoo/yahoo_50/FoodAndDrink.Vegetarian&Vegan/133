natural flavors vegan or no i seen it on a package of motts no sugar added applesauce and it has natural flavors i know some is meat derived but is that also meat derived you've most likely got a bigger problem than the natural flavors they list mott's is one of several large 'fruit product' companies that uses animal based enzymes in the processing of their fruit before everyone starts tding me here's the deal with enzymes and fruit products under us and canadian maybe uk food law food processing companies are allowed to not list ingredients that are used to process the food product and are substantially destroyed or degraded during the processing of the final product mott's and quite a few other juice companies use animal based digestive enzymes to break down the cellulose walls in the fruit so that more fluid juice can be extracted from the fruit in production of products like applesauce these same enzymes mean less cooking is needed to break the apples down into sauce saves a lot on their power bill g since the enzymes are destroyed as they break the cell walls they are under the law no longer present in the product and so the law allows the company to not list that they use them don't believe me contact the company and ask them how they process their fruit evil grin Food Veganism Brewery Enzyme Kosher foods Raw food diet Beer Honey Cheese Gastrointestinal tract Sauce Vegetarianism Vitamin C Tofu Apple Milk Rum Food preservation Alcoholic beverage Ice cream Stomach Flavouring Digestion Sewage treatment Mayonnaise Kashrut Food science Sausage Fecal incontinence Bacteria Cell (biology) Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Soy sauce Alcohol fuel Nutrition Starch Chocolate Cuisine of Africa Halaal Soybean Gelatin Vinegar Dairy Tooth Auxin Soy milk Natt__ Protein Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of the Philippines Brewing French cuisine Bread Aspartame Yoghurt Organic food Pancreas Lactose intolerance Domesticated turkey Coffee Sake Black pepper Sauerkraut Cuisine of the Southern United States Glycerin Champagne (beverage) Pasteurization Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine Healthy eating Hamster Compost Bacon Ramen Peruvian cuisine Nutmeg Banana Ketchup Apple pie Foodborne illness Soup Stock (food) Refrigerator car Ham Cuisine of Singapore Polish cuisine Salad Cajun cuisine Glucose Egg (food)
