good excuse for not becoming vegan i love the taste of meat because that's something ingrained in me by family and general society growing up now as an adult i have become aware of the atrocious way animals are raised and processed for human consumption so i want to become vegan it's a hard slow transition since i like meat so now and then i come up with several useless excuses which i ultimately know don't hold any weight what about this excuse though i've been reading articles on the internet and have not come across someone who has addressed this excuse the meat dairy egg industry will continue to do what they do anyway as encouraged by the government so what's the harm in me continuing to eat meat if me turning into a vegan won't really change anything on the planet i admire your honesty however yes it makes a difference for every person that supports the meat industry it just gives the thumbs up to them that what they are doing is okay i too grew up on meat and would have never considered giving it up i developed many food allergies including meat and poultry and was forced to give it up overnight until then i had no clue how shockingly cruel the meat and milk industry was i had never had any reason to find out now that i know the truth i couldn't with a clear concience eat meat even if i could tolerate it i am quite comfortable with my vegetarian diet now over years veggie and now find meat repulsive if you choose to make the transition educate yourself on the many reasons meat is unhealthy such as it being loaded with bacteria parasites hormones steroids antibiotics etc it truly is a gross proposition when you are armed with the facts i prefer my plant and grain based diet any day i no longer crave meat in the least thanks for your honesty but i think if you were truly honest with yourself you would realize that this argument doesnt hold water it wasnt until people jumped on the cause in droves that women were allowed to vote remember the less people supporting the meat industry and the more learning the truth about it the better off we will be in the long run perhaps you can open your mind to the idea of just lowering your meat intake for now and gradually eliminate it every little bit helps it doesnt have to be an all or nothing approach Kashrut Milk Factory farming Dieting Dairy Livestock Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Vegetarian cuisine Organic farming Animal rights Kosher foods Taboo food and drink Nutrition Organic food Tooth Raw food diet Egg (food) Vegetarianism and religion Meat analogue Vegetarian nutrition Low-carbohydrate diet Environmental vegetarianism Whaling Cheese Agriculture Chicken Protein Omega-3 fatty acid Tofu Acne Buddhism Dog Crohn's disease Fasting Guinea pig Meat Peter Singer Transsexuality Coronary heart disease Fecal incontinence Free trade 613 mitzvot Vitamin C Cuisine of Brazil Buddhist cuisine Puberty Soy milk Alcoholics Anonymous Cat Theodicy Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Prostate cancer Brain People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Sausage Theory of conduct Slaughterhouse Obesity Zinc Honesty Domesticated turkey Neolithic Revolution Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bodybuilding Hypoglycemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Allergy Food guide pyramid Ferret Stone Age Human Folic acid Lie Inflation Economy of the People's Republic of China Lactose intolerance Animal Liberation Front Domestication Human height Super Size Me Chocolate Ethical consumerism Clean animals Person McDonald's Colorectal cancer
