farsighted and nearsighted i am almost and i have a farsighted eye and a nearsighted eye i hate the way my eyes look in glasses one of my eyes is magnified and the other looks shrunk my prescription right sphere cylinder axis left sphere cylinder axis i know that i am not yet and my eyes will keep changing up to a certain age however i want to know how high my sphere numbers could get in my eyes before they level off maximum possible estimate considering that my eyes will get worse with time just because of age until they finally level off i'm assuming that nothing weird would happen to my eyes like i would get cataracts i'm afraid that before my eyes level off i might get to the point where i'll be wear a lens in my left eye and a some number lens in the other eye and i will look like a total weirdo in glasses would wearing contacts help to minimize the difference in my eye sizes as they are perceived also i know that nearsightedness gets worse with time does farsightedness get more extreme with time i mean when you are a kid not when you get prebyopia as an adult i ask because my left i used to be slightly farsighted when i was probably as a result of my right eye being lazy before it was corrected but then it went nearsighted with time so i figured that farsightedness lessens with time in normal circumstances i cetainly don't want my farsighted eye prescription to go up in magnitude to like a or anything then i would really look like a freak if i were wearing like a sphere in one eye and a in the other eye actually i know that the sphere of means that i am nearsighted in my left eye first of all your at an age where your eyes are almost stabilized meaning you may have some slight changes but not major this is the norm anyway contact lenses would certainly be ideal for you as they will not make your eyes look any different however if you have a lazy eye the dr may have prescribed prism in your lenses that cannot be corrected with contact lenses do you see anything on your prescription that has a triangle with a number and arrrow beside it if not i would definitely discuss getting contact lenses with the dr some advantages of getting contacts if you are a candidate that is are aesthetically your eyes will appear the same better overall vision less change in your rx overtime as the contacts do not allow for as much change in the shape of the eye Eyeglass prescription Glasses Myopia Lens (optics) Strabismus Aberration in optical systems Stereoscopy Eye Intraocular lens View camera Amblyopia Sunglasses Headlight Hipparchus (astronomer) Photographic lens Keratoconus Perspective projection distortion Autostereogram Light Map projection Loudspeaker ELO rating system Carburetor History of telescopes Amateur telescope making Archimedes Geodesy Digital photography Electrophysiology Explosive material Collision detection Refractive surgery Presbyopia Perspective (graphical) Movie projector Chromatic aberration LASIK Orthogonal matrix Equine conformation Dimension Diabetic retinopathy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Polarization Complex number Car handling Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Eye contact Shen Gong Wu Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Motor oil Phonograph cylinder Stuttering Phase-shift keying Laser engraving Telescope Tocopherol Point groups in three dimensions Color blindness Monocle Sphere Diplopia Circuit design E85 Nystagmus Sundial Photorefractive keratectomy Bloodstain pattern analysis Microphone M__bius transformation Strategic management Diffraction Rolling-element bearing IMAX Motorcycle Inflation Methamphetamine Infantilism Nuclear weapon design Microeconomics Medical prescription Ultraviolet Technicolor Social rule Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diabetes mellitus Bipolar disorder Trilobite Cataract Prolactinoma Age of Enlightenment Laser Jet engine
