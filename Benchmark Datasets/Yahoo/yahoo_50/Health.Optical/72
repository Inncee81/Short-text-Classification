a friend says a dr told her glasses make your eyes weaker my friend squints horribly when trying to read something but when i told her go get contacts if you don t want glasses she said a dr told her glasses only make your eyes weaker than they are i think if your eyes are bad enough to squint you already have weak eyes what is your opinion a lot of people including me think that wearing glasses and or contacts can make your eyes dependant on the glasses so they do get slowly worse i think of it as your eyes start to relax as they get used to the luxury of glasses and they need the glasses so pretty much once you start wearing glasses contacts you have to wear them forever Social rule Glasses Eyeglass prescription Glass Myopia Theory of conduct Sunglasses Pitaten Aberration in optical systems Denis Law The Ashlee Simpson Show Steve Taylor Monocle Milton H.
