can i hook up my peavey bass amplifier to my stereo i bought the amp when i was gonna learn the bass guitar but that fizzled out because i had no talent for bass so now i've got this nice bass amp sitting around unused it's like a watter it would be nice to plug it into my stereo and get some good bass that way it would not increase the music's bass response beyond your stereos integrated amps capabilities if the stereos bass response is say hz the bass amp will not increase the input signal it will just amplify it Bass guitar Instrument amplifier Amplifier Electric guitar Operational amplifier High fidelity Jack plug Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electronic amplifier Adam Jones Jimi Hendrix Eddie Van Halen Magnetic cartridge Loudspeaker Multitrack recording Ampeg Guitar Arch Enemy Effects unit Rockman (music) Microphone Peavey Electronics Grateful Dead Atari ST Stereophonic sound Audio level compression Music Man (company) Effects pedal Xbox Pet Sounds Fender Mixing console Audiophile RCA connector Kirk Hammett Megadeth Marshall Amplification Pickup (music) Synthesizer Double bass Spinal Tap (band) Valve sound Sound reinforcement system Vacuum tube Subwoofer Nominal impedance DIN connector Journey (band) IPod Chris Squire James Hetfield Rickenbacker Zakk Wylde Mesa Boogie Alice Cooper Analog computer Gramophone record Rhodes piano Kenwood Electronics Electrophysiology TRS connector FM broadcasting The Pet Sounds Sessions Receiver (radio) Vox (musical equipment) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Binaural recording John Deacon Sound Blaster Super Audio CD James Jamerson Mike Watt Frequency modulation Decibel Oscilloscope Transistor Peter Hook Walkman Headphones Telephone exchange The Apples in Stereo Leo Fender Circuit design Home cinema George Crumb Car audio Miami bass Therion (band) Brian May John Frusciante DVD-Audio Electrostatic loudspeaker ABS-CBN Nine Inch Nails Valve amplifier Sgt.
