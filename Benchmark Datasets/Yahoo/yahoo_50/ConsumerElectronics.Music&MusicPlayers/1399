ipod nano emits strange beeping sound my ipod nano just recently was charging during a very bad thunderstorm and when i played it the day after everything was just fine then i tried to put it to sleep to turn it off and save battery and it would not shut off i figured maybe this could be fixed by resetting it i reset it and then now it is showing the backlight on the apple symbol in the middle of the screen and emits a note tone the tone comes from the ipod itself and not though headphones as it still emits whether the headphones are attached or not when i connect it to the computer the computer does not appear to register that it is there am thinking only option is to let it run out of batteries and tinker with it then anybody else had any good outcomes from a problem like this or suggestions you want to reset the ipod hold menu and the middle button and immediately afterwords switch it into disk mode hold play and menu after that plug it in and things may just take care of themselves if that does not work you will want to try to restore the ipod to do that you need to open itunes select your ipod if it is still refusing to show up make sure you charged it duh and repeat the earlier steps there should be a restore button in about the center of your screen click it and pick the options you like best factory restore is most likely to work but say goodbye to your music if you use it that is as good advice as i can give you if all the above fails i am sorry but i can not help you IPod nano Apple Computer IPod shuffle IPod mini Mouse (computing) Embedded system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family ITunes Music Store Gramophone record PlayStation Portable Windows XP Creative Zen Walkman Oscilloscope Digital audio player Nintendo DS USB flash drive Apple Newton Disc jockey Headphones Apple IIGS Floppy disk Game Boy Advance FireWire Hello world program Gameking Windows 2000 Game Boy Micro IPod photo FairPlay Screenshot AmigaOS Pump It Up Video game music Toyota Prius Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Danger Hiptop Game Boy Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Jack plug Laptop Microsoft Windows DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Palm OS Macintosh Finder History of Microsoft Windows Macromedia Flash Modem Audiophile Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Redundant array of independent disks Phreaking Diablo II: Lord of Destruction ILife QuickTime DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Mac OS X v10.4 DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Pinball Mac mini ZX Spectrum Poker jargon DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Nintendo Entertainment System Beatmania IIDX Tag Dance Dance Revolution C64 Direct-to-TV Apple II family IBM PC compatible Commodore 64 Handheld game console Ethernet Hayes command set Podcasting Violin Switch Fire alarm control panel Advance Wars: Dual Strike Touchpad Relay Konami Code Flute AlphaSmart Synthesizer Mixtape Taskbar Apple typography Tungsten Handheld
