how do i download my music to an ipod into seperate libraries depending on album i want to have my albums under different libraries but everytime i sync they all go one library im not very good with technical language try to make the language easy to understand i am not sure if the albums you refer to are your on cds or albums you are purchasing from itunes i suppose it dosen't really matter anyway if it is your own cd first import it into your itunes main library you may have to rename all the tracks because sometimes they come up as track track etc do each album one at a time or you might get lost when you have that done click the icon create a playlist name the playlist whatever you like and then drag the song titles from your main library into the playlist as far as i know you can create as many playlists as you want so have fun if you are downloading albums from itunes itself do the same thing except you don't have to rename song titles as this is already done when you have finished connect your ipod and all the playlists you have will sync over to ipod i am sure there are other people out there with an easier way but this is what i did and it worked all right might seem a bit tedious but i enjoyed it one of the things i most like about itunes is how you can keep it neat and tidy hope this makes sense ITunes ITunes Music Store IPod shuffle FairPlay SonicStage Mixtape Digital rights management Black Eyed Peas U2 (band) IPhoto Playlist Rhythmbox MP3 Gramophone record Digital audio player Apple Computer QuickTime We Belong Together Walkman You Are the Quarry Real Love (song) IPod mini Perl RealNetworks Napster (pay service) Classic rock Bohemian Rhapsody Copyleft Shake It Off Don't Believe the Truth Video game music Extraordinary Machine Advanced Audio Coding The Chemical Brothers Aerial (dance move) Social rule Podcasting Billboard magazine Rufus Wainwright Disc jockey The Emancipation of Mimi Last.fm WNNX (FM) Whitney Houston Girls Aloud 2000 Australian Grand Prix Moby GNOME Sly & the Family Stone Janet Jackson Spice Girls Hung Up (song) Language.
