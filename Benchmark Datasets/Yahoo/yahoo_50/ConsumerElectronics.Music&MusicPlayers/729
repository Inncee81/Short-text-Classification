ipod fixing is there any way you can fix an ipod nano after its been through the washing machine please help you can try just letting it dry on it's own for a few weeks just don't play with the ipod for a few weeks or you may damage it worse if there is still water inside it and you try turning it on if it is less than a year old take it to an apple shop or go online and fill out a service form and send it in but if it's over a year old and you don't have a warranty extension and the letting it dry method does not work then it is better off you go and buy a new one because if you take it to the apple shop to have it fixed it will cost you alot of money my ipod broke and to fix a tiny little piece of metal in the headphone jack it was going to be apple stores are over priced and the inside of the ipod is only held together by tape so if you do decide to get a new one i wouldn't recommend the apple ipod video ones but i haven't seen the inside of a nano so i dont know if they are held together by tape like the video ones IPod Apple Computer ITunes Music Store IPod nano ITunes IPod mini Gramophone record FairPlay USB flash drive IPod shuffle IMac Atari 8-bit family Bong Digital audio player Apple Macintosh IPod photo Floppy disk Commodore 64 Podcasting Walkman Online music store Commodore International Compact audio cassette Creative Zen Disc jockey Poker jargon Surveillance Ocean's Twelve Napster (pay service) Steve Jobs Coffee Apple typography Knife Mac mini Casting FireWire Headphones Loss leader Madonna (entertainer) Digital rights management Hard disk Laserdisc U2 (band) Apple IIGS Video game crash of 1983 ILife Jack Tramiel Electrophysiology Star Wars kid Bulk vending Apple II family IBM PC compatible Retailer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Computer MP3 Windows XP Linux kernel Microeconomics Embedded system X Window System Naval mine The Apprentice 2 Wheel of Fortune Mattress Upholstery Dairy Fecal incontinence Mac OS X Marine aquarium Copy protection Marina District The End of the World (Doctor Who) Mac OS X v10.4 Redundant array of independent disks PLATO Apple Store Solar power Woodworking Compact disc QuickTime Wal-Mart Printed circuit board Textile manufacturing Best Buy Advanced Audio Coding Copyleft PowerPC Overclocking RealNetworks Warranty Mutual fund Neighbours Screw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Carbon dioxide Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis BASIC programming language Filling station Halting problem
