what should i buy a psp gb or an ipod video gb thinking about putting videos music photos and having a good entertainment system without taking too much place in my pocket wich one is best wich one is more simple to use im freaking out i think you should get the psp if you really want it for gaming but not for videos a new psp which is basically a redesigned psp pspee lol will come out next month so wait and it will cost the same as the original also a psp can't hold much video with gb to be honest only movies you need that space for other stuff like game saves music and photos but if you don't need videos then the psp is for you i think if you want music video and photos only you should just get a gb zune and not an ipod a gb zune costs the same as gb ipod and have more features i hope this helps you make up your mind with what you want to buy PlayStation Portable Game Boy IPod Handheld game console Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games Sega Nintendo Handheld video game Electronic Arts Wipeout (game) Apple Computer ITunes PlayStation 3 Apple Macintosh Sony Computer Entertainment IGN ITunes Music Store History of computer and video games Video game music The Sims 2 Final Fantasy Disc jockey Twisted Metal Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Breath of Fire III SpongeBob SquarePants Console wars Sonic the Hedgehog Magic (illusion) IPod photo Intellivision Street Fighter Alpha Paintball Wheel of Fortune Game development Ubisoft Neopets USB flash drive GamePark Advertising Redundant array of independent disks Persona (video game) Video game crash of 1983 Atari 2600 N-Gage Wireless Application Protocol Worms (computer game) WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 IMac IPod shuffle Xbox Star Trek Syphon Filter Poker jargon TurboGrafx 16 Action Replay Computer and video game genres Machinima Need for Speed History of video games (Sixth generation era) WWE SmackDown!
