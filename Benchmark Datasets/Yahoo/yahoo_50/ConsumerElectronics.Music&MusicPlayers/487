how do i hook up my stereo to my tv for sound just got cable music on my tv and have bought some rca wire to hook it up but have no idea whatsoever on how to do it stereo is an antiquated system so is the tv eegads does your tv have audio outputs probably a pair of rca plugs or just a cable antenna connection sometimes they do and sometimes you'll need to get an rf converter first odds are you will if the tv's very old but they're pretty easy to find if you don't know what i'm talking about just ask or browse through electronics somewhere so you even have some out s to hook up to what about the inputs to your stereo's amplifier rca plugs or just wires that hook into holes screws whatever i've never actually had the problem of trying to go from rca's to just wires but i suppose you might be able to just strip off the wires and use them on the other end if that's the case at least i'm guessing that's what you need to know other people just tell me i'm an idiot if i totally missed something Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RCA connector Jack plug SCART Television Xbox D-subminiature Loudspeaker TRS connector IPod Vacuum tube Synthesizer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari ST Transformer Electronic amplifier Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mixing console Impedance matching Audiophile Universal Serial Bus Oscilloscope High fidelity Telephone exchange Cable television DIN connector Gramophone record Bluetooth Receiver (radio) FM broadcasting Xbox 360 Sound recording Musical Instrument Digital Interface S-Video Microphone Seismometer RCA Nominal impedance Spark plug Sound reinforcement system Nintendo Entertainment System Decibel Electronics BS 1363 Federal Communications Commission Operational amplifier Hearing aid Phonograph NTSC Software-defined radio XERF Computer bus Commodore 64 Earring AT&T Sega CD NBC Radar Digital Magnetic cartridge Wire Balanced audio Bombe Stereophonic sound Karaoke MP3 Ethernet Electrophysiology Amplifier Atari 8-bit family Modem Wire wrap Wireless access point Sound Blaster TurboGrafx 16 S/PDIF Magnet TIA-568A/B Instrument amplifier Transmitter Naval mine Sound card Transistor Three-phase electric power Cyberspace Digital Subscriber Line Quadraphonic Computer Electronic music Coaxial cable Kenwood Electronics Transmission line Carburetor Potentiometer Electronic filter
