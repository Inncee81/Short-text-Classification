's fender twin reverb guitar amplifier with excessice static alright so maybe its not excessive but i wanted to draw you in anyway so for those of you who know anything about amplifiers i have a s fender twin reverb which i just got not too long ago its a great amp however when i plug my guitar into it and turn the volume up past the static gets very annoying i mean i can still play over it but especially when im trying to play somethign clean the static just interfers with the enjoyment of the piece when i press or hold any metal part of my guitar or the amp the static stops and i know this is common im just wondering to what extent i can call normal i figured that since its plugged into a grounded socket that the static would be reduced but apparently im wrong so do you think somethigns wrong or am i just expecting too much it's one of three most likely problems i'll start with the most obvious have you tried a new guitar cord if the current one has a short in it this is what it may sound like sometimes is the jack on your guitar tight if it is moving around any it may have began to short the wiring to the pickups and you are hearing the static from the contact of the wires moving around check the wiring to the pickups because what you describe sounds as though that at some point the grounding inside the guitar have came undone the first two are quick and easy to check but if they aren't the problem take the guitar to a qualified tech and explain the problem and he will know what to do good luck and hope that it's a quick fix for you Electric guitar Bass guitar Guitar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Jack plug BS 1363 Instrument amplifier Vacuum tube Screw Poker jargon Rhodes piano Equine conformation Fender Telecaster Fender Electrophysiology Effects unit Electronic amplifier Loudspeaker Friction Glossary of climbing terms Floyd Rose Overhead lines Blood on the Tracks Harp Violin Radar Double bass Transformer Salad Fingers Audiophile Scientology beliefs and practices Knife Pat Metheny Spark plug Gramophone record Switch Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus Gothic rock Oscilloscope Time Out of Mind Tire Reverberation D-subminiature Sin City Magnetic field Coming of Age (TNG episode) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Ground (electricity) Protoss John Myung Sound effect John Frusciante Adam Jones Naval mine Trey Anastasio Red Hot Chili Peppers Fuse (electrical) Shine On You Crazy Diamond GunZ The Duel Buddy Guy Les Paul Motorcycle Cheating in Counter-Strike Electrical wiring (UK) Social rule Enigma machine Incandescent light bulb Guqin Sampling (music) Jet engine Humbucker Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mike Watt Motor oil Strap-on dildo Bullet Galactic Civilizations Jimi Hendrix Eddie Van Halen Big band New York Giants Glossary of partner dance terms TRS connector Escape from New York Haven (TNG episode) Parachuting Sailing Pok__mon Abilities Heavy metal music Fender Precision Bass Vibrato unit Ethernet
