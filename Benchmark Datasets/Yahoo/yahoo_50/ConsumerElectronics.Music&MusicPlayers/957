can you put music from itunes into an mp player i have a shuffle and want a nano ipod but im really short on cash so i was wondering if i got an mp player if i could put my itunes music on it and if so what are some good low priced mp 's thanks so much if you bought the music you cannot do it no matter what you try if you ripped it from a cd it should work no problem itunes puts locks on their purchased music stopping it from being converted or put onto off brand computers the only way to make it work is to burn it onto a cd and then rip it back into the computer but it will leave imperfections in the audio quality but if ur not a freak like i am it wont be that big a deal IPod ITunes Apple Computer FairPlay IPod nano Walkman IPod shuffle Digital audio player Digital rights management Online music store IPod mini MP3 ILife IPod photo Vorbis Gramophone record Podcasting Warez Advanced Audio Coding Apple Macintosh Video game music Rhapsody (online music service) Rhythmbox Poker jargon SonicStage Steve Jobs Karaoke We Belong Together Citigroup USB flash drive Audio file format Napster (pay service) Commodity RealNetworks QuickTime Arbitrage Winamp Microeconomics Jumpstart 3rd Grade $ale of the Century Loss leader Sega High fidelity AMD Musical Instrument Digital Interface Vanilla Ninja Creative Zen Dance Dance Revolution Internet fraud Disc jockey Draw poker Electronic commerce Betting (poker) John Cage Cheating in poker Super Audio CD IMac Monopoly (game) Mixtape Supply and demand MMORPG Ripping Bulk vending Audiophile DVD Deflation (economics) President (game) Sears Holdings Corporation Sony Laserdisc Windows XP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Baccarat Jon Lech Johansen Dominoes Short selling Copy protection Grand Theft Auto: Vice City MPEG-4 Part 3 Berkshire Hathaway This Week in Tech Airsoft Commodore International Los Angeles Clippers Gross domestic product Nintendo Shuffle Inflation Compact disc Mergers and acquisitions Operational amplifier Baseball Stars Madonna (entertainer) IPhoto Keynesian economics Paintball Poker Psychedelic trance Computer and video games
