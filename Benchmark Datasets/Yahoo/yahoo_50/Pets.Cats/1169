my pregnant cat just had a bloody stool is this indicating the time is near it was confirmed that she's pregnant by the vet however he said he couldn't tell us the delivery date it would be based on when she was last in heat so we're counting days from when we heard the mating lol she's pinking and showing and very affectionate and it appears she's nesting however if our calculations are right she shouldnt be due till next week i know you are worried and that's great it may not be much comfort but cats are way better at having babies than humans are they rarely need any help the number one indicator that her time is near is that she'll disappear you'll find her in a closet or something and there will be pairs of eyes just don't stress keep petting her keep loving her make her a little nest of towels and old sheets nature will take it's course Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Garfield Cat EastEnders Animal communication Obstetrics Childbirth Hamster Pet skunk Friends Toxoplasmosis Neighbours House Mouse Upholstery Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding T'Pol Cytomegalovirus Phoebe Buffay's songs Knots Landing Code: Lyoko Dog Fecal incontinence Series finale Bengali language Dead Like Me Something Positive Melanie Wilkes Schistosomiasis Shaggy dog story Chinchilla Guinea pig Felis sapiens Days of our Lives Diarrhea Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Laci Peterson Maya calendar Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) New Zealand English Estrus cycle Platypus Abortion Sharon Tate Psoriasis Coeliac disease Stewie Griffin Douglas Adams Negima Elephant Dairy Zoophilia Domestic rabbit Richard Chase Street-Legal Solar variation Panthera hybrid Albatross Giant Panda Chinese calendar Socialization Red Squirrel 10cc Stuttering Pink Pigeon The Pet Sounds Sessions The Marriage of Figaro Gregorian calendar Grief Philip J.
