one of my cats keeps throwing up all his food right after he eats any suggestions on what to do yes he is a little overweight we took him to the vet and the vet said to put the food on a plate or flat surface so that he has to slow down when he eats but it hasn't worked at all i don't give him a whole bunch of food at once he doesn't do it every single time he eats but he does it a good amount of the time i even monitor him when he's eating to make sure he isn't eating to fast i'm not sure what to do and didn't know if anyone else had any suggestions at all sorry i didn't mention my cat eats meow mix dry food you could try giving him some hairball remedy cats will vomit when they are trying to get rid of one and they usually do this after eating mix a small amount of his dry food with the remedy or just smear it on his paw in order to clean it off he will eat it you could also start giving him canned food once a week to help prevent them in the future as long as he vet has checked him out thoroughly and did bloodwork and a fecal test to rule out any infection or parasites he should be fine i have cats and also work as a vet tech and do rescue work cats vomit for many reasons make sure he is eating small meals times a day and give him plenty of water if he is eating and drinking normally and only vomiting occasionally then he is probably fine i'm assuming that since you have taken him to the vet he has all his shots current just try the hairball remedy follow the directions on the tube but for the most part give it to him a few times a week that will help one pass and also prevent them in the future i hope this helps good luck Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Diarrhea Fancy rat Cat Gastroparesis Garfield Vomiting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Urinary incontinence Poker jargon Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Hypoglycemia Foodborne illness Theory of conduct Jumpstart 3rd Grade Halitosis Prostate cancer Homer Simpson Escherichia coli O157:H7 Binge eating disorder Little Britain Malaria Tofu The Amazing Race Breastfeeding Kosher foods Drowning Taboo food and drink Jackass: The Movie Hangover Dietary fiber Tooth Tooth enamel Anorexia nervosa Fasting Food Botulism Dieting Chocolate Coprophagia Kashrut Ron and Fez Thermal power station American Black Bear Carburetor Adjustable gastric band Coffee Colorectal cancer Ra (board game) Social rule Diabetes mellitus Dim sum USS Tunny (SS-282) Ascariasis Breakfast Roman eating and drinking English grammar Movie projector Jewish cuisine Genetically modified food Super Size Me Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kitchen Chopsticks Asthma President (game) Luck Ron Weasley Diseases of the honeybee Oscilloscope The Smoking Room Electrophysiology Brewery Folic acid Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Drawn Together HIV test Apollo 8 Cuisine of Denmark The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Entamoeba histolytica Dilbert Customs and etiquette of Japan Medical prescription The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Gonorrhoea Schistosomiasis Textile manufacturing Casting Ferret Albatross
