cat anxiety i will be going away a couple of weekends over the next few months and i just went away overnight and notice my cat was anxious when i returned home i think i'm now getting anxiety thinking about the upcoming weekends i will be away they are no more than nights but i feel badly about leaving her i've actually thought about getting another cat but i have a small place and she's yrs old and gets all my attention so i don't know if another cat would actually make it worse my hubby thinks i have more separation anxiety than my pet i just worry any advice most cats will appear anxious pouting or angry when you leave them overnight or for a few days don't get too anxious another cat might deflect some of that anxiety and keep them more occupied when you are gone but having another pet in the household after being an only child for a long time could also stress them out don't get too anxious ultimately they will still be mad at you when you return it's just part of a cat's normal personality Anxiety Stuttering General anxiety disorder Shaggy dog story Narcissism Urinary incontinence Attachment theory Dog Obsessive-compulsive disorder Pet EastEnders Doug Pet Sematary Panic attack Knots Landing WFAN (AM) Agoraphobia Fruits Basket The Cat in the Hat Infertility Procrastination Clinical depression Venom (comics) Humphrey Bogart Pet Sounds Red Dwarf characters Oh My Goddess!
