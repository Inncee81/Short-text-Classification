will a kitten help my cat loose weight i have a year old mixed breed neutered male cat who has been diagnosed as obese he weighs lbs when he should weigh about or less i am trying to change his diet but i fear that exercise is what's really missing i am not home enough to exercise with him enouh to really get him to work out and when we do play he usually lays down after a few minutes i am wondering if getting a more insistent play mate wouldhelp him exercise do you think it would just stress him or otherwise piss him off he is indoor outdoor before you start getting preachy about how it isn't safe for him to go outdoors please note that i live in the country and he comes in for the evening every evening so save your words on that topic hi amy i just went through the same thing myself my year old cat was alone a lot during the day so he was starting to get a little overweight and would terrorize the house when i was away b c he was bored i adopted a kitten and while it wasn't easy at first he became much more active and has been on better behavior now that he has someone to play with the tough part of your situation is that you have a year old cat his activity level and diet are going to be tough to change right now but if you're interested in getting another cat anyway it sounds like you have the space so why not try it there are lots of stray kittens that need loving homes and even if it doesn't improve your cats physical health it will definitely be good for him to have someone around all the time to love good luck Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Anorexia nervosa Garfield Kitten Pet skunk Hamster Binge eating disorder Dog Manx (cat) Treecat Cats (musical) Hypertension Socialization Fancy rat Exercise Puma Pitaten Breastfeeding Richard Feynman Species Livestock Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Autism Coeliac disease Body mass index Elephant Kim Possible RuneScape quests Time Out of Mind Super Size Me Softball Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Gender Feral cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Bulgarian language USS Waters (DD-115) Weight training Maine Coon Theory of conduct Paragliding Pound Physical attractiveness Little Britain Giant Panda Stuttering Atomic Kitten Housebreaking Social rule Dieting Friends M16 (rifle) Human sexual behavior Cancer The Ashlee Simpson Show Clinical depression Land use forecasting Scientology beliefs and practices Raw food diet Shit Atkins Nutritional Approach Space Shuttle program Pump It Up Robert A.
