i have just rescued a siamese cat i already have a cta hw would u introduce them i laready had a tabby cat which is now just months old which i have had since a kitten which is male and i have now rescued a older female siamese cat which is yrs old we introduced them for a few mins but she hisses at him but he just doesnt respond will they eveentualy get on and any ideas on introducing them and ideas of what could help them to get along thanx my younger cat just isnt bothered by her and doesnt responds to the hissing he justs carrys on playing oh and yes of course they are neutered lol hi there when introducing a new cat you should always separate them for the first couple of days to allow your current cat to get used to the scent of your new cat what you need to do is set up a room for your new cat perhaps a spare room if you have one if not any other room that is safe and you can close off keep your new cat in the room for the next day and night your boy cat will most likely sniff at the door and be very curious you can of course visit your new cat regularly don't feel cruel putting her in one room at the rescue shelters cats are kept in relatively small pens anyway so as a temporary measure it won't be a problem on the second day put your boy cat in your new cat's room and close the door bring your female cat out so that she can get used to her new surroundings without having to face your boy cat it's not surprising that she hissed at him she felt threatened she's in a brand new environment doesn't know who she can trust and to top if off she's faced with another cat who she of course does not know whether to trust allow your new cat freedom of the house for an hour or so this will also give your existing cat a chance to get used to the new smells of your female cat then put her back in her room and let your male cat have his house back it's very important that for the first few weeks you give extra attention to your male cat and reassure him that he is still loved you do not have to ignore your new cat of course but make sure male kitty gets double the normal amount of attention it is also useful to try to stroke each one of them directly after the other in order to mix their scents you can also switch their bedding over every day to do the same thing as long as there is no hissing through the door from either cat if there is wait a little while longer you can let your new cat out some recommend putting the new cat in a carrier but we found that when we did this with our kitten to introduce to our existing male he hissed continuously when we let her out of the cage there was no hissing at all for the first month or however long it takes never leave the two cats alone when you are out or asleep even if they appear to be getting along better to be safe than sorry some hissing growling and posturing is normal so don't worry it's just a cat's way of asserting his her dominance whilst also showing that they feel threatened if they didn't feel threatened they would not feel the need to show their dominance therefore do not scold or punish either cat for hissing let them work it out on their own the only time you may intervene is if they get into a fight that causes pain squealing blood being drawn etc in which case you should rattle a can of pennies car keys or spray lightly with water don't go in there with your hands it may take a little while for them to adapt seeing as your new cat is older than your current cat generally younger cats or kittens are easier for the existing cat to accept having said that i'm sure your cats will get along eventually i've had my kitten for about weeks now and it took about weeks for my male cat to stop showing his dominance he would pounce on her and bite her neck as soon as he saw her it's not perfect still but they are getting much better these things take time i hope you and both of your cats will be very happy together you may want to read the following articles http www messybeast com first impressions htm http www cat world com au catintroductions htm http www workpad com index item aspx objectid http www veterinarypetcare com catintroduction html xx emmie p s i hope that both are neutered Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Domestic rabbit Social rule Ferret Sin City Dog training The Amber Spyglass Fancy rat Milton H.
