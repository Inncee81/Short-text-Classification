kitten help please week ago we were given a week old kitten oz to foster i was syringe feeding him mls a day and he was doing great yesterday morning i woke up to his crying around am and i fed him mls he seemed fine and was still hungry nibbling on my arm but i put him in his carrier my horrible mistake around i came back into the room to check on him he normally mewed when hungry but he didn't i discovered he was very weak i tried to get him to swallow warm kmr and he refused it mostly i got maybe mls in i got him to urinate and i tried warming him up near our fireplace he sounded wheezy like he was struggling to breathe i ran him to the vet but he passed on i grew attached quickly and this was a shock it happened so fast i hate myself for not feeding him more in the morning i feel guilty and disgusted i can't stop crying the vet said he sounded like he had fluid in his lungs pneumonia inhaled kmr your opinion please i'm so sorry for your loss i know how difficult this can be i once had the same thing happen a one week old kitten is a large responsibility and if the kitten was already weakened by pneumonia or whatever you probably didn't stand a chance i'm sorry your kitten passed but i don't think you should blame yourself you did the best you could should you ever find yourself in that kind of a spot again i would suggest that you chat with your vet's vet techs they would be able to tell you what you need to know in how much and when to feed and what temp the kitten should be kept at and if you don't want to bother your vet contact the humane society they are a wealth of info and would be happy to help you StarCraft: Hybrid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Pneumonia Equine conformation Marilyn Monroe Futurama (TV series - season 5) Drowning Cat Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence Ferret Sin City Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass The Marshall Mathers LP RuneScape quests EastEnders Stroke Stomach cancer Atomic Kitten Sarah Kerrigan Lung cancer Knots Landing Babe Ruth Miss Saigon Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Big Brother UK series 5 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Intravenous therapy Milton H.
