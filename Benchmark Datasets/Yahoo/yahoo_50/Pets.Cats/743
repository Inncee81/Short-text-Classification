my cat has an ear tumor what is the cause of this and how should i treat it my cat's ears have bothered her for a long time we always thought she had ear mites and treated her for that but it never seemed to help much they recently got a lot worse so i took her to the vet he said that she had a tumor in her ear he said that he has saw this in many cats and that most usually he removes the tumor and it just comes back then soon after the cat dies we had the tumor removed this time he said if it comes back he would suggest putting her to sleep i have an ear ointment to put in the cats ears everyday which is very hard to do to make me even more confused the vet tells me this he said his cousin had a tumor in his ear and went through major surgerys and had his ear removed the dr's said he had herpes and that is what cause the tumor the vet said he thought that this may be what could caused the tumors in the ears of so many cats i am soo confused anyone that knows any info about this or has experienced this please help thank you i agree with marlou you need to go to another vet this whole thing is weird i have never heard of a cat having to be put down for a tumor in the ear it seems to be a localized condition the vet that you have seems confused himself go seek a second opinion oh was the tumor cancerous maybe he is concerned that the cancer will spread in the body of your cat now if that is the case then i could see why your vet would suggest that alternative otherwise i cannot rationalize why you would need to have your kitty put to rest as for putting drops in your kitty's ears i would suggest finding someone to help that person can hold the kitty by the scruff the back of the neck and the back legs firmly while you administer the drops that is what we do when we give our cat s drips or cut his nails good luck and i hope everything turns out well for you and your beloved pet Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Lung cancer Cancer Metastasis Radiation therapy Colorectal cancer Ferret Breast cancer Urinary incontinence Dog Brain tumor Cancer of the larynx Epilepsy Garfield Chronic fatigue syndrome Malignant melanoma Soft tissue sarcoma Guinea pig Cat Fancy rat Rabies Mesothelioma Traumatic brain injury Esophageal cancer Hearing impairment Testicular cancer Babe Ruth Medicine Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Oncology Care Bears 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prolactinoma Shaggy dog story Alcoholics Anonymous Book of Isaiah Paget's disease of bone Domestic rabbit Syringomyelia Neurofibromatosis type II Bell's palsy Acromegaly Stem cell The Dalek Invasion of Earth Milton H.
