kitten help almost weeks ago we were given a and week old orphaned kitten to foster he had been fine until last tuesday he suddenly became ill and passed on ever since then i can't stop thinking about how i should have fed him more that morning got around mls of kmr i just assumed he would be okay and since his carrier was next to me for most of the hours between first meal to checkup that he would cry for food like normal when hungry but he hadn't gotten food during the night and his first meal was so small that i doubt he ate enough i asked the vet tech tried going to the vet tues if he would have starved and she said it would take days so not that fast i tried feeding him when i found him weak but he hardly ate i feel so guilty about this now that i can't sleep or eat i hate myself so much the guilt is endless and i just can't stand thinking about how lazy and selfish i was i'm so stupid for doing this the pain is endless someone please help me was the kitten ill before he passed away did you know he was ill or i'm not sure why you feel guilty about this if you had fostered the kitten fed it well but missed feeding it by an extra hour or so that would not have caused the kitten to die if you were consistently missing feedings then yes you may have not given him her the care it needed but it hardly sounds like that sometimes no matter what you do or how hard you try they just don't make it even under the best of circumstances i used to raise cats and once in a great while there would be a runt or one that was having trouble and of course i'd step in to try and save it even when the mom kitty says it's not going to live i'd still try feeding it keeping it warm and clean etc etc it didn't always work and yes sometimes i would wonder if there was something i could have done differently but i knew i did the best i could if you feel you did the best you could under the circumstances then good for you don't let it stop you from trying to foster another kitten it's one of the hardest things to find someone that will take in orphaned kittens so quit beating yourself up over this realize that you were of help to this little guy and go forth and do more good for the kitties of the world the very fact that you feel guilt says you're a good person Garfield Kitten Guinea pig Fasting Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez One Piece minor characters Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cat Terri Schiavo The Marshall Mathers LP Kodocha Ferret Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe StarCraft: Hybrid YuYu Hakusho Pet skunk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Poker jargon Knots Landing EastEnders Paul Is Dead Eric Cartman Sin City Futurama (TV series - season 5) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Calvin and Hobbes Characters in the Smurfs One Tree Hill (TV series) Badly Drawn Kitties 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fecal incontinence The Inside Scientology beliefs and practices Anorexia nervosa Piccolo Junior Saga John the Baptist Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Joe DiMaggio The Subtle Knife Jon Secada Marilyn Monroe Days of our Lives Grief Little Britain Characters of Naruto James Hanratty Operation Market Garden Friends Sydney Riot of 1879 Charles Peace Little Shop of Horrors Night (book) Xiaolin Showdown Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Out-of-body experience RuneScape quests Random Harvest Atomic Kitten FoxTrot Textile manufacturing Sant Thakar Singh Johnny Appleseed 613 mitzvot Don Giovanni Mojave people Babe Ruth Trailer Park Boys Full Metal Panic?
