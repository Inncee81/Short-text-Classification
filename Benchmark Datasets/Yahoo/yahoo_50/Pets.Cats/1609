how do i integrate my cats into my mom's house with her old cat i moved home a month ago after being on my own for a month and brought my two female cats with me they're a year old the problem lies with my mom's year old female cat who doesn't want them in 'her' house i keep my cats in my room all day their food and litter is in there so when anyone gets home after work we let them out and they run around and get their energy out like they're supposed to any time they encounter my mom's cat they get into hissing fights and 'bat' each other with their paws it hasn't gotten really bad yet but it's literally been four weeks since we moved there and it hasn't gotten any better any suggestions how we can improve the situation has anyone else gone through this and if so how long did it take for the dust to settle i can relate to your situation in that i brought two kittens into my home after my oldest cat succumbed to thyroid disease complications i had one surviving older cat who may or may not have been happy to have the house to herself the kittens were four and seven months and my older cat was sure there was growling and hissing but while they had no choice but to mingle my older cat was not happy part of her unhappiness was the fact that they had so much energy the older cat is used to being the alpha cat in the house part of her hissing and growling is to tell the newcomers who is boss but some of it may be annoyance at these new turbo charged balls of fur four weeks is perhaps a bit too soon although if all you are dealing with is hissing that is really not a big deal your two youngsters are used to each other and will likely take a lot of energy out on each other allowing the older cat to adjust and batting i found that more amusing than of a concern fortunately i was able to be around for most of the time so i never kept them separated if there really isn't any blood being drawn then i would suggest it be 'open house' so the older cat understands they are here to stay by keeping them separated all these weeks but only letting them out at night may be comparable to a new situation each night it has been almost four years since the kittens came into my house it has worked out wonderfully and it didn't take anywhere near four years to have that result probably a couple of months and the kitten that was continually put into the submission position by my older cat are now good friends and the smallest kitten thinks she is alpha Cat Ferret Pitaten Friends Dog training Garfield Theory of conduct Pet skunk Kitten Phoebe Buffay's songs Poker jargon Cats (musical) Alger Hiss Doomsday argument Babe Ruth Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Akuma (Street Fighter) Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Manx (cat) Badly Drawn Kitties Ron and Fez Thermoregulation Feral cat Pok__mon Live!
