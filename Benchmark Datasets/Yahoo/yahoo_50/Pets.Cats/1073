how do i remove the glue off a glue trap from my cats hair the glue traps for mice are really sticky my cat layed on one of them and he has that all over his belly my cat is a persian cat with a lot of hair and i cant get that glue off i need help ok this could be tough as glue is designed to stay put the first thing you could do is to rub some mineral oil like caster oil or vasaline into the area and then with a mild detergent like washing up liquid wash the affected area remeber not to get any into the eyes if the glue comes out t might be agood idea to wash the cat a full bath using a special cat shampoo if the glue stays put then i'm afraid the only answer is to cust the fur to be honest it would be best if you could take them to a professional animal groomer who will have the special shavers to safely remove all the fur down to the skin as the glue might cause a reaction and is a much safer option than trying to cut the fur yourself good luck Shampoo Leather Fur Hamster Garfield Tanning Upholstery Trapping Solvent Tattoo Soap Acne Cheetah Fancy rat Ranma __ characters Dandruff Smoke-screen Sulfuric acid Multiple chemical sensitivity Psoriasis Spider Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Laundry detergent Tarantula Comanche Dragon Booster Sento Washing machine Hydrogen peroxide Pet skunk Sewage treatment House Mouse Road Rovers Depilation Clinker (boat building) Professional wrestling match types Shaving Cat coat genetics Pepper spray Textile manufacturing Felis sapiens Printed circuit board Carnivorous plant Social rule Peanut Stomach cancer Clothing Piccolo Junior Saga Casting Domestic rabbit Motor oil Fecal incontinence Pitaten Salad Fingers Guinea pig Care Bears Baldness treatments The Star Wars Holiday Special Fishing Pok__mon Abilities Diving suit Manicure Hard water Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape quests Dry cleaning Fur trade Dean Koontz Chinchilla Genericized trademark Fur farming Animal communication Hyperthermia American Bison The Secret of NIMH Hand washing Hair conditioner Violin Nuclear power 2003 North America blackout Knife The Amber Spyglass Tenchi Muyo!
