any cat breeders i have a question about the adoption process my mother has been pretty down lately she believes she's going through menopause she loves persian cats but doesn't have any at the moment they don't have the extra money to pay the prices they're selling for i was showing her photos today of a kitten that we're getting a breeder to hold for us and she went on and on all day about how precious it was and how badly she wished she could get one and i decided that i'd like to surprise her with one to help get her spirits up do all breeders like to meet the family prior to letting the kittens leave their hands or should i be able to get her one as a gift fairly easily i understand that you all want to make sure the kitties end up in excellent loving homes but then it wouldn't really be a surprise if she went through the adoption process herself and appeared in person you stated that you have already picked one out from the breeder if your breeder doesn't want to go along with the surprise you have better find this out and soon i have been a breeder for almost years and i have not met every family good luck Atomic Kitten Pitaten Badly Drawn Kitties Theory of conduct EastEnders About a Boy Kitten Friends Maneki Neko Garfield Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tenshinhan Cats (musical) Money Kodocha The Catcher in the Rye 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ron Weasley The Fairly OddParents Aladdin (1992 film) Saint Avenue Q Pet skunk Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Poker jargon Socrates Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Trinity Kasparov versus The World RuneScape quests Monster Rancher monsters Nuclear power Mutual fund Trailer Park Boys Shaggy dog story Siamese (cat) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Good Morning, Vietnam $ale of the Century Rocko's Modern Life Winning Streak Monetary policy Guinea pig Game show Jon Secada Luck Care Bears Through the Looking-Glass Humphrey Bogart A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church Milton H.
