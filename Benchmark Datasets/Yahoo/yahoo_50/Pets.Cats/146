what causes separation anxiety in pets i used to have a golden ret that would freak out wheneveri left her but i heard that was common for her breed now i have a kitten that follows me around the house and crys when i leave if i set somewhere he has to be in my lap and if i get up he follows me and then plops down again wherever i go even when i go to the bathroom he has to be in my lap do my pets think i am their mommies not necessarily their mommy's but their security blanket they trust you to take care of them and when you are out of their sight they get nervous and upset they also don't like change recently my daughter moved out of our house and took her year old orange tabby with her she let it out side last night and it showed up at our house today she took it home and low and behold it is back she lives miles from us and it only took the cat an hour to get here the second time because it knew the way how it found us the first time is amazing i guess the kitty will stay here as it is unsafe for it to be traveling on foot across the interstate Garfield Turkish Van Phoebe Buffay's songs Feral cat Friends Pitaten Speed limit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Cat Hamster Shaggy dog story Dog Jon Secada Badly Drawn Kitties Random Harvest EastEnders Elektra (comics) Kitten Terri Schiavo Fancy Crane Tiger Escape of Charles II The Amber Spyglass Year of the Spider The Inside Siamese (cat) Knots Landing Miss Saigon 1989 Golden Raspberry Awards Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blankets (graphic novel) The Ashlee Simpson Show House of M Domestic rabbit Puma Urinary incontinence Maine Coon Babe Ruth The Shining (film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma German Shepherd Dog Soap opera Rabies Cat coat genetics Transportation of Los Angeles Big Brother (USA TV series) Milton H.
