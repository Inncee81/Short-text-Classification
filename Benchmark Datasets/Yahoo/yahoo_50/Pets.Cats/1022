should cats be given milk or diary prdoducts my cats enjoy an occasional swig of milk or even an occasional swig of half and half this does not seem to bother their digestive systems at all i do realize that for babies that can not drink milk or tolerate diary products it is because of a hard to digest casin ingredient how strict are you other cat owners on giving your kitties an occasional drink of milk i have one cat of my cats that actually goes to the refigerator and begs for milk she doesn't do this all of the time though hi everything in moderation as the greeks once said i'd check the cat stool and if your not seeing diarrhea black and tarry stuff straining but no stool or hard and crumbly stool then the cat is not allergic and you can go on without guilt many farm cats will drink milk straight from the udder and if both parents drink cow milk the kittens usually though not always acquire the enzymes to digest it from their mama's milk the proof will be in the litter box so check it regularly and if all is good there your milk loving lactose tolerant kitties are just fine Milk Lactose intolerance Dairy Breastfeeding Cat Diarrhea Food allergy Soy milk Coeliac disease Guinea pig Kitten Vegetarianism Breast milk Chocolate Escherichia coli O157:H7 Yoghurt Veganism Nestl__ Kosher foods Coffee Raw milk Urinary incontinence Pet skunk Badly Drawn Kitties Food Dietary fiber Dairy farming Hypoglycemia Feces Poker jargon Hamster Garfield Hello Kitty Taboo food and drink Domestic goat Flatulence Enzyme Domestic rabbit Soft drink Laxative Gastrointestinal tract Trailer Park Boys Pasteurization Alcoholic beverage Crohn's disease Infant formula Lac operon The Super Milk-chan Show Dairy cattle RuneScape quests Andy Warhol Manx (cat) Little Britain Sugar Elephant Cat litter Irritable bowel syndrome Entamoeba histolytica Tofu Dairy product Allergy Eric Cartman Healthy eating Kashrut Friends Alcoholics Anonymous Domestication Glycogen storage disease type I Insulin Shaggy dog story Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Ferret Constipation Peanut Mammary gland B3ta Pitaten Antiretroviral drug Achewood Fancy rat Diverticulosis Tooth Kodocha Digestion Ice cream Feline leukemia virus Dr. Seuss Gastroesophageal reflux disease Rocko's Modern Life Condensed milk Bubble tea Dim sum Cats (musical) House music Hera Hemorrhoid Phoebe Buffay's songs
