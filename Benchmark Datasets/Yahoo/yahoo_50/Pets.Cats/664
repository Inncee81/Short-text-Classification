why does my kitten want to climb in the fridge my grandma just got aeight week old kitten a few weeks ago and he's a complete love to be around he's very affectionate though he does have his quirks he'll eat anything last night he crawled into a bag of potato chips and was munching on the when i found him he also seems to like to try and climb in the toilet for some odd reason but what i really want to know is if anyone knows why he'd want to get into the fridge gram accidently left him in the fridge the day after she got him and then she found him hours later curled up between the lettece and orange juice purring ever since whenever we open the fridge door he's right there at our ankles mewing and trying to climb in anyone know why he's acting so weird i am not saying this to be funny but you have heard of curiosity killed the cat cat are very curious and they want to explore everything that is new to them when i got my little kitten from the shelter she was curious about everything everytime i opened the frig she would jump in the very first time she did it i was so thankful that i saw her do it because i was getting ready to leave for work where i worked hours and it took me hour to get to work it would have been at least hours before i would have gotten back home i still cry when i think about what could have happened the frig is air tight and i don't know if she would have had enough air for that long i just got into the habit of checking before i closed the frig to make sure she wasn't in there because she did manage to get in there a couple of times without me seeing her jump in there that only lasted for a lttle while and she no longer does that also you might want to keep the lid to the toilet down as if she did jump in she might not be able to get out you didn't mention the oven but that is something that you want to be careful with too make sure he is not around when you open the the oven especially if it is hot and always check the oven before you turn it on when i was little my little brother thought it would be funny to hide our cat in the oven luckily i was walking by and heard her in there and got her out and i had a nice long talk with my little brother he never put the kitty in the oven again good luck with your new little kitty Shaggy dog story Cat Salad Fingers Poker jargon RuneScape quests The Dalek Invasion of Earth Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dean Koontz The Amber Spyglass Rais massacre The Inside AFI 100 Years series Atomic Kitten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Lovely Bones Conspiracy (TNG episode) Good Times Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sluggy Freelance Time Out of Mind Russian joke Futurama (TV series - season 5) Social rule Fecal incontinence Badly Drawn Kitties Humphrey Bogart Little Britain The Shining (film) Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Guinea pig Hun-Apu Saturday Night Live Shit The Star Wars Holiday Special Toilet humour Hamster Everybody Loves Raymond One Piece minor characters The Time Machine Pitaten Trailer Park Boys The Ersatz Elevator Joke Barbecue Phoebe Buffay's songs Methos Heinkel He 112 Ferret Blonde on Blonde "Weird Al" Yankovic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reservoir Dogs The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Microwave oven The Catcher in the Rye Eddie Guerrero Knots Landing Cliff Richard Silent Night, Deadly Night Mojave people Malcolm in the Middle Steven Wright Refrigerator Highway 61 Revisited Sonic the Hedgehog Soap opera Cats (musical) The Ark in Space Captain Thunderbolt StarCraft: Hybrid Columbine High School massacre Care Bears Big Brother UK series 5 Daylight saving time Milton H.
