why does my cat lick up the water in the tub after i shower i give them freash water but they still do it i have a cat who likes water from just about any source except her water bowl mostly she prefers to drink straight from a running tap and loudly demands that i turn one on for her but sometimes i catch her licking moisture off the tub my theory is that cats prefer running and or found water as in nature btw since your cat does do this use something pet friendly to clean the soap scum off the porcelain with you wouldn't want kitty to be licking the tilex off the tub Customs and etiquette of Japan Soap Cat Textile manufacturing Trailer Park Boys Friends Garfield Dishwashing Licking County, Ohio Hard water Eric Cartman Taboo food and drink Water Fast bowling Tai shogi Dishwasher Dymaxion house Turkish Van Hamster Characters in the Smurfs Onsen Pottery Japanese toilet Laundry Taikyoku shogi Maneki Neko Sento Gay bathhouse Ren and Stimpy Water resources Water (molecule) Chinchilla Cookware and bakeware Toilet humour Cat litter Chinese tea culture Austin Powers Pet skunk Toilet Swimming pool Glycerin Tap water Ron Weasley Jackass: The Movie Washroom Tiger Hydrotherapy Genericized trademark Smegma Bottled water Fancy rat Nepeta Beer Happy Tree Friends Mutts Soap opera Mattress Poker jargon Hand washing Fecal incontinence Salad Fingers Our Gang Have I Got News For You Hello Kitty Tea Tenjiku shogi Domestic water system Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hot tub Air pollution President (game) Texas A&M University Shampoo Domestic rabbit Super Bowl XIII The Cat in the Hat Lick Observatory Salt lick Car washing techniques Fountain Marine aquarium Plastic Peanuts Bong Coriolis effect Musical mode Tick Cat (Red Dwarf) Dai dai shogi Umpire (cricket) Phoebe Buffay's songs Plumbing fixture Maine Coon Red Dwarf characters Polyethylene terephthalate Moisturizer Kenny McCormick Felis sapiens Ice cream
