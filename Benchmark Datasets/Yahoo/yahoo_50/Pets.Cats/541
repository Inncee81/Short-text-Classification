why is new kitten so mean i have had my kitten for months now and recently got a new kitten the older kitten is excited and keeps trying to play and lay with the new kitten but the new kitten hisses and swats at him and wont let him near her is there a way to help the new kitten get along with the older new kittens cats are always nervous in new surroundings your older cat's playful ness is probably too much for your new kitty to handle at the moment its already overwhelmed being in a new place give your new kitty time to adjust without being bothered by your older kitty when he gets comfy in his new surroundings slowly let them spend more time together it will take the new guy some getting used to the old guy and if your old cat keeps badgering her and trying to play too rough she won't be able to adjust and will keep being aggrivated by your older cat and will never come to like him give her the time and space to explore without distraction when shes comfy then she'll be ready to socialize with your older cat Kitten Ferret Cat Socialization Garfield USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Shadowcat Feral Feral cat Atomic Kitten Every time you masturbate___ God kills a kitten Catgirl Badly Drawn Kitties Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hello Kitty Cats (musical) Cuteness Manx (cat) Domestic rabbit Abu Dhabi Treecat Guinea pig Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Azumanga Daioh Internet phenomenon Glossary of nautical terms Kitty Kelley Softball 2channel Thermoregulation Purr B3ta Sarah Kerrigan Girly Bast (goddess) RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 4) Care Bears Goatse.cx USS Chicago (CA-136) StarCraft: Hybrid Alger Hiss 2001: A Space Odyssey Lie El Goonish Shive Asiatic Golden Cat Hearts (game) Pet store The Aristocats Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Aerial (dance move) Abstraction Feral cat colony OpenBSD Neko the Kitty Time travel Xiaolin Showdown Big Brother UK series 5 Shaggy dog story Siamese (cat) The Sound of Music Chronic fatigue syndrome Windows XP BattleTech technology Phoebe Buffay's songs Tokyo Mew Mew Cat's Eye Nebula Toxoplasmosis Planetary nebula Louis Wain The Beatles bootlegs John Forsythe Lockheed (comics) Ultimate Spider-Man Breastfeeding Stacy Carter Sam and Fuzzy First Battle of the Atlantic Sylvester (Looney Tunes) Charles Darwin's illness USS Turner Joy (DD-951) Bobcat Okashina Okashi Avenue Q Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux Car handling Swingout Curiosity Mappy Rod Stewart Maneki Neko ELO rating system Nepeta Social rule First English Civil War Family Guy Lynx Tesla coil The Death Gate Cycle
