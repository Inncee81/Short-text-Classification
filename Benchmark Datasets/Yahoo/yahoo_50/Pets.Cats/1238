cat roams for up hrs before returning home is this normal cat behaviour i recently adopted a rescue cat he's neutered vaccinated de flead and gorgeous he has settled well and is very friendly i have recently started to let him go outside but he only returns after hrs usual he doesn't seem that hungry too after such a long time out is this normal cat behaviour as i have never owned a cat before is it possible he's going elsewhere for his food or filling up on mice i am thinking of keeping him indoors just so we can see him once in a while because he takes so long to come back any advice forgot to mention he is years old i would love to put a webcam on him to see where he goes lol that's not unusual cats like to roam but i think it's more likely that he's finding a comfortable spot and napping for a good part of that time cats will spend a lot of the day sleeping if they can assuming that they are fed and that they're someplace they feel safe enough to nap that is he could be out under a bush somewhere dozing for most of that time try this when i feed canned food to our cats i tap the spoon on the edge of the saucer to get them to associate that sound with being fed if you want your cat to come in earlier try standing at the back door and tapping a saucer with a spoon it sounds funny but ours will come running more often than not Cat Ferret Garfield Homer Simpson The Amber Spyglass The Dalek Invasion of Earth Shaggy dog story Animal communication Salad Fingers The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Guinea pig Feral cat Dog Housebreaking Siesta Sampling (music) RuneScape quests Invader Zim Dilbert Domestic rabbit Social rule Kakapo Dog training Dean Koontz Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Breastfeeding Seabird Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Kitten Time Out of Mind Halloween W.I.T.C.H.
