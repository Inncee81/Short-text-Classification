how often should you feed indoor cats i feed them whenever they run to their bowls but they are getting too fat and i'd like to get them on a regular schedule what's good once a day twice a day how much per serving thank you if they're getting fat feed them twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon both in the morning and afternoon fill the bowls and don't refill it until the next time choose a time for morning and afternoon and only fill at that time in the morning try to make it before and afternoon after but before pm move their bowls to different places so that you know how much each cat is eating because normally when you limit your pet's food intake they might eat out of each other's bowls if you go to fill at afternoon or morning and there's some food left just fill the bowl again but try to make it less eg if you put mg and by afternoon there's mg left only put mg not more you can lessen the food also if they're taking eating less also change the food to a weight control diet which consists mostly of fibre so it has less energy thus lessening the fattening effect of the cat food just tell your vet to give you a bag of weight control cat food whatever cat food it is if you buy from a supermarket just check the bag for the amount per serving the bag normally says how much is good but try not to make it more than two cups since it makes the cat fat two cups should equal about mg as for what's good prescription diets the ones that you get ffrom your vet are better than brand names iams isn't bad but it's not as controlled as prescription because they go dor taste not as much as health which i personally think is more important also if your cat doesn't like the food alot it would eat less so less fat if you have anymore question just email or write on the question warning this is if your cat is under years old remember young cats need more food so never limit them but this is only if they are under Ramen Dieting Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Garfield Tofu Anorexia nervosa Guinea pig Milk Fancy rat Dietary fiber Low-carbohydrate diet Hamster Nutrition Super Size Me Obesity Hypoglycemia Cat Breakfast Customs and etiquette of Japan Tea Livestock Chili con carne Stomach cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Ferret Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vegetarianism South Beach diet Bodybuilding Food guide pyramid Veganism Folic acid Pet skunk Breastfeeding Meal Raw food diet Little Britain Weight training Japanese tea ceremony National Football League Dairy Sugar substitute Fecal incontinence Weight loss Dim sum English cricket team Homer Simpson Hamburger Chicken Binge eating disorder Adjustable gastric band Caffeine Neopets Cuisine of Malaysia Healthy eating Flatulence Tooth enamel Mattress Insulin Ron and Fez Cuisine of Denmark Chinese food therapy Fasting Publicly funded medicine Fast bowling Acorn Cat food Carburetor Soft drink Domesticated turkey Daylight saving time Fugu Cuisine of the Philippines Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Hypertension Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Stanley Cup Overpopulation Margarine Oreo Diabetes mellitus Fast food Food Bread Poker jargon Famine Roman eating and drinking Dorama Thermoregulation Weight Watchers
