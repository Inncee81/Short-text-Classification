kitten diahorrea help my kitten has diahorrea and is busy doing it everywhere we have kittens litter boxes i dont know what to do i was told not to rub her face in it she isnt a dog so would not understand so i just scold her firmly everytime i see it take her to it make her sniff it and then scold her any ideas for food which might help to constipate her it'd make things easier for cleaning the house stinks completely a mixture of the lemony smelling cleaning solution specially for pets' excretions and of her excretions too help gosh what sad answers judging seems to be a common thing amongst internet users i think some of your comments rather rude though some were helpful if you have a child and they know how to sue a toilet and then after that suddenly they start excreting in every corner of the house you would sit back and watch discipline is a key in education and the western world lacks it i scold gently how is the kitten meant to understand that it is wrong am i meant to smile and say good girl as i have seen so many parents do to their out of control children please do not tell me i am not fit i am perfectly fit for these kittens was only asking something i am not scolding the kitten for diahorrea just for its refusal reluctance to do it in the litter box i have taken her to a vet she has been given the deworming paste so i am guessing it is merely dietary the vet said she is perfectly fine that the meds might cause it so was asking for home remedies gosh i dont rub her face in it i merely say in a more stern voice that she should stop my tone changes because animals do understand tone gosh what do all of you do with your pets children when they do something wrong then all of you have asked what scolding is i'm shocked first try feeding her boiled meat with rice just boil some meat preferably chicken in some water add rice and cook until rice is tender but mixture is still a little sloppy this will help to keep her from dehydrating and settle her stomach as to rubbing her nose in it don't let anyone tell you it won't work it will but be gentle and just touch her nose to it and put her in a litter pan but consider the problem may be she is young enough that with the diarrhea she can't make it to the litter pan by the time she realizes she needs to go if this continues for too long please take her to a vet Pet skunk Cat Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Kitten Guinea pig Ferret Shaggy dog story Hamster Salad Fingers Dog training Fancy rat Garfield Humphrey Bogart Japanese toilet Kashrut Dog Pitaten Housebreaking Jewish cuisine Zhao Yun Social rule Kodocha Singlish Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.
