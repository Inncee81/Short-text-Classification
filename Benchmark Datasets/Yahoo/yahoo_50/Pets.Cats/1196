introducing week old kitten to my month old kitten i have had my month old male kitten for a little over a month now and i wanted to get him a friend i brought home week old male kitten my month old kitten keep pouncing on and wrestling with the week old kitten it seems like he is being really ruff at times and its constant he isnt giving the other kitten a break is this normal or should i be concerned i seperated them the first day between bedrooms i let the little one out once in awhile is this ever going to end that should really be not much of a problem your boys are still both kittens and are going to roughhouse and chew on each other at least it's each other and not your furniture or your shoes and congratulations for having two kittens they need each other to keep one another company if you decide that your older boy is being too rough you can push them apart it won't hurt to separate them for a short while but if you leave your house let them be together the little guy can fend for himself they're just playing and getting to know each other they're just kids tell them to knock it off and settle down for a little bit separate food bowls are recommended they can share water when you get them fixed i know you don't have any females but if you get them fixed early you avoid much chance they will learn to spray they need to recover from the anesthesia totally separately and can then spend time together your vet may want to wait until your week old is months old but you really don't have to wait that long we've done boys as early as weeks but most vets will want to wait this was a mass population control thing Atomic Kitten Ferret Cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Garfield Guinea pig Kitten Pet skunk Eddie Guerrero Social rule RuneScape quests Dog training Big Brother UK series 5 Kurt Angle Breastfeeding Socialization Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Shawn Michaels Pet Sounds Hamster The Contender (television series) Vegeta Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Jazz Singer She Loves You Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga Manx (cat) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Prostate cancer TNA Unbreakable Sin City Treecat National Football League Big Brother (USA TV series) Pretty Good Privacy Journey (band) Good Times About a Boy ALGOL 68 1957 World Series Cleveland Browns Son Gohan Friends Super Bowl XXVII Elephant Planet Jarrett Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Super Bowl XXXVI Chris Benoit Feral cat Equine conformation Hey Jude Ron and Fez Yom Kippur War Second Battle of the Atlantic Sarah Kerrigan Fancy rat The Marshall Mathers LP Cliff Richard Sewage treatment Michael Garibaldi Professional wrestling slang Full Metal Panic?
