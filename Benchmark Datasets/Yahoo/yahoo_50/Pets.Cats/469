how do you earn cats love im having trouble with my cat im trying to earn her love but all she want from me is cat treats brushing and my hair dont ask help please well it seems to me that you have already earned her love believe me if she didn't love or at the least like you you wouldn't have gotten as you have cats show their love quite differently than dogs what you are doing is fine if and when she wants to be more demonstrative in affection like wanting to sit on your lap all the time she will does she sleep with you that's a very good sign that she loves you p s i know what you mean about your hair i had a cat once that loved licking my hair grooming is cat love so my answer to you is she loves you Cat Felis sapiens Shetland Sheepdog Garfield Road Rovers Keeshond Phoebe Buffay's songs Robert A.
