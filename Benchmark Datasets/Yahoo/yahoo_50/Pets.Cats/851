is it easy to clean a cat litter box so i'm thinking about getting a cat my mom are trying to know more about the responsibility of it before our minds are made up anyways one of my friends said its really difficult with the cat litter box because it smells really bad its hard to clean is it true well it's urine and feces so it doesn't smell like cinnamon buns but cat litter is made out of clay the scoopable type is treated so it clumps which absorbs the moisture and there are litters made out of wood and corn and some other substances if you want to go with something a little more biodegradeable the box will smell right after the cat uses it poopwise but if you keep it scooped the box shouldn't reek badly you can also buy an automatic litter box for one cat a littermaid would probably be fine cleaning isn't hard if you're using regular clay regular litter not the clumping type litter you can put a plastic bag or box liner in the box before you put the litter in so changing taking out the old used litter and putting in new litter is only a matter of wrapping up the plastic liner with the clumpable litter you just scoop out the used litter uring will clump into a ball making it easy to scoop out and you'll only have to replace litter once in a while you do have to remember to clean it though set up a schedule so you don't forget because many cats won't use a dirty litterbox and they'll start going other places you don't want them to and it is almost impossible to get the smell out and to retrain the cat before you get your cat make sure you have a practical safe place to keep the litterbox someplace that is always accessible to the cat that is easily cleanable cats will track almost any kind of litter it's probably a bad idea to keep a the box in an area human sleep or eat or do food prep in germs the box also has to feel safe to the cat not too exposed but not so hard to get to that the cat finds somewhere else to go hey if millions of people keeping cats can clean the litter how hard can it really be Cat Hamster Cat litter Plastic Fancy rat Social rule Guinea pig Mattress Japanese tea ceremony Urinary incontinence Domestic rabbit Collecting fossils Genericized trademark Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Theory of conduct Pet skunk Animal communication Knife Menstrual cup Water YuYu Hakusho Homer Simpson Bong Pitaten Waste management Diaper Ron and Fez Shit Toilet Textile manufacturing Dustbin The Catcher in the Rye Dog Toxoplasmosis Phoebe Buffay's songs Kitchen Drill bit Characters in the Smurfs M16 (rifle) Plastic bag Pottery Anchor Epistemology Clothing Sinfest Time Out of Mind Guns, Germs, and Steel Upholstery Surveillance Cremation Dairy Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 RuneScape quests Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cardboard Tofu Cocaine Avenue Q Foodborne illness Hey Arnold!
