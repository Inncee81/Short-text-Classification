why does my kitty binx act so strange he's about months old we got him when he was about months old i found him in a box with another kitten ontop of a garbage can he runs around the house making chewbacca noises as we like to call it he runs outside when we open the backdoor then shut the screen door and he sits and meows by it until we open it to let him in then runs off again if you walk in a room past him he will run and wrap his front legs around your legs he will get really comfy on your lap and start to close his eyes then suddenly jumps off when he sleeps with my sister or me he only purrs when he is on the top bunk in the morning he wakes us up by purring and licking every inch of your face neck and does that little curling thing with his paws and if you try to cover yourself with a blanket he pushes til he finds a spot to lick he digs his head into a spot in you like an armpit or your neck til he gets comfy he will be very vicious and bite you then start licking you here's a picture of my baby boy http www cutelittlekittens com files images american shorthair thumbs t dsc jpg your kitty isn't strange he sounds like a kitten having fun growing up this is why it's fun to have a cat they do the weirdest things and serve as real entertainment as opposed to tv which is fake entertainment even half of the stuff you listed is enough to keep you laughing for hours and i'm sure you didn't list everything i love it when they take off running at warp speed and crash into things or when they pace around seeming very threatening and suddenly drop in place and fall asleep cats are hilarious Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling throws Garfield Milton H.
