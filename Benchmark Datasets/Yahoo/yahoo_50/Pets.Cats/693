flea trap question i read that setting up a night light with a bowl of soapy water under it attracts fleas well i tried it last night so i just stuck a small lamp with a flourescent bulb above a bowl of soapy water but this morning there didn't seem to be many if any fleas in it should i invest in some incandescent bulbs or is the whole idea bunk please note my main concern with going with flea bombs and other such treatments is pretty simple that stuff is poison if i can mitigate the problem until i move in sept then the fleas die without the cats and i will take efforts to ensure no fleas come with us so if i can avoid putting poison into my cats' systems and mine it's worth a shot it works with an aluminum pan like a pie pan Stage lighting Headlight Ultraviolet Fluorescent lamp Bicycle lighting Traffic light Lighting Photometry (optics) Red Hot Chili Peppers Thomas Edison Cookware and bakeware Color temperature Kakapo Vacuum tube Second Battle of the Atlantic Railway signal Dimmer Tiny Toon Adventures Tobacco Minor Discworld characters Sewage treatment Compact fluorescent lamp Street light Linked list Light-emitting diode Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bong Electrodeless lamp Discworld gods Laser Manila Rotor machine Risk management Suicide Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Emergency preparedness X10 (industry standard) Christmas lights Nernst lamp Chinchilla Hand grenade Land mine Carburetor Cruising (maritime) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Neon lamp Arc lamp Spidey Super Stories Flea Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Future energy development Loki CPU cache Cat Carnivorous plant John Frusciante Mach kernel Toilet-related injury Convair B-36 Garlic Light pollution Security lighting Team America: World Police Pet skunk She Loves You Nuclear physics Hamster Bat EastEnders National Football League Hydroelectricity Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Beetle Mercury-vapor lamp USS Tunny (SS-282) Fancy rat Alexander Nikolayevich Lodygin Shrek 2 Night (book) P-38 Lightning Aluminium Flea market Fire fighting The Amber Spyglass Extreme Programming Flashlight Glossary of American football Cube (film) Cannabis cultivation Gypsy moth Mercury (element) San Jose, California Flush toilet Nuclear power Light Transformer Battle of the beams Nuclear fallout Paris Hilton
