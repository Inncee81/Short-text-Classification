do you enjoy listening to a cat meow also does the sound of a cat purring relax you i'm not talking bout when your petting or holding the cat just the sounds it makes i love my cats meow he is a year old intact male and his voice is so soft and deep you can barely hear him i love it because it is so sweet and cute when he looks up at me with his big green eyes and meows however i do not like my mother's cat's meow her cat is a year old spayed female and her meow is really loud and high or maybe because she is so demanding and queenly she demands you feed her and let her outside and pet her and tend to her needs but i do like her attitude i couldn't say about the purring part because i am mostly relaxed all the time so i couldn't tell you Cat Purr Shaggy dog story Maine Coon Guinea pig Garfield Hamster SpongeBob SquarePants (character) SpongeBob SquarePants The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Azumanga Daioh Dog Peafowl Roxette Stuttering Girly Ron and Fez Nashville Skyline The Cat in the Hat Ranma __ characters CatDog Trailer Park Boys Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Tribble Onomatopoeia Sant Thakar Singh Pet skunk Peter Bogdanovich Felis sapiens Pet Shop Boys The Pet Sounds Sessions Good Times Hearing impairment Kakapo Josie and the Pussycats (comic) Friends Frankie Goes to Hollywood Hello Kitty Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind The Super Milk-chan Show The Jim Rome Show Socialization Human voice The Smoking Room Atari 8-bit family Aquemini Vowel Pekingese The Basement Tapes Humphrey Bogart Chinchilla Kitten WNNX (FM) Ralston Purina Company The Wotch Namie Amuro Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Meow Wars Fancy rat Social rule Kirsten Dunst Domestic rabbit Mahoraba Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Samurai Pizza Cats Saved by the Bell Eric Cartman The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie College Roomies from Hell!!!
