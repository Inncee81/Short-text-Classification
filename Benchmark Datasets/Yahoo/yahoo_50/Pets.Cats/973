cat help pleaseeee i have cats that have lived in my house for years i found a stray cat that just had kittens a few days ago if i give away the kittens i really want to keep the stray cat that had the kittens but will my cats that i already have not like her and they will fight they will probably fight a little at first but once they get used to each other that starts to dwindle just don't try to put them all together immediately with free roam of the house introduce them to each other slowly you have to do this kind of thing in small steps like try to keep the newer cat in a room away from the others for a few days this way the other cats can pick up on it's scent and get used to it then introduce them in the room together when you are present so you can keep an eye on things just don't spring the new cat on them don't be surprised if you hear all kinds of strange noises coming from them while they get used to each other lol if they are too nasty with the new cat though it may not be a good idea to keep her there Cat Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Feral cat Slow Train Coming Social rule Kitten Big Brother UK series 5 Garfield Unreal Phoebe Buffay's songs The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Xiaolin Showdown Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jam (TV series) Scenes from a Memory The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass Kender The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath Cats (musical) Fancy rat Milton H.
