advice on a mixed breed cat my first cats were stray cats which i picked up from the streets they both ran away because i let them out every night and one day they just didn't show up anyway i adopted a week old kitten from a friend of mine it is a mixed breed betwen an angora and a persian it is grey and it looks like the persian except the face which isn't as flat as a persian's it's very playful and very spoiled and by spoiled i mean he loves being pet and purrs every time i touch him his name is toulouse after the painter and the kitten in the aristocats my question is do you have any advice on how to raise it the websites won't help because it inherited both his parents and both breeds are extremely different and i won't be letting him out as i let my other cats out i am from romania and i don't know if de clawing is illegal but i am convinced not to do it even if it is legal i consider it a form of mutilation and i am the one to decide anything regarding toulouse not my parents even if i am only years old first of all i am happy to hear of your stance on declawing he is a cat cats are unique and mysterious magical and special think of using words like angora persian in the same way we use words like mexican and negro we recognize that we are all humans and have the same needs think the same way in cats obviously your new baby responds to love and cuddles and thats a great start cats love consistency and freedom in the amounts that they choose cats are independant and like to feel that they are doing what they are doing because its their idea you almost have to use psycology to get them to do something but they are very bright and intelligent although not on a human kind of intelligence this kitten will know his home is with you because he hasnt been a stray and i am not sure about your first strays but if you picked them up from the streets they may have felt that you took them from their home and just went home when the opportunity presented itself if you do intend for this cat to be an indoor only cat you will have the responsibility and the concern for his entire life that he not get out under any circumstance even accidentally because if he is not allowed to learn of the outside dangers and how to avoid them he will be at a distinct disdvantage if this should ever happen Cat Pet skunk Turkish Van Team Rocket Domestic rabbit Friends Dog Ferret Treecat Turkish Angora The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Cats (musical) Monster Rancher monsters Abortion debate Baseball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Avenue Q Minor Harry Potter Beasts Phoebe Buffay's songs B3ta Franz Boas Adoption Polyamory God Emperor of Dune The Aristocats Milton H.
