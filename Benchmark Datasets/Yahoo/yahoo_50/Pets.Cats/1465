male unneutered cat sorry if tmi an unneutered gorgeous white male cat showed up at my house a few days ago and by the fact that he's so friendly i assume he has or had an owner but by the fact he's kinda skinny and is unneutered makes me think maybe he wasn't taken care of either way i'm caring for him while trying to find his owner and if he were mine he'd be neutered so don't tell me to just get him fixed if no one resonds to an ad within weeks he shall be chopped but my question is and sorry if this is gross is it normal for a male cat to get feces on his balls like i know it's all in the general vicinity and maybe it's just more noticable because he's pure white but it really seems like he frequently has poo on his balls till he bathes again and it's grossing me out i'm pregnant so i can't touch cat feces in any way so i can't wipe him i just want to know is this normal yes this is normal have sombody else use kitty cat wipes for his bum and love him also have you put up fliers in your neighborhood describing the cat someone may be missing the little guy poopy balls and all i suggest that you ask around the neighborhood also Cat Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Conker's Bad Fur Day Manx (cat) Ron and Fez Pet skunk Ferret Shit The Marshall Mathers LP Tina Turner Snooker Ren and Stimpy Friends Toilet humour B3ta Poker jargon Dog Feral cat Origins of baseball Shaggy dog story Carolina Panthers Little Britain Fahrenheit 9/11 Lucille Ball The Inside Menstrual cycle Giant Panda Euphemism Socialization Ravi Shastri I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Slayers Ron Weasley Los Angeles Dodgers The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Richard Chase Cats (musical) Mutts The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Garfield Prosecutor's fallacy Kurt Cobain Turkish Van Humphrey Bogart Housebreaking Vulgar Latin National Football League Elephant Tai shogi Sharon Tate Blood on the Tracks House of M Feces RKO Pictures Turkish Angora Coprophagia Child sexuality Sento Felis sapiens Weebl and Bob Sphynx (cat) Family Affairs Polish language USS Wadsworth (DD-516) South Park Something Positive Hamster Prince (artist) Transformation problem Morphology (linguistics) Kitten Prolog Roswell UFO incident Bayesian probability Neighbours RuneScape quests Pregnancy Ranma __ characters Buttocks Gender role Flatulence The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Lion House Mouse Badly Drawn Kitties Trigun characters USS Abbot (DD-629) Public domain Kangaroo Tooth enamel Dai dai shogi Babe Ruth Ed, Edd n Eddy Days of our Lives James Hanratty Phoebe Buffay's songs Trailer Park Boys Inflation
