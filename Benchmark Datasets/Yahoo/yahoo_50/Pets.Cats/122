my cats seasonal allergies my cat solo seems miserable he has seasonal allergies where he will sneeze and have really runny eyes other than that he is extremely healthy well anyway this morning he was fine just a bit of a runny eye like normal and later in the afternoon i noticed that it was sorta puffy like his inner eyelid was puffy then a few hours later it was really puffy and really watery and he looked miserable at this point i decided he would go to the vet when my husband got home and we looked at his eye it was normal not watery not puffy nothing so i am wondering was that just a flair up i plan on calling the vet tomorrow and see what they think but until then i d like opinions or past experiences thanks mind you he is a totally indoor cat and he has the allergies equally as bed with and without the ac on sounds like he was exposed to a newer allergen talk to the vet they will probably want to see him to make sure he doesn't have an eye infection which would need antibiotics he may prescribe an eye drop or ointment to help solo when he has attacks if it is not an infection good luck Allergy Conjunctivitis Hay fever Cat Eczema Common cold Guinea pig Psoriasis Fancy rat Antibiotic First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Asthma Domestic rabbit Chronic fatigue syndrome Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical prescription Dog Sneeze Diarrhea Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Immunoglobulin E Group A streptococcal infection Code: Lyoko Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tuberculosis Rocko's Modern Life Sinusitis Oh My Goddess!
