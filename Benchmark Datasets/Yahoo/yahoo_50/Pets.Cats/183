i have a tiger and i need to know how i can clip his nails so he is safer does anyone have any ideas it is unwise ofcourse to clip a very sweet tiger all awake on your face lol him a tranquilizer like all animals and your vet should be telling you what to do since you do have a ''tiger'' an endangered species in your collection of pets i am sure he has his own private vet who should be telling you what to do and what not to are u sure u just want to ''clip'' his nails than actually dig out his claws for its well known purposes anywayz none of my business i do not know much of ''private ownership of tigers'' but have a look at this article and visit this web site if you feel like tigers can grow to weigh between and pounds and can live to be over years of age the cub stage doesn't last long since they grow at a rate of about pounds a month as young adults they begin to urinate to mark territory including their bedding in fact they love to mark fresh clean bedding their urine is tacky and very pungent and often times pointed at people too tigers eat meat period they don't eat hot dogs and can't live on chicken alone tigers need red meat such as beef bison or venison in a year an adult tiger can eat to tons of meat vitamin supplements may also be required depending on the quality of meat you can provide and how well the cat was nourished as a cub tigers can kill these natural predators are one of nature's best designed killers and humans are attacked every year both in captivity and in the wild roy horn need we say more in order to truly bond with a tiger you have to live eat and breath it every day every day no vacations no separation of tiger home and your home no time to work a job elsewhere no family and friends allowed people who have shown off their ability to truly bond with tigers roy horn et al have dedicated their entire lives to those animals living with them literally for every one of those unique situations there are thousands of others that fall far short of that dream causing officials to confiscate and sanctuaries to rescue tigers from back yards every day in the united states federal government signed a new bill into law that makes it illegal to sell big cats to be kept as pets and makes it illegal to own them as pets if an owner does not hold proper usda licensing and local required permits the fines are substantial and the cat will be confiscated this is the first federal law ever to address the exotic pet trade in our country additional laws vary by state county and city some states and local governments ban exotics entirely so is owning a tiger fun if you think fun is never again taking a vacation perhaps over the next years if you're properly caring for your tiger it will bond with you as it's keeper no one else will be able to safely feed it give it medical attention or clean up after it when it does need medical attention good luck finding a 'local' veterinarian willing to help most are not trained or equipped to handle treating a tiger when you're lucky enough to find one it may be quite expensive the outcome of keeping big cats as pets is often isolation isolation from loved ones neighbors friends and others who lack your extreme passion for animals if you are alone in your desire to own a tiger understand you may be even more alone once you have one an ideal tiger habitat will be include lots of greenery and a water feature tigers will defecate and urinate in their water feature so be ready to clean it frequently real grass and dirt not concrete and plenty of room to stalk and jump and hide are essential boomer balls and shelter are important features too depending on where you live winter quarters may be needed and in the event of needing medical treatment a means of locking down the cat and transporting it safely are a must just to clarify people's homes garages apartments and caravans do not a good tiger home make if you do genuinely own a tiger hey thats cool owning and lettiing him live would be great and blend in with your own environment huh good luck but take care do things with someone to assist u Fancy rat Garfield Ferret Brown Bear Dog Kangaroo Gray
