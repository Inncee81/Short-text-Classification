introducing new cat not upd on shots i found a tame stray kitten outside recently and i guess he's about months old i had been keeping him at my boyfriends till i could get him fixed upd on shots but he's tired of him so i'd like to bring him to my apartment but i already have a cat and dog the stray cat appears healthy playful etc but i haven't wanted to bring him yet b c i worry about contagious diseases this cat might be carrying and give to my cat so basically i'm wondering if it's okay to bring this cat over to my place he's getting fixed shots upd on or is there a high risk of him possibly giving something to my cat also would indirect contact be okay like letting the kitten walk around my apartment to get his smell around but keeping my cat locked in my room my cat is fixed and utd on shots if the stray has not been tested for feline leukemia then you are placing your other cat at high risk not sure where these other folks got their info from but you should never mix cats until the newest addition has been checked for things like feline leukemia because it is highly contagious and once spread it cannot be stopped and it kills read any cat health books about integrating new animals if you must keep it away from your other animals in a totally different room with totally different food bowls water bowls and litter boxes i have a multicat household so i know what i am talking about also things like ear mites etc are very contagious easily cured but contagious so why risk it it is the same basic reason as to why they do not let kids go to school without being vaccinated first get a clean bill of health before you risk an outbreak same with our animal friends Cat Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Dog Garfield Tobacco smoking Tuberculosis Smallpox Rabies Manx (cat) Kitten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hamster Kevin and Kell Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Measles Columbine High School massacre Diseases of the honeybee H5N1 Canine parvovirus Leukemia Prostate cancer Feral Guinea pig Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fast bowling Ferret Herpes simplex virus Ebola Foot-and-mouth disease Canary Tick The Inside Taboo food and drink Cancer Pneumonia Sin City Psoriasis Jam (TV series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Dairy Felix the Cat The Cat in the Hat Socialization Marburg virus RuneScape quests The Invisibles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Transmission (medicine) Avian influenza Colorectal cancer Feline leukemia virus Azumanga Daioh Quarantine Thimerosal AIDS Care Bears Influenza Livestock Dog agility Kodocha Animal rights Diabetes mellitus Stem cell Vaccination Cytomegalovirus Avenue Q Feline immunodeficiency virus Heartworm The X-Files (season 1) The Shining (film) Bioterrorism Phoebe Buffay's songs Common cold Island Fox Cheetah Japanese tea ceremony Team Fortress Classic Folic acid Great Teacher Onizuka Pandemic Coeliac disease Catwoman Foodborne illness Puma Infectious disease
