turkish van good idea when i get out on my own i want a turkish van cat they are sooo pretty and i love how they love water i've always been a cat person over a dog person but i love water too and i'd love to take my cat swimming with me the only thing is idk if they have special needs or anything is grooming any different from other cats what's the average price for a kitten how do they get shipped if you don't live near a breeder does the shipping cost extra do they need any special care that's different from other cats i'd like to know thanks all cats are the same to me not personality wise because they live the same amout of years and all need grooming and all the cats that have to be shipped most likely will cost more and they just put the cat in like a carring case with food and water especially from long distances they will be fine but may be more jumpy than normal when they get home i wish my cat liked water sob Cat Turkish Van Turkish Angora Ferret Cats (musical) Domestic rabbit Morphology (linguistics) Livestock Pet skunk Hamster Manx (cat) Koi Garfield Externality Discus (fish) Kitten Felis sapiens 2000 Australian Grand Prix Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Guinea pig The Beatles bootlegs USS Sea Cat (SS-399) Shaggy dog story Dog training Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Balinese (cat) Dave Lister City Hunter English grammar Monster Rancher monsters Socialization Dean Koontz Chocolate Scooby-Doo Swimming Spanish verbs Azumanga Daioh Phoebe Buffay's songs Pekingese Nuclear power Pet Dog Serval RuneScape quests Vampire Prolog Atomic Kitten Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Care Bears A Milhouse Divided Socrates Pet store Microeconomics Blue Peter CatDog Siamese (cat) Cuisine of Denmark Feral Insurance Naval mine Rabbit Supply and demand Pep__ Le Pew Red Dwarf characters Chinese astrology Health insurance Ecco the Dolphin Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Economy of Norway Trigun characters Havanese Sinfest Maine Coon Tina Turner Feral cat Selective breeding Marriage Treecat Keeshond 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Spot (Star Trek) Tooth enamel German grammar Daz Dillinger S.H.E Euphemism Atari 8-bit family Hydrogen economy Collation Triathlon Timeline of alternative rock Canary Fruits Basket Golden Retriever 2 Stupid Dogs Bengal cat Devil Fruit Animal rights Snoop Dogg The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll
