cat's eyes dilated after general anesthesia my cats went to the vet today for a dental cleaning they were put under general anesthesia sevoflurane and their eyes have been dilated all day long is this normal they aren't acting different they're eating fine but their eyes are huge they also got their rabies and distemper shot but i don't believe that has any contribution yes they're fixed i promise they were fixed years ago and the newer anesthesia that my vet recommended sevoflurane was not available then or at least not offered to me so when they were fixed they were stumbling around and groggy and such that's why i was concerned about this time the vet made it sound like you don't get any of those side effects and that they would be awake and alert which they are i was just surprised by the dilation lasting so long that is normal though if it's not reduced by tomorrow call the vet it doesn't have to be completely back to normal but not fully dilated in the meantime try to keep her in darkened areas to spare them eyes you can do a lot of damage putting them in bright light when their eyes are dilated Cat Diabetic retinopathy Iris (anatomy) Local anesthesia Anesthesia Tooth enamel Time dilation Sun Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Ferret Intraocular lens Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rabies Book of Isaiah Intracranial pressure Pet skunk Out-of-body experience Pupil Sin City Solar eclipse Color General anaesthesia Methamphetamine Eye Guinea pig Glaucoma First aid Dog Turner syndrome Tooth M__bius transformation Parallax Gravitational time dilation Non-native pronunciations of English Betting (poker) Nitrous oxide Abortion Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Childbirth Education in Australia Knife Rosacea Speed of light Social rule One Piece minor characters Dental caries Diabetes mellitus Eye contact Red-eye effect Team Fortress Classic Urinary incontinence Randomness Deadly nightshade Garfield Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Intact dilation and extraction Twin paradox Unreal Heinkel He 112 Photography Punisher Ocean's Twelve Cancer Brachial plexus Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Proper time Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carburetor Datalore (TNG episode) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Piccolo Junior Saga Multiple sclerosis Domestic rabbit Pok__mon Abilities M16 (rifle) Ulcerative colitis Upholstery Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Binoculars Lethal injection Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Singlish USS Yorktown (CV-10) Migraine Milton H.
