dropping a cat they say that if you drop a cat it will land on it's feet they also say that if you drop a piece of buttered bread it will land butter side down what would happen if you tied a piece of buttered bread butter side up to a cats back and then dropped them jeez some people have no sense of humor i wouldn't actually do something like that even though i don't particularly care for cats i would never be downright mean like that and for those of you who are telling me that the cat is heavier blah blah blah or the bread has no muscles blah blah blah it wasn't a serious question but some of you got the joke and if i made you think a little and laugh a little then it was worth all of the stupid people with their all too serious answers man i just tried this i dropped my girlfriend's cat with a piece of buttered bread strapped to it's back butter side up before it could hit the ground my pit bull snapped him up and ate him whole i don't understand he's never eaten a cat before and he has not had much of an affinity for buttered bread maybe the two together was something he just had to try now i have to find a cat that kind of looks like the one that was just eaten Iggy Pop Little Britain Murphy's law Bread Joke Singlish Shit SpongeBob SquarePants Conker's Bad Fur Day Kenny McCormick Peanut butter Butter Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Double Nickels on the Dime Shaggy dog story Happy Tree Friends Recurring South Park characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Butters Stotch Piccolo Junior Saga Kyle Broflovski Toast Cookie Breakfast Friends Professional wrestling aerial techniques Fecal incontinence The Butter Battle Book Garfield Social rule South Park Blizzard Entertainment Krusty Gets Busted Theory of conduct MRE Glossary of American football Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Hiberno-English Cuisine of Denmark Radio Yerevan Sandwich The Ashlee Simpson Show Passover Professional wrestling attacks Time Out of Mind Trailer Park Boys Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Internet phenomenon Jewish cuisine Eucharist Mojave people RuneScape quests Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist "Weird Al" Yankovic Japanese particles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Strap-on dildo Pitaten Taz-Mania Toilet humour Pizza Flatulence Samuel Goldwyn Stuttering Cheshire cat Lie Porridge Freak Strike Make money fast Ron and Fez Humphrey Bogart Richard Feynman Jackass: The Movie Characters from Arrested Development Another Side of Bob Dylan Winter Peanut 3rd Rock from the Sun Onomatopoeia Hamburger Soul food French cuisine Ren and Stimpy Casualty lifting On the Road Knots Landing Discordianism Esperanto grammar Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shark Dairy Archery Skateboarding trick SMTV Live Pea soup The Catcher in the Rye Dilbert
