anyone out there have experience with pets who've gotten the big c from second hand smoke my kitten is months old he is so sweet one of my roommates smokes and i've told them i wish they wouldn't do it around my kitten however last week my worst fears came to life my kitten had a hacking episode so i took him to the vet they did some tests and an examination in the end they prescribed an antibiotic and said if that doesn't improve his breathing then they'll have to do an x ray they said they suspect cancer but they want to try this med before they do the x ray i got a second opinion and they agreed i know the best thing i can do is to put some air purifiers around the house keep smoke free areas for the cat to hang out in and groom him more often so if he gets any residue in his fur he won't ingest it during grooming i've worked with animals my whole life and i've faced death and disease many times i'm even applying to college to become a vet tech yet i'm scared i love this cat i just need some emotional support does anyone else have a similar story ty we're not sure if he has cancer yet that's why he's on the antibiotics both vets agreed that we should try the medication before putting him through the stress of an x ray according to the first vet the blood tests were inconclusive the second vet we saw didn't take more blood they just looked over the results from the first test and agreed i understand that if he has cancer it will be most likely caused by both a genetic disposition and irritation from second hand smoke it is not hard to believe that he might have a genetic disposition to cancer because he does have food allergies anxiety issues and all in all he's been a rather sickly kitten from day one i've had him since he was weeks old i know he was young to be weaned from his mother but there were difficult circumstances i've done all the medical research needed and i understand whats happening and whats possible vs whats probable i'm still scared can someone whose been through something similar help me feel better and we are moving out soon i can't stand the smoke any longer either i think you should move out do you think your feline is the only one at risk you saw it happen to him so it could just as easily happen to you as well unless you stop this situation you could end up just like your poor kitty there Cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Eczema Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Cancer Guinea pig Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Lung cancer Garfield Asthma Aspartame Stroke Cannabis (drug) Medicine Stomach cancer Multiple sclerosis Abortion Folic acid Ferret Common cold Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit Kitten Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Colorectal cancer Tuberculosis Diabetes mellitus Pet skunk Hypertension Traumatic brain injury EastEnders Mesothelioma Paracetamol Undergrads Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Acne Hamster Teen Girl Squad Vitamin C Friends Stuttering Alzheimer's disease Tocopherol Humphrey Bogart Dog training Dog Tooth enamel AIDS reappraisal Crohn's disease Atherosclerosis Fancy rat Growth hormone treatment Kodocha Cardiovascular disease Taboo food and drink Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Schizophrenia Angina Stress (medicine) Diarrhea Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Azumanga Daioh Drowning Ionizing radiation Hypnosis Health issues and the effects of cannabis Medical analysis of circumcision Post-traumatic stress disorder Causality H5N1 Chlorpromazine Anxiety Baldness Nutrition Animal testing Controversies in autism Borderline personality disorder Homeopathy Randomness Menstrual cycle Legionellosis Bipolar disorder Ovarian cancer
