my friend is househunting he has a year old with ibd that is controlled for the most part with prednisone he is concerned that the move will cause the ibd to act up also his cat has been pooing in the kitchen sink since his problem with ibd began we all assume that is because he thought the cat box was causing his discomfort no one knows where he will go when he gets to the new house my friend is hoping he will adopt the new kitchen sink instead of a place on the floor it's a year old cat yeah everyone thinks it's pretty gross but he just won't use the cat box making coffee at his house can be pretty gross this may turn out even better than using the new sink have your friend buy a new litter box and a completely different type of litter than before the kitty might start using it as everything is new house box and litter your friend might also be able to train the cat to use the human toilet many people have done it the cat is already halfway there with pooping on a solid surface http www karawynn net mishacat toilet html good luck to your friend and her kitty purrs the cat lady Cat Cat litter Domestic rabbit Kitten Hamster Carolina Panthers Poker jargon Pitaten Toilet humour Ren and Stimpy Shit Fecal incontinence Catscratch Inflammatory bowel disease Kitchen 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Nicomachean Ethics Sailing Animal communication Japanese toilet Conker's Bad Fur Day Toilet Ulcerative colitis Eight ball Jackass: The Movie Steven Wright Composting toilet Phoebe Buffay Urinary incontinence Friends Cliff Richard Badly Drawn Kitties Hello Kitty Garfield Upstairs, Downstairs Washroom The Amazing Race Radio Telef__s __ireann Kill Bill Pride and Prejudice Prisons in the United States Felix the Cat Jean Grey Passenger car Maneki Neko About a Boy Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Luck Cats (musical) Sewage treatment HTML Feral cat Diatomaceous earth Dog Ages of Myst USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Shadowcat Fancy rat Trainspotting (novel) World Wide Web Social rule RKO Pictures Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Value added The Ashlee Simpson Show Soap opera Pretty Good Privacy Bristol Grammar School Neko the Kitty Kevin and Kell Gaia Online Little Britain Wood carving Vomiting Uniform Resource Locator Feces The Fairly OddParents Rock Follies Wright brothers Semiconductor device The Brady Bunch HyperText Transfer Protocol HTML element Care Bears Drill bit Hiberno-English Dormitory Purr Cheetah Kimi Finster The Lion King Genericized trademark Infantilism OpenBSD USS Yorktown (CV-5) Xiaolin Showdown First Battle of the Atlantic
