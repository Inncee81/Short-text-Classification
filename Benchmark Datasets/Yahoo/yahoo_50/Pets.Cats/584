my cat occasionally gets soft stools this always ends up being only a symptom of a respiratory problem i don't understand the connection between the two but i'm glad i get a good heads up before she becomes distressed or gets a secondary infection the vet gives her a couple of shots for congestion and she is right as rain the next day it's either allergies or a virus he says i can expect her to go through this every or months he says she's looking better than she ever has she had been sick with parasites and uri's as a kitten i keep a savings for her frequent flyer vet visits vet always does a fecal and it's always negative i don't understand the connection between soft stools and respiratory problems it's funny you should ask about a prescription diet today he asked me what she was eating and i told him hill's prescription diet w d high fiber for her soft stool problem he thought that was good sometimes i think her problem is a virus she has been tested and is negative she is strictly an indoor cat most of the time she has solid stools once in a while she has a soft stool then the next day the solid stools resume but when she has three or four days of half solid half soft stools i know something is going on anyone know the connection between respiratory problem and soft stools i actually can never tell she is having a respiratory problem he hears the congestion in her chest the connection may be stress when a cat becomes stressed it can affect his or her gastrointestinal system if your cat responds well to treatment for her illness and the vet has run fecals that have come back negative you probably don't have anything to worry about as far as the soft stool is concerned at least i do agree that you should have your cat on heartworm prevention if she is not already it's been discovered that cats do get heartworms more frequently than we thought they did in the past in infected cats the lungs are often greatly affected ask your vet about feline revolution not only will it help prevent heartworms but it controls fleas too Heartworm Fecal incontinence Pneumonia Common cold Asthma Medicine Domestic rabbit Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Cancer Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Fancy rat Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Entamoeba histolytica Multiple sclerosis Prostate cancer Ascariasis Guinea pig Cystic fibrosis Clinical depression Poliomyelitis H5N1 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anopheles Pet skunk Dog Ebola Acute respiratory distress syndrome Tuberculosis Psoriasis Lung cancer Hay fever Myasthenia gravis Breastfeeding Herpes simplex virus Duchenne muscular dystrophy AIDS Cytomegalovirus Cephalic disorder Trichinosis Cirrhosis Virus Influenza Botulism HIV test Henipavirus Lassa fever Sleep apnea Hypoglycemia Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ferret Childbirth Radiation poisoning Panic attack Upper respiratory tract infection Charles Darwin's illness Tobacco smoking Rabies Decompression sickness Insomnia Feces Reflexology Traumatic brain injury Anorexia nervosa Schizophrenia Legionellosis Tocopherol HIV vaccine Norwalk virus group Avian influenza Anal fissure Chemotherapy Glycogen storage disease type I Group A streptococcal infection Anemia Rheumatoid arthritis Adjustable gastric band Dietary fiber Gastroenteritis Marburg virus Feral cat Premature birth Coprophagia Acromegaly First aid Adenoviridae Chagas disease
