my cat had kittens weeks ago and they have all opened there eyes except who has a sort of scab over its eyes what should i do usually the mother will lick it and make sure ti's kept clean so watch that mama is doing it if she isnn't put the kitten boo boo close to mama nose so she can smell the scratch and she should take care of it if she doesn't then use a warm not hot cloth and gently wipe the eyes don't force them open right away do it gently and slowly you don't want to pull the delicate flesh around the eyes if neither of these work then get the kitten to a vet also when i had my litters i didn't allow the stronger kittens to take over the best teets so i constantly moved them around so the kittens all got the best milk the best milk comes from the middle to the back of the mother the least comes from the first two nipples so give them a shuffle i've done this through three litters and this gives the runt a great chance at catch up it really works Guinea pig Kitten Ferret Garfield Joke Breastfeeding Little Britain Pet skunk Aerial (dance move) Poker jargon Dog Happy Tree Friends Delta Goodrem Social rule Fecal incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Manx (cat) Pitaten Milton H.
