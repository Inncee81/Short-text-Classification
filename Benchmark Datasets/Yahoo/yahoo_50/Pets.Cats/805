how long should cats be out my dad puts tom my cat out at about oclock and then lets him in about in the morning is this too much and can someone suggest a good timetable otherwise it seems like hes sleeping all day then going out at night not sure if its the right thing to do your cat shouldn't go outside at all there are too many dangers for cats outside they get attacked by predators hit by cars pick up diseases etc a cat who lives inside has a much longer healthier life than a cat who goes outside Cat Bart the Daredevil Friends Grandview, U.S.A.
