bitten by a cat while cleaning cages yesterday for a shelter i volunteer one little kitten took a chunk out of my thumb i have never been bit to this degree most cats will scratch and give little warning nips but that is it anyway the bite didn't require stitches but i was told i should go to the dr for a tetanus shot and antibiotics is this true the cat is up to date on all her shots the fact that the cat is healthy from cat diseases is irrelevant to the possibility of your wound getting infected or the possibility of bacteria like tetanus getting through the chance that something like that will actually happen is very small even minimal but the correct approach is to take all precautions and these are indeed to take a tetanus shot and antibiotics for days and since you work at the shelter you must be vaccinated for tetanus so that you don't have to get a shot every time personally i have been bitten many times and never bothered to do all these shots and antibiotics but i know that doctors say that you should anyway make sure you disinfect the wound well Tetanus Vaccine Rabies Group A streptococcal infection Infectious disease Wound Pneumonia Cat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anthrax Antibiotic Ferret Pet skunk Old wives' tale Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Quarantine Feral cat Bacteria Disinfection Guinea pig Rocky Mountain spotted fever Legionellosis Smallpox Escherichia coli O157:H7 Common cold Toxoplasmosis Bubonic plague Acne Staphylococcus aureus Dog Cytomegalovirus Cellulitis RuneScape quests Marburg virus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Thimerosal Fancy rat Cystic fibrosis Hamster Epidemiology Tularemia Milton H.
