my month old cat that we just got days ago still hasnt eaten im worried she wont eat right when we got her we took her to the vet he gave us medicine for her eyes and for her worms we gave her food but she hasnt eaten it we mixed dry food and wet food oh yeah and she is sneazing and coughing what should i do she most likely has an upper respiratory infection if she is sneezing and that can make them decide to eat also if she is still only months old she may not be ready for dry food she needs canned only and kitty chow for sure also at that age you can still give her kitten suppliment milk from the pet store which is packed full of vitamins for her get some quickly into her and to get her to start eating the best thing out there is to go get some gerber or heinz baby meat do not get beef or veal since that is too harsh on kitty's tummy at that age but chicken and turkey are fine get a very good quality kitty soft food that is much better for a cat than dry is anyway and spread some of the baby meat on the top and it will devour it if the vet didn't put it on antibiotics for it's cold then i would call them back and see if they think the kitten is gettng worse if you pinch the fur at the back of the neck kind of tight and then release it quickly and it doesn't immediately lay back down but sort of sticks together then the kitten is getting dehydrated from lack of moisture get some kitten milk and moist food into it as quickly as possible if the kitten still won't eat that combination then there is definitely something wrong with it and it needs medical attention since i've used that combination on lots of kittens and sick adult cats and it works great good luck Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat Kitten Garfield Common cold Fancy rat Food preservation MRE Breastfeeding Dog Taboo food and drink Chicken Hamster Livestock Chocolate Chili con carne Tofu Fecal incontinence Comanche RuneScape quests Milk Urinary incontinence Veganism Pet skunk Dairy Tlingit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food Breakfast Diarrhea Pizza Pneumonia Food storage Atomic Kitten Cuisine of the Philippines Characters in the Smurfs Garlic Soup Ferret Tea Chinchilla Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hamburger Gray Wolf 1957 World Series Vitamin C Russian cuisine Snake Folic acid Escherichia coli O157:H7 Badly Drawn Kitties Domesticated turkey Ramen Cha chaan teng Coffee Cuisine of Malaysia Phoebe Buffay's songs Rocko's Modern Life Tuberculosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic goat Toilet humour Poker jargon Sin City Korean cuisine Chicken soup Dog food Insulin Conjunctivitis Cuisine of Brazil Kodocha Genericized trademark Asthma Anemia Curry Group A streptococcal infection Little Britain Carbon dioxide Basic English Chronic fatigue syndrome Dumpling Meat analogue Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Knife Jewish cuisine Hemp Bengali cuisine
