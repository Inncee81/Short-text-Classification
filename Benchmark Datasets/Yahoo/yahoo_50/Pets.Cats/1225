i want a cat but my parents say no but they r willing to negotiate any ideas ummm ok c i had a dog but my parents had to give it back cuz my sis had asthma taht i couldnt argue with then we got cats from egypt my homeland and one of them died naturally u noe got old died but the other one got sick and died and see my parents are like refusing to let go of these past experiences they say that it is too painful to go through again and i swore up and down and on my life that if they let me get a pet i would devote my self entirely to it they thought that sounded pretty good but then when my neighbor offered us a cat they freaked and said no and now that i noe what its like to have a pet my life feels so empty without one animals are my life please give me some answers and it is summer and that means i would have ample time end energy to train and bond w this cat w out a pet i feel empty and lost i know that sounds cheesy but its true please help and my b day is coming up should i ask them for a pet then help help help ok i dont want any other pet i want a cat and financially yes i can take care of this cat so that will not b a problem its just that whole parental responsibility thing that parents are so paranoid about and think that their kids cannot handle an animal and believe me i have had pets in the past and i was able to take care of them i know how hard it can be loosing a pet and having that empty feeling inside that only a pet can fill i understand your parents not wanting that disappointment again but if you really want another animal than it is up to you to call a family meeting and sit down and without drama explain the best way you can on how you feel give the plus side of having a cat there are many give your parents the respect they deserve in the decisions they make but maybe if you show how really grown up you are by the way you present your case to them maybe they'll cave in its worth a try good luck Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet Sounds Simone Weil Care Bears Meaning of life W.I.T.C.H.
