my cat and his sleepieness im worried about my cat he never wants to excersice anymore and he's only years old how can i get him to be more active my first question has he been checked by a vet then is this a sudden change gradual is he an indoor outdoor kitty or strictly indoor make sure it isn't a medical condition first then you can start trying other things it could be he's bored do you play with him and engage him in chasing things try a new toy or bring one out he hasn't used in awhile try taking a ribbon or sturdy string and having him chase it as you wiggle it lift it etc also they usually have pretty frequent sleep awake cycles throughout the day and night so this just might be normal for him since he's not a kitten anymore just make sure he knows he can always get a pet scratch on the ears and love from you and you'll be fine Cat Sleep Garfield Socialization Girly Phoebe Buffay's songs Catscratch Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Guinea pig Narcolepsy Dog Characters of The Sandman Dream Milton H.
