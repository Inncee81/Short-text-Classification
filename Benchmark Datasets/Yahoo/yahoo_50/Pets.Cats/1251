quirky cats my cat is very quirky and very funny lately though she has been acting like a dog she jumps up on your leg when you walk in the door and wants you to pet her head she wants her belly scratched and she fetches last week i decided to have fun with my new dog i have recently taught her to shake lol i was just wondering if anyone else's cats have a special talent oh and i've started calling her puppy kitty and she answers me also she not a kitten she's almost i don't have a dog either my oldest cat loves to have his belly scratched by anyone that comes along and he just flops and rolls over my little kitten takes my shirt in her mouth and then starts to knead where ever she is at plus they both love to cuddle into me personally now my parents cat i have to say is a little more quirky she'll only play with rubber bands and only rubber bands she chatters consistently out the windows to the birds and she won't eat unless she get brushed or petted all cats tend to have their quirks but i think that because the personalities of their owners and what their owners need want from the cat is how they act but that is my personal theory Garfield Cat Ferret Dog Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Manx (cat) Dog training Guinea pig RuneScape quests Socialization Invader Zim Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Trailer Park Boys B3ta Dean Koontz Pet Aerial (dance move) Sinfest Kitten Puma Mutts One Tree Hill (TV series) Pet store Fleetwood Mac Atomic Kitten Game show Badly Drawn Kitties Cats (musical) Azumanga Daioh Richard Chase Doug Feral cat The Fairly OddParents Dilbert Shetland Sheepdog Domestic rabbit Cyndi Lauper Spidey Super Stories German Shepherd Dog "Weird Al" Yankovic Ren and Stimpy The Beach Boys Fancy rat Hello Kitty Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Petplay Catscratch Rabbit Rod Stewart Internet phenomenon Calvin and Hobbes The Beatles bootlegs Cheetah Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Pet Sounds Whose Line Is It Anyway?
