is it safe to apply frontline to a cat twice in once month i applied frontline a few days ago and she still has fleas wondering if it would be safe to apply it again she is about months old no do not overuse this product it's poison that's how it kills the fleas it can become toxic to your cat if you don't follow the instructions and to you for that matter be sure to wash your hands after applying i personally prefer advantage or advantage plus i think it's a much better product and works better than frontline if your cat has fleas after using the frontline bathe her using a mild dish soap like palmolive it will kill all the fleas don't use this routinely because it can cause skin problems with cats as it's formulated for dishes instead of the ph on a cat's skin however it works wonderful in a pinch note do not reapply frontline use only once a month the bathing does not wash it away since it's absorbed into the cat's skin Psoriasis Shampoo Eczema Soap Menstrual cup Manicure Foodborne illness Flea Cat Menstrual cycle Hamster Aluminium Hard water Sento Donald Rumsfeld Chinchilla Pesticide Morphology (linguistics) Wound Embalming Tattoo Paracetamol Hyperthermia Heartworm Autism Acne Sunlight Cruising (maritime) Common cold Anthrax Smoke-screen Drug test Minor Harry Potter Beasts Richard Feynman Dracunculiasis Vitamin D Aloe Dishwashing Agar plate Livestock Thimerosal Rice Skin Boom Town (Doctor Who) Social rule First aid Boric acid Jade Emperor Richard Chase Fecal incontinence Potato Animal testing Customs and etiquette of Japan Pepper spray Japanese toilet Ultraviolet Hair Diseases of the honeybee The Amber Spyglass Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Ranma __ characters Electrophysiology One Piece minor characters Car washing techniques Feral cat SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger Jute Hygiene Canary Napoleon I of France John Frusciante Nutmeg Fugu Scientology beliefs and practices Clothing Kosher foods Urea Spanish verbs DDT Kakapo Saint Certified Nursing Assistant 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Explosive material Laboratory Sewage treatment Scabies Tobacco Escherichia coli O157:H7 Chronic fatigue syndrome Poison Towel Cheese Bubonic plague Linked list Cytomegalovirus Frontline (Australian TV series) Breastfeeding
