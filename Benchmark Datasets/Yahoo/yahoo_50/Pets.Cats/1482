is it fair to a cat to neuter it before it has fathered mothered one litter from the cat's point of view it seems cruel and i feel guilty about taking my cats to the vet to be fixed would you feel guilty too thank you all for your answers so far i cant help thinking that if i was male i wouldnt want my bits snipped off but i'm probably just imagining that my puddytats have emotions which they dont really have but it must be a natural instinct to reproduce cats aren't humans and they don't think like we do if you take away their reproductive organs they don't have a sex drive and they lose it without knowing it's gone if you're feeling guilty think of the health benefits as they'll have a longer life expectancy males won't roam as much lessening the risk of traffic accidents they'll be less likely to fight and be injured reducing the risk of catching illnesses including serious ones such as feline leukaemia and fiv there'll be less scent marking and spraying and no caterwauling to 'serenade' a queen in heat a female comes into season up to times a year each time lasting about weeks during these times she'll howl loudly and her behaviour will change on top of which she'll have lots of attention of caterwauling toms she'll still look and act like a kitten when she first becomes sexually mature and i've known people who've been caught by surprise when their little kitten became pregnant the younger the cat the more difficult traumatic and problematic the pregnancy and delivery once she's neutered she'll have less chance of catching certain diseases through bites and reproductive activity she'll have reduced risk of some illesses such as mammary cancer note that a queen neutered after it has first come into heat has a times greater risk of having this cancer than a cat neutered before its first one in short cats have sex to satisfy hormone induced instincts not for pleasure like humans they don't miss what they've never had and you'll be giving them a longer life there are no benefits at all in letting your cat have a littering before being neutered the bare fact is that neutered cats have twice the life expectancy of unneutered ones on top of that there are enough unwanted kittens in the world many being destroyed for want of a good home why bring more kittens into the world even if you manage to find good homes for all the litter would it not have been better not to have kittens and let the homes take unwanted cats from shelters we've cats all neutered males and they are all affectionate we've had since they were kittens and we had them neutered their behaviour has changed for the better since the operation and they seem more contented if you're still not sure have a look at these http www oregonvma org petowners spayneuter asp http www vetsmart co uk html factsheets cat asp id http www catsinternational org articles feline care benefits spaying neutering html http www cats org uk catcare key cat care neutering asp http www rspca org uk servlet satellite pagename rspca rspcaredirect pg catspetcare marker articleid Dog Ferret Guinea pig Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Prostate cancer Castration Pregnancy Human sexual behavior Abortion debate Cancer Oral contraceptive Gender role House Mouse Garfield Child sexuality Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hamster Socialization Sex AIDS Tobacco smoking Sexual intercourse Toxoplasmosis Sex education Grammatical gender Manx (cat) Heterosexuality Elephant Sexual orientation Altruism Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Species Housebreaking Estrus cycle Milk Abortion in the United States Liger Divorce World Wide Web Puberty Consensual crime Reproduction Childbirth Teenage pregnancy EastEnders Sigmund Freud Cheetah Grief Postpartum depression Nerpa Endometriosis History of intersex surgery Alignment (role-playing games) Happiness Theory of conduct Zoophilia Gender identity Fox hunting Oral sex HIV Clinical depression Sterilization (surgical procedure) Transgender Baldness Herpes simplex virus Medicine Traumatic brain injury Rabbit Turner syndrome Breast Tocopherol Ajax (programming) Motivation Gray Wolf Sadism and masochism Growth hormone treatment Melanie Wilkes Anal sex Medical analysis of circumcision Poker jargon Schizophrenia Female genital cutting Antidepressant
