how do you tell if a cat is pregnant my not quite yr old cat got out on the fourth of july just a few days after she was obviously in heat when she got back in she was all skittish but what housecat wouldn't get skittish outside on the th of july as it's been over a month are there any signs i could check for to determine if she's pregnant i know that a cat's gestation is only about months so she's halfway through should she be showing now any other signs thanks i plan to get her spayed we saved her from the street but we hadn't had the funds to get her fixed quite yet it's not like i let her run around get pregnant she escaped she is exclusively indoors with other cats that are fixed she's always had a firm tummy she's the only cat i have that isn't pudgy she looks a bit rounder i think but it could be my imagination she hasn't been acting any different this method i was taught when i first started working with animals it's a good way to find out if kitty is pregnant take her and put her on a table using a table will be better for you and her gently scruff her by the back of the neck it doesn't hurt the cat and shows the cat that you are in control of the situation momma cats do this all the time to carry babies from one place to the other hold her up right having her on her hind legs place your hand on her belly and gently feel around squeeze a little to see if you can feel anything if you feel little round lumps in her belly it's a sure sign that she is pregnant those little round lumps will be the babies heads even if you take her to a veterinarian they will do the same thing hope this helps Cat Poker jargon Friends Breastfeeding Professional wrestling holds Guinea pig Dog Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dog training Suplex Debugging Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix Domestic rabbit EastEnders Escape from New York Feral cat Jam (TV series) Diving Kitten Aerial (dance move) The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Texas hold 'em Manx (cat) Professional wrestling throws Charmed Theory of conduct Horse gait Prenatal diagnosis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fancy rat Garfield Housebreaking Characters of Lost Pregnancy fetishism 2005 English cricket season Characters in the Smurfs Abortion debate Dairy Days of our Lives John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Incarnations of Immortality Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ferret Milton H.
