why do i still keep having dreams about my ex i have been separated and divorced from my ex for almost years now she has gone on been married and divorced and is basically no great catch although i try to remain civil with her since we have a child she is not friendly attractive or anything i really like but when i dream about her i feel so rejected why am i dreaming about her anyway i have been in about short term relationships haven't met the one and not sure if i want to settle down with anyone i just don't understand what kind of hold she still has on me after all this time because your marriage vows before god and man went like this for better or for worse for richer or for poorer in sickness and in heatlh 'til death were you supposed to part there's some real karma going on here and you have an inner conscience that's talking to you deep down that child means something also this is also why no other relationships are working out you might want to consider being bold having a real talk with her and possibly get back together there could be a window of opportunity for this to happen Marriage Theory of conduct Theodicy S__ren Kierkegaard Family Divorce Same-sex marriage Polygamy Humphrey Bogart God Emperor of Dune Luke and Laura Spencer Fiddler on the Roof Predestination Phoebe Halliwell Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Women in Islam Friends Eucharist The nature of God in Western theology Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Karen Horney Game show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish view of marriage Polyamory Presuppositional apologetics Karma Cyberspace Sant Thakar Singh Causality Supernatural Jon Secada John Wesley Religion and sexuality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sexual orientation Claudius Conscience Sin The Amber Spyglass Laura Schlessinger Existence Justification (theology) Kender Cary Grant Marilyn Monroe Miss Saigon Caste Masculism Another World (TV series) Salvation Maison Ikkoku Christian view of marriage Love Brigham Young Economic inequality Stan Laurel A Course In Miracles Animism Mail-order bride X Window System Homosexuality and Christianity The Shining (film) Incarnations of Immortality Kodocha Time Out of Mind Dream Eastern Orthodox Church Henry VIII of England Henry Fonda Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Poverty Milton H.
