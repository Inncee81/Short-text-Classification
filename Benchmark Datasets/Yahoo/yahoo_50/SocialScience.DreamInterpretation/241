i have this dream maybe once a month i don't know what it means i am in my boyfriends house and then i always go what seems like stories up the first story seems like my boyfriends house the other i can't tell but i always feel like i am at my granparents house in germany when i am on the third floor it starts out i push the ceilng foam aside like in office of school room and i squeeze through this small entrance i have to move all of our tarantula's off out shelf to climb onto the shelf i really doubt in real life it would support my weigh it is always different wheni get to the top i think my american granmother was there digging through junk i found an exnsive purse i assumed to be my german grandmothers then i always go to the computer there is or of them are always on and i have never seen the other on some are laptops i always go on there and my boyfriends messenger is always on and i i always look but never find anything this time i was searching the entire room and found and envelope full of a lot a of money there were dollar bills and everything the wad was like inches fat then someone came through thelittle hole someone old and i woke u i never make it back down the hole what in the world does this dream mean and please don't answer if you don't ahave any idea thanx i found the money yes but i did not take it i left it in the drawer although i did want to take it see i am looking for work right now and we are hard on cash i understand now both my grandmothers are fairly well off on money and they both know i need to furture my education but since i didn't graduate high school and i failed my ged it kind of seems like they don't want to help me out when they have the means to my sister gets checks for dollars about or times a year for school books but my sister doesn't been go to school anymore college and she buys stupid things like a dollar coach bag when she has a daughter to take care of i'm sure there are more details that you have not provided but from what you share i would say that you are trying to figure out what to do with yourself going up to the third floor is a signal that you need more education and training always finding computers means you might want to consider that field your grandmothers are a sign that you wish someone in your family would help you figure out life a little faster and the money is an indication that you are going to need some to get the training you need the weak shelf is the concern you have to pursue this road in life having to move the spiders means having to shift things in your life that you are used to and maybe it won't be such a good thing for others you might also be expecting your boyfriend to just make a decision for you or maybe even take care of you but in your heart you know that isn't going to happen hope this opens ups some ideas of your own Poker jargon Pitaten Shaggy dog story EastEnders Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Wheel of Fortune Social rule Avenue Q Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Theory of conduct The Price Is Right Ben Johnson (athlete) IBM PC compatible Blood (computer game) Betting (poker) RuneScape quests Education in Germany The Catcher in the Rye Milton H.
