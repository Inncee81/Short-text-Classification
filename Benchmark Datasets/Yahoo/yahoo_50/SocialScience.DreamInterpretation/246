a dream i kill someone i have made a strange nightmare last night my fellow platoon members me were resting when suddenly somebody we id as ennemy shoot at us everybody was looking at him and i was the only one to shoot at him but not with my regular service rifle but with an old bolt action rifle i shoot i shoot and shoot a third time to hit the head at close range then i woke up am i really going crazy just to add a little detail my regular service rifle is the fn fnc and i found myself in my dream with a lee enfield rifle i have one as collector's item a rifle used by the belgian army just at the end of wwii anameerf l can assure you that i am not waiting such opportunity it is not something i would do with joy but if needed i hope i will be up to the task i think that in this one the elements that stick out for me are the fact that you are the only one to stand and take action that you shoot with the old bolt action rifle and that you take multiple shots before the final close range kill shot i don't think you're going crazy but your subconscious is trying to work out some fears that you don't feel comfortable confronting consciously the fact that you're the only one to take action in this situation tells me that you're afraid that your fellow platoon members might let you down it's a reasonable fear the idea of standing alone in combat but realistically it won't happen like that this is just anxiety working its way out through your dreams you're shooting with your old bolt action rifle seems to have two possible meanings here on the one hand it could be anxiety in the sense that you feel like the weapons you have will let you down i'd go with this interpretation if your feelings about this weapon are that it's unreliable or somewhat negative in this interpretation it's more anxiety with the feeling that the weapons you're working with are going to let you down at the moment you need them alternative interpretation if you have strong positive feelings associated with the weapon then i would say that you have a connection with the past associated with your service in this case you are connecting with pride with the soldiers of the past and taking action with this rifle is giving you this sense of nobility and courage multiple shots and final close range shot to me indicates a sense of overkill i think we are looking at anxiety again and a fear that you will panic and the horror will get too close to you i think there are issues of anxiety fear a sense that perhaps you will have to deal with things without anyone to help you depending on the rifle this may be a mixed dream with also a sense of pride in your identity as a soldier this is common though to have a mixed dream they tend to be more confusing and nightmarish because they are not clear M16 (rifle) Rifle Krag-J__rgensen Springfield 1903 rifle Sniper Platoon (film) Martial art Ammunition Out-of-body experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Mixed martial arts Internal ballistics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Shaggy dog story Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Mosin-Nagant ISSF shooting events The Amber Spyglass Carbine StarCraft: Uprising Polish cavalry Jon Secada Unreal Milton H.
