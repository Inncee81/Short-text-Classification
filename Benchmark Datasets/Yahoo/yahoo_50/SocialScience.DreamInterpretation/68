unusual dream need help ok i was in a local theatre and i use to work there real life i remember being in the elevator projectionist and hearing of a fire and we had an alarm my initial reaction was to help everybody remind you i have not seen any fire and i only know that its going on well i got off the elevator and from what i remember my co worker and acquaintance worked with at the theatre ended up popping in some part of my dream on the elevator and i was guiding him on what to do with helping others the thing is that my coworker shot himself less than a year ago and is dead i am sure it was him in my dream but i find it hard to believe well everything calmed down and i ended up looking around for my ex same county firefighter once the firefighters were leaving i did not see him but i ran into my family i never seen one flame weird a few things i noticed your ex was a firefighter you used to work there you coworker was dead that dream of fire or alarm could be related to what you have experienced either from your ex or your job however elevator decision making guiding him on what to do with helping others seeking support fire alarm alert reminder dead coworker feeling loss it seems like in reality you are into some sort of decision making you tend to be in control in many ways however projecting fire alarm in your dream shows that you have to make up your mind somehow in some sort of decision making you may think you are able to do it yourself however subconsciously you are seeking help projecting people needing your help shows subconsciously you are in charge however that is flip side of it you are feeling loss co worker is dead because there is so much you can do in life and basically you are seeking help but you do not want people to know Infantilism Firefighter Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Dream Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Unconscious mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The nature of God in Western theology Fire fighting Unemployment Elevator Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Alcoholics Anonymous Daylight saving time Avenue Q Aerosmith Year of the Spider Fight Club Honey and Clover Colony in Space Journey (band) Scientology beliefs and practices Glossary of firefighting equipment Prostate cancer Glossary of firefighting terms K' Anarchism and society Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Psychoanalysis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Mother Transactional analysis Derren Brown Burglar alarm EastEnders Jean Grey Bushfire Aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks W.
