can anyone help me with this dream meaning well about half hour ago i had a dream that i found my boyfriend under my bosses desk wih some naked blonde chick they had just had sex and he was laughing and cuddling up with her i kept telling eveyone look see what is going on and no onecared then i find myself out in the rain somewhere like ye olde world type thing contemplating life when this man trys o sell me smoothies and other drink from his stall anyone that can help with a serious answer for this dream meaning would be much appreciated xxx sighs i usually don't respond to dreams like this one just because the main issue of the dream is usually apparent but you seemed like you wanted some opinions input and perhaps a little consolation as well it's a trust issue subconciously or even consciously there are trust issues in your relationship with your boyfriend dreaming of your partner having an affair or cheating on you usually depicts that there are very strong unresolved issues with distrust in the relationship this could be on your part or on his has he ever cheated on you during the time you were together does he flirt a lot with other women either when your are or are not with him if neither of those things are true do you feel like he doesnt spend enough time with you or pay attention to you this could be the reason that you dreamt of him 'compromised' with the woman in the dream why that type of woman i e in reference to the 'act' of sexual relations in the dream or with that colour hair it couldve been any does he tend to like blonde women or do you feel like perhaps he favours blonde women over women with darker hair do you feel inferior to women with blonde hair in the sense of comparing your beauty to that of someone with blonde hair these may not even be relevant conclusions yet they are questions you should ask yourself as women we often compare ourselves with other women we may admire the beauty we see in others and compare oursleves to them thinking ourselves less beautiful and appealing for a number of reasons this is our nature but this is not true every woman is beautiful in her own way i think we each need to realise this as we as women are all guilty of comparing ourselves to each other wanting to be like that which we think or believe is beautiful it takes more confidence in yourself and a realisation of your own personal beauty inside and out for which he fell in love with you in the first place the fact that you dreamt him laughing about it after he got caught by you this again could be the trust issue or could be revealing of his personality if you have had issues in the past with him cheating on you in real life this i believe is relevant as indicated by the next part of you dreaming of being in the 'ye olde world type thing' as that is representavie and symbollic of your past perhaps your past with him in terms of the realtionship you were contemplating life you were out in the rain somewhere rain can be symbollic of a refreshing or a cleansing but that depends on the context and setting of the dream as in the particulars of this dream what was emoted by you as you were standing out in the rain i see it more as symbollic of you feeling lonely and isolated perhpas in this relationship and even perhaps so far back as when it first began which would seem to fit in with the context of you dreaming of the past i e olde world the part about the smoothies and drinking from his stall i havent any sense on except maybe it indicates a self comforting or self medicating in a way in the sense of or along the same lines as does a drink at the bar after a really bad day at work act as a kind of therapy for our emotions perhaps this is representative of bringing health to you in terms of choosing healthy relationships as smoothies are healthy but i dont know i think that's a stretch in any case i'd say that for your relationship with him your boyfriend to go on the two of you need to bridge that gap of communication and quality time that is causing this major trust issue in the relationship as without trust and communication even the most hand picked of relationships will fail if he is the kind that is a philander at heart then you need to have the confidence to end the relationship knowing that you can do better as any man that cannot be faithful is no man at all and not worth your time this is just my opinion take it with a grain of salt EastEnders Social rule Sexual orientation Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Human sexual behavior Abortion debate Blonde on Blonde Simone Weil Child sexuality Transsexuality Dead Like Me Sin City W.I.T.C.H.
