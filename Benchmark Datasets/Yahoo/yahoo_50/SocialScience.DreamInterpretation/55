do you believe in this i have had a very unfortunate life suffered childhood abuse and have had one abusive relationship after another i have also always had the most vivid nightmares since i was a kid hardly ever having good dreams i would thrash as a child and would hurt my feet from kicking the wall whilst asleep and the nightmares have got worse as i've got older and i often dream of someone being in my room wanting to kill me so when i wake i'm still scared i've recently read a book called the secret given by a friend and it's about positive thinking and how you can change your life through your thoughts and that like attracts like and you will bring good things to you by thinking good thoughts call me crazy but i totally believe in this and in the couple of weeks since reading it have for the first time in my life felt in love with myself at peace positive and really believe in myself and that happiness is going to rule my life from now on so many good things have happened to me in the last couple of weeks just little things but enough to be noticeable then last night i had a good dream i always dream i m being chased and always wake up at the point that i die in the dream last night i dreamt that instead of being caught i ran from the bad people and found the gateway to a parallel universe one they couldn t enter exactly the same world so much so i had to look back in my dream to check but it felt good my friends were there and i could sense that this world was my new world and i would be happy there i woke up feeling so amazing so happy so calm and so rest assured can it be true that my nightmares are banished can it be true that through all my positive belief and thoughts the last few weeks i have really brought happiness to my door at last i think so do you absolutely your attitude toward yourself and others directly affects how people treat you which directly affects your feelings toward yourself and so on and so on if you treat yourself as a victim people will victimize you i'm sorry to hear that you had such a bad life i never like to hear about childhood abuse realize though that it is not your fault you should have no guilt over this you didn't do anything wrong the abusers are the guilty party accept this fact and become strong from it you are strong you are beautiful you need to be happy and secure with yourself you cannot find this in another person you cannot be happy with another person unless you are happy with yourself when you are happy and confident people will flock to you because you compliment them not because they can control you stop the cycle of abuse postive thinking positive results but there must be action as well ditch the abusers they aren't worth your time Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Transactional analysis Scenes from a Memory Lucid dreaming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Infantilism Goodness and value theory Alcoholics Anonymous The Catcher in the Rye Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare God Emperor of Dune Utilitarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Sigmund Freud Out-of-body experience K' Pitaten W.I.T.C.H.
