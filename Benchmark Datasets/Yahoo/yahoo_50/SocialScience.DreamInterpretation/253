can some one interprit my dream i was driving with both of my parents in the car and my father was falling asleep and we had almost crashed so me and my mother proceeded to yellat him and we did that and he woke up an then we kept driving and then this trailer skided and hit us and more people and we went off a bridge and we were in a tree and immediately i starteed looking for my mother searching that she would be ok she was next to me but my dad wasnt then i tried calling but i accidentaly dialed then we got off the tree with the help of some workers and there was this little dog walking around i dont remember what kind of dog it was i think a little beagle the end well last night i did eat like burritos and alot of hot sauce and i also watched harry potter and the order of the phoenix but yeah me and my father get along well in my religion it is a sin to not honour your father in the family relationship it seems to be just you and your parents and you perceive that your father is letting the family down falling asleep the driving symbolizes just getting on with life normal boring day to day living your father is in the driver's seat so he's the one that's in control of the situation but i think that you and your mother feel he's not paying attention falling asleep again and both of you find it hard to connect with your father which is why you are both yelling at him as he is falling asleep sometimes this yelling works because he wakes up and continues driving i think this part of the dream is symbolic of your perception of day to day living where you feel like you go along once in awhile screaming for attention your father in the driver's seat and not always paying attention and almost crashing the trailer skidding and hitting you and more people seems to symbolize a traumatic or disastrous event that will happen perhaps you forsee the path your family is heading on and that it might end badly and potentially hurt a lot of people you feel close to your mother because she was next to you and you begin searching for her there's still this sense that you are emotionally disconnected from your father because you're very aware that in this scary situation he wasn't next to you but your mother was you don't trust your capability to deal with the emergency situation because you dial the wrong number not finally you get down from the tree with the help of others i'm not sure about the dog because from the context of the dream i'm not sure where he appears at the end or throughout he could indicate a gentleness on your part or your tendency to get distracted overall i think you have this strong feeling of solidarity with your mother and worry that you will lose her or not be able to protect her if something traumatic happens in your family there's also a feeling that you are not able to communicate with your father as well as you would like and that he's in control of the family but perhaps not paying the best attention to where he's leading you that maybe your father should listen to what you and your mother need a bit better you're also worried about your own skill in dealing with stressful situations and whether you could do so successfully or not Shaggy dog story Philosophical skepticism Milton H.
