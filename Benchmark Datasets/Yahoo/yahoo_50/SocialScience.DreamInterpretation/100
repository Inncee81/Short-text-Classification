does anyone other than me remember every single dream theyve ever had even the slightest details ever since i was two years old i had this dream about a lava monster ever since that day i remember multiple dreams a night every little detail even today i can recal thousands of dreams i never really know whether im remembering real life or only a dream and they are all so funny just the weirdest dreams even if i dont remember it right away the come to me like flashes that just leave my jaw dropped does anyone else have problems to say at the least similar to this i remember every single dream that i can remember upon waking i write them down in a journal right after the dream aswell i still remember a dream years ago when i was child and i had a falling dream before getting chased around at the bottom by johnny bravo perhaps the more interested in dreams and related is leading to a more active remembrace because i know i'm very big on imagination Dream Lucid dreaming Cliff Richard Haibane Renmei Philip K.
