gym assassination last night i had this dream that i was doing a bench press at a gym when some guy in a uniform wearing gloves and sunglasses walks behind me grabs the barbell and uses it to pin me down he lifts up a syringe full of potassium chloride stabs it into the carotid artery in my neck and injects the fluid into me i can't move because of the barbell and nobody in the gym notices right then i have a massive heart attack and wake up does anybody here know what this means yeah i work out and as i'm a med school student and use a syringe every couple of days the needle part makes a lot of sense do you work out if so this can be a normal worry getting pinned and not having the strength to get up if you just saw a movie that had elements of this that could it too the mind is pretty creative when it has no bounds of conciousness Intravenous therapy Weight training Powerlifting Syringe Professional wrestling holds Akuma (Street Fighter) Tenshinhan K' Lethal injection Professional wrestling throws First aid Stroke Aikido The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Suplex Dodgeball Aerial (dance move) Pulp Fiction The Inside Infusion pump Hypodermic needle Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Potassium Earring Weightlifting Cobra Commander Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Pneumonia Professional wrestling aerial techniques Trish Stratus Time Out of Mind Dialysis Team Fortress Classic Potassium chloride Insulin Vegeta Vein Diabetes mellitus Carpal tunnel syndrome Vampire Jugular venous pressure Tai Chi Chuan Pok__mon Live!
