what does my dream mean ok so last night i had this dream that i was in this room that was supposedly mine but it was detached from the main house like some sort of casita it was well lit and looked like any normal teenagers room the problem was i couldn't lock the doors because i didn't have the keys to the room anyways it was nighttime i was watching the movie 'brokeback mountain' which baffles me even more and i was kind of scared because my doors weren't locked and it was pitch black outside though it was well lit inside suddenly there happened to be security guards outside and there were robbers getting away with stuff at the neighbors house with the security guards doing nothing about it what does all this mean i am gay in the closet but i really have no intention on watching brokeback mountain hmm well this is just speculation but maybe you feel that you have a guilty pleasure or something that you hide from other people brokeback mountain and the normal room and you are constantly afraid that someone somehow the darkness will find out unlocked room or you are exposed too much and that regarding this or something else you see crimes happening all the time even though the police and government do not seem to intervene security guards and robbers if this regards the first part of the dream then maybe it's the crime of society forcing you to hide whatever you are hiding this is what i can see right now as far as you describe your dream or perhaps it was just a random dream that has no significance and is just showing your imagination of my dreams are like that Shaggy dog story StarCraft: Uprising Changeroom Sin City Bad Wolf Blood (computer game) Perfect Dark Columbine High School massacre Surveillance RuneScape quests The Brady Bunch Milton H.
