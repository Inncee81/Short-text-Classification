here's a fun dream to interpret my situation i'm years old single rent a duplex start a new job on monday my cat named kiwi is years old i've always been able to tell why i have dreamed about something based on what was going on in my life or the thoughts of the previous couple of days this however has nothing to do with any of it i usually don't remember my dreams unless i'm awakened during the dreaming cycle in a rural area it starts off with me in a house that i've never been to before we went to town to get something from the market and came back i noticed my cat was missing i went into the woods to try to find her i noticed a mideval convoy of about people on horseback on a dirt road i then noticed a lady in a tiger costume on a horse ride past me i then saw tigers perched in the hills above the road watching me next i was running by some deer jumped over and the buck got angry and ran beside me he then turned to attack but i avoided it and ran some more there was some more running in the woods beside a lake and then to some people on top of the hill that forms the lake then there was a bar full of people and we all exited this is where it gets interesting on top of the hill in a group of about people i noticed everyone laid on their backs to look at the sky i did the same and saw a meteor shower although there were way too many meteorites probably about per second and they were too small and moving in a pattern i noticed two red slow moving meteorites leaving a long trail then it all stopped and mars faded into view in the middle of the sky but it was the size of the moon not a red dot then it rotated up degrees and back down degrees then about degrees to the right a small blue light appeared on its surface and everyone started to get scared so we all stood up and ran to the left and heard an explosion in the distance behind us then while running to get away i heard artillery thumps in the distance and looked up i noticed artillery above us coming down at our position and in our path so we all walked backwards while trying to understand this dream in my sleep i remember thinking it must be associated with something mystical and ancient i can't relate this to anything going on in my life right now so any interpretations would be helpful thanks i had to print this out so i could start writing my best selling sci fi fantasy book about this one just kidding it's odd that while your own cat was missing in your dream you still dreamed a lot about cats it could mean that your only constant in life now is your cat kiwi and that without your her your life would be surreal you tend to fantasize or daydream to me which is not bad i do that myself perhaps too much thank god for yahoo answers for such distractions as unusual and changing as life is now for this is what the interesting part seems to me you still look for order and structure something to make sense meteor showers are random and not orderly the way you saw them in your dream you tend to be a follower perhaps since you were in a group of yet you have the ability to be alone and survive just like a cat with nine lives in the same way you avoided a dangerous situation with the buck and avoided it this is what starting your new job represents to me the final part of your dream suggests uncertainty in your new job don't be afraid and go with the flow kiwi is always with you nice dream i'll let you write the best seller Opportunity rover Astronomy on Mars Paul Is Dead Tai shogi Equine conformation Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Time Machine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Battles of Lexington and Concord Impact crater Taikyoku shogi Code: Lyoko Aerial (dance move) Avenue Q Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Radar Moon The Shining (film) Milton H.
