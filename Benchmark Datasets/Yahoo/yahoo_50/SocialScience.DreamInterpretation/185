do you think the same dream every night means something i've had the same dream every night for the past week that i die from a fire in my bedroom do dreams symbolize something else to dream of that you are being burned by fire indicates that your temper is getting out of control some issue or situation is burning you up inside most dreams contain messages that serve to teach us something about ourselves unfortunately many a times we forget what we dream about as we go about our daily routine with recurring dreams the message may be so important and or powerful that it just will not go away the frequent repetition of such dreams forces you to pay attention and confront the dream the dream is trying desperately to tell you something such dreams are often nightmarish or frightening in their content which also helps you to take notice and pay attention to them recurring dreams are quite common and are often triggered by a certain life situation or a problem that keeps coming back again and again these dreams may recur daily once a week or once a month but whatever the frequency there is little variation in the dream content itself it usually points to a personal weakness fear or your inability to cope with something in your life past or present the repetitive patterns in your dream can reveal some of the most valuable information on yourself it may point to a conflict situation or matter in your waking life that remains unresolved or unsettled or some urgent underlying message in your unconscious is demanding to be understood following are some tips in overcoming your recurring dreams in understanding your recurring dream you must be willing to accept some sort of change or undergo a transformation you must be willing to look within yourself and confront whatever you may find no matter how difficult it my be you must be able to look at the dream from an objective point of view try to get pass the emotional and reactive elements of the dream and get down to the symbolic images many times dreams are masked by elements that are disturbing preventing you to delve any deeper this is a defense mechanism that your unconscious may be putting up be patient do not get discourage if these dreams still recur even after you thought you have come to understand them learn to accept yourself truly and fully often times once you discover what your recurring dream is trying to tell you these dreams will change or altogether disappear Dream Traumatic incident reduction Narcissism Psychoanalysis Carl Jung Karen Horney Autism Internet troll Clinical depression Consensus decision-making Narcolepsy Social psychology Epilepsy Deconstruction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Meaning of life Transsexuality Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Infantilism Unconscious mind Lucid dreaming Urinary incontinence Stuttering Miss Saigon Strategic management Futurama (TV series - season 5) Procrastination Cultural relativism Traumatic brain injury Children of Dune Milton H.
