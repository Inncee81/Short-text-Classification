would you like to enjoy one of my bizzare dreams i have dreams like this every night but i took the liberty of writing this one down as soon as i woke up while it was still fresh in my memory and i swear i don't use drugs my cousin wanted me to drop her off at the mall on my way somewhere we drove from her house after i dropped her off i suddenly had a white bag full of groceries i was carrying over my shoulders not only that but my deaf mute aunt was taking my groceries from me i yelled at her in sign language and she got into a van and drove off i wanted to chase her but for some reason it took me an eternity to put my key into the ignition and i could see her driving by trees gradually gaining distance finally i got the car to work and drrove over sidewalks and grassy hills to catch up with her as i was speeding down a sidewalk i noticed a cop car and was sure he would try to stop me but out of nowhere a brown horse reared up and must've caught the officers attention because they didn't give chase brb so as i'm driving i noticed my car had beome a bicycle and there were police searching houses i pulled over and asked what was happening to a couple of officers they didn't say much but i thought they were lying i rode on and came to a bridge that turned the road into a swamp i had to climb up a series of trees mixed with pavement to get passed that point as i was climbing a fat anaconda tried biting my hands i took a closer look and noticed although it was very wide it was only about a foot and a half long and it had fangs i tried grabbing it behind its head but it was very strong and still managed to barely bite me so i started to smash it against rocks while looking for something to stab it with suddenly it slithered away and a beautiful neon blue light radiated from the direction the snake went then i woke up i always have dreams like that they're usually pretty funny when i look back at them Professional wrestling throws Knots Landing Reservoir Dogs Shaggy dog story Vehicular cycling Professional wrestling holds The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sin City The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escape from New York Transportation of Los Angeles Drag racing Grand Theft Auto (game) Paul Is Dead Milton H.
