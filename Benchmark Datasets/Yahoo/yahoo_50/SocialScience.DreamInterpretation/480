noticed a change in dreams recently ive noticed that i havent had a nightmare in years and that before i used to be in a dream i would think it was real but now im more aware and instead of thinking its real im just like watching things happening and im often involved in stuff and moving and doing stuff but im not thinking just observing and acting and sometimes in a third person watching myself this normal or mean anything or what according to dreamcrowd to dream that you are watching something represents you lack of initiative to take a position or action the dream may also symbolize your neutrality in some situation you do not want to take a side to dream that you are being watched suggests that you are feeling confined in your work environment or personal relationship you feel you are lacking a sense of privacy try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Lucid dreaming Dream Out-of-body experience Autism Rape Artificial consciousness Sigmund Freud Karen Horney Miss Saigon Psychoanalysis Free will A Course In Miracles Cyberspace Determinism Theodicy Consciousness Immanuel Kant Infantilism Phoneme Objectivist philosophy Philosophical skepticism Jon Secada Dualism (philosophy of mind) Mulholland Drive (film) Carl Jung Jiddu Krishnamurti Asperger syndrome Estoppel Summa Theologiae Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Philosophy of mathematics Alexander Technique German student movement Friedrich Schleiermacher Transactional analysis Culture Ethics God Emperor of Dune General relativity Carlos Castaneda Obsessive-compulsive disorder Manual transmission Magical thinking Coercion Philosophy of perception Volleyball Scenes from a Memory Cultural Revolution Alignment (role-playing games) Law of value Internet troll Tonality Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change K' Social psychology Surveillance Separation of church and state Meaning Stuttering Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Post-traumatic stress disorder Fair use Anonymity Scientology beliefs and practices Time travel Milton H.
