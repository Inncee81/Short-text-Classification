recurring dream of ex and cheating my boyfriend tell me his dreams all the time and he's had recurring dreams of his ex she was his first real relationship and she was his girlfriend right before me they're different everytime one is when he was at home and he hears a baby crying his ex comes into his house angry and says something like this is your baby look what you did then another dream that was recent is that he and his ex got back together they were in his car talking then it starts getting hot 'n heavy ugh i told him he probably misses her what does it mean really should i be worried this is all very normal and part of the healing process we have very little control over what happens in our dreams and sometimes even small triggers like a smell of familiar perfume is enough to get the sub conscious mind to dream about old relationships or past events the most important part of your story is that he is talking to you about these dreams he's having and not hiding it from you this shows that he is not ashamed of the dreams he's having because there is no truth to them this means that his concious mind does not want to be back with her and is happy with you hiding his dreams might mean the opposite and that he is afraid that telling his dreams you would reveal his true feelings Scenes from a Memory Kodocha Avenue Q Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Neighbours EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Miss Saigon Days of our Lives Sin City Paranoia Agent Jean Grey Leo Wyatt Friends Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Social rule Cliff Richard Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Consciousness The Invisibles Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dream Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Grandview, U.S.A.
