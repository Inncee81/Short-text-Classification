how is it possible to dream of someone you've never met and never seen in my dreams the person exists with shape and form but has no 'real' physical details but they're there almost like a shadow but as more than that according to dreamcrowd it is very common to dream about all kinds of faces strange faces and familiar faces alike are frequent images in our dreams interpret your dream by considering the face and the general content of the dream a stranger's face could represent different parts of your personality or psyche you think that you are seeing a stranger but in actuality you are seeing a different part of yourself jung said that the stranger is a part of you that comes from the unconscious a comic face may indicate that you have a conscious or unconscious need to mock or snub the conventional featureless faces suggest that you may feel unnoticed and unappreciated on the other hand some believe that the blank or unclear face represents a teacher that is someone who is there to show and teach you a lesson but you are unprepared for it and the face is blank smiling faces are representative of happy thoughts and feelings and possibly anticipation of a joyful event in the near future always remember the compensatory nature of dreams and their ability to point to the opposite of what you experience in daily life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Dream Carl Jung Consciousness Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud James Hillman Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Artificial consciousness Analytical psychology Karen Horney Collective unconscious Free will A Course In Miracles Alexander Technique Lucid dreaming Meaning of life Cyberspace Past teachings of Prem Rawat Oneiromancy Drama God Emperor of Dune Gestalt therapy Happiness Near-death experience Synchronicity Shadow (psychology) Michel Henry Modernism Eyes Wide Shut Philosophical skepticism The Giver Animism Carlos Castaneda Theory of conduct Current teachings of Prem Rawat Out-of-body experience Socrates Stranger (Myst) Narrator Scientology beliefs and practices Human nature Edgar Cayce Soul Human Polyhedron Anthroposophy Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death of a Salesman Jungian psychology Dualism (philosophy of mind) Religion Scenes from a Memory Supernatural Objectivist philosophy Jiddu Krishnamurti Doctor (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Drawing Rudolf Steiner Characters of The Sandman Sri Aurobindo Mojave people Friedrich Schleiermacher Alcoholics Anonymous Transactional analysis The Amber Spyglass Salad Fingers Traumatic incident reduction Unidentified flying object Existentialism Glossary of partner dance terms Determinism Sin City Causality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Mind Poker jargon Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Irony Tarot Saga (band) Philosophy of perception Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Master (Doctor Who) Aikido Shadow the Hedgehog W.I.T.C.H.
