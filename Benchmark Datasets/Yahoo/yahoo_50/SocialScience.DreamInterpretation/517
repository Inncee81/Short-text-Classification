my year old daughter is afraid to sleep because dead people come and talk to her in her sleep she says the dead people dont want to leave this world and ask her to help them come back any suggestions on what to do its been going on for years she doesnt watch scary movies or such she is into sponge bob and disney still even when she is awake sometimes she sees them and talks to them i think she's gifted but doesnt know how to use it or control it look up your local spiritualist church it is quite normal for gifted children to be able to communicate with the spirit world for reasons not fully understood there are trained mediums there many of whom were just like her when they were little for goodness sake don't put her in the hands of the shrinks who don't or won't admit such things exist don't let them put her on strong drugs or attach electrodes to her head she needs developing not suppressing she has a gift not an illness i recommend the spiritualist church not through any religious conviction or sense of evangelism but because after my mother came back to me after she had passed away to tell me that i was a healer i had nowhere else to turn after training i am now a qualified healing medium and feel grateful because i can help many with training she will be able to help others too who like you are frightened Out-of-body experience Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roman Catholic Church Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Animism A Course In Miracles Church of Christ, Scientist Baptism The Lovely Bones Eastern Orthodox Church Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Milton H.
