who should i see about dreams that come true i just want to know if theres a specialist i could go see for help or direction on my dreams i tend to have dreams every so often about an image or a story that comes true for example i had a dream about a plane crash then a few days later there was a plane crash its not something i'm scared of i would just like some direction on what i should do i don't know of any professional who could help you in any way my mother and i have both had dreams that came true she had dreams about my car accidents the nights before i believe she may forseen an accident which she warned me about so i didn't drive the next day thus i had no accident i dreamt of planes crashing into buildings in the weeks before scared the crap out of me when it happened i felt like i should have done something but i know there was no way i could have prevented it most of my premonitions occur while i'm awake i've learned to go with my instincts one example once i was watching tv when i heard what sounded like an old bombing raid siren i went outside to see what it was i saw nothing but the siren started getting louder i lit a cigarette and decided to wait to see if something would happen about seconds later i looked up to see a young lady walking down the street saying no leave me alone to a car following her the siren stopped as the lady approached an alley the car sped up and pulled into the alley the car stopped blocking her path and a man got out and started to walk toward her she screamed no get away from me at that point i walked into the street and said do you need some help mam the man looked at me ran back to his car and sped off she said she didn't know him and that he had begun following her block up the street i believe i prevented a kidnapping and who knows what else my advice is this go with your instincts you probably could not have done anything about the plane crash but if you have a dream in which someone you know gets hurt or something on a small scale like that go ahead and try to warn them you may save a life and since you've noticed this ability pay attention to your gut feelings when you're awake who knows what else you might be capable of Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
