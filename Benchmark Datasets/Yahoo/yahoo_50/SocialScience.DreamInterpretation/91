ok i have this creepy dream it starts out just me in a movie theater and everything is black then the screen comes on and it is white then the screen is ripped in half and a giant hand that all it is a big hand that is almost cartoonish with a white glove and a huge butcher knife then i notice that there are other people in the movie theater and we all start screaming and run out of the building and run through neighborhoods while this big hang with a knife chases us and then finally we find a house and we all pile in there but the big hand and knife burst through the door and there we all are cornered that is when i wake up just a common nightmare of a public calamity wouldnt worry about it too much knives are usually thought to be empowering and public places are thought to be a sign of shyness cheerios Wes Craven's New Nightmare The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Inside Shaggy dog story Scream (film) The Shining (film) Sin City Initiation: Silent Night, Deadly Night 4 Richard Chase Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Escape from New York Dream Theater Codename: Kids Next Door The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Meat Loaf Scenes from a Memory EastEnders The Empty Child O.
