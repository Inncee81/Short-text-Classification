what in the world does this mean okay this is a dream that i had and am wondering what it means k so i was at this party with a bunch of my friends and family this part was strangy a party that actually happened and as the party progressed i would do stuff with people like my best friend and they would transform to this girl kate that used to be my friend but now is not we talk about her and like no one likes her anymore i woud go over to my mom and she became kate i was about to kiss this boy tommy and he turned into kate what does this mean we kind of ended on bad turms it just kind of ended i chose that i didnt want our friendship anymore to be there so i just stopped it it deffinatly wasnt mutual my choice well first consider where your dreams come from they come from your brain who is the dreamer you you and your brain are the same thing so when it comes to dreaming you are your brain the dream was your brains message to you and you only nobody else can tell you what your dream means except you you the dreamer know how you the one who is awake and asking about her dream will interpret your dream and however you interpret it is correct there is no wrong intepretation as long as it's your own interpretation funnily your dreaming brain knew you would go onto yahoo answers and ask this question so doing that is equally valid Lucid dreaming The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy One Tree Hill (TV series) Dream Out-of-body experience Friends W.I.T.C.H.
