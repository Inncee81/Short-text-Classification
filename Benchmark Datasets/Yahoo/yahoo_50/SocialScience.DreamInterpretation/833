can someone interpret my dreams please it starts out a couple of people in boat and there' s me and a guy holding on to the end of the boat we're in the water not on the boat and i help this blond girl get into the boat i guess she fell out or something and we're headed towards like a cave somehow we managed to go the guy father's house i guess he's my boyfriend since we were holding hands and were awfully close he and his father take me to the backyard and the father says you should tell her and so we walk to this area and the father starts digging and he dug up clothes of a baby boy and like crib liner thing he starts explaining what happened though i couldn't hear so the father told me to rest my head on his leg and he told me that he saw them kill his father in front of him and then we walk back into the house and like the government people were there and one of them took my boyfriend and his father and left and one of them told me to go outside with a blanket but couldn't leave remember that dreams are symbols that are created by the sub conscious so that when you dream you can deal with problems that you cannot handle when you are awake from your dream i believe that you have a need to hang on to people and things for security you have a problem with adults and authority figures when something occurs that you don't want to handle you shut it out so that you don't have to hear it and deal with it when in fact you need to be open minded so that you can hear and deal with the problems in your life so that you can get through your problems and get past them and get them out of your life once and for all if you underdstand what i am saying and agree with me then i would like to suggest that you go see a therapist for a while and get your life back on track where it belongs Scenes from a Memory Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
