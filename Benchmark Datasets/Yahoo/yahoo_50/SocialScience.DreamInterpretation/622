injuries blood surgery i had a dream last night there were people injured there was a girl whose injury was self inflicted she was telling someone not me but i could over hear that she'd finally found where the main artery is so she stabbed herself there she had her hand covering the wound and there was no sign of any injury at all but when she took her hand away to show the person she was telling blood gushed out a lot of it then there was a man who seemed to be my patient he was lying down and his torso was quite mangled i noted to someone that i could see his shoulder blade sticking out except there was no blood whatsoever and he was cheerful and chatty this man had the same name as a man i know the father of a guy i really like but it wasn't him i knew that he'd need surgery so i went off to phone to book him a theatre or something now i'm in my parents house where i'm staying at the moment picking up their phone it's noisy so i'm looking around for a quiet room my parents live in the countryside so there normally wouldn't be any noise inside or out my sisters room is quiet though there's some noise outside the window i have the relevent phone number on a piece of paper so i dial the number but it seems to be wrong so i decide to ring directory inquiries and then i woke up http www dreammoods com dreamdictionary Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Friends Kodocha Triage Shaggy dog story Social rule The Dalek Invasion of Earth Jam (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Escape from New York One Tree Hill (TV series) The Contender (television series) Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Blood Simple Salad Fingers Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
