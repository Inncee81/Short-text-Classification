not sure what this dream meant i had a dream the other night that i had twin baby girls we were on a boat out in the ocean and for some reason i had to jump holding the girls when i was rescued and pulled to the top of another boat only one of my girls was in my arms i remember crying and saying that i tried to save her but couldn't i remember people helping me try to find her and we couldn't then later on i saw her floating in the ocean and when the people went to get her from the water a shark grabbed her and took off i totally freaked in my dream and then woke up now i don't have twin girls but i do have two daughters one is and the other is any idea what this dream meant twins your two daughters one of your girls was in your arms dependent other floating in the ocean seeking help shark threat fear guilt conscience looks like you are burdened by the fact that you have to upbringing two children projecting one of them was saved and other wasn't show sign of anxiety you may be having negligence on one of the daughter and that caused you dream like that perhaps one of your daughter is giving you signals that you love one more than others basically this dream is about your conflict feeling about treating them equally maybe you are doing it equally however due to heavy responsibilities you are feeling unfair sometimes for both of them projecting shark grabbing her symbolize some sort of regret in reality maybe you have some regret for not giving fair treatment for both of them and you may be stressed about complains from them and basically you had to vent it out in dream Knots Landing Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Charmed Jon Secada Days of our Lives Psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud Drowning Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RMS Titanic Romulus and Remus Miss Saigon Swimming Transsexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ecco the Dolphin One Piece minor characters Jaws (film) Diving Urinary incontinence Scenes from a Memory Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kasparov versus The World Final Fantasy: Unlimited Narcissism Fathers' rights Paranoia Agent Cliff Richard One Tree Hill (TV series) Aikido Night (book) Waking the Dragons Journey (band) Infantilism Dream The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jumping the shark Bipolar disorder Street-Legal Rais massacre House of M Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Abortion debate Clinical depression Insomnia Tide Lucid dreaming First Battle of the Atlantic L__ Bu 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters of Lost W.I.T.C.H.
