i'm usually pretty good at doing this myself but i need someone to help me interpret this dream in the dream my year old son and i were at a red light he hopped out of the car and ran to the car ahead of us and got in with them for whatever reason i didn't get out but i was honking my horn like crazy for him to come back to me the light turned and we crossed the street and we were at my dad's station a chevron in real life my dad died years ago and he got out and he had a bag of cookies in his hand i quickly grabbed the cookies and looked and seen tiny pieces of pecans in them i was screaming and angry as i watched my son start to be able not to breathe in real life he is allergic to tree nuts i was crying and asking him why like why did you eat food from strangers because i taught you not to do this and i was angry not at him but at the people that gave him the food he was crying also because he knew he was dying is this a warning or is this just a fear dream please serious answers only i'd say this is simply a 'fear dream' not an intuitive one along the lines of a premonition or anything as a mother you have that protective instinct over your child sometimes the genuine concerns about the welfare and safety of your child will be 'transposed' into your dream life due to your subconscious fears of all possible scenarios of things that could happen especially since he's so little like getting into a car with strangers or eating food he's allergic to i'd say subconsciously youre worried that something bad might happen and you wont be there in time to intervene this is a normal 'fear' so long as it doesnt consume you and you become so over protective that you refuse to let your child have any freedom the cars life your life his life etc red light stop i e your 'rules' correction discipline etc honking your horn trying to get your son's attention i e 'listen to mommy' etc intersection crossroads direction i think this pertains to perhaps certain interests behaviours traits your son shows demonstrates that remind you of your dad were there some things that your father did that you saw as unhealty behaviours if so this could explain your concern that your son will grow up and take on those negative qualities reiterated by eating the bag of cookies with the nuts in them that causes him to die eating the cookies from 'strangers' innocence on the part of your son children tend to be very trusting and often accepting of things that interest them regardless of the source i'd say this part deals with your fears that as a child he's naive and gullible to be led into harms way the part of you asking him why addresses your fears that something bad will happen to him if he doesnt listen to you as does the scenario of him dying have you been having normal disciplinary issues with your son meaning he's simply being a child and testing the limits if so this could be why you dreamt it Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Theodicy Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) About a Boy Father's Day (Doctor Who) Infantilism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Second language acquisition The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Marshall Mathers LP God Emperor of Dune Social justice Milton H.
