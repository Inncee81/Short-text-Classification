what does it mean when you continue to have dreams about an ex i divorced my kids father almost years ago but i still have dreams about him it started out very frequent almost every other night i got to where i didn't want to go to sleep cause i knew he would be there and i would wake up thinking about him and the dream over the years the dreams have dwindled down to about once in a while but i still have them the strangest part is i have been happily married for years and have not had contact with my ex for years so why don't the dreams stop no matter how right a divorce is it's one of the saddest events of anyone's life especially as the years go buy and you realize this man you once loved knew you during the years when you were young and beautiful when the future held more possibilities and life's road was wide open dreaming of your ex in a sense is a way to dream once again about your young adulthood your heart is trying to see through the regrets and the pain again trying to find a reason why this love came to an end don't worry about it live your life in the present and your dreams will take care of the rest Knots Landing Scenes from a Memory Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass Marilyn Monroe Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Lovely Bones Futurama (TV series - season 5) Phaedo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Theodicy Haven (TNG episode) Philosophical skepticism Cliff Richard Dream Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
