being chased in a dream there was many questions about this but not as specific as i wanted it ive recently had three dreams each one was different but had the same premise todays dream i seen a guy steal a car he saw me and started chasing me with a gun it felt like i was running in water so i couldnt get away when he finally caught me i woke up and another was me and of my friends were walking in a park at night a group of people starting chasing us my two friends took off running i tried to stay with them but i tired out and the group of people caught up with me when they caught me i woke up if anyone has had these kinda dreams let me know what ya think hi daniel i always start by reminding people that nobody can interpret your dreams better than you all i can do is to offer some ideas for you to consider and to see if they make sense in the context of your life first feel at ease generally nothing in a dream is what it really seems a gun is not a gun more later on that also keep in mind that anyone you meet in a dream is symbolic of some aspect of you the guy with a gun is you your friends are you the group of people chasing you probably represents you as well so where to start look at the dream in pieces i will just discuss the first dream because the elements in the second dream are so similar the car is a symbol for you in your daily physical life the fact there is someone stealing the car suggests negativity guilt or anxiety the gun is a strong symbol for sexual energy being chased by someone with a gun suggests a your are fearful of your own sexual energy water is a symbol for your emotional state you are running through it which suggests you are ignoring or not paying attention to your emotions so what does this all mean well i dunno lol but it may be that you are starting to deal with sexual issues that are causing you some anxiety and that anxiety is sapping your energy and these other elements of your personality are trying to get your attention to get you to pay attention and be less fearful the good news is that this is just a dream the dream cannot hurt you in fact it is meant to help you understand some issue that's an odd fact since the dream is so unclear but that's the way it works odd huh good luck Psychoanalysis Out-of-body experience A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Reparative therapy Transsexuality Sigmund Freud Self-harm Homophobia Meme Autism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind LiveJournal Gender role Empathy W.I.T.C.H.
