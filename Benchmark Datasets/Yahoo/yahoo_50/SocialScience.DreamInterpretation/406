another crazy one here bout dreams i've been dreaming bout a guy i like for the past three months after i move to another town and we are like really close childhood friends we still chat online and i still visit him i don't want to ask him out cause i know it won't happen don't ask why is there any way to stop dreaming bout him don't assume it's a romantic interest but don't rule it out relationships are best based on friendship first perhaps the memory of this trusted friend is appearing in your dreams because the move was stressful or you feel a bit lonely or isolated in the new place this feeling may change as your circle of friends grows and your comfort level increases but with a good friend like this continue to stay in touch you stay married to someone a long long time long after the good looks and the passion disappear that's when you really need a friend who knows and care for the inner you you may find as you mature that this uninteresting guy is exactly the kind you should have been looking for hopefully you decide before he's off the market for good think less about romance and more about who will support your development as a good human beimg romance will follow trust me Humphrey Bogart W.I.T.C.H.
