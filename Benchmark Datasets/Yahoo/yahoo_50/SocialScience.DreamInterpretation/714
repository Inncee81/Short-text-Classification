can you help with my dream it was a weird night and the sky was really pink and red scary looking i was on a board walk thingy it went straight forever it was really skinny an went over the ocean i would keep walking trying to get to the end and i would fall drown be back at the begining and i would keep repeating that what casey said was good i'll add my thoughts i would say this deals with your fears and perhaps an issue that you are stuggling with in life that has been difficult for you to overcome and 'get through' could be anything really an issue with family work a relationship a habit et cetera but insofar as it makes you feel like you cant see the end of it you know the cliches 'walking on egg shells' and walking on a 'tight rope' these sayings are similar to the symbollic imagery of walking on the board of having to be extra careful in your dealings in this situation or with this person in the sense that you havent the freedom to say and do as you please for fear of reproach or something similar as you're walking on a board over the ocean not on a road or a bridge or a pathway of some kind this is representative of you feeling theres no room to be you and say whats on your mind or handle the situation you're way you're forced to have to handle it according to someone else's way as in for their approval and you feel as if the situation's controlling you not you controlling it you also feel alone hence the open ocean you're falling and drowing simply represents your constant struggle in this situation as is reiterated by the fact that you keep going back to the beginning to start all over i don't know what you're going through but we've all had struggles cheer up it doesnt last forever this is just my opinion take it with a grain of salt Immortality Teen Girl Squad Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dog training Scenes from a Memory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Care Bears Time Out of Mind Diving Scientology beliefs and practices Drowning Procrastination Poker jargon Rei Ayanami The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Propaganda Friends Out-of-body experience Stuttering Consensus decision-making The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Eggerland series K' 1957 World Series Homophobia Aerial (dance move) One Tree Hill (TV series) Infinity Theory of conduct Epistemology Car handling Philosophy of mind The nature of God in Western theology Straight edge Psychoanalysis Hikikomori Social rule Salt Satyagraha Mario series enemies Luck The McGuire Sisters Alexander Technique Socrates Professional wrestling holds Simone Weil Miss Saigon Dragon Booster Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Redundant array of independent disks Skinny Puppy The Time Machine Aikido Atomic Kitten Democratic Party (United States) Haibane Renmei Jiddu Krishnamurti The Shining (film) Escape from New York Subjunctive mood Obsessive-compulsive disorder Textile manufacturing Mojave people Sant Baljit Singh Nicomachean Ethics Coming of Age (TNG episode) Ages of Uru Shaggy dog story Jean Grey Goodness and value theory Ranma __ characters "Weird Al" Yankovic Jon Secada Knife Dream Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Polyamory Sant Thakar Singh Infantilism Motivation Friedrich Schleiermacher Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Super Mario Bros.
