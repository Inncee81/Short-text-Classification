my dreams nightmares i have had nightmares for nearly years now they started a while after i returned from iraq in i know everyone claims ptsd when they have nightmares and bad memories but i don't know if that is what i am suffering from is it normal to have nightmares after seeing things like that or does having the nightmares mean i suffer from ptsd its not always the same sometimes its just sounds or just hazy images and i feel scared or like i know my buddy needs help but i can't get to him and no matter how bad he is hurt or even if i know hes dead i try to get to him but cannot sometimes its specific events and i swear every night i see them its like i see them more vividly then when it actually happened like they burnt into my mind and they just wont leave i had a dream once that i was ambushed and we tried to fend off the attack and right in the middle of the fight everything disappeared and i was in my living room crouched behind the sofa one time i had a dream of a firefight just past an nassiryia in iraq everything was exactly the same until a bus got hit with a tow missile and as i watched the bus explode and burn its was like i knew everyone from my whole life i knew was in there and they were all dying and i had no way of stopping it i couldn't even move to protect them from the hit i've only had this dream once but it woke me up from a dead sleep and i didn't sleep for nearly days i need to know how to make this stop its getting worse and its getting harder to close my eyes at night because i sometimes tremble at the thought of what i might see when i fall asleep i need help what do i do and what does that dream mean i suffer from ptsd from a few horrific calls i went on i literally could not sleep for months i constantly would wake up re living these calls i went on then i would dream of myself in the person's position when i was trying to help them have you ever considered talking to someone like a counsler it might actually help you out and maybe help you stop with these dreams i really hope everything works out for you its a rough road i know beacuse i live it Post-traumatic stress disorder Sin City Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) K' The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Lucid dreaming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Phoebe Halliwell The Subtle Knife Traumatic incident reduction One Tree Hill (TV series) Dream StarCraft: Uprising Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Time Out of Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Philosophical skepticism Narcolepsy Cindy Sheehan W.I.T.C.H.
