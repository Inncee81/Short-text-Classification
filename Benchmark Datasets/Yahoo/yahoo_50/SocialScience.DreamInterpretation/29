recurring dream slightly altered i have had this dream once before probably a year ago i woluld go into detail but its a really long dream that is pretty much andaction movie but i was wondering why this time i dreampt it that i realized i had had the dream before and wheile the things were going i i knew how last time i had done something wrong so this time i changed it slightly how come this nd time i could change it and what does that meazn when you realize you are dreaming it's called lucid dreaming it is an often sought after state because it allows you to alter and direct the contents of your dream thisoften involves flying which can be wonderful the recurring dream is a sign you need to work on something the fact that the awareness of dreaming kicked in shows that you have learned your lesson and have taken control of your life congrats some spiritual people see lucid dreaming as a precursor to enlightenment because it underscores the fact that we ultimately create and control our own world Lucid dreaming Dream Scenes from a Memory Carlos Castaneda Carl Jung Consciousness Meaning of life Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Lisp programming language A Course In Miracles Milton H.
