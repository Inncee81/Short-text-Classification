pumping instead of actual breastfeeding i am not pregnant but my husband and i are beginning our efforts to try to get pregnant i figured i could also use this time for a little research i know that i will want to breastfeed at least in the beginning but i also know that sometimes it isn't as easy as it looks if i have a child and s he has trouble latching on do i just pump instead and bottle feed him her with the bottled breast milk for those of you who breast fed did you also supplement with formula thanks oh honey there's nothing wrong with pumping in fact i had the biggest trouble getting my daughter to latch on i ended up renting a medela pump and eventually buying one it was a life saver my daughter and i finally learned the appropriate way to latch but i still ended up pumping between feedings i had enough milk supply that i didn't need to supplement with formula i'm now on baby and he's weeks old i'm doing it again a pump is a great investment they can be a little pricey but so is formula your baby will be alot healthier thus saving on medical bills good luck Breastfeeding Infant Breast pump Infant formula Fertility awareness Milk Breast milk International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Pregnancy Baby bottle Breast Nestl__ Nipple piercing Dairy Nestl__ boycott Days of our Lives Premature birth Sea-Monkey Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Great Teacher Onizuka Industrial Revolution Veganism Abortion Protein-energy malnutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Childbirth Insulin Oily fish Patent medicine Phoebe Halliwell Folic acid Mastitis Prolactinoma One Life to Live Vitamin D Baby Blues Drawn Together Dairy farming Gross domestic product Heinkel He 100 Guinea pig Infantilism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours Married... with Children Prolactin Nipple Organic farming Inflation Brassiere FairTax Abortion in the United States Friends Yoko Ono Futurama (TV series - season 5) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lucille Ball The Price Is Right Metroid (video game species) Siphon Hydroponics Red Hot Chili Peppers Docosahexaenoic acid Boston Public Indianapolis 500 Medical analysis of circumcision Fiddler on the Roof Paintball John Edwards Puberty 24 Hours of Le Mans Cancer Cytomegalovirus Sesame Street Dynamic random access memory John Berryman Kodocha Conker's Bad Fur Day Marilyn Monroe Honeybee Billboard Hot 100 Another World (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Stuttering Abortion debate Situation comedy Platypus Pitaten Procrastination Jaundice Sam Walton Father Ted Public Eye Pulp Fiction Vitamin C Charmed Sly Cooper
