cosleeping mothers what age was your child moved to his own bed how hard was the transition for both of u i have a month old every now and then i'll put him into our bed just for me to get some sleep i don't believe in cry it out method so when he's restless at night i lay him next to me and comfort untill we both fall asleep he's not a great sleeper so sometimes he sleeps better in my arms others still wakes up every hours for the sake of both of us getting rest i'd like to let him sleep with me in his room maybe nights a week will he get used to this and if he does will it be hard to change this habbit any experiecne with this i co slept with my son until he was about weeks old i wanted to transition him into his crib before he started to recognize me i've heard from many people that it's been hard to transition a child to his or her own bed after being so used to sleeping with mommy and daddy and i didn't want that to happen to me it was hard the first days because he would cry in the middle of the night times but as soon as i heard him cry i ran into his room and rocked him back to sleep i wanted him to feel secure sleeping in his own bed and now he knows that i'll come if he needs me he's almost months old now and sleeps from pm am in his room and he plays by himself in the crib he very happy in there i think the days with you and days by himself might confuse him and lead to even more irregular sleeping patterns if you plan on transtitioning him into his crib do it all the way not partially also put baby in the crib during nap time start building a routine it'll be a slow process but you'll be happier in the long run when you don't have a year old who refuses to get out of your bed take care Sleep Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Knots Landing Mattress Daylight saving time Insomnia Co-sleeping Tupac Shakur Siesta The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
