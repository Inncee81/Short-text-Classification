how can i get use to this adopted baby i have a cousin who gave birth to a baby at the age of with her being so young we decided to raise this baby as if it was mine now this baby is very fussy it cries alot i wouldn't say he's spoiled because i don't hold him all day i'm just nervous that the baby will not get use to me and i feel like i'm not bonding with the baby he cries all the time i know he shoulld cry but for how long i need someone to explain to me how to raise a child when he's not yours i had him since birth but i still feel like i don't know him and now i'm getting scared if i made the right decision my sister had our son for us her and my hubby's blood and i bonded with him right away i don't know why you haven't bonded yet i notice that you call him this baby and the baby but not my son you need to first think of him as yours he will look to you to be his everything for the next few years and you cannot do that if you don't feel he is your son maybe you should talk to friends and family or join an adoption support group good luck though children are a gift no matter where they came from Baby Blues Jon Secada Kodocha Friends Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Breastfeeding Sami Brady The Care Bears (television series) Pitaten Infant Adoption Charmed Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Frankie Laine Theory of conduct Lauren Bacall Abortion debate Time Out of Mind Phoebe Buffay's songs Blonde on Blonde Childbirth Family Kyle Broflovski The Miracles Tom Jones (singer) Dinah Marler Sheryl Crow The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Love and Theft My Life as a Teenage Robot The Beatles discography Marie Antoinette Romulus and Remus Scrooge McDuck Humphrey Bogart Days of our Lives Cliff Richard Princess Marie-Th__r__se-Charlotte Alois Hitler The Marvelettes Sydney Riot of 1879 Neighbours Kender About a Boy The Critic Guiding Light Ja Rule The Emancipation of Mimi Rais massacre Taliesin Polyamory The McGuire Sisters Gift economy Saki The Beach Boys AFI 100 Years series History of As the World Turns (1990-1999) One Life to Live Cindy Sheehan Leo Wyatt Year of the Spider Night (book) Transsexuality Mama's Family Characters in the Smurfs Infantilism Brandy (entertainer) Sugo Theodicy Miss Saigon YuYu Hakusho Melanie Wilkes Genghis Khan Generation Y Pregnancy Chinese New Year Jerry Lewis Coming of Age (TNG episode) Tupac Shakur Virgin Mary in Islam Dursley family Emotions (album) Eugenics Ayyavazhi mythology Social rule Past characters (Neighbours) Full House Supergirl Grumpy's Three Wishes William the Silent W.I.T.C.H.
