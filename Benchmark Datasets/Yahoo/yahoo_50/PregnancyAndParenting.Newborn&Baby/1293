week old and sleeping my week old was a good sleeper until now she seems to get overtired by not napping as much as she used to she also is starting to give me a hard time putting her down i know sleep patterns change so can anyone let me know how their babies are sleeping around this age thanks she could be going through a growth spurt and needing to eat more often or something find a good routine and stick to it there's not much you can do during the day to force naps but sticking to a nightly schedule will have huge pay offs in the long run don't only lay her down asleep at night or she'll want this forever and it will make it difficult or impossible for her to settle back to sleep during the night when she wakes everyone goes in and out of sleep during the night and normally we don't notice but babies that are only rocked to sleep have a really difficult time learning to put themselves back to sleep when they are older right now she probably still needs to eat during the night ask your pediatrician it is really tough on the parents just do the best you can what worked for me was giving a bath putting on bedtime lotion fresh pajamas then breastfeeding sometimes i played some light music in the background too jack johnson is a baby whisperer at our house good luck to you Sleep Narcolepsy Breastfeeding Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Siesta Urinary incontinence Characters in the Smurfs Insomnia Delayed sleep phase syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Daylight saving time Cliff Richard Childbirth Campfire Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April The Amber Spyglass The Beatles discography Jon Secada New York Giants Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sleeping Murder Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Cat Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Blitzball Hansel und Gretel The Catcher in the Rye Co-sleeping Lisa's First Word W.I.T.C.H.
