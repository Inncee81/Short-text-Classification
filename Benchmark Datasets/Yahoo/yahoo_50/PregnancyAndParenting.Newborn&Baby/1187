just curious ok now i know you aren't suppose to have sex until after the week check up but i didn't have any stitches and was also done bleeding about a week after i had my son sorry if that's to much info my husband and i had sex with out a condom i know not the best idea i am also nursing and well i was told by the health nurse that for at least months while exclusively breastfeeding that it could be used instead of a condom or birth control i personally don't like that idea and wouldn't use it on a regular basis but i guess what i am asking is why do you hear about some people being pregnant at their week check up and they are nursing but then you hear it can be used kinda as a form of birth control as i really wouldn't want to be pregnant so soon after having my son thanks for you answers in advance everyone's telling you to use birth control but the two kinds of birth control pill are actually bad for breastfeeding moms though the companies who make them tell you otherwise they tend to deplete your milk supply i know it happened to me and the lactation consultant informed me that according to an independent study done by a curious doctor the majority of women saw a severe decrease in their milk supply when taking the mini pill so i breastfed both of my kids and planned my second pregnancy and now my third pregnancy around breastfeeding yes some women still get pregnant while breastfeeding so it's not a sure fire birth control method however combined with condoms your chances are that much lower breastfeeding does suppress ovulation when you are exclusively not pumping as the pump does not do nearly as an effective job as a baby suckling breastfeeding all day and all night at least times during the night as stated before some women are different your nurse mentioned months because that's when solids are typically introduced and baby doesn't exclusively nurse which may start ovulation up it is also said that even though you have a period while breastfeeding you still may not ovulate everyone is different i believe i am just now starting to ovulate as my periods are coming closer together due to my son cutting back to nursings a day this is after months and i am still not pregnant it's said the pull out method isn't effective but we stopped using condoms while ago after we went into the if it happens it happens stage i also make sure to urinate after every sexcapade to flush any thing that could have gotten up there this also helps keep away uti's basically if you don't want to get pregnant take precautions Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Birth control Oral contraceptive Childbirth Emergency contraception Folic acid Urinary incontinence Condom EastEnders Herpes simplex virus Abortion debate Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Safe sex Haloperidol Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prolactin Sexual abstinence AIDS Humphrey Bogart Premature birth Friends Guinea pig Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Oral sex Infant Doxepin Medical analysis of circumcision Kodocha Prolactinoma Tocopherol Sex education Cytomegalovirus Elephant Gonorrhoea Miscarriage Maprotiline Polycystic ovary syndrome History of sex HIV Stomach cancer Nipple Paroxetine Theory of conduct Hiberno-English Puberty Infant formula Shaggy dog story Nipple piercing Acne Little Britain Boston Public Depo Provera Twin Progesterone Niddah Prenatal diagnosis The Inside Survivor (novel) Pregnancy test Heracles Sharon Tate CPU cache Dairy Horus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Kender Melanie Wilkes Milton H.
