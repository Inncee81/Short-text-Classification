autism what causes it what can i do to prevent it i'm afraid to take my daughter month old for her shots i'm as crunchy granola and counter cultural as they come and i'll tell you the link between shots and autism is a myth it started when mercury was used in the creation of vaccines but mercury is not used anymore there has been a rise in autism but whether it's an actual rise or just better diagnosing is uncertain there are so many pollutants and chemicals our children are exposed to everyday through the food drink clothes furnishings toys etc etc that i think it's just wishful thinking on the part of some that the increase in autism cancer etc can be pinned on any one thing such as vaccines do some research into the diseases these vaccines prevent see what a baby sick with these goes through and dies from and you can see that the development of these was a miracle every day you take a risk when you leave the house with your baby but you do go out the risk is higher getting in the car than getting a shot the hysteria over shots in some people is i think an attempt to pretend they can control that which cannot be totally controlled no matter what your baby's safety health and happiness you can do your very very absolute most obsessive best and i think that's a good thing but you have to admit that some circumstances will be up to luck chance genetics environmental pollution whatever welcome to motherhood honey constant worry that there's some something you should be doing that you're not we're all in the same boat just try to relax and enjoy your little darling anyway o Autism Thimerosal Controversies in autism Vaccine Cancer MMR vaccine Mark Geier Autism rights movement Breastfeeding Epidemiology Asperger syndrome AIDS Precautionary principle Thomas Verstraeten Malaria Coeliac disease Pesticide Measles Refrigerator mother Andrew Wakefield Left-handed EastEnders Autistic enterocolitis Autistic community Pneumonia Asthma Multiple sclerosis Dioxin Richard Deth Smallpox Abortion debate Nutrition Kodocha Genetically modified food DDT Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Microeconomics 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Mercury (element) Prostate cancer Poliomyelitis Safe Minds Health insurance Birth control Ultraviolet Bernard Rimland Biological warfare Tobacco smoking Dave Weldon Bioterrorism Public health Common cold Herpes simplex virus Asbestos Growth hormone treatment Colorectal cancer Minamata disease Anti-psychiatry Childbirth Allergy Externality Vampire Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coffee Pollution HIV vaccine Polyvinyl chloride Cytomegalovirus Anorexia nervosa People's Republic of China Tocopherol Mobile phone radiation and health Medical analysis of circumcision Cryptorchidism H5N1 Vacuum Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Infantilism Mumps Ferret Breast cancer Alzheimer's disease Pet skunk Ionizing radiation Barbara Boxer Light pollution Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Public policy Autistic spectrum National Institutes of Health Sickle-cell disease
