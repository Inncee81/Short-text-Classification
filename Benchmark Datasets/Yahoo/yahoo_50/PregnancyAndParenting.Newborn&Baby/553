ignorant to the facts why are people still ignorant to the benefits of breastfeeding and if not so then why do many people choose second best it seems that formula is the normal these days but shouldn't it be the other way around i am here to bash no one besides it is ok to feel guilty about a poor decision we do all the time whether it has to do with breastfeeding or not so get over it and just do your best there are lots of ways to excel in motherhood and i don't care about stories where a mother had to use formula this is not about that it is about people who chose to substitute themselves just because they felt like it i am asking questions to find answers to things i do not understand no judging here honestly everybody i know uses formula and i don't think less of them but i do see their children have serious health problems often and i just think that it would be beneficial to all if our children were healthier and as we all know breast milk is just perfect for babies that's all when you look at how long it was considered unacceptable or at least unusual to breastfeed it's really no wonder that so many women still chooose to use formula even though society is much more accepting of breastfeeding if you never saw any woman breastfeeding their baby but only bottles you might grow up thinking that's the way it's suppose to be it's great that you see advertising to promote breastfeeding as opposed to all the ads for formula and bottles and whatever else you need if you're going that route but that is all fairly recently mostly it is ignorance i think because if a woman truly knows the difference between giving their baby breastmilk vs formula it would be a hard sell for a mother to choose formula a lot of woman make a choice before they have kids before birth or just days into it that breastfeeding isnt for them because they think it's 'weird' to put their baby's mouth to their breast because they're worried about their sex lif or changes to their body because they're working or otherwise afraid of the time commitment because they've been told that formula is just as good or only slightly less than breastmilk and all their baby needs when you look at who does breastfeed their children it's typically more educated women that's why there have been older studies showing that breastmilk boosts iq levels when comparing formula fed babies to breastfed ones they found children who had been breastfed had higher iq levels recent studies are showing that isnt a direct result from the breastmilk though it's genetics environment i breastfed my daughter for mths but i didnt find it easy between poor dr advice relating to breastfeeding family finding it 'strange' to breastfeed family that originally supported my decision constantly questioning when i was going to stop once she passed mths it was all pretty draining the best decision but if only society made it easier to make the right choice Fertility awareness Abortion debate Theory of conduct Childbirth Sexual orientation Milk Breast milk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infant formula Prostate cancer Nestl__ boycott Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Social rule Infant Transsexuality Jaundice Divorce Medical analysis of circumcision Cancer Veganism Anorexia nervosa Microeconomics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Apprentice 2 Abortion in the United States Stuttering Intelligence quotient Economic inequality Biology and sexual orientation Socrates Unemployment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Vitamin D Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Adoption Haloperidol Economics Autism EastEnders Stomach cancer Capitalism Sant Thakar Singh Puberty About a Boy Asperger syndrome Voter turnout Arguments for and against drug prohibition Brassiere Same-sex marriage Transactional analysis Current teachings of Prem Rawat Prenatal diagnosis Organic farming Urinary incontinence Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Left-handed Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Breast cancer Ethics Sex education Joke Pregnancy Mental retardation Democracy Cytomegalovirus Justification (theology) Baby bottle Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shaggy dog story Free will Inflation Protein-energy malnutrition Altruism Tocopherol Kylie Minogue Alexander Technique Health insurance Hearing impairment Simone Weil AIDS Polyamory Redundant array of independent disks ELO rating system Yoko Ono 613 mitzvot Politics of Canada Singlish
