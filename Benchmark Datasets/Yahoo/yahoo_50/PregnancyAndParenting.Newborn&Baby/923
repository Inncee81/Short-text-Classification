month old and sleep questions my th month old continues to wake every night i have tried everything from the ferber method to cold turkey and while i do not expect him to sleep through the night i need to some how find a way to break his waking every hour he has a mobile that i have used to distract him i have put him down awake and asleep if i respond quickly to his crying he'll grab my hand and go right back to sleep if i don't respond right away he wakes up and is harder to get back to sleep when i do go in he is sitting up and then wants to play and the only way he'll go back down is if i stand there bent over the crib with my hand on his stomach and since he is awake it takes a long time to get him to go back to sleep sometimes this goes on for hours in the middle of the night i have tried putting something that smells like me in crib he has a blanky he cuddles with but apparently nothing is as good as me i about to return to work and i can't be losing this much sleep every night any ideas he started solids at months and we are up to three solid feedings a day he is well fed and happy we have a bedtime routine and i have pushed him through a nap thinking that might help too i appreciate the advice everyone has given i guess i just need to know that other people have gone through this too and so far all the advice people have offered i have done so it makes me feel like i am doing all right i will check out the link to the book thank you first off the book no cry sleep solution helped us a ton http www pantley com elizabeth books php check it out a few more things that helped us moving bedtime up to pm it was much later a consistant bedtime routine starting at pm no tv or radio on during this time everything is kept quiet and non stimulating as we do bath pjs stories and finish with rocking in the rocking chair and lullibyes a lovey like your blanket i have him hold it when i'm nursing it and sometimes i'll wear it in my shirt so it smells like me i do a dream feed before i go to bed at pm i go in and nurse baby while he's half asleep to tank him up for a few more hours making sure he is napping enough during the day sleep begets sleep it took us awhile to figure that one out it sounds like you might be a good candiate for cosleeping if that is something you are open to it sounds like you would both get much more sleep that way and it would be a nice way to reconnect since you are going to be at work during the day we coslept for the first months and loved it it stopped working for us once ds got really moblie and we are both light sleepers transitioning him out was no big deal so don't be afraid that baby will be in bed with you forever he won't you could put baby to bed in his crib and once he wakes move him to your bed for the rest of the night good luck hope you get some sleep mama Sleep Insomnia Mattress Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Milton H.
