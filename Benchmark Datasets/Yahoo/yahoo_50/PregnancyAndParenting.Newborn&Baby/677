does supply and demand for breastfeeding work on both breasts together or independently of each other can i theoretically feed from one boob only and the other will respond accordingly my daughter really doesn't like my left breast she will feed from it but is really fussy and the let down is incredibly slower on that side and she rarely 'empties' it where as she feeds fantastcally from the other side i have tried all sorts of things to even this out chances are if you mention it here i've done it but it doesn't seem to be a problem just to let her nurse primarily from the one side now i'm not getting engorged on the other side at all but it just led me to wonder might there actually be a problem with one side i know breastpreference is common or is it quite normal for one side to produce less in response to lower demand and the other carry on as normal thanks the side she doesn't like is the one where she lays on her right side to feed the side she always turns onto to sleep so i don't understand that one i always tend to start on the fussy side and then switch but i'm not that lop sided so i'm not worried about that i can't pump nothing comes out i can hand express but it's really slow and i don't really have the time thanks for the information so far sounds like it's not a problem and doesn't seem to be for my daughter if i just let her do her own thing so i think i'll continue to do that supply and demand is independent if you stop using the one breast eventually it'll stop producing milk or it will produce a very small amount if she 's happy with the one breast i wouldn't be too concerned but it would be good to try and keep both breasts producing milk when your baby goes through a growth spurt she may need the other breast too give pumping another try at first most women can't let down to a pump but eventually it starts to work also pumping will help if the reason your baby fusses is slow milk flow you could also have her doc examine her to make sure nothing is bothering her when she lies on that side it could be something you can't see you can of course get by on only one breast if she keeps stimulating it but if you can help it maybe you shouldn't let the other one dry up it's nice to have the option of using it if you need it good luck with everything Urinary incontinence Puberty Breast pump Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Dairy Singlish Theory of conduct Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Inflation Hypoglycemia Infant Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Action potential Breast milk Brassiere Prolactinoma Carburetor Floppy disk Supply and demand Fertility awareness Carbon dioxide Thermal power station Microeconomics Electrophysiology Abortion Chicken Insomnia Humphrey Bogart Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Baby bottle Supply-side economics Knots Landing Renewable energy Quicksort Cancer Human height Dialysis Nestl__ Law of value Transformer Mastitis Nestl__ boycott Nipple Blood pressure Goodness and value theory Shaggy dog story Myocardial infarction Carnivorous plant Kodocha Labor theory of value Ethics Hydrogen economy FoxTrot Philosophy of language Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Prolactin Eldfell Neopets Coffee Unemployment Extreme Programming Lac operon Economics Hiberno-English RISC Indianapolis 500 Surplus value The nature of God in Western theology Human penis size Recurring South Park characters Piccolo Junior Saga Jet engine Gas metal arc welding Shit Samuel Goldwyn Wind turbine Infantilism Overpopulation Jam (TV series) Wood Backstroke Breast cancer Sharon Tate Nipple piercing Premature birth
