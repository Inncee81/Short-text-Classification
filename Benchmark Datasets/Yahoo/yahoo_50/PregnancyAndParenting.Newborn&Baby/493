how do you go about breastfeeding and doing formula together i am weeks pregnant i want to breastfeed my baby but not soley breastfeed i will be going back to work full time weeks after the baby is born i have inverted nipples and am worried i might have a hard time my mom was unable to breastfeed for that reason so my question is do i tell them at the hospital that i am going to nurse and they don't give the baby any formula at all or do i let them give the baby formula and then try to breastfeed i am just trying to figure this out this is my first baby and yes i will be taking a breastfeeding class but i have to wait until i am at least months to get into it thank you and please do not try to talk me into breastfeeding only that is not my i would try to exclusively breastfeed in the hospital if you can you want the baby to establish good nursing before you introduce the bottle the bottle is much easier for them and if there are any challenges with nursing it may be hard to go back to it however if the baby has blood sugar problems is losing too much weight or just seems to be starving it is ok to give them formula if that is what they need i would tell the nurses that it is your plan to breastfeed and they will support you with that but they will also be able to suggest if and when they think formula may be necessary if nursing goes great in the hospital i would try to wait about weeks before introducing a bottle but then definitely do it at least once per day so the baby doesn't refuse it when you have to leave them at weeks good luck and know that your baby will be just fine no matter how they get their nutrition Infant Fertility awareness Nipple piercing Infant formula Brassiere Folic acid Nestl__ boycott Milk Breast Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nestl__ Premature birth Social rule Stomach cancer Nipple Kodocha International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Oily fish Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Baby bottle Pitaten Urinary incontinence Nursing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Guinea pig Piccolo Junior Saga Melanie Wilkes Obstetrics Tocopherol Protein-energy malnutrition Mountain Dew Ben Johnson (athlete) Alcoholic beverage Professional wrestling holds The Contender (television series) IP (complexity) Terri Schiavo Knots Landing Ron and Fez Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Humphrey Bogart Dialysis Macbeth Certified Nursing Assistant Phoebe Halliwell Abortion in the United States Rod Stewart Alcoholism Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Great Teacher Onizuka Prolactin John Sheridan (Babylon 5) New Coke Jaundice Atkins Nutritional Approach Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Jon Secada Coeliac disease Soft drink Sharon Tate Marilyn Monroe The Family from One End Street Sami Brady Abortion debate Pet skunk Baby Blues History of corsets Infantilism Nurse Single certification The Amazing Race On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Bringing It All Back Home Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jennifer Lopez Neighbours Chris Amon Breast milk Days of our Lives Haloperidol Equine conformation The Super Milk-chan Show Royal Assent Clinical depression Prolactinoma Diseases of the honeybee Mastitis Pacifier Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Logic Health insurance GED Elephant Charmed
