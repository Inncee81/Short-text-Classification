worry mother about a mnth old screamer i'm not embarrassed or anything i just asked this question earlier today and i made a mistake and meant to say she screams only indoors and stays quite outdoors i know she does it for fun and i was just wondering if its a fase or do i stop her or do i have to worry that she might have ear problems or something along those lines i don't mind her screaming unless i have a headache i just wanna make sure shes okay babies around her age love to hear their voices and in a house or apartment their voices come back at them and they get a reak kick out of it i don't think you have anything to worry about but if it would make you feel better then you could talk to her doctor and she what he she has to say about it Social rule Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Pitaten Spice Girls Jam (TV series) Milton H.
