why is my month old son so fussy hello all i have a month old son in the last couple of weeks he has been getting very very fussy for no apparent reasons i work all day long and my wife stays home with him i go home early twice a week to be with him while she goes to work and the attitude he generates is the same with either one of us example all three of us would be in the living room and him on the floor playing with my keys he plays alone at times which is nice but as soon as mom walks out of the room to get something he freaks out when i walk out he doesn't freak out now i know he doesn't hate me or anything like that but it's kind of weird seeing him freak out almost anytime we don't pay of our attention to him if we pick him up and walk he calms down but as soon as we sit down with him in our arms he starts to yell and cry we are soo stressed out by this it's making us fight a lot me and my wife because we disagree on how to calm him down anybody have any answers thanks sounds like he might have a little bit of separation anxiety being months old it's hard to reassure him that mommy will be back but try your best i would check out some parenting websites for more advice Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Babe Ruth The Inside Reservoir Dogs Mad Money Highway 61 Revisited RuneScape quests Kender Ron and Fez Avenue Q Kurt Cobain She Loves You Garfield Time Out of Mind Columbine High School massacre EastEnders Eddie Guerrero Urinary incontinence Social rule Liam Gallagher Kim Possible Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Out-of-body experience Aerial (dance move) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Miss Saigon Recurring South Park characters The Apprentice 2 Milton H.
