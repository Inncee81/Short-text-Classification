breastfeeding supply before i start i want only serious answers and please no bashing judging or debates please i am still breastfeeding my month old son neither of us are ready to wean be weaned from breastfeeding i am leaving with my husband to go on a hour drive and will be gone for days nights and our son is staying here i have tried pumping to create enough milk supply for when i am gone i don't know how much i should have here for him i also can not get anymore supply as i'm only getting one ounce from pumping for minutes but my son is getting enough to eat when he nurses my other question is will i still have my milk supply when i return from our vaca without nursing him for that long thanks for your advice answers in advance thanks so far for the great advice our son does get other foods he eats one stage two or three jar of fruit and baby oatmeal for breaskfast one stage two or three jar of a vegetable and baby oatmeal for lunch and one stage two or three jar of baby dinner with baby oatmeal for dinner after he eats his dinner he tries what we have for dinner so he is eating a small amount of real people food and he drinks some water from a cup or water juice from a sippy cup with his meals i still nurse him times a day or about there another question should i have the breastmilk formula in a bottle or his sippy cup or regular cup he doesn't use a bottle now but i don't know what i should be doing thanks again for all the advice so far a one oz output is completely average so you have plenty of milk you will need about oz of breastmilk per day depending on how much other foods your toddler eats but i would aim for if you don't tend to have supply problems you should be fine after that amount of time but you are going to have to pump not just to keep your supply up but to prevent engorgement and possibly more serious issues like mastitis Breakfast Milk Fecal incontinence Coffee Baby bottle Tooth Meal Alcoholic beverage Dairy Cuisine of the Philippines Soft drink Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Mastitis Fasting Nestl__ Infant formula Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breast milk Nutrition Childbirth Hypoglycemia Rice pudding Breast Kitchen Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hamster Cha chaan teng Swedish cuisine Elephant Tea (meal) Porridge Little Britain Jewish cuisine Infant Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breast pump Dieting Korean cuisine Tea Guinea pig Vitamin D Veganism Vegetarianism Escherichia coli O157:H7 Siphon Soy milk Nipple piercing International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes International response to Hurricane Katrina Energy development Indianapolis 500 613 mitzvot Social rule Cuisine of Brazil Foodborne illness Nestl__ boycott Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Passover Seder Domestic goat Breakfast cereal Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Atkins Nutritional Approach Beer Thermal power station Cat Healthy eating Insulin Drink Passover Happy Meal Brewery Persian cuisine Expert system Food preservation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Ron and Fez The Amazing Race Ice cream Diarrhea Caffeine Comanche Carburetor Dialysis Fiddler on the Roof Kashrut
