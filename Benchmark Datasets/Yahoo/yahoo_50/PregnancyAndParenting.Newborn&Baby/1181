why is my almost month old baby is getting up times a night she does have one tooth and we haven't been able to feel any others working through but she used to sleep all night or just wake up once or twice now she is up times a night and is ready to play or really mad we have cut back on her naps and nap lengths tried the bottle of water only not talked to her no lights not pick her up all the suggestions that have been suggested and still she gets up she used to sleep so well and now i'm lucky if i get hours of solid sleep she did not get up this much when i was breastfeeding help i am starting to really feel the effects of lack of sleep oh and my husband works nights so he can't help me out she will not sleep next to us we have tried to co sleep like we did when she was very young and all she wants to do is play because i work days and my husband works nights swings i can't let her stay up when she gets up at night i have to get her back to sleep so i can get back to sleep she had jaundice when she was born and because of that she has always been a breast fed and formula fed baby i tried only breastmilk but she wasn't getting enough before we left the hospital and they were going to keep her so i asked for help with forumla then she got spoiled to the ease from the nipple on her bottle and wouldn't nurse for more than minutes total and she hates orajel i do give her a warm bottle her blanket and her toy when i tuck her in and tell her it is night night time i'm so at my limit but i know that it will pass i would just like to know when its a faze that i think most kids go threw my daughter did when she was that age but it usely was her teething try getting up a litle with her and watch to see if she bitting her hand or a toy really bad if so give her a little tynenol will not harm the baby if this seems to work then you found the problem next if shes not teething try getting her into a routine maybe she thinks she having a nap every single night do the same thing over and over feeed her bathe her read her a story optional because it makes my daughter hyper play soft music and give her a bottle preffered water not to rott her teeth try doing this like i said its a faze something is making her get up Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Childbirth Kodocha Jaundice Fertility awareness Baby bottle Infant Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Sleep The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Aerial (dance move) Narcolepsy Textile manufacturing Social rule Satchel Paige Dog The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milk Sleeping Murder Drill bit Humphrey Bogart Baby Blues Characters in the Smurfs Macbeth The Lovely Bones Siesta About a Boy Days of our Lives Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Tooth Friends The Contender (television series) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Henri Murger Urinary incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Sudden infant death syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Ty Cobb Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Care Bears Jon Secada The Subtle Knife Hamster Mojave people Phoebe Buffay's songs Salad Fingers Capercaillie Buddy Guy Battle of the Bulge Polyphasic sleep Prostate cancer Kurt Cobain The Big Sleep Doraemon Deftones 2000 Australian Grand Prix Little Britain Sharon Tate 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Nudity Singlish Apollo 8 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Bottlenose Dolphin Yoko Ono Vampire 50 First Dates Theory of conduct Premature birth Hera One Tree Hill (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye Phoebe Halliwell Breast milk Great Teacher Onizuka Shark Rais massacre Infant formula Pitaten
