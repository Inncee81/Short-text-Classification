general q's about teething baby my son is months and he may be teething he's got a slight redness on the cheecks doesnt sleep well at night sometimes fusses for no apparent reason drools exessively and bites down hard on anything he can get his hands on so does teething pain come and go or is it constant how long untill a tooth actually breaks through the skin are hylands tables effective since i'm really not sure i'm not giving him tylenol or even orajel ijust give him a damp washcloth to chew on or a teething ring or rub his gums with my finger but he's miserable so how do the hylands tablets work and how effective teeting pain does come and go the time it takes for a tooth to break through depends on your baby and what tooth he's getting some only take a week or two while others seem like they're never going to break through i never used hyland's tablets but i did use a similar brand that you buy at walgreen's i think the tablets help calm the baby and offer some pain relief please don't be worried about offering your baby some medication for pain relief i would recommend using baby motrin instead of tylenol though the motrin is specifically designed to help deal with the inflammation and the relief comes a little faster and lasts a little longer since some babies can get an upset stomach from motrin give your son small snack with the motrin if he isn't eating any solid foods just give him the motrin right before or right after he has a bottle breastfeeds my son started to teeth when he was ten weeks old good luck Breastfeeding Tooth Cocaine Paracetamol Childbirth Dog training Carpal tunnel syndrome Adjustable gastric band Tooth enamel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Dental caries Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Domestic rabbit Knife Kodocha Knots Landing Migraine Social rule Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Customs and etiquette of Japan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Fertility awareness Sulfasalazine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Gout Medical prescription Swimming Alcoholic beverage Acne Blackjack Guinea pig Chewing gum Tylenol 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Needle aspiration biopsy Drawn Together Pregnancy Tobacco Oxycodone Babe Ruth Dental brace Massage Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Textile manufacturing Sandy Koufax Group A streptococcal infection The Fairly OddParents Insomnia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hash table Masturbation Motorcycle Cannabis (drug) Happy Tree Friends Characters of Naruto Menstrual cup Glen Jacobs Oral sex Ben Johnson (athlete) Fecal incontinence Dog Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mind Over Murder Medical analysis of circumcision Mojave people Cancer Halitosis Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Aloe Squirrel Philmont Scout Ranch Stuttering Comanche Tocopherol Coeliac disease Animal testing Methamphetamine Cuisine of Denmark Hypnosis Insulin One Piece minor characters Withdrawal
