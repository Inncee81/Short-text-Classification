weaning my son i breast feed my month old and plan to keep it up until he's a year he does great with stage two baby food although we dont hold to a strict schedule of when and how much i got to thinking about it and realized that if i want to be done around his birthday i should start setting up a plan what are some things i should implement now to make weaning a transition and not a battle of wills my biggest one is bed time and at night its sooo easy to just pop him on a boob and put him to sleep or back to sleep obviously i dont want that to be the only way he sleeps how did other breast feeding moms do it without too much of a battle you may wish to begin by taking away certain predictable nursings sessions and replacing them with some more solids the thing is is that he is too young to start on whole milk just yet and you'd likely have to supplement with some artificial milk your doctor knows you best and could make some reccomendations i can truly understand the nighttime feeds those are usually the last to go especially because they hold the most convenience for us giving yourself mo is very generous just take things slowly and anticipate some bumps along the way if your baby isn't ready then this may be more difficult that you anticipate child led weaning is a widely growing popularity and perhaps something you may wish to look into you may be suprised once your child hits mo that him and you may not be ready to let go of your special time some sites that have many gentle weaning suggestions http www lalecheleague org nb nbweaning html http www picosearch com cgi bin ts pl Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Cross site scripting HyperText Transfer Protocol Puberty Shaggy dog story Breast Milk Humphrey Bogart World Wide Web Kitten Internet Infant Common Unix Printing System Apollo 8 New York Giants Koala Dairy Pok__mon Live!
