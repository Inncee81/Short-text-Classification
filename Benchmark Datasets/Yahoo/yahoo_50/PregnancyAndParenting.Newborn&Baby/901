i'm half joking half serious any moms found themselves in a situation where they can't remember if they brushed their teeth on a particular day the days go by so fast how about this i just had a c section weeks ago and they prescribed percocet to help with the pain i could take every hours but i'd forget when i took the last one or even if i'd had any painkillers that day my mom asked me the other week if i was still taking the painkillers my response nope well maybe gosh i can't remember lol i quit taking them after the first week but only in the last day or so have i really felt like me again stupid drugs i make sure to brush my teeth and squeeze in a shower before hubby leaves for work in the morning that way i'm guaranteed to be clean for the day Social rule Tooth Breastfeeding Analgesic Blonde on Blonde Jewish bereavement Ben Johnson (athlete) Methamphetamine Medical prescription Rush Limbaugh Cindy Sheehan Oxycodone Migraine The Family from One End Street Kodocha Little Britain The Marshall Mathers LP Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Shaggy dog story Antidepressant Mnemonic Fecal incontinence Milton H.
