should i worry about giving out more invitations i was just wanting an opinion see i have already given out some baby shower invitations for a close friend that i am planning a surprise baby shower for because she already has had her baby he is one month and a half old she barely has things for her baby so that is why i'm wanting to plan it for her but my question is should i worry about buying more invitations to give to a couple of other people that i want to invite since it is only five days away or should i just call them and tell them about the baby shower and that way i could save some gas and money what do you think i wouldnt buy anymore invites they wouldnt get them til like a day or two before the event just give them a call and see if they want to attend Childbirth Social rule Avenue Q Knots Landing Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Fancy Crane The Family from One End Street Ayyavazhi mythology EastEnders Moe Berg Breastfeeding Katelyn Faber Big Brother UK series 6 The Holocaust John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Ocean's Twelve Phoebe Buffay's songs Thanksgiving Smallville (Season 4) Paradox Gettysburg Address Sharon Tate The Lovely Bones Shaggy dog story Infantilism Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban K' Tiger Woods Kath & Kim Charmed Yin Shun George Costanza Orde Charles Wingate Surveillance Bob Dylan (album) Philip J.
