can i use neocate and soy based formulas my baby is months old and is fine with breastmilk and regular milk based formulas any kind my aunt works in a hospital and gave me a lot of soy and neocate formulas before i had my baby so i'm pretty stocked up and i don't want to waste the formula i already have i'm breastfeeding regularly when i can i work so he gets a little formula here and there is it okay to use the soy and neocate or are those formulas strictly for babies with allergies he maybe fine with the soy formula or not some babies are allergic or don't do well on soy neocate is an extremely expensive formula for highly allergic babies or extreme feeding problems of my kids were on neocate at some point very unlikely that it would do any harm on its own to your baby what is not ok however is for you to change formula like you change ice cream flavors babies tummies are sensitive and it takes about a week for them to adapt to any formula change so for you to play around with his formula is not advisable i understand you want to put the formula you have to use but i would suggest perhaps you donate them to babies with special needs who really need the soy or the neocate if money is an issue for you then try selling or exchanging them for the formula your baby is used to choose one type probably milk based iron fortified since your baby does well with it and stick to it maybe you can try doing that on craigslist best of luck to you Breastfeeding Soybean Milk Tofu Soy milk Infant formula Ice cream Allergy Dairy Veganism Breast milk Food allergy Nestl__ boycott Coeliac disease Coffee Infant Childbirth Nestl__ EastEnders Characters in the Smurfs Vegetarianism Inflation Tattoo Cat Chocolate Meat analogue Urinary incontinence Japanese cuisine Cheese Microeconomics Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Care Bears Food Advance fee fraud Cream (food) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Baby bottle Vitamin D Yu-Gi-Oh!
