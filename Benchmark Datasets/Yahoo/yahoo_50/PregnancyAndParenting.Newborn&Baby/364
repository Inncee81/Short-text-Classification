breastfeeding human rights so i was reading on the bbc that a woman was actually stopped by police in norfolk and asked not to breastfeed http news bbc co uk hi england norfolk stm do you think this is a matter for the european court of human rights surely a baby's basic right is to breastfeed even if other adults don't want to see it how can our society say that it's ok to not allow a woman to feed our babies in public but quite alright to have topless women in the sun on page and top shelf mags in the shops with offensive covers so who is going to be first and take this one to the top so that all women can have the absolute right to breastfeed anywhere well maybe not in dangerous places like high up on a construction site but everywhere safe and public please do how dare they this is why we need the same law in wales and england as they have in scotland where it is illegal to interfere with a breastfeeding mother in any way whatsoever i would have refused to stop breastfeeding told that policeman exactly where to go and would have liked to see how popular he made himself if he arrested a mother for feeding her hungry baby that would not wash with any judge i'd have sued the police for millions and had him sacked my baby son is fed when and where he needs it and if people don't like it them they can just look away as you said some silly bimbo can get her breasts out on page but a woman using them for the purpose for which they are intended gets harrassed bizarre Breastfeeding Breast Brassiere Abortion debate Indecent exposure Infant Nudity Judicial review Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Childbirth Milk Gay rights European Convention on Human Rights Supreme court Intellectual property Theory of conduct Civil rights Bill O'Reilly (commentator) British monarchy Jon Secada Murder Jam (TV series) British National Party Scots law Child pornography Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Privacy George Michael Breast milk Infant formula Slander and libel Breast pump Vitamin D Sharon Tate Rod Stewart Michael Savage (commentator) Miranda warning Topfree equality Fred Phelps International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Public domain Phil Hendrie Rosa Parks Lawyer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness 21 July 2005 London bombings Neighbours Ayyavazhi mythology Weathermen Knots Landing Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Freedom of speech James Bulger Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Guantanamo Bay Spyware SCO-Linux controversies E-mail spam Al-Aqsa Intifada North American Man/Boy Love Association Katelyn Faber First Amendment to the United States Constitution Independent school (UK) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India EastEnders British national identity card GNU General Public License Unlawful combatant Stolen Generation Corporate personhood Fair Game (Scientology) Bail Human rights Scotland Appeal U.S. presidential election, 2000 Jaundice Past and present anarchist communities Mastitis Prisoner (TV series) Sheriff One Piece minor characters Terri Schiavo Jennifer Lopez Bill Maher Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Nick Berg Divorce Fathers' rights Censorship in Australia Fathers' rights movement in the UK The Young Ones (TV series) Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Professional wrestling slang
