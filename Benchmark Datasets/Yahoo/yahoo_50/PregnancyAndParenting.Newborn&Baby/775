my month old breastfeed baby will not drink from a bottle help a baby who enjoys breastfeeding may not particularly welcome having milk from a bottle especially when his mother is available the first strategy could be to get other people to try your partner or your childminder for example while you absent yourself he may be happy doing things for other people he won't do with you you could try holding your baby in a different position to your usual breastfeeding one facing outwards for instance experiment with temperatures some babies will drink from a bottle at body temperature like breastmilk others prefer it cool or at room temperature try a variety of bottle teats and try softening them with warm boiled water if your baby really won't accept a bottle then it is possible to feed him with a spoon or a soft spouted beaker if he's around six months he might manage to drink from a cup some babies never bottle feed moving happily from breastfeeding to using a cup as part of the family meal don't forget that you can combine breastfeeding and working by feeding at nights early in the morning and at weekends if your working days are relatively short your baby might decide to hang on until you come home and then enjoy a good long feed generally speaking if you know you need to get your baby onto a bottle it's better to wait until breastfeeding is established but not leave it so long that your baby is unwilling to try anything new somewhere around six weeks after the birth is probably ideal many women who intend to return to work are understandably anxious about making sure their baby will take a bottle but try not to let the short time you have together be spoilt by fretting about this i hope this helps Milk Baby bottle Fertility awareness Infant Dairy Childbirth Breakfast Coffee Customs and etiquette of Japan Comanche Pregnancy Breast milk Bong Humphrey Bogart Breast Breast pump Alcoholic beverage Infant formula Sake Social rule Shaggy dog story Japanese tea ceremony Nestl__ Nestl__ boycott International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Drink Hong Kong-style milk tea Poker jargon Inca Kola Alois Hitler Knots Landing Soft drink Fiddler on the Roof Breech birth Paradox Joke Water Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Rum Jon Secada Peruvian cuisine Ayyavazhi mythology Champagne (beverage) Fecal incontinence Plastic Spacecraft propulsion Hard water Friends Marilyn Monroe Nipple piercing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phil Hendrie Elephant Platypus Indianapolis 500 Bass guitar The Apprentice 2 Katharine Hepburn Domestic goat Siphon Little Britain Eucharist Stanley Cup Dog EastEnders Coeliac disease Ocean's Twelve Cuisine of the Philippines Phoebe Buffay's songs Stone Cold Steve Austin Domestic rabbit Temperature Strap-on dildo Sea-Monkey Cider Roman eating and drinking Dairy farming Water (molecule) Cool (song) Prolactin Coca-Cola Guinea pig What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
