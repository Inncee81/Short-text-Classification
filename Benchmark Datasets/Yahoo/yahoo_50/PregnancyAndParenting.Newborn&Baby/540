drugs and intervention in childbirth why are people so naive when it comes to this issue i know that doctors don't instill much faith in a womans natural ability to give birth because it isn't convenient for them don't people realise that for every type of drug intervention can lead to further complications e g with an epidural you have to lay on your back which often leads to slow progression of labour fetal distress nasty tears etc i know that some want to avoid the pain with medication but i think that a lot of people underestimate the effect that it can have on the baby and the labour i was not implying that opting for meds is weak i was simply saying why don't women educate themselves and take active roles in the decisions etc there is a place for intervention i agree yes i have had beautiful of course drug free labours i'm not claiming to be superwoman i just let my body do it's job i guess you were lucky that nothing went wrong mercy i totally agree that women under estimate their ability to tolerate pain all the women i talked with prior to making my decision to get the epidural told me you can't not get it the pain is unbearable they scacred me into getting it the intervention for me was the epidural it prolonged labor once i got the epidural my labor almost cam to a complete hault and i had to be put on iv pitocin to keep things moving along one thing just leads to another my labor was so long that the epidural wore off long before labor was over and once your drip is out that is it they don't refill it i did the most intense part of labor without any assistance from pain meds even though my daughter was completely healthy i feel things could have gone better if i hadn't gotten the epidural and had to lay in bed moving around is te key this pregnancy i am going natural i am going to use water to help with relaxation and pregression i know i can do the worst part on my own so i will be able to go though the entire labor drug free Epidural Caesarean section Abortion debate Theory of conduct Local anesthesia Breastfeeding Breech birth Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Herpes simplex virus Premature birth Medicine Miscarriage Folic acid Cancer EastEnders Social rule Trade union Traumatic brain injury Friends Chronic fatigue syndrome Paracetamol Drug addiction Anxiety Opioid Goodness and value theory Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Simone Weil Psoriasis Microeconomics Theodicy Libertarianism In vitro fertilisation Midwifery Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
