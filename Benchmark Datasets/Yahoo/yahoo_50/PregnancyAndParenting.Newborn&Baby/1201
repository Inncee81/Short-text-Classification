why do so many people feed their babies formula dont they realize that breast milk is the best thing for your child personally i thing its lazyness cause it is much easier to give a baby a bottle im not saying im better than anyone i jsut see people my friends included using formula because they 'cant' breast feed what would they have done before formula came along i bet they would have tried alittle harder to breast feed and im not a stay at home mom yet i'm weeks pregnant and plan to feed my baby the right way ok so out of the billions of people in this world there might be some who have a good medical reason to not breast feed but for the most part woman these days are too concerned with what they want to do rather than what they should do it just bothers me because i was out with a friend who does breastfeed and my year old stepdaughter didnt know that was how babies eat she thought they ate out of a bottle i didnt realize that no one ever told her its pretty sad that we have to tell people thats how babies eat tina you and your doctor are uneducated idiots when it comes to breastfeeding and bilirubin levels maybe you should do some research on that issue before you give out facts that are untrue rather then have the nerve to tell people to research it or to have an open mind your breast milk was harming him lmao that has to be the funniest and stupidest thing i have heard this year it's really sad that your doctor is not educated on breastfeeding and to even suggest that your breast milk could harm your baby is ludicrous slightly raised bilirubin levels are always prolonged in breastfed infants and it causes no harm if you or your doctor were more educated on the issue you would know this just so you know not all doctors are up to date on their information this is a fact they don't know everything and don't suggest the best things at times this question probably wouldn't make you so upset unless you feel guilty somewhere deep down about choosing to formula feed yes i said choosing get a clue Fertility awareness Infant Breast Childbirth Infant formula Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Jaundice Milk International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Abortion debate Folic acid Nestl__ boycott Friends Kodocha Social rule Nestl__ Stuttering Knots Landing Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart Transsexuality Vitamin D Adoption Hypoglycemia Breast pump Jon Secada Drawn Together Ron and Fez Baby bottle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Characters in the Smurfs Domestic violence Theodicy Cytomegalovirus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Breast cancer Have I Got News For You Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Little Britain Alcoholics Anonymous Milton H.
