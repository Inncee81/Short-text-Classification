i ended up letting my month old cry last night and i felt horrible it took me hours to finally get him to go to sleep last night we don't normally have any trouble he may fight it for a couple of minutes then he is gone at he started crying and i went in and looked and his eyes were still closed so i gave him his pacifier and he seemed like he went right back to sleep as soon as i layed back down he started crying again i go back in and this time he is wide awake crying he hasn't had a bottle in the night for months but the last nights or so he has waken wanting one i tried to see if i could calm him without offering a bottle and that didn't work so i gave him a bottle and rocked him for minutes and that booger would not go to sleep he wasn't crying i had changed his diaper burped him he didn't have a fever he wasn't acting like his teeth were bothering him finally since he was calm but wide awake i ended up just laying him down he started to fuss and hold his arms up he just wanted me to hold him i felt horrible but i didn't know what else to do nothing was wrong and i couldn't hold him all night he cried for an hour or so and then he started crying again a hour after that i never wanted to let him cry it out i feel like i am letting him down if i do that i feel like he will think he can't depend on me do you have any other suggestions for me on things i can do if this happens again please thanks so far for all the answers they are all great we've let my boys cry themselves to sleep sometimes at months it's probably teeth and gums though after their last bottle sometimes my wife or i would rub a little oraljel on their gums and that usually soothed them into sleeping you do not let them down when you let them cry like that it's ok to see if they can settle themselves just as ok to pick them up too you sound like you are doing a great job don't worry your baby boy adores you no matter what you do hope this helps good luck The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Knots Landing Breastfeeding Friends Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Humphrey Bogart One Piece minor characters The Apprentice 2 Slow Train Coming Satchel Paige Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten The Subtle Knife Parsifal Oasis (band) Kodocha Milton H.
