equivilent digital focal length to mm focal length i have sony dsc h it's megapixels optical zoom is x it seems whatever the digital focal length is i times it by and seems to be pretty accurate any idea how much i times my digital focal length on my new toy to get close to mm focal length fuji e x optical megapixels here ya go your e has a sensor measuring about mm x mm the sensor to compare with measures mm x mm divide the larger length by the smaller length then do the same for width and the discrepancy is due to differing aspect ratios the smaller sensor being while the larger one is for differing aspect ratios the length multiplier is normally used to calculate the mm equivalent and in the case of a sensor that's it's actually but what's a few decimals edit i just noticed dr sam already gave you the correct ballpark multiplier so just consider my answer as confirmation and award him the points unless you prefer versus haha Digital photography Decibel Photography Photographic lens Aberration in optical systems Panoramic photography Digital camera back Digital single-lens reflex cameras Zoom lens Circuit design Pi Lens (optics) Leica Sensor View camera Canon EF lens mount Numeral system Reflecting telescope Aspect ratio (image) Continued fraction Resistor Radar Aperture F-number Binoculars Fuel injection Golden ratio Computer numbering formats Gravity Mental calculation Trigonometric function Macro photography Floppy disk Digital cinema Depth of field Telescope Antenna (radio) Global Positioning System Hipparchus (astronomer) Clementine mission Hard disk Digital camera Motion capture Age of the universe Central processing unit Canon EOS Angle Anamorphic widescreen Four Thirds System English unit Mouse (computing) Elementary arithmetic Contax History of measurement Nuclear fusion DV Konica Minolta GED Gregorian calendar Phase-locked loop Vedic mathematics Chromatic aberration Eye Movie projector Bayesian inference CPU design Amateur telescope making Analog-to-digital converter Angular resolution MP3 Microeconomics Metric system Advanced Photo System Normal distribution Panavision Probability Specific impulse Special relativity Pluto PID controller Hebrew calendar Optical fiber Scientific notation Inertial guidance system Piezoelectricity Oscilloscope Vector (spatial) Floating point E85 Units of measurement Wavefront Gear ratio 8 mm video format
