buying a digital camera i am looking in to buying a camera and i have been told that canon is the best i am looking for something over mega pixels any suggestions this question is like asking who makes the best car or which is the best band the answer depends on personal preferences and taste canon is the most popular in the prosumer market and makes many point shoot models too saying you want over megapixels is like saying you want a car with at least horsepower it will haul a or a big load but it will use a lot of gas make sure that is what you really want other quality manufacturers in alphabetical order are fuji leica if you are so rich that money is no object nikon olympus pentax and sony some of the smaller companies such as fuji olympus and pentax will allow you to get much more for your money check out steve's digicams for reports and reviews on lots of makes and models the big objection i have to canon nikon are that they spend a fortune on advertising and then charge more for all their products you don't specify what type of photgraphy you want to do or how you want to use the camera but both fuji and olympus have a wide selection of models from p s point shoot to pro grade cameras so i would go to steve's and look at some of the resources and links he has camera reviews by the number of mp brand or type and help sorting out the terminology all of the reviews include sample photos steve's conclusions a summary evaluation of the model i hope this helps good luck please email if you have specific questions Binoculars Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta Digital single-lens reflex cameras Leica Pentax Canon Inc.
