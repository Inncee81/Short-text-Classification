which is better a high pixel or changable a lens i have to make a choice between a pixel camera without the option of changing the lens or an pixel that can any camera reccomondations or less a make and model would help but the camera is undoubtedly a digital slr probably a canon eos rebel xt there are no fixed lens cameras that i know of that have more than a sensor which is about sq mm the xt has a much larger sensor at sq mm the sensor size in the slr will give you much better image quality check this out http www flickr com photos samfeinstein okay the slr is mp but you will see so much difference that i think you can practically discount that the slr gives much more definition or less i like the nikon d for a comparable rebel xt is both with the lens the pentax k d is with the lens my choice of these three would be the d regardless of price nikon d vs canon eos d rebel xt this isn't exactly what you asked for but perhaps you will find it helpful in making your decision i have never used a canon eos d so i can't actually compare the cameras but i favor the d because it has a spotmeter and the d doesn't although the d seems small it is practically the exact same size as the d http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras canon eos d cnikon d show all http www dpreview com reviews nikond page asp tells us that the canon d meter calibration is off by about of a stop this would not really present any problems except that it suggests something to me about the quality since the nikon and pentax are dead on scroll on down the page for image comparisons the d is clearly sharper and shows less noise at all iso settings http www dpreview com reviews nikond page asp shows us that both handle shadows equally but the d clips the highlights by about of a stop http www dpreview com reviews nikond page asp shows a side by side of studio images the mp of the canon d at least put the camera on equal footing with the nikon d for image quality but you have to take note that the rebel xt is shot at iso and the nikon is shot at it lowest setting of iso i think the canon images may look a little better but we know from the prior page that under equal lighting levels the canon will start to break up before the nikon the reviewer says while it is possible to pick areas of the image which lend some credence to the eos d's pixel count advantage it's clear that the average observer would not notice these differences and that you would need a very large output size for any of them to become visible check this out http dpreview img

originals dsc jpg is taken with the nikon d with an mm focal length at f th of a second iso using jpeg the point of focus for the canon photo is a bit deeper than it is for the nikon but even having mp and using raw and a smaller aperture i think the canon image breaks up a lot more than the nikon you can barely make out the features on the face of the gentleman in the background is this the camera or the superiority of the nikon lens which so many of us here praise okay i've made my stance clear i like the nikon d better than the canon eos d so here's my general review of the d the nikon d is a great little camera very easy to use and quite reasonably priced it has a few consumer friendly totally automatic modes that make it very easy to use but still offers total photographic control when you are ready to take charge it will get you in the nikon family which is a great place to be if you buy accessories and lenses you will be able to use everything on any nikon that you might upgrade to later on check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera test nikon d html http www kenrockwell com nikon d d recommendations htm i hate to see people slam the camera because it can't autofocus with older nikon lenses it is true that there is a slight problem with older nikon lenses not autofocusing on the d but if you do not own a bag full of older lenses it is not going to be a problem it is barely a problem anyhow if you check www nikonusa com for af s lenses which are all compatible with the d you will find lenses including vr vibration reduction lenses and one true macro lens with vr there are another plus lenses in the current catalog that provide all functions except autofocus as well as many possibly dozens out of print lenses that will work just as well in addition although these lens will not autofocus most of them will still give focus confirmation from the d manual if the lens has a maximum aperture of f of faster the viewfinder focus indicator can be used to confirm whether the portion of the subject in the selected focus area is in focus after positioning the subject in the active focus area press the shutter release button halfway and rotate the lens focusing ring until the in focus indicator is displayed see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses the d only has autofocus zones arranged horizontally at the center o'clock and o'clock positions this might be considered a limitation but realistically most people will find this perfectly adequate especially if you are moving up from a point and shoot with only a center zone you can get the d with the kit lens at b h photo available through yahoo shopping or at for june add a lexar platinum x speed card for or gb for or get the d with lens and gb lexar card for they also have used d 's from and yet clearly these are both very good cameras what it all comes down to is which one you feel better about go to a camera shop and pick them up and see nikon d vs pentax k d i was devoted to pentax film cameras for most of my life they have just started to come on strong in digital camera development but pentax has always been a concervative company in my opinion others make the point that you should choose a camera system by its lenses and this is definitely true both pentax and nikon have a full catalog of lenses to choose from although fhotoace points out that it may be harder to find good used pentax lenses finding used nikon lenses will not be a great help for you if you buy the d as most will not autofocus with the camera it requires the newest generation of lenses the af s lenses for auto focus however most of the older lenses will still work perfectly well in all other functions most will even give you focus confirmation as you focus manually the pentax has built in image stabilization but as far as i can determine it is only one mode nikon offers some vr lenses that have two modes of image stabilization to be used under different circumstances i admit that this is still an advantage for pentax though i have two stock answers that i will spare you reading as the real decision here is how the camera feels in your hands since you have some camera experience you will know what to look for go to a camera shop and ask to handle each camera ask how each one would be put into the different modes they each have a mode dial but once you are in shutter or aperture priority of manual mode see what you have to do in order to actually adjust the shutter speed or aperture frankly i'd like to see a few more buttons on either camera so you would not have to dive into the menu system to make changes but i guess that's part of being entry level from the spec sheets it concerned me that the pentax uses aa batteries i didn't know that until now true you can use nimh rechargeables but dpreview said that they have gotten many hundreds of shots out of dispoable lithium cr v batteries so i guess that is not an issue for an slr this quote from the dpreview page also concerns me k d is acceptably quick in most everyday respects but doesn't feel as snappy as you would expect from a modern digital slr the biggest disappointments would probably be the lack of instant startup relatively sluggish record review and a virtually pointless continuous shooting mode just four jpeg frames my usual pitch is to say that the pentax k d is the cheapest digital slr worth owning and the nikon d is the one i would choose for myself i would stand by that decision after some review on your behalf tonight check out this comparison page click on in depth review and read owner opinions for each camera be sure to note that the reviews are many pages long so you don't stop after page one check the sample images also you can enlarge these to full size images if you click on the file name shown below the picture you will have to then put your cursor in the white space to the right of the picture and click once after that you can pass your cursor over the image and it will turn into a magnifier click it as a magnifier once and the image will go to full size and you can really examine the detail or look for artifacts like purple fringing around items in high contrast photos or noise in darker areas of the picture http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras pentax k d cnikon d show all fortunately these cameras came out at about the same time and both reviews compare one camera to the other in many aspects this will help you with your decision
