looking for new digital slr camera lens i am looking at the nikon d x camera and i think i definately want to get it after looking at the reviews i am just getting into amateur photography and was wondering if anyone could steer me towards a good lens to purchase with it it comes with an mm lens mostly my husband and i will be taking snapshots and nature landscapes and sports shots any reccomendations your desires are at opposite ends of the spectrum landscapes typically demand a wide angle lens while sports usually required a telephoto as a primary and first lens i'd suggest the nikon mm mm as your best bet you don't have to buy the lens that comes with the camera you can subsitute it for any other but of course that will cost you a bit more in mm terms that gives you a range from a mm wide angle which it pretty good to a telephoto of mm which is also pretty good what's nice too is that you won't have to constantly change lenses this lens has an image stabilizer built in too which helps in low light situations later if you really need a wider angle lens you can add that as you have the money wider angles tend to be rather expensive and later you can also add a longer telephoto if you really need that capability beyond the lens above usually telephotos aren't quite as expensive as wide angles your other alternative is to buy two lenses get the mm mm which gives you that same mm wide angle and extends to mm in mm terms this is great for landscapes and parties and portraits stuff like that add to this lens the mm mm zoom with the image stabilizer this then takes you from mm all the way up to mm a fairly lengthy telephoto this combination will cost you more of course and will necessitate changing lenses all the time but it does allow a much larger telephoto range nature photography demands all kinds of things but either lens recommendation would meet your needs however if you're into little things small bugs for instance then the nikon mm macro lens is ideal it goes to life size has an image stabilizer and is very fast at f while stopping down all the way to f however this lens is not practical for every day photography its strengths lie in photographing little things i have all four of these lenses and have been very happy with them i do a lot of macro work so the macro is priceless to me when i first bought my d s it came with the and i added the however i found it a pain to constantly change lenses so when i bought my d i got that with the lens now i never use my it's unnecessary but once in a while i will use the when i need that extra telephoto length which isn't too often if i were starting out again i d get the as my primary lens and add a later on unfortunately the didn t exist at the time i bought my d s in terms of your camera choice the d x is an excellent exceptional entry level slr that will allow you to accomplish quite a bit and will give you an opportunity to really learn photography if you have a serious interest later if you want more sophistication look at the d or whatever replaces it at the time nikon has built in a lot of features into that one that are usually reserved for the professional line i use the d personally this model is almost identical in functionality and reatures to their professional camera but at one third the cost as you get ever more sophisticated this one is a real bargain for what it delivers to your hands i hope that helps a little Cinematography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Contax Nikon Corporation Digital camera Konica Minolta Panoramic photography Microeconomics Zoom lens Canon EOS Digital camera back Canon T90 Rangefinder camera Depth of field Eyepiece Binoculars Economics Camera Canon EF lens mount Computer Extreme Programming Supply and demand Theory of conduct Insurance Surveillance Aberration in optical systems Car handling Amateur astronomy Poker jargon Photographic film CPU cache Advanced Photo System Street photography Lens (optics) Equine conformation Pinhole camera Inflation Atari 8-bit family MMORPG Camcorder Bicycle lighting Film Reflecting telescope IBM PC compatible Telescope Hubble Space Telescope Nikon FM2 Medium format Movie projector Explosive material Gamma ray burst Full frame digital SLR Lighting Parallax Windows Vista Polarization Drill bit Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Nikon FE Monetary policy Bloodstain pattern analysis Floppy disk Transformer Paragliding Redundant array of independent disks Color Golf Land use forecasting Mach kernel Anamorphic widescreen Apollo 8 Carburetor Goodness and value theory Wayne Corporation Oscilloscope Milton H.
