reviews on the samsung s digital camera please any problems or complaints you had about it the pros cons ect i'm really focusing on this camera so unless if you have something similar is what i'm looking for decent quality pictures video abilities not a tiny tiny camera either as for the samsung are the photos decent quality can you zoom while filiming and how is the quality of video i have a samsung s it about the same will the battery life is horrible you would need lithium batteries or rechargeable batteries also the pictures have good quality as long as you keep it on portrait there's different colors and frames you can put on while taking a picture that cool but i paid for mine so you get what you pay for oh and the video is good as long as you in some light the video works great outside though keep the picture mode set on portrait when you take it because in the dark because if you change it to night scene it won't work also make sure the flash is on at all times i hoped i helped and to answer your question you can zoom in and out while making a video but the sound won't work as you do it so you should keep the zoom where you want it while filming Digital photography Photography Leica IPod Cinematography Film Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation Portable Digital camera Single-lens reflex camera Game Boy Traditional animation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Widescreen Television Konica Minolta Digital cinematography Contax Oscilloscope Stereoscopy Bicycle lighting Camera Laserdisc Canon T90 Camcorder Electronic journalism Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis View camera High-definition television Liquid crystal display television Panoramic photography Vorbis Digital cinema Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Digital single-lens reflex cameras Handheld game console Prank flash Movie camera Color temperature NTSC Sega Saturn Video Battery (electricity) Tungsten Handheld Creative Zen The Ashlee Simpson Show Motion picture terminology Game Boy Advance Atari ST Walkman DVD 8 mm video format Lightsaber Digital video Zoom lens Nintendo 64 Windows Vista Apple Computer Citizen Kane Atari 8-bit family Macro photography Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Point and shoot camera DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Digital camera back Mouse (computing) All My Children Late Night with Conan O'Brien Technicolor Xbox 360 DV Protoss Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Nintendo DS Lithium ion battery Road-rule enforcement camera Photograph Binoculars Doom 3 Movie projector The Legend of Zelda series Camera phone Verizon Wireless Bullet time Charge-coupled device Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Machinima Platform game Contemporary culture of South Korea Canon PowerShot G Music video Photographic lens Samsung Treo 650 Nintendo
