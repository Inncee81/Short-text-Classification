about canon powershot sd i have a problem with setting the battery status i can't see the battery status on the screen until it's low battery by the time it's low batt i only can take more pics how to set the battery status so that it will appear on the lcd screen thanks the sd doesn't have a battery status indicator it only has a low battery icon that shows up on the lcd because your camera's battery is quite small up to shots when fully charged the only way to make sure you don't run out of power other than buying a spare battery is to make sure you always charge the battery before you intend to use the camera limiting the use of the flash zoom and movies will help to conserve battery power and turning off the lcd monitor between shots also helps you don't have a viewfinder to compose your photos with so you have to use the lcd this is a downside because the lcd consumes most of the battery power the sd would have been the better camera in this instance because it does have a viewfinder anyway just charge your battery regularly good luck Digital photography Liquid crystal display Canon T90 Laptop Digital single-lens reflex cameras Windows XP Leica Photography Oscilloscope Konica Minolta Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Contax Danger Hiptop Universal Serial Bus Movie projector Canon PowerShot G IMac Handheld game console Ford Ranger EV Steadicam PowerBook Stereoscopy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster IBM PC compatible Nikon FA Embedded system Television Liquid crystal display television Organic light-emitting diode Mouse (computing) Canon EOS PlayStation Portable TFT LCD Tungsten Handheld Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Watch Single-lens reflex camera Cathode ray tube Digital camera Digital cinematography IPod Thermostat Memory effect Nickel-cadmium battery Light-emitting diode Toyota Prius Energy development Sega Saturn IPod nano Vacuum tube Closed-circuit television Xbox 360 Canon T70 ThinkPad Screenshot Nintendo DS Apple Computer Battery electric vehicle Battery (electricity) Lead-acid battery Pixel Gameking Nikon FM2 Gamut Nikon FE PIC microcontroller Gross domestic product Creative Zen Archos Sharp Zaurus Plasma display Nikon FM AlphaSmart Nikon FE2 Cheating in Counter-Strike Rangefinder camera View camera Binoculars Bluetooth Lithium ion battery Surveillance Hybrid Synergy Drive WNEP-TV Microvision Computer display Color Wind turbine Bicycle lighting Thermal power station Macintosh Portable MIM-23 Hawk Inspector Gadget Bulk vending Wind power USS Terry (DD-513) Road-rule enforcement camera Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Prank flash
