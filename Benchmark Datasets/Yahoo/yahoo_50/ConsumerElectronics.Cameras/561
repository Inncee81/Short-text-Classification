must i have win or higher for my digital camera i have a kodak easyshare c digital camera and i have windows me on my computer the disc says i have to have win or higher and the computer doesn't recognize the device could i possibly download a program that could recognize the camera please help yes and no if the kodak software demands that you have win or higher then it definitely means it however there are other options technically any computer running win or later should be able to connect to the camera as long as you plug the camera in and turn it on before you boot up the computer that's the theory in practice sometimes the camera isn't recognized expecially by win usually because the operating system doesn't have a driver for it if that happens you can also consider getting a card reader what works with win or later again the trick is to connect it to a usb port before booting up the computer unless you're running win xp which can detect it immediately if the card reader comes with a cd install the cd and that will provide the needed driver if it doesn't come with a cd and also doesn't work download the driver from the manufacterer's web site and install it once that's done you can download your images from your card i hope that helps a little good luck USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Windows XP Secure Digital card Bluetooth Digital photography Microsoft Windows Floppy disk IPod Linux Digital camera Knoppix Computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk MAME Common Unix Printing System Computer virus Digital rights management Modem Device driver USB mass storage device class IBM PC compatible Computer forensics History of Microsoft Windows Apple Newton BIOS PlayStation 3 OpenBSD File Allocation Table Nintendo Revolution Spyware FreeDOS Closed-circuit television LiveCD PlayStation 2 X Window System DVD Blue screen of death High-definition television Rootkit Digital audio player Windows Server 2003 Apple Computer Modchip Movie projector Architecture of Windows 2000 Copy protection Mouse (computing) Television Nintendo Entertainment System Computer hardware Flash memory Surveillance IMac Disk cloning N-Gage Malware Photography Visual Basic Computer bus Xbox 360 XD-Picture Card Atari ST Trusted computing Anti-virus software Mac OS X Personal computer ReactOS Wi-Fi PlayStation Portable Memory Stick ITunes System 7 (Macintosh) PDP-11 Embedded system Atari 8-bit family Screenshot Danger Hiptop Windows Me Windows 3.x DirectX Commodore 64 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Multifunction printer Hardware random number generator CPU design Ebook Tungsten Handheld
