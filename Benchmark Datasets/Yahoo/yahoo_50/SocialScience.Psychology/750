how do i become more decisive i seem to take a very long time making any and all decisions what uni course should i take in what order should i complete a specific task that'll be more time efficient i'm always analysing all the pros and cons of every situation or i ask friends and anyone around me what they would do i'm afraid that if i just go with my instincts it'll be the wrong decision i'll be thinking if i had chosen the other decision or if i had done it the other way i wouldn't have wasted all this time most of the time i don't even know what my instincts want i'm also afraid that if i choose one thing i'll be missing out on what could have been had i chosen the other thing because of my indecision i end up not resolving the situation i will plan a lot but won't be able to follow through or i keep changing my mind flip from one decision to the the next back to my first decision and the cycle goes on i end up procrastinating and wasting a lot of time and my life help there are some people who are naturally open minded that's why it takes them a lot of time to decide others however decide quickly even without having to think about the pros and cons of their options your open mindedness is a positive quality that may also become a great hindrance to you that is why you shouldn't think too far sometimes you just need to decide without considering every inch of the problem just think of it this way there is no single best solution for a problem just the good and the bad just pick out the good among your options anything from that would be the best for you rely on your instincts when choosing among the better options stop thinking that you'll miss something when you chose option a because i'm sure if you chose option b you'll still end up wondering what if you chose otherwise it would be an endless cycle so stop thinking there's only one best solution if you felt that you chose the wrong decision don't despair at least you now know that otherwise is better you can still shift to the other option because everyone learns from his her mistakes don't think about shifting from one option to another choose and commit to one until it proves itself wrong that's when you can shift to plan b hope this helps Procrastination The Apprentice 2 Social rule Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Poker jargon The Death Gate Cycle Jon Secada Mediation Friends Extreme Programming Coming of Age (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chess strategy and tactics 2000 Australian Grand Prix About a Boy Microeconomics Consensus decision-making Sheepshead The nature of God in Western theology Chu-Han contention Ontological argument Kasparov versus The World Labour economics Goodness and value theory Operation Market Garden Requirements analysis The Contender (television series) Legal research Paradox Coin flipping Ethics Milton H.
