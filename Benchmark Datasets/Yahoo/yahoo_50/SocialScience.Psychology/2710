do you think it would be dangerous to go clubbing i'm going clubbing downtown for a friend's birthday party this is my first time to an actual club i'm by the way and it's legal where i'm from once you turn i have been to a restaurant bar or lounge before but haven't stayed there for more than minutes after hours my parents disapprove with severity they claim that drive by shootings happen and things get out of hand all the time in these kinds of places and it's definitely no place for someone as young and inexperienced as me in the end however it is my decision by the way i do look very young i got ided multiple times at the lounge and i wasn't even there for that long but my friends didn't b c i look young do you think this would make me vulnerable or an easy target for the wrong type of people do you think it would be a bad idea to stay out late once and just have fun clubbing with my friends i was planning on wearing a sexy dress but now i'm unsure should i i won't drink thanks for your help if you go with and stay with your friends do not dress too seductive and act properly you will be fine you can dance and sing but do stay with your friends never leave your drink unattended even if you have to take it to the bathroom with you and even go to the washroom with a friend don't give out your personal information phone number etc unless you meet someone that you really feel comfortable with and even then make sure someone you know can at least vouch for him too much craziness going on out there these days but you cannot live in a cage either just be careful and trust your gut instincts and friends that have proved themselves i swear by the buddy system thank you Social rule Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) T.A.T.u.
