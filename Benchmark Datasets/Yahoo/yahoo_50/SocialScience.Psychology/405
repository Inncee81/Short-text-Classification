what is there to smile about for some reason i just can't smile unless something truly touches my heart to cause me to smile if that makes any sense sometimes i'm just content but i don't smile people think i'm really sad i'll admit i'm not really a happy person i'm a quite and shy type of person and when people don't know me at first they think i am the hostile type of person but later when they get to know me more they tell me i thought you were a mean or hostile person at first but after i got to know you i realized you are so nice and innocent people misintrepret the real me because i don't smile i'm really sorry but i just can't smile when there is nothing to smile about a lot of people including teachers tell me to smile or ask me whats wrong and sometimes when i do occasionally smile for whatever reason they say to me its so nice when i smile so my question to all of you is how can i be a more smiley person and what do you smile about dude i do nothing but am happy and smile just to make ppl know eberything ok even iof everything isn't ok there not rly alot of things to smile about like the freaking war the bush is screwing us over the army is god don't get me started my dads in the army and global warming is gonna kill us all some day moms a biology teacher umm everything is going to the drain and nothing is eeverr right its really depressing but you gotta have a posotive attitude to make things happen theres really nothing you can do to become a smiley person but really want to be happy i usually don't have alot of things to be happy about but i try somhow i jus smile and be happy that im alive mimi Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophical skepticism Pitaten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Smiley Smile Humphrey Bogart The Marshall Mathers LP Phoebe Buffay's songs Dead Like Me Negima Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cindy Sheehan The Smoking Room Cliff Richard The Emancipation of Mimi Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Treehouse of Horror V Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Catcher in the Rye Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Year of the Spider Care Bears Jon Secada The Beach Boys Goodness and value theory Kodocha Time Out of Mind Peter Singer Recurring South Park characters Kyle Broflovski Rent (musical) Blonde on Blonde Aristotle Ranma __ characters Boom Town (Doctor Who) Kender Nicomachean Ethics Kim Possible Theodicy Graham Kennedy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kim Possible: So the Drama Smiley Saga (band) Fahrenheit 451 Springfield Elementary School Traumatic incident reduction Utilitarianism David Hume Fruits Basket Frankie Vaughan Ontological argument A Course In Miracles AFI 100 Years series Dualism (philosophy of mind) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The Inside Joke Smile (album) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Meaning of life Yoko Ono Sunflower (album) The Midnight Sun Gregg Alexander Death of a Salesman Blood on the Tracks Jackass: The Movie Self Portrait User Friendly Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
