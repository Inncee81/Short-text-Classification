bereavement how do you manage it last week i went to two funerals one was a woman aged who had died of cancer i'd known her and her husband for years that was on tuesday on thursday i went to the funeral of a male friend who had died of brain damage after an accident i grieve very much for their families but at the same time my own heart is about to burst i work as a careworker in a home for old people with alzheimers one of the nvq questions is 'what are the stages of bereavement ' is it as neat and tidy as that i have buried my grandparents my parents schoolfriends how can there be stages of bereavement life's a mess emotions are a mess and you still have to live with the sadness of people who are still living how do you stop yourself from just being overwhelmed thank you so much for all kind and thoughtful replies so far will leave my question open for a bit longer love to you all i think grief never leaves you it changes its debilitating effects i think the stages of grief are disbelief shock anger depression acceptance you have my compassion and empathy for the sadness that you have it is so hard to loose those we love at times it can make you feel well there are no words its just feelings time does not heal it just makes it easier to go on you have a warm spirit and for that gift you are paying the price its called caring take time to heal yourself because even the soul has its seasons best wishes Grief Jewish bereavement Funeral Reaction to the assassination of John F.
