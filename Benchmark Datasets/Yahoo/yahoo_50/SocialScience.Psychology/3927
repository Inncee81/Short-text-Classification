i'm and still shy i'm a year old male and have been shy my entire life i thought it would go away as i got older but it hasn't i have friends had girlfriends but this makes it much tougher to meet women in my case i have trouble even walking down the street with my head up i have a tough time making eye contact with people as i seem to get really nervous as people approach i'd seen a psychologist for over a year but stopped after not noticing a difference in being less shy i've also tried paxil for social anxiety but it still didn't work much i don't even know if i have social anxiety as i do enjoy going out with friends and being an extrovert is there even such thing as a shy extrovert while i enjoy spending time by myself and live alone i don't want to be alone all the time i don't think i have any type of mental issue as the psychologist and medicine didn't seem to work i'm not sure what it could be though i just don't want to be so nervous with eye contact thanks coming from a year old shy male i can suggest a few things take a temperment study to find out what your natural reactions to things are if you haven't already this will give you the information about yourself to either accept that that's who you are or understand better how to deal with things about yourself that you'd like to improve for example i am also naturally shy so i know to avoid certain situations altogether that will make me uncomfortable i have a need to stay out of the spotlight but my temperment study says i'm also fanatic about doing things absolutely perfectly when i care about them knowing this i leaned on that strength to study and improve my weaknesses for situations in which i have to be involved such as job related situations or the like i'm still shy but i know how people expect me to react in certain situations and i simply learned how to do it once you've taken the temperment study assuming it says you're naturally prone to shy behavior don't worry about it don't try to make yourself somebody you're not don't just accept it enjoy it i know i know this sounds like an afterschool special cop out but seriously it's best to accept who you are and like it go with your strengths if you prefer to spend an evening reading the latest tom clancy novel or watching a movie by yourself or with one or two friends instead of hitting the night clubs or finding any excuse to locate a crowd of people then do it my friend can't stand being alone but needs to be around people all the time that's cool find out where your comfort zone is and enjoy your time there don't waste your time worrying that the grass might be greener in the field you're too shy to enter or that the people in that field might be mocking you forget them have fun where you are figure out how to fake your way out of the situations you have to be in learn the little psychological nuances and simply do them i know to look a person in the eye when i'm talking to them so i do it even though my natural tendency is to look away i know how to sit in a chair properly as if to appear confident at a job interview find the little tricks that confident people do unconsciously yes you're using a conscious effort to accomplish the same task but they don't know that if it's really important to you don't just fake it really change the only way to accomplish this is by doing it your temperment study will reveal what your tendencies are it doesn't mean you're stuck that way experience can change who you are i took drama in high school for the specific purpose of learning how to fake comfort around people i've never met and you know what it worked sort of i'm now more comfortable quoting shakespeare on stage in front of a thousand people than i am with only one person who wants me to discuss myself why practice repetition i simply did it and i did it often enough that now what used to scare me to death is actually a comfort zone last but not least women the best thing i can say is once you determine your comfort zone stop wasting your time trying to marry a woman who wants to spend all of her time outside of it go find the girl who says she enjoys quiet walks in the moonlight and actually means it when women blow you off because you're not the crazy wild type pity them be the guy that women on their third divorce wish they'd been smart enough to latch onto and please be yourself around women don't fake this and don't try to learn to be somebody you're not it simply doesn't work in high school a friend of mine said i'd have a million friends who were girls but never a girlfriend because i was the kind of person that women felt safe being with he actually felt sorry for me he's been in one messed up relationship after another and in days i will celebrate my th wedding anniversary no matter what you do have fun doing it i hope you find your answer Friends Shaggy dog story Asperger syndrome Psychology Infantilism Transsexuality Scientology
