did you have a dream last night tell me about it i haven't been asked that in a while so i thought i ask it for a change my dream was cool but im sure i've had it before firstly the horrible part was this man was holding me hostage and he was really tall and gross but then other people came and we all went on the run and i had to get some drugs off someone by kissing them then i whispered to some police that the horrible guy had a gun and was gg to shoot people then we ran up ten storeys and somehow the guy just disapeared then the scene flicked to a large group of people in a circle looking terrified with a man who looked like naopolean dynamite in the middle holding a gun everyone was crouching down and he shot two people but they survived and then he suddenly declared his love for god and gave up the gun lol and that was the end sorry probably didnt make much sense but yeah an interesting dream anyway Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miss Saigon Sin City Knots Landing Late Night with Conan O'Brien Characters of Lost Cliff Richard Fancy Crane The Cure Little Britain She Loves You One Tree Hill (TV series) ROC presidential election, 2004 Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Humphrey Bogart Jam (TV series) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Escape from New York The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jiddu Krishnamurti Collateral (film) Kyle Broflovski Jon Secada The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath John Lennon Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dundas Square Max Payne Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Phoebe Buffay's songs Deus ex machina Paul Is Dead Hall & Oates Moe Szyslak Shaggy dog story Scenes from a Memory Idolatry Psychology of religion Neighbours Moonraker Columbine High School massacre Piccolo Junior Saga Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Invisibles Salad Fingers The Ashlee Simpson Show Blue Seed The Shining (film) It's All Gone Pete Tong Melbourne gangland killings EastEnders Billboard Hot 100 House music Meaning of life Second Battle of the Atlantic Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Guns N' Roses W.I.T.C.H.
