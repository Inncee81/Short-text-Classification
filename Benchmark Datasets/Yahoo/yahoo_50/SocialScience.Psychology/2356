why do you think people get stuck in the pain i recently posted another question one person answered saying there is no way that i could feel or understand how he she felt and then of course called me clueless i believe we all feel very much the same things but in different experience levels i believe this because i have lived the life that this person spoke of i have felt the very same things he she felt i have just moved grown forgave past that point in my life add to that my doctorate of life and you have one powerful understanding of human behavior i know the clinical reason but i want your response so my question is why do some people who have been through extreme trauma come out unscathed while others choose to remain in the pit of despair do they refuse help do they want to feel that way does pain give people power and that's why they hold on to it you tell me i just want a discussion from the people i see post on this site i'd like to know what you truly think first i am not very fond of and do not use i know exactly how you feel because it is a lie even if in the same event with an identical twin each will feel somewhat different and deal with it emotionally in a unique way their own people want compassion company and understanding but they also like their own feeling to be their own not i know how you feel that gets people defensive or agressive not on you who are just trying to let them know you understand their pain but on their autenticity as look how unique i am when i suffer so you can't know no one can that pain is as unique as fingerprints but even more so it is soul print then i don't think there are any true humans that didn't feel at any given moment of their lives a certain amount of soul pain if they let it out confront it hide it especially from themselves that's also an individuality they say time heals all wounds but it is not entirely true is what people do with that time that really heals chosing to stay in that pain probably has its payoff no one does something without a payoff even when one smiles at the other they feel good about it hence payoff if they can trigger the exact payoff what are they getting from staying in a continue suffering they could see that the payoff of letting go is even greater so this is how i think feel and deal with everyday life Goodness and value theory Simone Weil Scientology beliefs and practices Game theory Traumatic incident reduction Theodicy Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nicomachean Ethics Grief Religion Sexual orientation Clinical depression Post-traumatic stress disorder Determinism Milton H.
