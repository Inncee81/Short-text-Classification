sister thinks i think she is inferior to me this is driving me crazy my mum knows my sis feels this way and consciously tries to praise my sister more than me i talked to my mum about the problem and we agreed that praise might help her so i know i'm not imagining it i am the oldest child of two so maybe she feels that as the youngest being the weakest makes her somehow inferior i would never put her down or try to upset her so i don't know why she feels this way i don't know why she feels this how can i show her that i love her and i think she is of the same importance as myself she probably recognizes that you are praising her to make her feel better which in the end makes her feel worse try to find an activity or hobby that is important to her or that she is good at and have her teach it to you or join her in the activity even if you know how to do or are not interested at all let her be in control if there are certain topics that your family discusses let her voice an opinion and reflect what she is saying so she knows you are really listening Theory of conduct Social rule About a Boy Milton H.
