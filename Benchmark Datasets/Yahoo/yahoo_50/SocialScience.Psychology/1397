how do you get over wanting to commit suicide i have struggled with thoughts of suicide for years i should be happy i have brothers who call me regularly great friends that would do anything for me am very active in sports etc i enjoy and i have a decent job in fact many days i am happy then something will happen for instance a friend overreacting about my doing something wrong my first response is 'i can't do this any more i don't want to do this anymore i am going to disappear and kill myself ' i have it planned i will be sure no one ever finds my body so no one knows i killed myself that way they are not victims of suicide i may even say i'm going overseas to teach that is something not out of character for me then they'll just think i lost touch i just can't get over this lingering desire that sometimes becomes a very strong urge to be done living a life i'm tired of living i truly do want not feel this way but i can't help it a little history several adults in my life commited suicide when i was a child and my mother tried i'm not bi polar just don't know how to change my thinking i am not sure if that desire ever goes away i as well have mine planned and have for years some days the pull is strong other days i don't think about it at all i don't know if i am happy on those days but i do know the moments that make me happy what i have been told and what seems to work for me is making goals but making them so that there is always a goal present staggering the goals so to speak if i have something to move forward for or to it is easier for me to have less days where i want to stop living i hope this helps in some small way and i wish you peace Pitaten Avenue Q Suicide Shaggy dog story Friends Survivor (novel) About a Boy Jon Secada Anna Karenina Knots Landing Jonestown EastEnders Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye 2005 trial of Michael Jackson John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Transactional analysis Paranoia Agent The Death Gate Cycle Serial killer Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Amber Spyglass Hillary Rodham Clinton Social rule The Fairly OddParents W.I.T.C.H.
