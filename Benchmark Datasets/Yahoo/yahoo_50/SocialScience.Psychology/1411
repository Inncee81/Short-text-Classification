so why can't i stop dreaming about him my boyfriend broke up with me after being together for months he told me he wanted to marry me when we broke up he said that he couldn't handle the situation i was in anymore i e i have a work related injury that has left me without a job pretty much the entire time we were together when he met me i was really happy in m life and very secure about myself after a couple of months without work and the possibility of having a permanent injury i became very depressed i know i wasn't easy to be around but i guess it was too much for him he's still the first thought when i wake up in the morning the last though before i go to sleep and he's always in my dream what can i do to get past this i forgot to add that we've been apart for about months now there isn't really anything you can do you need to give your heart some time to mend it seems like you're still in love with him and the only thing that will get you past that is time it may take a long time and it may not but just go with the flow and let yourself feel what your feeling don't try to force yourself to stop feeling this way because that will only repress the feelings and then they'll come back stronger later on One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Jon Secada EastEnders Shaggy dog story Kodocha Friends Pitaten Dead Like Me W.I.T.C.H.
