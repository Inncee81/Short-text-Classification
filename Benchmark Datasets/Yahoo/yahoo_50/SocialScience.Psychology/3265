do you believe in forgiveness or revenge more when someone rips you off or emotionally hurts you neither i believe in justice i seldom see it but i believe in it nonetheless forgiveness is overrated not to mention completely subjective person to person some things are simply not able to be forgiven especially when it involves deep emotion i wouldn't forgive someone that emotionally hurt me with no regard for my feelings nor would i seek revenge on them i would cut them out of my life and thoughts without a second thought and not bother thinking about them again that's justice Forgiveness Sin A Course In Miracles Anger management Soul Summa Theologiae Self-harm Theory of conduct Revenge One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders John Howard Yoder Evil Capital punishment Alcoholics Anonymous Abortion debate Obsessive-compulsive disorder Nicomachean Ethics About a Boy Sub-Zero Philosophy of language Emotion Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Pashtunwali Repentance Knots Landing Hip hop rivalries Sexual orientation Transactional analysis Obi-Wan Kenobi Hulk (comics) Sufism The Merchant of Venice Serial killer Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Bhakti yoga Objectivist philosophy Simone Weil Social justice Psychoanalysis Drama Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Stoicism Sigmund Freud Kain (Legacy of Kain) Rei Ayanami William James Confucius Traumatic incident reduction Charles Grandison Finney Haibane Renmei Eastern Orthodox Church Bondage (BDSM) Lightsaber combat Goodness and value theory Medea (play) Force (Star Wars) Ethics Friedrich Schleiermacher Asperger syndrome Sin City Nuanced voices on the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Kodocha Jon Secada Mind control Albert Ellis Meaning of life Human Polyamory The Vampire Chronicles Happiness Guilt Scientology beliefs and practices Artificial consciousness Narcissism The Marriage of Figaro Eddie Guerrero Appeal Plame affair Solar Element Saga Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Alignment (role-playing games) Roe v.
