adult life and responsibility why is it so awful i remember when i was a child and i looked at the adults around me and it struck me how much time they spent just talking about things and how boring that was how boring their lives were shuffing about from one tiresome duty to the next how little sense of adventure or idealism they had how tired they all seemed is there a way of avoiding this fate i'll address each point it helps us to talk with friends peers so that we aren't mentally overwhelmed responsibility always increases even without having kids one has to shop cook clean go to work and pay the bills it was always so much easier when we had minimal chores homework and then the rest of the day was free good old mom and dad taking care of everything else yeah it's easy to forget adventure and sometimes our idealism gets a bit diluted due to conforming in the workplace and community trust me always have room for adventure whether a spontaneous weekend trip just driving until you're ready to stop or planning something with friends always be true to yourself don't lose your idealism and at the same time don't get militant about your beliefs leave room in the world for other people's ideals and try to at least understand their point of view avoid extra stress the key i believe is to live within your means still get the things you want but don't let yourself become burdened with heavy debt credit cards can be extremely dangerous for your health my tiredness has always increased when i had too many credit card bills tiredness hopelessness and despair don't let yourself be overwhelmed also drinks or dinner with friends a couple of times a week can be very refreshing even when we feel we're carrying the weight of the world a little personal contact and fun can really ease whatever our burdens are ok i'm going to move on as i've spent a lot of energy and thought i'm going to do something relaxing so i won't feel tired Social rule Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Scientology beliefs and practices Equine conformation Alcoholics Anonymous Borderline personality disorder Procrastination Friends About a Boy Psychoanalysis The Contender (television series) Grief Humphrey Bogart Infantilism A Course In Miracles Fathers' rights Hillary Rodham Clinton Goodness and value theory Little Britain Kimi Finster Singlish Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Apprentice 2 Scouting Abortion Polyamory Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 The Catcher in the Rye Richard Feynman Unemployment The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Out-of-body experience Autism Breastfeeding The Amazing Race Cruising (maritime) She Loves You Anorexia nervosa God Emperor of Dune Capitalism Abortion debate 2000 Australian Grand Prix Garfield Rich Mullins Asperger syndrome Charmed Socrates Hikikomori Religious Society of Friends Doug Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kyle Broflovski IBM PC compatible Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Car handling Diving Fecal incontinence Migraine Futurama (TV series - season 2) Traumatic incident reduction Customs and etiquette of Japan Vladimir Peter Tytla Pitaten Surveillance Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Calvin and Hobbes Time Out of Mind Psychiatric hospital Narcissism Tire The Death Gate Cycle Grandview, U.S.A.
