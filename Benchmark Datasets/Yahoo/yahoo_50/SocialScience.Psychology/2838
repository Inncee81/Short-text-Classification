i want to know about gender and poilitics in india oh god i don't what a horrible thought especially for women their treatment of women is nothing short of barbaric it's time they moved into this century slaves are a thing of the past and most prostitutes get money for sex instead of a beating or whipping and they aren't kept in cages this was told to me by my dad who spent time there during world war two he said the palaces were lined with beggars the stench was indescribable as they use the streets as their washroom and he had to drink one gallon of water every day to both stay hydrated and toxin free his main point on this was that he at first felt sympathy for a country in such a state of crisis with a handful filthy rich and millions in poverty all living right next door to each other until he learned that they did not attempt to change their quality of life and refused to help each other i've observed this for years now and i agree with his statement that they've lived in chaos for years and continue to do so because they do not promote free thought and the result is an inability to learn from their mistakes those brave enough to escape fare much better outside of their beloved home country Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Amber Spyglass Sin City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Death Gate Cycle Knots Landing Miss Saigon Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Toilet Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Days of our Lives Vernon Schillinger One Tree Hill (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban About a Boy Friends Ex-gay Rape Muslim ibn Aqeel Incarnations of Immortality Washroom Hey Jude Mother Teresa The Catcher in the Rye Aztec U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Brave New World EastEnders Alcoholics Anonymous Characters in the Smurfs St. Elmo's Fire (film) Social rule Sauna The Smoking Room Socrates Terri Schiavo Louis XV of France Kyle Broflovski People's Republic of China History of sex W.I.T.C.H.
