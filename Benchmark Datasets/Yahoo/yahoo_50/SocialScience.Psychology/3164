i have a question about the human id that i'm having trouble with can you help me understand please for one thing the human id is prehistoric and what i don't understand is how humans can say there a civilized species sure humans channel there more agresive impulses into constructive ways of thinking like science but no matter how much the human race changes there still preditors when the first humans where described it was as hunters and gatherers the primary word being hunters preditors hunt to survive sure the struggle for survival has changed but the human id hasn't changed at all women still prefer the alpha male and males still have the need to mate with more than one female to spread the gene's magazines books movies and all other sorts of literature still premote this sort of thinking so how can mankind still claim to be civilized sorry for my miss spellings i'm dyslexic because civilized is a word we created to describe ourselves being civilized as i see it doesn't repress human nature it just channels it into different civilized things sure you can slap an objective definition onto the word civilized but there are a million subjective interpretations my point is it's in the eye of the beholder Human Culture Art The nature of God in Western theology Anarcho-primitivism A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Summa Theologiae Science Species Epistemology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Franz Boas Meaning of life Atheism Human nature Validity of human races Philosophy of language Logic Creationism Dyslexia Biblical inerrancy Discordianism Guns, Germs, and Steel Evolution God and gender Social constructionism The Origin of Species Metaphysics Scientific method Urantia Sociocultural evolution Aristotle Sexual selection Objectivist philosophy Origin belief Sociobiology Jewish principles of faith Intelligent design Determinism Deconstruction Biology and sexual orientation Postmodernism Gender-neutral language Color Supernatural Presuppositional apologetics Western philosophy Human evolution Extreme Programming Cultural relativism Fundamentalism Doomsday argument Asperger syndrome Lion Socrates Extinction Goodness and value theory Cognitive science Ontological argument Biodiversity Ethics Sexual orientation Mythology Economics Neolithic Revolution Existence of God Identity and change God Religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Moral objectivism Original sin Simone Weil History of evolutionary thought Frank Herbert Reality Community Gender Civilization Karen Horney Consciousness Free will God Emperor of Dune Bertrand Russell Sex Noah's Ark Abduction Phenomenon Neuro-linguistic programming Race Creation-evolution controversy RGB color model Justification (theology) G__del's incompleteness theorem Nonviolence Animism Therianthropy
