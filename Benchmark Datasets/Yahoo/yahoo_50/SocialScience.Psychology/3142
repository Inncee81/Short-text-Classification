advice on managing self hatred i'm in my early twenties and i'm beginning to realize i don't even know how to participate in life tonight i went to a party with some friends everyone else was having fun laughing and talking with each other but i couldn't get myself to talk to anyone again the hardest part was that everyone else had someone they were really close to best friend lover spouse etc and i began to realize i probably am not considered to be the friend of anyone i know i'm beginning to feel like i can't function in the real world and i'm hating myself more and more each time i go out with my friends because i feel incredibly inadequate and different from everyone else i'm really struggling to get through this on my own i don't think my friends would want to help me any advice it's not just this one group of people it's anyone if i don't know someone it's virtually impossible to get myself to talk to them if i do know someone i usually don't know what to say or do my knowledge of modern society is virtually non existent so i can't even handle conventional small talk i have read your additional information alone in a crowd not an uncommon feeling for all of us at some time or other not everyone is a social butterfly so quit beating yourself up over that what you need to do is find some conversational starters if i am feeling the odd person out at a party i usually look for someone that is feeling equally awkward and go over to them you can start the conversation with how awkward parties are and then the two of you can complain about that for a while ask the other person what they do that always sparks a bit of conversation listen carefully and ask some questions about their work you might add some information about yourself at any point when it seems that you have something in common in barbara walters wrote a book called how to talk to anyone about practically anything you might look for that book in the library or used book stores that book sold very very well but the main part of the information was to ask questions of people people like to talk about themselves and interestingly enough the people that listen the best are the most popular Social rule Religious Society of Friends Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show The Emancipation of Mimi Fight Club Ron and Fez Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct CPU cache Mach kernel Polyamory Human sexual behavior Science Earth Girl Arjuna Infantilism Requirements analysis Stuttering ITunes Timpani Philosophy of language Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Opie and Anthony The Catcher in the Rye The Marshall Mathers LP Craps Current teachings of Prem Rawat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Major League Baseball television contracts Recurring South Park characters EastEnders Finnish language Friedrich Schleiermacher Carlos Castaneda Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cliff Richard Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Plame affair Redundant array of independent disks Ty Cobb C.
