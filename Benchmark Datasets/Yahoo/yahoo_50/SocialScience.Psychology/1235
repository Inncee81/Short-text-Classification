question for positive thinking skeptics hi guys i'm looking for an article or an essay that criticizes the positive thinking movement but the internet is so inundated with this stuff that it is hard to find with a google search do any of you know where i should look i'm looking on the grounds that it is dismissive of all the negatives in the world that suffering is a part of human existance that it is self serving helps you get what you want and that it is an easy water down version of real mind discipline philosophies like buddhism for example which does not require you to be constantly positive all the time also on the grounds that it is just a drag to hang out with people who have such limitations on the things you can talk about anyway the reason i'm asking is that if i can't find an article or criticism like this i'm going to write one myself help oh and please don't respond saying you are a positive thinking person and i'm wrong that wasn't the question maybe if you look at sites that contest teh movie or book the secret i would think not everybody thinks about that idea so maybe looking for criticisms of the secret or related links through the secret web page Theory of conduct Falsifiability David Hume Atheism Theodicy Philosophy of language Epistemology Cyberspace Peter Singer Philosophical skepticism Carlos Castaneda Intelligent design Philosophy of mathematics Supernatural Urantia Time Out of Mind Buddhism Ethics Philosophy The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Immanuel Kant Philosophy of science Presuppositional apologetics Arthur Schopenhauer Idealism Criticism of libertarianism Scientific method Ontological argument Bernard Williams Deconstruction William A.
