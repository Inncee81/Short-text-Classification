does a person's physical appearance affect the person they are on the inside i know they say that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and i agree with that but might a person's apperance affect who they become personality wise and even thought process wise there is always the nature vs nutrue argument and obviously we weren't just born to be the people we are today the world around us molded us to be who we are to some extent if i person who is very nice and has a positive attitude in life and happens to be very attractive do you think they might be a different person if they were unattractive how difference could their appearance make them i wonder if perhaps i had been more pretty or ugly or fat or thin if i would be a different person today and weather i would be happier or less happy or not its hard to tell if i have the attitude about the person i see in the mirror because my brain was always wired to tell me that that girl is unnattractive or if my attitude about myself is a result of my actual unattractivness and my brain see's that eh this is a very interesting topic my thoughts are that who we are on the inside i e our personality and character is a combination of nature and nurture although you would be a somewhat different person in terms of personality depending on your looks as well as intellect for that matter how you allow your looks brain etc to effect your personality and character is what truly defines you Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness Nature versus nurture Social psychology Dualism (philosophy of mind) Goodness and value theory Asperger syndrome Friedrich Schleiermacher Color Narcissism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Social justice Abortion debate Infantilism Friends The nature of God in Western theology Happiness Borderline personality disorder Meaning of life Atheism Consciousness Human nature Prostate cancer Mental illness Sexual attraction Puberty Psychosis Love Current teachings of Prem Rawat Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Clinical depression Microeconomics Explosive material Francis Crick Stuttering Socrates Economic inequality Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Divine Providence Intelligence (trait) Supply and demand Wealth Bomberman Psychology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scientific method Sexual orientation Political correctness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gender role Cognitive science Plastic Cerebral palsy Hypoglycemia Patent Traumatic brain injury Urantia Appeal Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Free will Agnosticism Coercion Reality Schizophrenia Casting Nerd Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intellectual property Evil Spark plug Cyberspace Sexual differentiation Joke Wood Intelligence quotient Derek Parfit Social constructionism Magical thinking Unidentified flying object Empathy Utilitarianism Polyamory Person Woman Philosophy Child sexuality Transsexuality Objectivist philosophy Stroke Pedophilia W.
