this thought makes me crazy i was in my gifted class a few years back when i was in grade and we had this discussion with our teacher about whether everything was actually just a big dream or not maybe youre actually in a nut house and because of all this that your mind is creating thats why youre in here none of us are real just in your mind does that make anyone else get all antsy and scared and does our brain even have the power to falsely create something so vast as everything we've learned and know and see etc etc really this should only happen to those who have some unhappiness in their life or maybe depression for example if you asked to this a self confident rich and happy person of course their going to say this is all real but to a person who's life is horrible unfair their wishing it to be false just a dream and to make it a fact they believe it as in the quote believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact now switch it so that it's saying believe that life is a dream and your belief will help create fact so then those who want it be like a dream believes in it causing the believe to make a false fact personally i've ask this to my friend and she said it's real my prediction was also true that she'll answer real why this is because often she's popular and very happy with a chance to teach others to play soccer and she's the star of her team why wouldn't she be happy with it for me a depressed child with nothing but a home and a family and maybe or good friends i've got nothing else i am fat and short i am not very smart everything's not and thus i always wished it was a dream and because i've done that so much it's starting to eat into the belief and become a false fact cherryie personal opinion about other answerers chips i agree we already started life why quit now don't think so much about it and everything will be easy if we keep being this way all antsy and scared all we're going to end up is sitting next to a computer without a job just being an useless person and if our thought about it all being a dream is false we can't go back we already decide to stop our future i rather not take such a chance and just keep living Avenue Q Knots Landing The Catcher in the Rye Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Epistemology Soul Kodocha Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Philosophical skepticism W.I.T.C.H.
