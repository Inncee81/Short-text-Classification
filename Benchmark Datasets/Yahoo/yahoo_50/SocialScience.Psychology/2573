have you met people who will blame anyone or anything else but refuse to see their own fault so it doesn't necessarily mean they were completely and solely responsible for what went wrong but they act as if everyone and everything else was so wrong but they had done nothing wrong they will blame and excuse and give you stories but will not take responsibility for their action and or their share in the responsibility if it's not too much why do you think this is why do they behave this way what triggers or triggered this characteristic or personality trait i think it's your fault everybody is like that to a greater or lessor extent the perspective of being outside allows us to see it in others much easier than it is to perceive it in ourselves you have to conciously work at it in today's society because people encourage such externalizing they do it both overtly with messages like the environment is purely to blame for a person's actions they do it subvertly with gun control which is blaming the gun for the actions of the user when you boil it down to it's real usage and by excluding people from the death penalty because of insanity or lack of mental resources every day you see an example of people be exhonorated for their behavior because of this or that this tends to re enforce the already natural tendency to stamp your feet and blame others for all wrong in your life notice how you asked about others doing it that in itself means you feel you do not yet being a human being odds are very good you do just that i'm not exempt either even making concious efforts to take full responsibility for my actions i easily fall prey to the easy way out to blame circumstance and the actions of others for any shortcomings or failures i might have so really it's not some people it's all people the big variance is more on how often and how severe rather than whether people do it Microeconomics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rape Nicomachean Ethics Insanity defense Capitalism Evil Abortion debate Theodicy Asperger syndrome Social psychology Object-oriented programming Intelligence quotient Extreme Programming Divorce Utilitarianism Negligence Determinism Human nature Unemployment Alcoholics Anonymous Psychosis Autism rights movement Internet troll Procrastination Contract Fathers' rights Value system Free will A Course In Miracles Libertarianism Drug abuse Trademark Liberalism Visual Basic Human sexual behavior Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Gun politics Friedrich Schleiermacher Motivation Guns, Germs, and Steel Gender role Consensus decision-making Embedded system Feminism Mouse (computing) Falsifiability Karen Horney Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Anorexia nervosa Justification (theology) Anti-globalization Autism Human Leasing Capital punishment Strategic management Serial killer Friends Homosexuality and transgender Antisocial personality disorder Morality British monarchy Objectivist philosophy Anger management Gestalt therapy Sin Cult Person Cultural relativism Anarchism in Spain Pedophilia Meaning of life Leadership XML Controversies in autism Social rule Homosexuality Salary cap Mental Health Act 1983 Religion Surveillance Reputation management
