is it true that we are in control of our own feelings and if we feel hurt by someone else's actions it is our fault for feeling the hurt and not theirs how can we make concious decisions not to react to someone else's actions well now that's a question that can be answered by both psychology and neurobiology but let's stick to the simple side of things emotions are complicated and are dictated by all sorts of forces both internal and external meaning that some emotions can be altered by whatever substances you put into your body for example if you drink coffee you might have an elevated mood caused by the caffeine if you take antidepressants you might experience euphoria where you did not before your emotions originate in the limbic system of your brain and are quite dependent upon your brain chemistry thus substances like caffeine and alchohol and antidepressants alter that chemistry and play on your emotions so from that regard you do have control over your emotions to another extent you have no control at all meaning that if your cat dies you cannot help but feel sadness and greif no matter what types of substances you use to avoid feeling that way the only real thing you have control over then is how you exhibit your emotions and what types of actions you take because of them your behavior is really what you have control over not necessarily the emotions themselves for example if someone makes you mad with a derogatory comment you can choose how to react to that comment with either a fight or flight response coupled with your response you might think of the consequences of your action before choosing a response emotions are what allow us to navigate our way in the world and secure our place in it they're sort of like the whiskers on a cat allowing us to navigate new space unfamiliar territory and others who live in the world with us and though they are quite complicated without them we would flounder around on auto pilot not really having a true understanding of where we're going Antidepressant Addiction Consciousness Drug addiction Brain Clinical depression Emotion Breastfeeding Bipolar disorder Dualism (philosophy of mind) Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Internet troll Narcissism Motivation Theory of conduct Post-traumatic stress disorder Hypoglycemia Atomism Empathy Karen Horney Mind control Word of Wisdom Cognitive science Borderline personality disorder Sleep Infantilism Caffeine Social psychology The nature of God in Western theology Methamphetamine Happiness Epistemology Human sexual behavior Occam's Razor Autism Mental illness Object-oriented programming A Course In Miracles Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Obsessive-compulsive disorder Human Alcoholics Anonymous Abortion debate Theodicy Transactional analysis Soul Drug abuse Sexual orientation Divorce Alcoholism Ethics Meditation Religion Traumatic brain injury Simone Weil Rat Park Anger management Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chemistry Stroke Determinism Chlorpromazine Deconstruction Fecal incontinence Withdrawal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pain Stress (medicine) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Domestic violence Psychosis Human nature Microeconomics Philosophy of mind Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Urinary incontinence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Antisocial personality disorder Bernard Williams Social rule Friedrich Schleiermacher Vomiting Transsexuality Free will Cultural relativism Expert system Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Hypnosis Adult attention-deficit disorder Diazepam
