how would you defend yourself against a rapist unless you are used to fending off attacks and are alert and expecting to be assaulted it is rare that anyone reacts with any presence of mind so for practical purposes one should formulate plans for ones own defense keeping in mind and working with the instincts that kick in when one is consumed by fear i would think that if you can shitting yourself would be a great deterrent or if you'd rather inflict some lasting damage possibly retaining a gooey skewered orb as a trophy of your survival lace your keys through your fingers and apply them with vigorous enthusiasm to your assailants eyes or even if they have their hand over your mouth bite a finger off or bend and break it backwards if they don't have a convenient hand across your face then draw them in and then bite the mo'fos using the hugging technique that worked for mike tyson in his fight against evander holyfield and for me in my fights against my brothers you'll have to have the jaw locking mechanism of a pitbull or at the very least it's die hard determination even under the onslaught of the inevitable blows your assailant will inflict upon you under duress otherwise below are some of the results what i can remember of them of a survey done on rapists to determine what they look for and avoid in prospective victims they prefer the early morning hours am to am when hardly anyone's about they target women who are distracted on the phone or looking through their handbag they prefer women with ponytails because they are easier to manhandle as are women in skirts and dresses rather than jeans they avoid women who carry an object that can be used as a weapon eg an umbrella etc they are more likely to rethink you as a target if once you detect them following you you look them in the face and engage them in some kind of conversation eg ask for the time etc because you would be able to identify them in a lineup or from mugshots later they are slightly less likely to attack with a weapon because of the severe differences in sentences passed for rape and for rape where a weapon was used in the perpetration of the crime if you find yourself in prison then you are literally f k'd abandon all hope Rape Evander Holyfield Boxing Domestic violence Aikido Combine (Half-Life 2) Mike Tyson Human sexual behavior Professional wrestling holds Volleyball Corporal punishment Blood (computer game) Social rule Martial art John Lott Professional wrestling throws StarCraft: Uprising Continuation War Torture Terrorism Jujutsu Spanking Tenshinhan Sydney gang rapes, 2000, 2002 Capital punishment Trench warfare Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Fast bowling Tai Chi Chuan Beltway sniper attacks Resident Evil (video game) Force powers Nuclear warfare USS Tunny (SS-282) Unreal Mutual assured destruction Spider Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Fencing Breastfeeding Textile manufacturing Naval mine Knife Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Nuclear weapon Skateboarding trick Violin Internal ballistics Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Gun politics Siege Peleliu Columbine High School massacre Mixed martial arts Battle of Jutland Theory of conduct Surveillance Karla Homolka Lightsaber combat Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Second language acquisition Jaws (film) Tribes 2 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Electroshock gun World War II Oral sex Coercion Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Third Battle of Panipat Battle of Berlin Beslan school hostage crisis YuYu Hakusho Harmonica Hearing impairment Sling (weapon) Battle of the Bulge Japanese tea ceremony EastEnders Professional wrestling match types Defense (justification) Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Yom Kippur War Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Attack on Pearl Harbor Eastern Front (World War II) Protoss War of the Austrian Succession Guilty Gear Salute
