be honest how self aware do you think you are it seems to me that most people are not very introspective or willing to be honest with themselves i guess because to look at ourselves and acknowledge the bad as well as the good can be very painful in my experience most people are quick to point blame at others and really don't seem to know themselves very well what do you think on a scale of how self aware would you say you are why do you feel this way and do you think more people should make an effort to perform self analysis why or why not i haven't always been self aware i used to be one of those ppl that just pointed out others faults but then one day it kinda just hit me i realized that i'm not perfect and i should judge myself more than others then i started beating down on myself and struggling with low self esteem i would always point out something that was wrong with myself now i'm finally at the point where i realize the good and bad about myself accept it and try to work on the bad ppl should make an effort to perform self analysis to be aware of how they are this way they wont judge others so much and they'll accept themselves because they're being honest with themselves Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Utilitarianism Transactional analysis Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Sigmund Freud Social rule Rich Mullins Behaviorism S__ren Kierkegaard Honesty Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Equine conformation Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sydney Riot of 1879 The Apprentice 2 Alignment (role-playing games) Alcoholics Anonymous Adoption Hip hop rivalries Ethics Autism rights movement Ontological argument Milton H.
