is this normal i need real answers when i was little i was realy scared of bugs because everone told me they were everywhere like on your body ext well ever since if i focused my eye on something i could see them moving like one time i was at a football game and i saw all kinds of bugs were i was sitting and i had to stand up because it kinda scared me and when i was me and my cousin were playing football and he takled me and his teeth went into my head and everytime when it would scab over i would pick it off now i'm and i still pick it is there something wrong well i dont really want to write a long answer because i just want to say what i wanna say my mom used to be a paramedic so she knows everything about medical stuff she said that if a scab is still there then that means its either most likely to become a serious scar or that your body is just used to that cut being there for so many years and your imune system might not to its best to heal it hoped i helped and if u need anything else just email me by clicking on my profile oh and she said dont worry about it just try and do your best not to pick it so that it can heal and if it starts to hurt real badly seek help from a docter when u getta chance Shaggy dog story The Inside Muslim ibn Aqeel RuneScape cheats Scarification Social rule Rich Mullins Characters of Naruto Smallpox Milton H.
