is it enough feel bad about past transgressions even if you can't apologize for them directly like for example maybe you picked on someone in school because they were different now years has gone by you have no way of knowing where they are or if they would even care to hear an apology at this point enough for whom i mean it's a sign that you've grown more mature and become kinder since then but it's not going to do anything for them obviously unless you tell them although i still feel resentful toward the people who made my life a living hell in middle school years ago it would be terribly embarrassing to have one of them apologize now i'd rather just forget about it Pitaten Reparations for slavery Babe Ruth Ranma __ characters Past teachings of Prem Rawat Scenes from a Memory Eastern Orthodox Church Avenue Q Phaedo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
