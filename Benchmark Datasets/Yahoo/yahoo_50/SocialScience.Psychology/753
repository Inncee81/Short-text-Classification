i really want to know i know that not a lot of people believe in people can see the future thing and i don't believe in it strongly either however this past week has been odd i mean i've had a lot of deja vu before but this past week i've had a lot more deja vu in addition to me being able to predict almost anything that anyone is going to say i'd be watching a tv show and i'd be able to come up with that person was going to say before the person actually says it and in addition to that i've recently found that i am very good at lucid dreaming for those of you that don't know lucid dreaming is when you are lightly dreaming and you literally make decisions throughout the dream so you pretty much affect the outcome of the dream so is something weird happening do i just have a really active mind well not just the tv anyone even if it's a complete and utter stranger i can probably predict what they were going to say both it's truly an active mind however 'wierd' is a relative term some of us have gone through most of our lives with these types of things something 'wierd' to us might be if life and people weren't so damn predictable or if we dreamed and found we were really not in control and could actually let our sub conscious teach us a few things that we might want to learn about ourselves Lucid dreaming Predestination Dream Free will Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Theory of conduct Grammatical tense Milton H.
