is there is a balance between emotion and pride pride cant be beat and that is that but hmm let me see how i can say this i am a closed person i dont let ppl in but recently i've been letting these hidden emotions slip out and i can feel it all of the built up rage and sadness will explode from me anytime now after it happens i'm scared i'll be more vulnerable than ever before i dont ever want to feel vulnerable to my emotions i want to be my own able to stand up for myself with confidence in myself something i dont have but i dont want to get to carried away with pride where i become a b ch can you help me understand how to make myself invulnerable but confident i understand for me i always think before i say something to someone such as standing up for myself and then i relize hey if i dont do this now then people are just going to walk all over me in situations dont be affraid to tel someone off or speak how you feel because you opinion does matter and if your affraid to let things out i doubt you will end up getting carried away and start being a bitchh just think before you do something or say something and then think about the reaction i dont know if this helps but its what i do and it helps for the most time Ranma __ characters Social rule Narcissism Montgomery Burns Martial art Darth Vader Happiness Asperger syndrome Borderline personality disorder Emotion Time Out of Mind Sydney Riot of 1879 Tag Self-esteem God Emperor of Dune Social psychology Polyamory Dualism (philosophy of mind) Drama Scenes from a Memory Gottfried Leibniz Sexual orientation Autism Boxing Consensus decision-making Post-traumatic stress disorder Past teachings of Prem Rawat Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Homophobia Dog training Aphasia Domestic violence Dragon Booster The Contender (television series) Clinical depression Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tank Traumatic incident reduction Aerial (dance move) Transactional analysis Bhajan Mixed martial arts Epistemology Atomic Kitten Milton H.
