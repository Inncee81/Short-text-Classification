a two person fight breaks out on school grounds among a crowd of students the crowd could easily subdue the combatants but the tendency is to spectate why do ppl selfishly consider that this is for their amusement when there is strong possibility that one or both combatants could endure bodily harm injuries that could scar them for life or worse if we saw two dogs fighting most of us i think you would agree would immediately try to stop it if anything i would think we'd show more compassion for the humans what's up w that i'm not comfortable w the don't get involved because you might get hurt combatants anger focus is generally pct on ea other sure you could get hit w a stray punch but this is very remote plus if the overall mentality of the crowd was where it should be there would be multiple ppl acting together to break it up it usually only takes one person to intervene and most often times others follow lol hahaha it's amusement for the most but it's not anybody's business or quarrel of the two kombatants many don't get involved bekause that's not our pla e and we more and likely don't want any problems arising or es alading than they already are but that's true i agree many just don't want to be apart of the situation many believe that a kombatant should fight their own battles but through it all it just makes you stronger i mean in any ir umstan es or quarrel a person should always stand their ground regardless but that's true and i agree just give the shots and upperkuts your best bekause they may not or may be your last Sub-Zero Mixed martial arts Tenshinhan Noob Saibot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Lin Kuei Shang Tsung Alignment (role-playing games) Anger management Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Sydney Riot of 1879 Alcoholics Anonymous Soul Maison Ikkoku Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Martial art Lightsaber combat Sin City Spanking Bodyline Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) A Course In Miracles The Death Gate Cycle Value system Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Oasis (band) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Theodicy Evil Mortal Kombat: Deception Blood (computer game) One Tree Hill (TV series) Goodness and value theory English cricket team Self-harm Hatake Kakashi The Contender (television series) Shinn Asuka Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tai Chi Chuan Immortality Shao Kahn Tank Diving Winter War Babe Ruth Professional wrestling match types Sesshomaru YuYu Hakusho Utilitarianism Vernon Schillinger Force powers Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Emotions (album) Limit Break Keynesian economics Vegeta 1957 World Series Sant Thakar Singh InuYasha (character) Actual bodily harm Torture Libertarian socialism Infantilism Violence in sports Stryker Slander and libel Boxing StarCraft: Uprising Deus Ex: Invisible War Yoga Sutras of Patanjali War of the Austrian Succession B__b The Amber Spyglass Twelve Swords of Power Duel Mortal Kombat II Team Fortress Classic Rayden Spidey Super Stories Protoss Scientology beliefs and practices BDSM Fathers' rights Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bubblegum Crisis Professor X Milton H.
