religion in general i ask this question in many forums so here goes again i have my own beliefs and i keep them to myself they are not extraordinary in the least however i often wonder why so many folks feel the need to go to such extremes one way or the other examples you are uber religious and you believe strongly in something why do you feel the need to go with gusto and attempt to force others to conform to your beliefs if you're christian and you think that is a sin won't god judge that sinner in the end who are you to judge them in this life and why how do you feel yourself qualified to deliver judgment if you are an atheist why do you feel it necessary to belittle the belief of others you have your beliefs you are secure in them why antagonize i'm not getting an answer to my question the question is why i know that we all want to share our belief but why do you do it whatever manner why the extremism on both sides is a result of escalation and counter escalation the olde tymey way of things has been on a decline since the enlightenment and the rise of science but more recently the conservative religious folk have felt like their version of the world the one they're comfortable with has been slipping away from them with the growing acceptance of things like the theory of evolution changing standards of morality growing rights for women and for minorities etc a growing acceptance of more tolerant and liberal kinds of religion among christian theologians and church goers during the th century unlike that of the old fire and brimstone version of traditional christianity also made the conservative religious types ill at ease back in the 's you had a kind surge in fundamentalist christian backlash against the liberalizing trend it really kicked off much earlier with the advent of fundamentalism but i won't get into that ever since then christians at least in america have been quietly mobilizing and gaining strength all this started coming to a head in the 's with things like the christian right that got reagan a fundie type christian into office and it continued to mushroom into things like the moral majority powerful televangelist wackos creation science everything culminating into bush jr the evangelical president and all the hard core uber christians today trying to rewrite the laws and turn this into a christian nation what we have today is the result of year movement which is part of an even older movement on the part of christian conservatives the backlash by atheists is just them waking up to the current situation the growing beast of fundamentalist type christianity has them freaked out so now they are tending to go a little overboard on the counter attack it's a long and complicated subject hence my long post the origins of this whole explosion are very long in the coming karen armstrong has a great book on the subject called the battle for god which deals with some of this in more detail you should check it out why because it's a power struggle it has to do with worldviews which people take very seriously it has to do with the passing of laws and decisions about how people are allowed to live their lives it has to do with some people's basic sense of security in knowing that the world is the way they want to believe it is admitting one's belief systems are not the way things are is very painful and scary for
