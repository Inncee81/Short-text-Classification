do all mother's do this she calls me her b i t c h daughter also the s word that refers to a woman that sleeps around i recently got a high paying job and she tells me i won't be able to keep my money and how to spend it one of my sisters she always brings up around me and tells me how she loves her so much and insinuates she loves her more than me then when i ask why she says can't i love my daughter ''you won't keep me away from her'' her and my father got divorced a couple years back and now she makes me feel guilty for seeing or speaking to him she also makes comments about my weight and does the opposite of encouraging me when im working towards a goal why do you think she does these things shash i already have done that and she blamed it on me and said her actions were my fault recently she also told me not to trust my own father which shocked me she was trying to portray him as bad saying maybe hes changed and to not trust him she does not want me sharing any of my life with him poor you parents certainly screw you up don't they your mother's obviously hurt from having your father leave and is lashing out at her nearest and dearest you and your sisters they probably all get some of this or something similar from her it's not just you it's not fair and she shouldn't act this way but it's her only method of keeping you all with her she can't control her own life but she can try to control yours as it's a form of security for her the comments about your weight stem from this same need she has of controlling you and keeping you in her 'camp' ignore them do you live with her if so maybe it's time to move out do it gently though don't be confrontational about it and try not to hurt her she's already damaged enough you say you have a good job with money so hopefully you can afford it and don't need her to support you what does your father say about it all or does he also play this game of trying to be the 'best' parent you just have to be strong don't play her games don't ask why she loves your sis more than you she doesn't she's just trying to undermine you and keep you under the thumb see your father if you want to you don't have to tell her if you see him you're a free agent and can see whoever you wish EastEnders Friends Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
