question for clincial psychology students i'd like to know how much time to yourself you have in graduate school at my undergraduate institution i saw clinical students burn out they stayed at work until midnight hardly ever slept didn't go home for holidays as one said i need a better reason than thanksgiving to go home and didn't seem too happy do you have time to read go to movies go out with friends on the weekends and weeknights do you ever get week long vacations spring break winter break summer break etc where you can take a break from work and maybe go to a beach do you have assigned readings and tasks during these breaks basically i want a happy healthy mix of work and fun there is no doubt that clinical programs are demanding you've got your core classes to attend research work to conduct classes to teach dissertations to defend outside readings to complete and material to constantly study it can be overwhelming however i did have time to have fun outside of school i moved to florida from michigan as a single woman so it was very important to me to develop friendships while i was there because i didn't have a built in support system to return home to each night after school work sometimes you literally have to schedule the time to spend with friends or family then stick to the schedule i usually take saturday off as my day to enjoy the sunshine watch movies go out to eat etc then on sunday i get back to work it takes some planning but it can be done Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor EastEnders MTV2 Avenue Q Daylight saving time University of Michigan Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Master's degree University of Central Florida One Tree Hill (TV series) National Football League Education in France University of Chicago Georgia Institute of Technology Pitaten Thanksgiving Carnegie Mellon University Columbia University Education Education in Australia American University Education in Germany Abigail Folger College Negima University of Pennsylvania Education in Romania Physician Garfield Education in the United States Nurse The Family from One End Street Homeschooling Tufts University Teachers (film) Hikikomori Ultimate (sport) Brown University Knots Landing GED Florida Institute of Technology Franz Boas Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Cornell University Medical school 2005 trial of Michael Jackson University of Minnesota Carnival The Ashlee Simpson Show Sabbath Napoleon Dynamite USS Taussig (DD-746) Air Education and Training Command Pennsylvania State University USS Yorktown (CV-10) Boston Public University of Maryland, College Park Psychology Blonde on Blonde USS Ammen (DD-527) Education in Finland The Adventures of Pete & Pete University of Virginia No Child Left Behind Act STS-59 Physical therapy CBC Television Monday Night Football James S.
