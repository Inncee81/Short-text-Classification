my dreams nightmares i have had nightmares for nearly years now they started a while after i returned from iraq in i know everyone claims ptsd when they have nightmares and bad memories but i don't know if that is what i am suffering from is it normal to have nightmares after seeing things like that or does having the nightmares mean i suffer from ptsd its not always the same sometimes its just sounds or just hazy images and i feel scared or like i know my buddy needs help but i can't get to him and no matter how bad he is hurt or even if i know hes dead i try to get to him but cannot sometimes its specific events and i swear every night i see them its like i see them more vividly then when it actually happened like they burnt into my mind and they just wont leave i had a dream once that i was ambushed and we tried to fend off the attack and right in the middle of the fight everything disappeared and i was in my living room crouched behind the sofa one time i had a dream of a firefight just past an nassiryia in iraq everything was exactly the same until a bus got hit with a tow missile and as i watched the bus explode and burn its was like i knew everyone from my whole life i knew was in there and they were all dying and i had no way of stopping it i couldn't even move to protect them from the hit i've only had this dream once but it woke me up from a dead sleep and i didn't sleep for nearly days i need to know how to make this stop its getting worse and its getting harder to close my eyes at night because i sometimes tremble at the thought of what i might see when i fall asleep i need help what do i do and what does that dream mean first i don't think you would be normal if you weren't affected in some way by an experience like going to iraq it's natural to have an emotional response to a highly stressful situation and it doesn't get much more stressful than war as a human being it's bound to affect you seconly don't worry about being diagnosed with a disorder putting a name to your symptoms doesn't make them any worse but it could make them better if it helps you learn how to handle them it surely sounds like ptsd you had a traumatic experience you have lingering anxiety from that experience and it is negatively impacting your health mental and probably physical if you don't think your tour of duty was traumatic enough to trigger a post traumatic condition it could be something else but whatever it is it warrants attention again don't be afraid of any particular diagnosis you have to figure out what it is before you can fix it that being said regardless of what the diagnosis is don't keep suffering get help there's absolutely no shame in it and there are people who can help if you have military veterans' coverage start there otherwise look for a reputable counselor psychologist or psychiatrist in your area if the first one can't help you he she will refer you to someone who can and if they don't then try somebody else it may take a little time to see improvement once you find the right person and the right treatment but you will also talk to other vets about your situation you'd be surprised at the number of people who will tell you they have similar circumstances once you ask them if you don't keep in touch with folks from your tour look for online communities finally i have to say thank you for serving and best of luck in getting through this Clinical depression Anxiety Obsessive-compulsive disorder Hypnosis Refugee Mental illness Traumatic brain injury Procrastination Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Autism Milton H.
