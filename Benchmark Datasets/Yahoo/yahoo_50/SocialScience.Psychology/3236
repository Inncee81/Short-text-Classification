a beautiful mind people tell other they are beautiful all the time whether it be comments online or in person or cards letters everyday speech but what does it truly mean to be beautiful just a polite way to say thats hott or sexy or is it truly beautiful the word beautiful has lost its meaning in todays world i think but why why let such a meaningful word loss its power i guess its like the teens these days and how they throw the term i love you around am i the only one that feels like these words are powerful and todays youth doesn't realize how they're using them affects others insightful answers please no stupid ones and its a lot of questions i realize that i feel that as current society encourages more political correctness and such the term 'beauty' arose to a wider prevalence these days however the terms 'hot' and 'sexy' are used more frequently to describe physical attractiveness it is probably due to shying from such a strong word as beautiful or an effort to appear fashionable and trendy because the truth is terms like 'hot' are becoming used much more frequently either way i feel 'beautiful' is more accurately used in describing the 'whole package' of people by classifying both external and internal features that would also take time and finally i do not see much wrong with throwing around terms like 'i love you ' this world does need to lighten up and be more comfortable around each other social views should be perspicacious Love Social rule Indian English Theory of conduct Autism A Course In Miracles Political correctness Sexual attraction Deconstruction Pedophilia Simone Weil Western philosophy Physics Time Out of Mind The nature of God in Western theology Alignment (role-playing games) Transsexuality Friedrich Schleiermacher Psychosis Jon Secada Extreme Programming Internet troll Charles Darwin's views on religion Philosophy Heterosexuality Asperger syndrome Child sexuality Objectivist philosophy Economics Sex and the City Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supernatural Password Franz Boas Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Homophobia Goodness and value theory Gay Hiberno-English Current teachings of Prem Rawat Irony Microeconomics Emo Wheel of Fortune Friends Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Atheism Anthroposophy S__ren Kierkegaard Homosexuality LiveJournal Black (people) Generation X Mathematics Postmodernism Confucianism Taiwanese (linguistics) Infantilism Reality Aesthetic Realism Therianthropy Meaning of life Shit Scientology beliefs and practices Discordianism Nineteen Eighty-Four Transgender Non-native pronunciations of English Jeopardy!
