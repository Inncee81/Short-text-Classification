people who keep lying why is it that some people keep lying even when you've caught them in a lie even when you are trying to be a friend to them i think there are quite a number of people who are sort of psychopathic by that i mean that they are incapable of relating to other people in a rational and fair way some are compulsive liars others are entirely self serving or emotionally manipulative or violent or never learn to be mature or they manifest any of many other mental or emotional disturbances nobody is precisely normal as far as i can see but i try to stay away from the ones who are destructive towards me or who are too destructive towards themselves most of the people i have learned to avoid seem to act as though other people are not real as though we are just objects to be used to satisfy their desires in short they seem to be unable to understand the golden rule do unto others it sounds to me like i would be avoiding your friend in my view he is treating you like have no value of your own only value as far as you can be used to satisfy himself you are virtually an object to him in his world and so he has no need to be honest or respectful towards you good luck Lie Alignment (role-playing games) Theory of conduct Alcoholics Anonymous Asperger syndrome Iago Narcissism Goodness and value theory Antisocial personality disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Friedrich Schleiermacher Animism Vulcan (Star Trek) Human Empathy Law of value Carl Jung Scientology beliefs and practices Sin City Advertising Stoicism Logic Mental illness Supernatural Borderline personality disorder Serial killer Karen Horney Happiness Traumatic incident reduction Infantilism Transactional analysis Immanuel Kant Aesthetic Realism Naruto jutsu Out-of-body experience Victor Cousin Homophobia Post-traumatic stress disorder Social psychology Motivation Anxiety Zoophilia Child sexual abuse Social rule Second language acquisition Object-oriented programming Dualism (philosophy of mind) T'Pol Sigmund Freud Spanking Natural deduction Cognitive science Mind Luck Defence mechanism Fair Game (Scientology) Merit Gestalt therapy Storytelling Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hulk (comics) Force (Star Wars) Drug abuse Ethics Axiomatic set theory Appeasement John Howard Yoder Evil Objectivist philosophy Grief Function (mathematics) Ulic Qel-Droma Aikido Mathematics of general relativity Drug addiction Epistemology Rudolf Hermann Lotze Simone Weil Statutory rape Polyamory Summa Theologiae Arthur Schopenhauer Learning disability Religion Mojave people Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Paranoia Agent Dyslexia Masturbation Psychology of religion Bernard Williams Psychotherapy Art Intellectual property Sexual orientation Nicomachean Ethics Reality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Clinical depression
