help me transform my life what do i do now let's see where to start my supervisor at work regularly reminds me that i never smile and need to i feel irritated by every word that comes out of my parents' mouths i am disappointed in my two best friends i recently went on vacation and felt like my entire extended family was giving me the cold shoulder i thought vacation would be the perfect opportunity for me to jump into the sociable center of attention persona i have envisioned however i did not fulfill this fantasy i don't feel like people notice me or else they are deliberately staying away from me because i scare them off i am daily buffeted by a torment of sexual desires that feel empty and fruitless because i am unable to share them with a girl i love i feel lust for many not love for an individual i am not happy with how i communicate myself to other people i get bored at work from not having enough to do i feel like i need to get to know more people on a personal le level but nothing in my life seems to be able to provide this gateway i'm temperamental i have bad mood swings i seek the genuine in life i am very philosophical my faith is weak how can i transform my life i don't feel pressured by anyone at all the only pressure i have at the moment is to decide what college to go to and that's hardly even important to me mainly it's like i have an idea of who i want to be ingrained in my mind and i want other people to glorify this person too for about half a year i've been going to the gym trying to perfect my physical appearance while becoming an amazing athlete i want to force attention upon myself and i will do whatever it takes but what does it take for me you're an introvert and possibly a loner this is not a crime it's your personality introverts and loners are some of the most maligned people in the world and for no good reason are you disturbed because you're not happy with the way you are or are you disturbed because you fear you are not living up to other people's expectations of the way they think you should be if your problem is the latter my best advice is to get over it hanging your self worth on other's people's expectations of you is a lousy way to go through life people are going to smack at you like a pinata all your life especially if they think they have power of you i doubt your problem is the former we live in a society that is obsessed with the mob we live and die by what other people think of us you seem more introspective and frankly it may be that the people around you simply bore you you prefer your own company to that of others people hassle you for it and you feel like something is wrong with you maybe i'm off the mark here but this is just the feeling i'm getting what to do about it well one thing you may want to do is go to amazon and look for a book called the loner's manifesto read it if you recognize yourself you'll probably find your answer as to the lust and sexual desires you feel for others all i can say is welcome to the human race you are very much in the mainstream there Carl Jung Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator A Course In Miracles Social rule Nicomachean Ethics Simone Weil Evil Asperger syndrome Love Avenue Q Alcoholics Anonymous Sexual orientation Past teachings of Prem Rawat Transactional analysis Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Amber Spyglass Meaning of life Hulk (comics) David Hume Infantilism S__ren Kierkegaard Iago Milton H.
