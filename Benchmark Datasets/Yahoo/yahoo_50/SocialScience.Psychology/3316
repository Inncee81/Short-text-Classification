what are the constraints or pitfalls in problem solving to me there are three big problems the first is that most people do not follow the scientific method it exists for a reason because it is an unbiased universal means of exploring a problem some people neglect to follow it and therefore are a little overwhelmed when someone shows their conclusions could be incorrect the second problem is a failure to express things empirically however qualitative we might want to make our findings the only true universal language is mathematics so in order to bypass language barriers and the constraints of colloquial or temporal expression a problem solver has to remain empirical thirdly is bias way too many people have a predeveloped idea that they wish to see expressed some of the more outrageous ones can be found in the book the ig nobel prizes such as the one guy that claims water has memory the fact is that anyone can generate data to arrive at a predetermined conclusion the real factor as to whether or not your findings are valid is if they can be replicated particularly by those outside of your field if they can't be replicated then you may have just had a fluke or you may be having biased answers Scientific method Model (economics) Logic Halting problem Mathematics Falsifiability Complexity classes P and NP Francis Crick Philosophy of science Philosophy of mathematics Engineering Database Expert system G__del's incompleteness theorem Epistemology Second language acquisition Creationism Autism Psychology Numerical analysis Pseudoscience Causality Ontological argument Religion Parapsychology Determinism Supernatural John Lott Sudoku Skepticism Meme Case study Experiment Law of value Intelligent design John Wycliffe Problem of universals Dynamical system Exact solutions in general relativity Identical particles Fermi paradox Ordinary differential equation Social research Debugging Physics Peer review Philosophy of space and time Microeconomics Biblical inerrancy Inference Ontology (computer science) Social sciences Theory Linked list Probability Bertrand Russell XML Frame problem Historical materialism Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Objective-C Prices of production Deconstruction Transformation problem Principal-agent problem Many-worlds interpretation Axiom Joseph Louis Lagrange Universal pragmatics Induction (philosophy) Adjoint functors George Lakoff Crossword Object-oriented programming Sexual orientation Philosophy of language Postmodernism Mathematician Anthropic principle Where Mathematics Comes From Reality Infinity History of science Artificial neural network Willard Van Orman Quine Cognitive science Existence of God Mathematics of general relativity Creation science Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Surplus value Large numbers
