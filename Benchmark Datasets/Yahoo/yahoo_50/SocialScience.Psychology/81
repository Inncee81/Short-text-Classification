i don't know what this means i have been dating my boyfriend for over year and i've been working at my current job for months there's this guy here at my job that is single and kind of young my guess is about he's rather quiet and mostly keeps to himself but he's really cute when i first started work one of the other salesmen told me that he was single and that i should ask him out if i ever had the chance this was of course a joke recently like two weeks ago he asked how my boyfriend and i have been doing that kind of surprised me because he normally keeps conversations between us about work since then i've had a few dreams about him but nothing sexual he's just in them i don't know what to think i love my boyfriend a lot and i'm pretty sure this guy isn't interested in me what's going on you're curious not unusual you just found intrest in someone other than your boyfriend and don't know what to think about it if you love your boyfriend forget about the other guy if you are having serious thoughts about this new guy maybe it's time you moved on and broke up with your boyfriend maybe this new guy has a connection to you that your boyfriend doesn't either way you're crushing on him Friends Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Knots Landing Dead Like Me Avenue Q Megan Griffin The Wotch Undergrads Shaggy dog story Sex and the City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Smoking Room Scenes from a Memory Seinfeld Little Britain Will & Grace Neighbours One Tree Hill (TV series) Something Positive Pitaten Badly Drawn Kitties Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.
