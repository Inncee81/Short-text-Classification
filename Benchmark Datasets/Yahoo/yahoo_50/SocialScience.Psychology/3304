do life's hardships make you more optimistic or less do you think that all the stuff whether our own making or not life throws at us from time to time makes us more downtrodden less hopeful for the future or more optimistic explain why you answer the way you do please why do people insist on giving thumbs down so much just to let you know none of them are coming from me i appreciate all your replies comments keep em coming well your question would have a variety of answers you would have to consider what exactly you feel is a hardship for me moving from one place to another every few years coz my dad gets transferred is a hardship coz i would have to make new friends it would take time for me to get used to the new city or country or the continent but for someone else their hardship would be to get over a break up or getting over the death of someone they loved for me the hardships have made me more optimistic i now feel that if i were to just get dumped anywhere in the world i'd still be alright i guess that means that hardships have made me optimistic for someone else who has faced very freakish things like divorce or death or something throwing more things like that is barely going to make them feel good about it it might not even give thema chance to recover i also feel that it depends on how strong the person is someone who is incredibly mentally strong would be quite alright with some hardships getting in their way they'd take life as it came to them and stuff on the contrary if a weak person is faced with the same problems i doubt they would welcome those hardships the way a strong person would there are some people who love having problems and solvin them there are others who think of suicide the minute some prblem comes up so it basically depends on the person in question and their mindset what do you think Social rule Goodness and value theory Jon Secada Coming of Age (TNG episode) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Transsexuality Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga The nature of God in Western theology Kurt Cobain Grief Jack London Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theodicy German grammar The Time Machine Religion About a Boy Friends Sharon Tate Incarnations of Immortality Sin City Pitaten Optimism Hey Jude Grandview, U.S.A.
