are you a good person or a bad person most people before me seem to think that they know they are bad or good but it is impossible to know for sure in most case most of us going thru life unchallenged because we are lucky to born in a rich country so we think we are good when we stop at a red light and hand out a few dollars to a beggar or help an old pedestrian cross the street those thing are quite small because it doesn't require personal sacrificed what if you are born in a poor country you have a small piece of bread you are very hungry do you willing to share it with your equally hungry neighbor if you are in battle a guy in your company that you don't like is wounded do you rush out there to pull him into safety and put yourself at risk or do you just hide behind the wall and hope someone else would do the dirty work for you for most of us we are never going to know if we are good or bad until something drastic happen to us however according to my personal experience most people are selfish good people are hard to come by that's why we call them hero the rest of us are pretty much for ourself and only help when there are no risk involve Altruism Luck Theory of conduct Justification (theology) Poker jargon Chess strategy and tactics Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clint Eastwood Social rule Capitalism Kimi Finster Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Monetary policy Traffic Equine conformation American Psycho Sant Thakar Singh Time Out of Mind Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Transactional analysis Singlish 2000 Australian Grand Prix Saints and Soldiers Humphrey Bogart Pok__mon Live!
