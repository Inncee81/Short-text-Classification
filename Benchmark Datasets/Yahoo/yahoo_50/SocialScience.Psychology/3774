what do you do when your fairy tale and fantasy is no longer there and that person is just now physical i have a friend in which i was intimate with for a long time i just woke from the sleep of denial that this person will never feeling anything for me i feel that my safe and wonderful place that i found with this person is no longer avaliable to me because all my mind tells me it is pointless why should i make the effort of being friends or apart of this person if you were to leave and become a ghost it really wouldn't make a difference because he would never put the effort to reach out for you substance you lack 'substance' in your relationship you are not alone you put all of your heart and soul into a relationship hoping to receive the same back and didn't it's time to move on you don't need to realize that this is as much as you'll get out of this relationship some others aren't there yet so take your time because you don't need to move fast and go at a pace which is familiar to you work your way out of this relationship and search for the person who will make you 'whole ' that is my advice which i took myself i am not an expert but it worked well for me Ekadasi W.I.T.C.H.
