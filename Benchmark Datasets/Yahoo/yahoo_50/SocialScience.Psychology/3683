is it true that we dream every night but don't always remember lately i haven't had any dreams or i do but don't remember them so i was curious if we always dream maybe if something is triggered in our memory that's when we can remember it yes you dream during your rem cycles but its my understanding that its usually the last dream b you wake up that you actually remember not everyone does i hardly ever remember my dreams unless it was completely out of the usual or someone says something thats sparks it to pop back into my brain if you have a pen paper the moment you wake up you can jot down things you remember from the dream which may help trigger the entire dream Dream Lucid dreaming Rapid eye movement Sleep Out-of-body experience Narcolepsy Jon Secada The Shining (film) R.E.M.
