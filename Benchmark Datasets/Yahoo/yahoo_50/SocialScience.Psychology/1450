regret builds character i heard that in a movie i never understood it really until now what do you think about it should you forget your regrrets or remember them in the movie big kahuna bob replies you mean i have to do something i ll regret in order to have character whatever your regret is it is likely that your perception has changed your regret has probably grown through the years what you thought was okay before might have been due to being young and immature what you did years ago is no longer okay with you today i would take it even further by suggesting that the greater the regret the greater the character it can create the older we get the greater our regret becomes it becomes heavier to carry at the end of the day it is what we do with regret that creates real character character comes when we face the fact that we cannot change what we did when we realize that we cannot buy another chance when we come to understand that we cannot make things better again when we carry the truth that what was done cannot ever be changed the damage will always be done character means genuine remorse to live with that means character character also comes when you gain understanding for others who may have made poor decisions character is condemning an act but not necessarily the person who committed it if you have character you can and will extend sympathy to those who have remorse and most importantly if you have character you can forgive others A Course In Miracles Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sydney Riot of 1879 God Emperor of Dune Ontological argument Panay incident Free will Humphrey Bogart Alcoholics Anonymous Duties of the Heart Summa Theologiae Jiddu Krishnamurti Repentance Deconstruction Theodicy Sin Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Parsifal Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cultural relativism Gerund Eastern Orthodox Church Scenes from a Memory Capital accumulation Simone Weil Chinese character John Wycliffe Paranoia Agent Ten Commandments Doctor (Doctor Who) Philosophical skepticism Estoppel Jon Secada Divorce Sola fide The Jazz Singer Consensus decision-making Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Laura Schlessinger Contrition Columbine High School massacre Microeconomics Internet troll Meme Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gross domestic product Sub-Zero Divine grace Angel (vampire) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Supply and demand Cognitive dissonance Phaedo Michel Henry Shaggy dog story About a Boy Christian apologetics Merit Zhao Yun Franz Boas National Kidney Foundation Singapore Chapterhouse Dune Past teachings of Prem Rawat Irony I Ching Epistemology Fathers' rights Blonde on Blonde Court system of Canada U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Yusuf al-Qaradawi Social rule Battle of Jutland Surrender of Japan Homosexuality and Judaism Trademark Reality Eddie Guerrero Judas Iscariot Motion picture rating system Anselm of Canterbury Opus Dei Bernard Williams Abortion debate Meaning of life Book of Mormon Sun Drama Recurring South Park characters Berengar of Tours Immortality Infant baptism Wang Mang Nicomachean Ethics Victor Cousin Existence of God Mobile Fighter G Gundam
