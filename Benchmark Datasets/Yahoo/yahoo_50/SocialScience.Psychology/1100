what makes a person jealous and some people not jealous of anyone or anything like me for instance i dont get envious or feel jealous even if i do say so myself and some people that i know are void of any jealousy i mean if someone won a big house or holiday i would think to myself i wish that was me in a nice way but i do not hold any ill feelings toward the person because i didnt win and they did jealousy is a complex human emotion that usually stems from fear because fear is the root of emotions like anger and insecurity it may also be said that jealousy is caused by any of these emotions it is likely that all humans experience at least some degree of jealousy at some point in their lives it is so common because it arises as a natural response to a threat of some kind for instance if a female believes another female is more beautiful than herself she may likely become jealous this is because in terms of evolutionary reproductive science and behavior all females are in competition with one another as are all males recall darwinian 'survival of the fittest' and 'natural selection' theories the main goal of an individual of a species is to reproduce and propagate perpetuate the species' existence the individuals with the most desired traits will have their pick of mates those traits will be desired by opposite sex because whatever traits are 'desired' are representative of healthy 'successful' offspring thus likely to survive and reproduce thus propagate perpetuate the species so the female with the best reproductive traits characteristics i e hair breasts body etc will be wanted by all the males and the male with the best reproductive traits will be wanted by all the females these individuals thus have the 'pick of the litter' so to speak remember however that this 'want' and 'desire' is a reproductive urge and therefore sexually based and derived it has nothing to do with 'love' which is why individuals with desired traits can form relationships with individuals who lack those traits so jealousy is purely primitive and natural it is wholly human and so should not be looked down upon for we are all human the important thing to remember for those who become jealous is why they feel jealous once they realize the evolutionary and primitive reasons for their jealousy they are more likely to forgive the person whom they are jealous of and resolve the jealousy at a cerebral or conscious level though they may still feel jealous at a biological or reproductive level kudos to you for not experiencing this primitive competitive emotion don't worry if when you do however just remember you are human and all things shall pass Evolution Natural selection The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sexual selection Human Sexual attraction Artificial selection The Origin of Species Gender role Sigmund Freud Meme Reproduction Sociobiology Sexual orientation Dog Emotion Jealousy Eugenics Happiness Human sexual behavior Charles Darwin Biology and sexual orientation Sexual dimorphism History of evolutionary thought Meaning of life Biology Franz Boas Baldness Psychology of religion Patriotism Color Animal communication Objectivist philosophy Physical attractiveness Abortion debate Sadism and masochism Sociocultural evolution Polyamory Empathy Culture Heterosexuality Social psychology Gene Orgasm Anarcho-primitivism Reincarnation Supernatural Iago Gender Homophobia Evolutionary psychology Elves (Elfquest) Evolutionism Religion Man Evolution of sex Goodness and value theory Sexual differentiation Transgender Irreducible complexity Infantilism Rape Simone Weil Parthenogenesis Sexual intercourse Motivation Consciousness Ecological selection God Creationism Sexual reproduction Brain Free will Evolutionary creationism Art Transsexuality Penis envy Nicomachean Ethics Ethics Darwinism Competition Inception of Darwin's theory Mind Altruism Intelligence (trait) Asperger syndrome Anthropology Nature versus nurture Arthur Schopenhauer Psychology Asexuality Soul Macroevolution Domestic violence
