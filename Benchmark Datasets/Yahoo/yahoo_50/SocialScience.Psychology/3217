i feel kind of depressed kind of angry but at the same time amazing alright this is a continuation of the question i had about my younger cousin this weird feeling takes over me and i feel really cool really sure of myself but kind of dark depressed sad and angry at the same time but this feeling gives me a huge sense of satisfaction the spark of this feeling was caused when she wrote stay fly my first thought was thats something new and cool and i was jealous because i didn't think of it i feel this need to be cooler than her and i don't y but this feeling came up and i'm afraid i was a jerk but i'm positive that i wasn't atleast not to her some more detail on the emotion anyone who doesn't meet my expectations will usually get assualted by me verbally not like ur a bitch but like lol u think ur hip hop but remeber u used to live on a farm in a trailer and ur a redneck idk that was light but i'm afraid that i'm just going to go off on her or someone else around and just end being a d ck ah y is this happening to me i'll try to pin point the question emotion w confusing properties emotion is sparked by weird often mundane events the emo is only associated w her or ppl around her idk y this happens when i'm in this odd state of emotion it feels like i'm in a trance and i can point out exploit ppl's insecurity's short coming's or if their covering something up like a false persona i can read ppl very well when i'm like this hope that clears it up what Milton H.
