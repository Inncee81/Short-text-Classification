someone abused me and i do this normal or not i was abused badly by someone i looked up to and they never payed for what they did yet i wake up from nightmares and i feel an overwhelming anger inside for payback i go in the basement and bring large knives and hammers and smash things pretending its their head i have fantasies of killing them and since this issue has been ignored i feel like i want to take it into my own hands for payback what do i do do you have a really close friend that knows just about everything about you someone that you can confide these feelings in i think that i understand what you are feeling i have been there myself you hate this person for hurting you obviously and that hate is what makes you react but you are the one that carries the hate you are the one that loses time of life and happiness waiting for this person to get theirs i am not the most religious person but i do believe in god i can promise you this no one is a greater equalizer than god i have a personal relationship that maybe some people dont understand but between god and carma i think it is safe to say that you can go on and live your life that person will not skate free they never do you may not actually see what happens but usually it is in what is taken from them it isnt doing you any good to hang on to the experience i spent years doing that time doesnt change anything but time is opportunity for you to reason it out with yourself its a choice to be happy dont give that creep the satisfaction of allowing what they have done to make you miserable chances are that is exactly what would make them happy is to see you suffer if you show hate they will be glad i figure that who ever did this to you is more miserable than you are they dont like themself you wont either if you dont find some way to be living with positives then they win they have succeeded dont let them have your life W.I.T.C.H.
