how do i stop sabotaging myself and my relationships last year i totally screwed up my first year of university i did no work procrastinated and only opened my books and notes when it was time for exams i ended up with mostly b's when i know i could have gotten a's which is what i should be aiming for if i want to pursue professional schooling or graduate studies after my undergrad i also have a tendency to cause the eventual destruction of all my relationships friends familial and romantic initailly everything is fine and then i get paranoid and assume they're out to get me or hurt me and break it off with some lame excuse or accusations of how badly they were treating me i do this early on before they have a chance to hurt me b c i'm totally paranoid and afraid of getting hurt it would be safe to say i've built more walls than bridges the only people that stuck around were those who said we're not leaving you can push us away all you like how do i change when i don't even realize i'm doing it when i do it i actually start believing my own excuses and don't realize what i've done until much later you will never feel the wonders and magic of love until you expose yourself to the possibility of hurt an old story i like a skinny pimpled young man found himself with the opportunity to date and marry a stunningly beautiful young woman who could easily be a runway model in nyc or paris after a time however she divorced him a week or so after the breakup a friend of the young man came by his house and found him sobbing and in the depths of sorrow the friend asked was it worth it from his agony the young man looked up and said yes to have had her love was beyond my wildest imagination and this pain is simply the price i was willing to pay to have it if you are afraid of being injured you will never risk and will miss the sweetest parts of life nothing worth having comes to you without risk ever risk risk risk your question measures you to be a bright and articulate young woman find a man with equal qualities and open your heart Friends Jon Secada Kodocha Procrastination Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fathers' rights Sex and the City Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic violence Undergrads Hermione Granger Incarnations of Immortality Pitaten Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Maison Ikkoku The Good Soldier Sin City Chess (musical) EastEnders Eddie Guerrero Cliff Richard Knots Landing The Human Stain Blood on the Tracks Extreme Programming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Nine Inch Nails Mary Jane Watson Jam (TV series) Plame affair Boston Public American Psycho Jean Grey Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Rich Mullins Divorce Polyamory History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Douglas Adams One Life to Live Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jane Eyre Timpani Escape from New York John Lennon Liam Gallagher Love Hina main characters The Inside Eastern Orthodox Church Marilyn Monroe Grief Vegeta Saved by the Bell Transactional analysis Everwood Prostate cancer The Shining (film) Milton H.
