why does being rare make something valuable although it may be useless e g diamonds i asked a question a long time ago on ya about the reason for diamonds value rareity was the reason it appears so what makes rareity so valuable simple human competition for an object they desire it all has to do with human nature whenever something is admired a human being suddenly desires it for the praise or acceptance of others its something that has to do with culture and society nothing to do with need or use for example your diamond such is wanted because of its praise for beauty and rarity if one such object is obtained praise and envy ensues making the person with the diamond feel special and more important than others people ultimately want to feel special and better than the rest Goodness and value theory Diamond Sexual orientation Rudolf Hermann Lotze Transsexuality Ethics Abortion debate Utilitarianism William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham David Hume Wealth Guns, Germs, and Steel Free will Gender-neutral language Coercion Meaning of life Simone Weil Art Gemstone Reality The nature of God in Western theology Bernard Williams Property (ownership right) Human Mortification of the flesh Human sexual behavior Social psychology Supernatural Clothing Objectivist philosophy Supply and demand Diamond color Infantilism Love S__ren Kierkegaard Microeconomics Negligence Sesshomaru Buddhism Neolithic Revolution Theory of conduct Mojave people Arthur Cayley Current teachings of Prem Rawat Synthetic diamond Expert system Patriotism Mao (game) Jean-Jacques Rousseau Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Martial art K' Molecular nanotechnology Kitsch Economic inequality The World as Will and Representation Science Law of value Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Narcissism Karen Horney Yu-Gi-Oh!
