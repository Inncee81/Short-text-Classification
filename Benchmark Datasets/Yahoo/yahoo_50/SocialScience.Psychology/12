what should i do anxiety okay so i developed anxiety two years ago i am an extremely outgoing person and i have always been i am and i am overweight i weigh around lbs and i am only i dont no what to do because i am supposed to be going into grade and i just moved this was the reason why i got my anxiety in gtrade because i moved and i was sitting by myself at lunch for a while i am so terrified to go to school and school feels like it is coming sooner and that is making my anxiety worse now i dont just feel like crap when i get anxiety i cry alot i find it so stupid and i dont understand i am such an outgoing and happy person when i am not thinking about school i am begging my parents to just let me do online school but i want to get my ba in university and that wont get me there please does anyone no what i should do does anyone no any good online schools for canada that are affordable will exersize help a diet is there anyone out there that has the same problem i was seeing a psycologist for about months and she told me that it was panic anxiety disorder i have had a number of tests done and i am well its like when i am having the anxiety if i am at school i begin to not care about what i want to do in the future when i am having an attack i just want to be at home with my family and just curl up in a ball in those moments i would drop out of school if my parents would let me i can feel my anxiety getting worse everyday and i am on the edge of having a breakdown as the school year comes closer thanks for all the great answers if you have a weight problem and don't know how to lose the excess the first thing you should do is have an evaluation by your family doctor and perhaps a dietician no one weight loss program works for everyone one thing i would strongly recommend though if you drink diet soft drinks aka soda pop or whatever you call it flavored with aspartame quit but i just noticed you apparently live in canada if so aspartame shouldn't be a problem unless your government now allows nutrasweet and equal a lot of studies i have heard about over the past several years have found that aspartame increases appetite my wife and i had both put on a lot of weight over the years but by following rather rigid restrictions on our caloric intake though not a lot of routine exercise we were each able to lose over pounds in a year's time however since you are still a teenager your diet requirements would undoubtedly be different from ours so you should consult your own proffesional how well do you do in your various subjects at school it's got to be hard on a teenager when you have to change schools a lot and keep having to leave any friends you had at your old school behind and try to make new friends while at the same time adjusting to a new school your anxiety which results in your self described excessive crying is something else you perhaps need to discuss with your family doctor he might think a referral to a mental health care professional is in order if so this is not something to be ashamed about one's mental health is just as important as one's physical health and is not a matter of some fault on your part your weight and anxiety problems could both be a result of any number of things hormonal imbalance low thyroid function too high of a blood glucose content too much insulin any number of other blood chemistry imbalances best wishes on getting to the root of your problems adjusting to your new school and hopefully making some new friends i'm sending up a prayer for you right now god bless you
