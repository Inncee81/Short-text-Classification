how does one overcome the side effects of being abused i was raised in a foster home and i was abused in more then one way as a result of it i have learned to feel nothing i thought this was good cause i couldn't feel the impending pain on my heart but after a while it began to hurt times as much then it usually does i push people away and alienate myself i need to learn how to love and feel for i fear i will be alone like others who have experienced the same thing i want to feel something other then pain when i do feel something other then pain its overwhelming it confuses me and i can't trust these feelings because i don't know what they are help i'm lost i have lost some people i truly loved with no way of repairing my relationship with them i'm vendictive and spieful not to a point were it can seriously hurt someone but enough for people to hate me and stay away from me i'd suggest you read the books by dave pelzer they will give you hope he went through hell you can change and better yourself but you have to do it no one else can do it for you One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Darth Vader Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Domestic violence Milton H.
