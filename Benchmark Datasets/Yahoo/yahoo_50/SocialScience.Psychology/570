can anyone help me understand this dream i've had this dream times so this time i wrote it down so i would remember it clearly i went to a foreign country and got arrested for trying to help some poor children when i was released my family and friends gave me a huge dinner only old friends i don't see anymore and dead relatives were there at the same time my family and friends that i do see was waiting for me across town at another dinner i was torn between the sides but i stayed with the ones i never see anymore also when i was looking out of the window at the party i saw a huge snake lizard and an alligator that was under a bed trying to eat one of my sons each time it was a different son i was behind the glass so i couldn't save him but somebody at the party did please help i have no idea what this means and i keep having the same dream when i looked out the window there also was a fully cooked whole chicken floating in the pool sounds like you are a people pleaser you want to take care of others and make everyone happy saving poor children at the risk of being arrested you may spread yourself too thin when it comes to doing things for other people as when you see your children being eaten by animals like maybe you feel guilty if you don't help everyone else but then if you do you feel like you haven't spent as much time with your family as you would like you also are sentimental about your past or wish you could go back to your younger days old friends and deceased i think the dream indicates a need for you to take some time for yourself and relax load the kids up and spend some time some place where you can enjoy some time together Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass About a Boy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Shit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Social rule Cliff Richard The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing John the Baptist Pitaten Miss Saigon EastEnders Salad Fingers Characters in the Smurfs Phoebe Buffay's songs Scenes from a Memory Care Bears W.I.T.C.H.
