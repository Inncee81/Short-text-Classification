mental problems when dealing with the opposite sex let's get some details out there right off the bat i am an year old male i graduated from high school three months ago and i have never had a girlfriend when i was younger i used to always think i was insane i begged for something to be wrong with me some kind of mental disease so that i could have it fixed with some simple pill so everything would be normal i eventually got over this and i havn't had any pseudo mental problems since except when around girls i became much more clear minded and i consider myself to be more sane than almost anyone out there i'm very rational and i'm able to look at things from every perspective however any time any girl or crush comes into play i go completely insane i obsess over the girl i'll love them for minutes hate them the next minutes wonder what the fuck is going on the next minutes and so on all day completely sane but insane and very obsessive around girls it's really creepy advice well that's what a crush is but if you're looking for the right girl it'll be someone that you feel comfortable talking with its usually the person you least expected don't go looking for a girl shell bump into you and you wont even notice it until later and don't go crazy about girls right away as being a girl i know we make sly moves anything to confuse guys sometimes when we act like we're interested we're just trying to be nice its not always love at first sight so don't just fall for us you'll find the right person and when you do you'll know it i advise not to think about girls but dont ignore them just be nice and friendly Avenue Q Friends W.I.T.C.H.
