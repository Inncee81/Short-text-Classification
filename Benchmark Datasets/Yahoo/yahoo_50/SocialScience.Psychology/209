has anyone had cognitive behavourial therapy im asking because im wondering what will happen if i choose to do it im intersted in what they say and ask you to do becasue ive heard its about changing the way your brain thinks like changing its pattern any personal experiences would be great thanx i think i may have a bit of a social anxiety disorder not really bad but i find talking to intimidating people who some can be my friends really horrible to talk to cos i go really red and hot its horrid i dont wanna make a big deal out of it tho cos itl make me worse if u know what i mean so im not going into detail cbt has the counselor in the role of judging if your 'way of thinking' is rational or irrational the premise is we make our own distress because of what we tell ourselves a classic example from a psych textbook is woman i don't think my husband loves me anymore counselor what makes you think that you have to have love you see having to have love is irrational therefore the counselor will work on you for you to 'consciously' learn and believe that i don't have to have love i won't be annihilated if i don't have love i can go on surviving and be happy without love now so all cards are on the table i am strongly biased against cbt even though right now they are claiming remarkable results i think in the near future that it will be found that their statistics of improvements will be found skewed tampered with or just bad research cbt is en vogue right now and a lot of people sincerely believe in it it may be quite helpful to you give it a try but as far as brain wave patterns and in depth character re structuring it is weak Cognitive therapy Psychoanalysis Chronic fatigue syndrome Borderline personality disorder Psychotherapy Phobia Mental illness Behavioral therapy Post-traumatic stress disorder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychology Homophobia Panic attack Human Bipolar disorder Transsexuality Narcissism Anxiety Reparative therapy Domestic violence Schizophrenia Avenue Q Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Cognitive science Transactional analysis Asperger syndrome Autism Sigmund Freud Theory of conduct Cognitive bias Traumatic brain injury Multiple sclerosis Noam Chomsky Social rule Carl Jung Personality disorder Controversies in autism The Lovely Bones Social psychology Second language acquisition Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Strategic management Philosophical counseling Mind control Anorexia nervosa False memory Dissociative identity disorder Traumatic incident reduction Objectivist philosophy Magical thinking Intelligence quotient Neuro-linguistic programming The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Binge eating disorder Social anxiety Scientology Neurosis Urinary incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Theodicy Stroke Grief Antidepressant Infantilism Philip J.
