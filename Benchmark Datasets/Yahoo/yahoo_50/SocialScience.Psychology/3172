does every living and non living objects give out positive or negative energy iwould like to know if every object gives out and absorbs positive and negative energy for example if someone sits on my couch for a while is that person releasing some of his her positive and negative energy that could affect any person or an object in a good or bad way is it good to not let others sit in the couch where i have good energy so that if the other peson has bad or negative energy does not affect me later aperson who has negative energy touches a person or too close to him her is negative energy being absorbed by the surroundings i think so but with inanimate objects i think the absorption of energy from humans is minimal so if someone with bad energy sits on your couch the residual energy which is left behind is small if someone with bad energy spent a month with you and slept on your couch there might be more of a buildup of the negative energy a sort of cumulative effect so the more direct contact the more energy absorbed i think that's why jewelry and rings worn by loved ones who pass become so dear to folks a lot of that person's energy is absorbed because the object has been in direct contact with them for such a long time it also seems to me that this kind of energy will dissipate over time it doesn't stay forever and as long as you envelope yourself in positive energy it probably would have minimal effect in most cases i don't think there's any proof of this it's just an intuitive thing others may experience it differently Theory of conduct Electromagnetic field Vacuum tube Nuclear explosion Diode Vacuum Fire fighting Karma Peltier-Seebeck effect Electromagnetic radiation Dark energy Dualism (philosophy of mind) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Equine conformation Langmuir probe General relativity Welding Nuclear fission The nature of God in Western theology Entropy Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Solar cell Circuit design Spacecraft propulsion Goodness and value theory Deflector shield Nuclear fusion Friction Depleted uranium Radiosurgery Solar power Heat Urinary incontinence Water (molecule) Radar Permittivity Volleyball Common cold Happiness Electrophysiology Lightning Social rule Rogue (comics) Numerology Eyeglass prescription Transformer Utilitarianism Membrane potential Energy development Photoelectric effect Pitaten Corona discharge Nuclear magnetic resonance Sonar Insulin Vegeta Capacitor Planetary orbit Action potential Black Lens (optics) Tide Force (Star Wars) Final Fantasy magic English grammar Photosynthesis Dirac equation Loudspeaker Motor oil Reinforcement Potential energy Faster-than-light Particle in a box Nuclear weapon design Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Ranma __ characters Ethics Light pollution Law of value Supernova Energy Traumatic incident reduction Shock absorber Pressurized water reactor Human position Bicycle helmet Green Lantern Resistor Escape velocity Socrates Diving Natural deduction Internal ballistics Nutrition Moral relativism Dog training Microwave oven Refractive index Speed of light
