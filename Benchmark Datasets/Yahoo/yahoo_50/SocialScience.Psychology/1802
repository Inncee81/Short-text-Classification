how come most people who like horror or who write horror are white ive never seen any ethnic horror authors or seen any ethnic horror fans of books and films why is this and people who like the horror genre in general seem to be white why is this i am going to answer this question first before a bunch of idiots come on and give stupid racist opinions about different ethnic groups i am sure there are ethnic horror writers out there they just are not as well known as their white counterparts further i and a lot of people i know are both ethnic and horror fans so maybe it's just one of those things but i am sure there is no connection between ethnicity and enjoyment of the horror genre Fantasy Tokusatsu Horror fiction Horror film The Rocky Horror Picture Show Death rock Joke Ethnic group Canon (fiction) H.P.
