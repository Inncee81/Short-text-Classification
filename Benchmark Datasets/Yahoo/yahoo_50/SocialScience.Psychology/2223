can't stand it when people post links to pictures and ask you to rate how pretty they are why do girls it's always girls do that is it low self esteem or something it really irritates me does anyone else feel the same way or am i overreacting i feel the same way and i don't think girls should put picture of themselves on the internet and asked to be rate how pretty they are they should know that they are pretty no matter what it could be that they are frond of themselves and want people telling them they are pretty it also could be that they don't feel pretty and want to see if people on the internet think they are there could be other reasons too Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Good Morning, Vietnam James T.
