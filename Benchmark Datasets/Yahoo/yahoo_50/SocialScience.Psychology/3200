distractions what are priorities and what are distractions i am still a teen and seem to get distracted too easily from things i need to do my distractions are video games television middle east news that i look up and watch on the television i now know a heck of a lot about the middle east sleeping until p m eating snacks when i feel nervous about something and even going outside to take walks this is almost everything i do to distract myself from the work i need to do how can i reduce the amount of distractions and start working on what i need to do like practicing for the act to get a better score or doing my summer reading assignment the question i guess is how can i change my patterns i know it is possible to control them eventually although i have been unsuccessful so far basically i have tried to create a schedule for myself and failed like times but every so often i see a hint of progress in change do you have any methods for changing patterns i need them pretty quick because i am scheduled to take the act again in about months thanks you are unusual in that you have insight into your patterns of distracting yourself so take it a step further is this a pattern than you can control try some experiments with yourself if it seems to happen whether you try to control it or not you could have biochemical issues which can be addressed with medication and strategies for managing your attention if you can control it and it is not biochemical then you need to look at your patterns and take responsibility for addressing what you are avoiding and changing your patterns either way you can learn to be in charge of your life instead of feeling that it controls you enjoy you will feel much better Milton H.
