what is your opinion on this guy i know i met this guy who who's and tells me he's intelligent all the time or as he puts it i have an above average iq it would prove other wise by his actions let's just say i don't think he's the brightest bulb in the box he thinks it's normal if you put oil in your gas tank he obsesses over his teeth car hair physical hygiene and plenty of other items he still lives at home with his mother i've gotten to the point that whenever i talk to him i just cringe because i literally can't stand the guy he seems like he always contradicts what he says today i made a crack at him about his mother's house being messy he told me intelligent people don't need to be organized to me that's just so arrogant i told him i guess i must be stupid because i love to organize things i loathe the guy so much my question is what's a great excuse as to why i don't want to talk to him ever again lie i hate lying and i hate to do it but this guy needs a big whopper if he's ever going to even remotely go away tell him you're moving or you started seeing someone who's totally possessive or jealous or whatever just tell him something that would make him think he doesn't want to be around you Friends Liam Gallagher Rei Ayanami Social rule Humphrey Bogart Garfield Little Britain Theory of conduct Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Catcher in the Rye The Ashlee Simpson Show The Strangerhood Eric Cartman The Human Stain Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scenes from a Memory The Fairly OddParents One Tree Hill (TV series) Great Teacher Onizuka Please Save My Earth Good Morning, Vietnam Avenue Q Plame affair Downing Street memo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grandview, U.S.A.
