if you have a bad day what kind of things do you do to make yourself feel better if i am unable to get away and to go somewhere quiet at the moment i usually try to do something that i know without a doubt will cause me to snap out of it i try to change my day by doing something that brings out positive emotions in myself such as watching my children play and getting down there and playing with them doing something kind for someone else calling someone up who is always in a cheery mood or just doing something small yet enjoyable for myself like taking a long hot bath also getting active when you are feeling down can help tremendously this may sound silly but there have been times when i have felt myself getting down and have just gone out in the back yard and jumped on the trampoline walking or going jogging or bike riding just doing something active being active results in better blood flow and more oxygen to the brain you can think faster clearer etc it is also a great stress releiver it actually releases more endorphins into your body which effects our emotions causing us to feel happier and more relaxed it also helps me at times to just try to go some place where i can be alone with my thoughts usually after a short period of time of just getting away from everything for a bit i am able to look back on it and realize that the events that happened in this day were not so bad i always remind myself that i have had worse days before i survived those i survived this one and i will survive any that i may come across in the future i also write down my feelings alot it gives the feeling of actually being able to talk to someone let it all out but in a more relaxed environment where no one will actually read it but yourself it's a great release by taking the time to reflect on a bad day you start to notice what actually triggered it all usually one thing happens that we did not desire and we get thrown off a bit because we get thrown off something else may happen that we have to experience in this weaker state and it makes that event seem so much worse and eventually it just spirals down into more and more negative situations and emotions and eventually we get so down that we begin to actually draw these negative situations to ourselves until we decide to take control of it bad things happen but it is how we react to them that matters the most i have to remind myself of these things and it makes me feel better makes me feel more in control i become reminded that yes bad things do happen sometimes and sometimes we do not have control over every situation but that does not mean that we are not in control we will always be in control of ourselves and we don't have to let one situation ruin our entire day we don't have to let negative situations cause us to bury ourselves in negative thoughts and depression it is usually by reminding myself of these things and by doing something to lift my spirits to change my day that i am able to get through even the worst of days Social rule Happiness Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Transactional analysis Drowning About a Boy Milton H.
