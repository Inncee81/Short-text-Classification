why is it so damn hard for some people to keep a secret you beg you plead you say if this comes out my life is over or everyone will hate me but theres just no use knowledge is power people generally find that it increases their social status to have information regarding other people that is hard to come by a secret perhaps especially one that might be as scandalous as to ruin that person's life they share the information with their friends whom they may believe can keep the secret but they are usually overcome with the urge to share further if you have a secret this powerful i would suggest you keep it to yourself in the future if you absolutely must tell someone tell a journal or pet i know it seems silly or some other media that does not talk back you'd be surprised how many people cannot be trusted with secrets even those you thought were your best friends may prove just as deceitful as your enemies good luck Plame affair Password Mojave people Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Evil Care Bears W.I.T.C.H.
