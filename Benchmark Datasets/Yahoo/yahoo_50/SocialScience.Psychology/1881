this is sooo weird i need serious answers now i met a girl this summer that was staying next door with her grandparents for a couple of months i saw her around and she looked totally familiar but she had never been in this area before i met her one day and she asked if she had met me before and i said no but she looked really familiar too we started hanging out a lot and she got me into the band my chemical romance we talked a lot about them later one night she slept over and we were up in the attic trying to sleep my sister used to stay up ther so it was all finished off anyway we were trying to draw a gun and a rose as soon as we put the pencil to the paper we felt a heavy stabbing feeling it stopped after about mins then we felt our hair being tugged on we tried to ignore it and started talking about mcr we were talking about gerard way and frank iero and how we had become so much exactly like them and when we talked about them we smelled smoke because they both smoke and drink continued soon so we were all freaked out and then we were thinking the same things and seeing the same random pictures in our heads of mcr realted things there was one of a man in his s a little girl and a medium sized black dog in front of an old building old picture we went down into my bedroom and tried to sleep in there we woke up the next day and were talking yet again and we both felt like we had met mcr before like when we were about and it had to do with playing kickball we had earlier that week watched a video of mcr playing kickball we watched it again and it was soooo friggin scary familiar i am just wondering if it is possible that we could have known eachother earlier in life and lived with mcr for a little while if not why could we be having these strange occurances possibilities come to mind about your experiences because you both talked so much about the band and all it could be due to the powers of suggestion heavy powers of suggestion that all of these things occurred it could be that it is all coincidental and with talk and influence of things the way they played out you could have very well known each other earlier when you were younger and it is possible if you were too young forgot these things as you grew older and it was all brought back by these experiences whatever the cause of it they happened it's up to you to figure out what you wanna do with it and where you wanna go with it good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Friends Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
