what do you do when you are faced with what might be a terrible loss for example a loss of a good buddy or things that have sentimental value to it basically something that cannot be replaced but you have feelings associated to it that you cant explain what you do is take one day at a time sometimes just one breath at a time i lost my husband everything i owned including my home and my mother all within years i prayed a lot to help me get through it i surrounded myself with family and friends for support then i joined a support group and added in some counseling i has taken me years to begin to get back to normal sometimes i still slip back into a mild depression but then i remember what i learned in group and therapy and pull myself back out my husband died suddenly while in our bed asleep that was the hardest we had been childhood sweethearts and were married for years none of this process has been easy it has been long hard work i never thought i'd get this far but it can be done get help as soon as you can and good luck my blessings to you The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Baldness EastEnders Out-of-body experience 2000 Australian Grand Prix Knife Dog training Grief Milton H.
