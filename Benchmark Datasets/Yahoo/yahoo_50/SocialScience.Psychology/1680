help with this dream for the last year i've been dreaming that i'm getting married most of the time religious marriage i'm in church all happy i get married but never got to see the broom's face nice celebration but never saw his face i had this dream like times last year i stopped having this dream during this current year but last night i dreamed of my civil wedding ceremony and got to see the broom face very clearly i have never seen this face in my life so he didn't look familiar to anyone neither i couldn't associate him with anyone in my real life nor on tv i felt that he was very happy and made me feel very secure about my self i'm single and marriage has never been a concern for me but i'm making some decisions in my life can you help me please sorry i actually meant the groom nope i didnt have this dream in the early hours of saturday actually it happened last night it sounds to me as though you are coming to a time in your life when you have to make some decisions that will have a long term effect the marriage but you don't know what you're going to choose the groom with no face however it sounds as though you might have encountered something recently that gave you more of an idea of what direction would be good for you to head the groom that was happy and made you feel good about yourself maybe you've come across a career field that really makes sense for you perhaps you've recently come to live in a place that you really like or some other facet of your life has recently become clear or at least clearer that's my interpretation for what it's worth Same-sex marriage Marriage Cliff Richard Same-sex marriage in Canada Wedding The McGuire Sisters Knots Landing Haven (TNG episode) Religious Society of Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Dualism (philosophy of mind) Journey (band) Fiddler on the Roof Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Roman Catholic Church Theory of conduct Blonde on Blonde EastEnders God Emperor of Dune Bon Jovi One Tree Hill (TV series) Current teachings of Prem Rawat White wedding Women in Islam Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Goodness and value theory Holy Orders Divorce W.I.T.C.H.
