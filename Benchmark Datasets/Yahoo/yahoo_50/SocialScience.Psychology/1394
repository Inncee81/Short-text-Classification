does your own mortality make you frightened this is a sincere question i am in my early thirties and have realised recently that i am going to die in my twenties i think i didnt really acknowledge the fact but now the thought that i am definiately going to die and i dont know when or how totally spins me out i spend far too much time thinking about it and obsessing and frankly im terrified does anyone else get spun out by this or do most people accept the inevitability i think everyone worries about their own mortality from time to time and that is completely normal however these thoughts seem to be causing you much distress and i wonder why these thoughts have suddenly been triggered has someone close to you died recently or are you feeling depressed at the moment i ask these questions because a sudden onset of anxiety over mortality can be a symptom of depression maybe these thoughts are alarm bells telling you that you need to take stock of your life and where you are going in your future Anxiety Panic attack Obsessive-compulsive disorder Anorexia nervosa Bipolar disorder Cognitive therapy Borderline personality disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Autism Multiple sclerosis Transsexuality Narcissism Charles Darwin's illness Meditation Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Death Father's Day (Doctor Who) Behavioral therapy Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Stroke Milton H.
