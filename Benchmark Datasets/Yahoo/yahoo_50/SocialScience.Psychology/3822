grief and loss hi guys i have just lost my beloved father in law and i am in a lot of pain why did he have to die please no god botherers answer this question i was with him when he died i feel so honoured with that but so terribly sad i just can't say any more i loved him nonjourno allow me to offer my condolences for your tragic loss i too have lost several deeply loved and respected individuals to death and it rocked my world to the edge having gone through this a few times i would like to share a couple of observations there is nothing anyone can do to take away your pain it is like a wide but shallow river that you must cross and no one can cross it for you you must go through the pain but you will survive it the only thing that will take the pain away is time i know it doesn't feel like it now but i promise you that sooner than you think the anguish you are suffering right now will begin to heal in time you will think less and less of you lost loved ones and when you do think of them it will be with loving fondness we do not know why such beautiful people must die but they do and we cannot stop it we must realize that this passing is a natural and actually desirable part of life take comfort in all of the wonderful memories you have of him and always try to act in a manner which honors his memory no one can say but personally i take comfort in the belief that i will see my beloved ones again someday it may be a fairy tale but it gives me peace and harms no one may your healing come quickly and may you always be enriched by the time you spent with him peace be with you will Reaction to the assassination of John F.
