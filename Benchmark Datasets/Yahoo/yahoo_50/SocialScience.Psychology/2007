what do you understand about this poem which was written playfully with children university knowledge is as the universe expanding in every way how will it keep its integrity if this follows it can't stay look see here the apple on the ground after its fallen from the tree it doesn't hang around focus is as gravity that keeps things quite on track here is one of learning's tools with integrity quite intact look see here the witness of the moon i must ask you here this day will it be falling soon we are as the wondering child playing with many toys while finding how things work today we're making a lot of noise look see here we grow this way to gather what remains we then move on to another stage to focus in our reigns billy perhaps for most children but that might depend on age brightness and the nature of playfulness children often catch concepts quicker than adults give them credit for those are deep concepts that would certainly evoke many questions in children the ideas that knowledge is continually expanding and that gravity provides a constant rhythm to the the movement of the stars in the universe are esoteric concepts that children aren't usually exposed to i agree that we should continually push the knowledge curve until it approaches maximum potential we just need to be careful to introduce these concepts when the children are willing and able to receive and perceive them Planetary orbit Gravity Extreme Programming Entropy Causality The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mathematics Second language acquisition Meaning of life Religion Scientific method Music Education Classical music era Socrates Calculus Determinism Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human Epistemology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Species Soul Probability Floppy disk Time Out of Mind Mantra Dark energy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Action potential Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief General relativity Original sin Aikido Origin belief Creationism Explosive material W.
