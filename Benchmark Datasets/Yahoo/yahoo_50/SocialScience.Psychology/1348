can a relationship survive without sex can a relationship survive without sex i was just wondering i plan to abstain from sex until marriage for personal reasons i just wanted it to know if it would be possible for a relationship to last without any sexual activities involved i completely agree i plan to abstain as well i do think relationships can survive without sex i know of a couple who are now married and they have one of the best relationships i've ever seen simply because they chose to abstain you see abstaining allows you to keep yourself from getting caught up in pleasure seeking relationships if anything it strengthens the relationship because now you can focus on your emotional connection to this other person you have more time to explore each other when you aren't caught up in recieving something purely physical know that love isn't defined by sex if anything sex is defined by love good sex comes from a loving secure and happy relationship and i think that if you significant other waits for you and respects your choice then that just goes to show how much you mean to them and how much this relationship means to them i would definitely wait to see who cares enough to respect me i know there's this whole argument about sexual compatibility and what i say to that is if your love can survive lack of sexual intimacy and if you have a strong enough emotional connection to each other the rest will fall into place i think sex should be the last aspect of a relationship it should never be a condition of the relationship you see psychologists have talked about passionate and companionate love and truly they've said it best because you know that passionate love whether it's based on this new excitng relationship or good sex will fizzle out however what stays is the companionate love and that's based on so much more than that it's based on your emotional connection and frienship with this person so more power to you sister edit one thing i do suggest is that you have a discussion with your partner about sexual preferences so that it doesn't affect your relationship later on Polyamory Sexual abstinence Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Marriage Pedophilia Same-sex marriage Zoophilia Sadism and masochism Human Sex Domination & submission (BDSM) Child sexuality Interpersonal relationship Childlove movement Sexual intercourse Meaning of life BDSM Motivation Inhibited sexual desire Abortion debate Nicomachean Ethics Emotion Child sexual abuse Objectivist philosophy Sexual addiction Lawrence v.
