my first out of body experience i think i had my first out of body experience ok so last night i fell asleep around am and had set my alarm to am i woke up feeling really tired so i went into my parent's room wich was empty and watched tv i fell asleep and suddenly had a weird feeling go throughout my body kind of as if somebody or something was on me and i couldn't move then it was like i could see through my eyelids i felt like i was rising in the air and floating of course i panicked and came back in my body after that it seemed like i was awake and turned over and saw my mom lying there i turn to the tv and it was still on i turn to the side of the bed again and nobody was there i turn to the tv and it was off i hear people outside the room and i felt freaked so i screamed for my mom but she couldn't hear me suddenly i wake up for real with tears in my eyes sweat tv turned off and an empty room does all this make sense to you guys what do you guys think out of body experiences obe and lucid dreaming may seem similiar one obe when i was around more or less taxed my vocabulary to describe but more or less i will do my best i was relaxed and comfortable then a weird sense of vibration that was not shaking nor movement in it self seemed to spread throughout my body curiosity compelled me to allow the experience to strengthen and continue next thing what can only be described as floating though my celing and roof occured i had no form per se like my body rather i discovered that if i thought myself to a place i would be there of course the marvel and novel sensations easily distract you usually the obes were limited to known places and sometimes involved other people lucid dreams on the other hand are a tad more elusive you are in a dream and suddenly you realize you are in a dream more often than not this tends to wake you the primary trick is to focus on something in the scene but not too closely i remember approaching a glistening gold fountain but as i examined it closer and closer it seemed to be made up of rough grey paper like that used to make egg cartons as i reduced focus and such the more and more it went back to glistening gold etc all the objects were made of the same weird stuff lucid dreams are fun because now you can manipulate your dream to fly play or anything else obes tend to leave you stuck in real places and such the sense of pure total freedom of obe ranks high on my experiences enjoy it but remember if you tend to be scared or anxious or panic prone this would not be for you Lucid dreaming Dream Milton H.
