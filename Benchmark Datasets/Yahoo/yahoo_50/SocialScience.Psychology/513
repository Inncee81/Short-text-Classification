double major in art education and in nursing i know this sounds silly considering the course load but i do like both with an equal passion i do hospital volunteer and taking prereqs for nursing but lately my part time jobs have often been something to do with teaching and children my first job was babysitting and second is assistant teacher im also excited about being a qualified peer tutor at campus i also like art a lot has anyone done double majoring in nursing and another i need an outsider's point of view i suggest that you continue your double major until you become over burdened that time may not come so you may be able to graduate at the college level with a double major and then concentrate on one or the other at the graduate level i'm suggesting that you continue to delay your decision until you cannot handle the extra work Nurse Graduate school Nursing Far Eastern University Education in the People's Republic of China College Northeastern University, Boston Homeschooling Education in the United States Community college Paralegal Affirmative action Columbia University Vanderbilt University Johns Hopkins University University of Pennsylvania Hunter College Chinese University of Hong Kong Academia Cricket Grand Valley State University Education in Portugal Niagara University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 The College of New Jersey Teacher Lyceum of the Philippines Football (soccer) Seneca College Middle Tennessee State University Otterbein College Bristol Grammar School Professor Academic degree Harvard University Harvard College Towson University University of San Diego University of Michigan No Child Left Behind Act Franklin W.
