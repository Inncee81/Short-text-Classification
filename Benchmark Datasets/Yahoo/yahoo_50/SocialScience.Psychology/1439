what is your take on the song hide and seek by imogen heap this is by far one of the most powerful song that i have ever herd i have a friend who danced to this song and after i herd it i cried it might sound silly but the feeling i get from it is amazing it reminds me change and espically right now i moved a years ago from alabama to illinois and i was never happy with the idea and hide and seek just sums up all my feeling in a song when it says where are we what the hell is going on the dust has only just begun to form crop circles in the carpet sinking feeling it is like when i moved i was so out of it and things had just seemed to have settled where i was living before and then things pick up again the dust only just beginning to form life just settling down spin me round again and rub my eyes this can't be happening when busy streets a mess with people would stop to hold their heads heavy then this portion is like remembering when things were good in life hide and seek trains and sewing machines all those years they were here first trains and sewing machines are the new people i met in school they had been here years before i moved and had already made their cliques and their friends oily marks appear on walls where pleasure moments hung before the takeover the sweeping insensitivity of this still life oily marks are past memories and the takeover is leaving my old home the insensitivity of this still life is how my parents picked me up and moved me with out asking mmmm whacha say mmmm that you only meant well well of course you did mmmm whacha say mmmm that its all for the best of course it is mmmm whacha say mmmm that it's just what we need you decided this mmmm whacha say mmmm what did she say now here that you only meant well was like what my parents told me it was supposed to better when we moved well of course you did was my reaction it was all for the best were my parents exact words to my response and the its just what we needed is what my mom said to calm me down ransom notes keep falling out your mouth mid sweet talk newspaper word cut outs speak no feeling no i don't believe you you don't care a bit you don't care a bit this part is showing how my parents didnt care at all that i wasnt happy with this move hide and seek ransom notes keep falling out your mouth mid sweet talk newspaper word cut outs hide and seek speak no feeling no i don't believe you you don't care a bit you don't care a you don't care a bit hide and seek oh no you don't care a bit oh no you don't care a bit hide and seek oh no you don't care a bit you don't care a bit you don't care a bit and the ending sums it all up and brings me to today how i have all this anger built up inside me about this move that my parents didn't care a bit about how i felt anyway that is my take on this song like i said it is just a totally powerful song and i think everyone can relate to it in some way or another i just listened to it to refresh my mind lol i think it's about making difficult decisions in your life that you don't want to make but you have to for the best the whole first verse suggests that its about a time of confusion of feeling lost this can't be happening makes me think that its about a loss of something either a home or even someone it reminds me of my childhood i love and hate to look at old pictures it makes me think of 'what could have been' if things had been different and it's hard to see my old home town it's changed and i feel somewhat like where are we what the hell is going on like it says in the song i don't know how else to put it there's so much that i could write but i don't think most of it would make sense lol well that's my take on it Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Social rule The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Pitaten About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Hey Jude Humphrey Bogart Wonderland (McFly album) The Marshall Mathers LP Pok__mon Live!
