if vulcans were really logical wouldn't they let out their emotions so they didn't get that disease at old age excellent point i agree completely and at the risk of appearing to be a complete nerd would remind you that there have historically been many groups of vulcans who have rebelled against the teachings of surak and embraced emotion though most apparently ended disasterously i've also noticed that the focus on logic in vulcan culture may not be as ancient as we've been led to believe for instance commander t'pol first officer of the nx enterprise exhibited emotion regularly though she denied it vehemently as did many other vulcans of her time it was many years later when emotion seems to have become more well controled as evidenced by tuvok and of course by spock who was of course a hybrid so my point is that perhaps they haven't worked through the problem long enough to see the logic of your idea you might write to the vulcan science directorate as i'm certain that they have sponsored much research on bendii syndrome that might include discussion of this idea live long and prosper Vulcan (Star Trek) T'Pol Mr. Spock Timeline of Star Trek Mirror Universe (Star Trek) Pon farr Starfleet ranks and insignia Kir'Shara (ENT episode) Romulan Surak Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Charles Tucker III T'Pau (Star Trek) Soval Star Trek: Enterprise Tuvok Nerd Religion Star Trek: The Motion Picture Democracy Warp drive Asperger syndrome Language Sarek Saavik Jonathan Archer Abortion debate Leonard McCoy Star Trek: Voyager Is There in Truth No Beauty?
