psychology of women who don't want to breastfeed their baby putting aside the fact that some women cannot physically breastfeed that is not what my question is about i am fully aware that some women cannot produce milk or have physical disabilities my question is regarding women who don't want to breastfeed their child thus deciding to use a chemical supplement formula i find it incredibly disturbing that a woman does not have that primal instinct either by choice or a result of the way she was raised or some other unknown factor females of all mammal species will nurture their newborn with nature's best nutrition breast milk i see it as a purely faulty or selfish mindset that could make a women deny her child the best nutrition and deny herself and her baby the bonding experience that comes with breastfeeding what is the psychology responsible for this choice by a woman i agree i may sound judgmental but so far most of these cases sound purely selfish even working mothers can express milk for when they are not at home as for my own psychological triggers i was raised very naturally and breastfed for a long time only when i was older did i see women giving their children something other than breast milk and i guess it just repulsed me that something so unnatural could be considered as an alternative to the 'best nutrition' a baby can get i suspected that a lot of women wouldn't answer the question and start answering defensively that alone speaks volumes i agree totally with you i am a mother of three all mine were breast feed my middle child until she was which helps to develop areas of the brain that nothing other than best milk can and that has been scientifically proven i think mothers that choose not to feed do it for their own convenience and are not taking the baby's interest seriously they need to get their priorities straight Milk Fertility awareness Infant Breast Breast milk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychology Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Sexual orientation Nutrition Infant formula Abortion debate Human nature Stuttering Free will Gender role Elephant Omega-3 fatty acid Coercion Nipple Nestl__ boycott Orgasm Terri Schiavo Hypoglycemia Cancer Intelligence quotient Domestic violence Haloperidol Pregnancy Reparative therapy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Folic acid Obstetrics A Course In Miracles Coeliac disease Transsexuality Whale Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medical analysis of circumcision Protein-energy malnutrition Cheese Goodness and value theory Theodicy Abortion in the United States Infantilism Childfree Hypnosis Tocopherol Nestl__ Puberty Cytomegalovirus Parenting Breast pump Species Second language acquisition Abortion Organic farming Little Britain Sex Scientific method Neuro-linguistic programming Divorce Guinea pig Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual differentiation Science Vitamin D Ethics Oxytocin Scientology beliefs and practices Adoption Motivation Soul Heterosexuality Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Postpartum depression International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Cat Chronic fatigue syndrome Meaning of life HIV God Emperor of Dune Hillary Rodham Clinton
