how accurately do your everyday actions represent your personal philosophies are your views about what's important in life played out accurately in your actions and words if i met you for the first time would i be able to tell what things you value and believe in life by observing your actions and words alone is there sometimes a discrepancy between what you believe and what you do is your satisfaction in life determined at least partly by how closely you are able to control your actions to reflect your beliefs or perhaps how quickly you are able to get your beliefs to reconcile with your actions my satisfaction in life is largely determined by how consistently i can stick to my convictions hypocrisy has brought down more societal institutions than any other act and i do everything in my power to live by my word just a tiny example how many people do you hear say this i don't believe in organized religion because of the hypocrisy involved in the church i'm not a believer per se but i do feel that religion used to be a great tool in creating a stable moral background for children this isn't the case anymore because of the lack of consistency between belief and action look where it has got us i think when people meet me for the first time they know who they're talking to and i take pride in that Separation of church and state Evil Theodicy Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Coercion Religion Social psychology Objectivist philosophy S__ren Kierkegaard Conscience Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Fundamentalism Roman Catholic Church Sexual orientation Creationism God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism David Hume Power (sociology) Goodness and value theory Soul Nicomachean Ethics Sin Human Confucius Polyamory Intelligent design LaVeyan Satanism Origin belief Law of value Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Franz Boas Moral relativism Ten Commandments Causality Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Ethics Jiddu Krishnamurti Determinism Abortion Karma Autism Young Earth creationism Summa Theologiae Scientology beliefs and practices Altruism German student movement Philosophy of science Existence of God Abortion debate Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Social justice Religious conversion Simone Weil Sola fide Baptism Merit Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Paul of Tarsus Morality Christianity Past teachings of Prem Rawat Intelligent design movement Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints George Fox Iago Witch-hunt Immanuel Kant Spiritism Wedge strategy Predestination Sigmund Freud Theology Holy Spirit Duties of the Heart Lie Cognitive science A Course In Miracles Sociocultural evolution Out-of-body experience Karl Marx Microeconomics Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Pedophilia Teach the Controversy Laura Schlessinger Patriotism Philosophical skepticism Jewish principles of faith Christian-Jewish reconciliation Church of Christ Satanism
