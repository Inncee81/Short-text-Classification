where do i go to find a therapist i live in orange county ny i have looked online but there isnt anyone close to me at least not online what can i do i am lonely i feel i dont connect with anyone i have no friends i would not recommend asking your doctor as he will only recommend his buddies or someone he has a reciprocal business relationship with and this may not be the type of therapist you need first what kind of therapist do you need individual counseling couples counseling do you have a phobia or anxiety disorder you want treatment for therapists and counselors usually specialize in particular areas you don't want to select someone with behavioral modification training if all you really want to do is talk about how you hate your mother you should start by looking in the phone book call up the counselors and therapists ask what their specialties are and ask what their background and training is in then make an informed choice give it a few sessions and if you don't' feel comfortable with you therapist select a new one often therapy is about a good relationship between the therapist and client so you must find someone you feel comfortable with and that you feel you can trust Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis Reparative therapy Cognitive therapy Ex-gay Traumatic incident reduction Clinical depression Psychiatry Transsexuality Autism Occupational Therapy Neuro-linguistic programming Prostate cancer Medicine Anxiety Massage Marriage counseling Dissociative identity disorder Behavioral therapy Sexual dysfunction Albert Ellis Borderline personality disorder Milton H.
