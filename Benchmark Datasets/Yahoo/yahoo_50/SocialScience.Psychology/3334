what to do with a bad boss i have this boss who is constantly competing with me he has no ideas of his own and will take what i say and act like it was his idea i work in advertising and he is my art director every time i do something that gets praise from higher ups he says i told her to do that he is like a child who can't stand for anyone else to get positive attention what do i do i don't want to quit if i were you i'd just keep doing what you're doing chances are his boss knows him better than you realize rise above it and instead of retaliating or defending yourself try something completely off the wall compliment him not flattery but a genuine compliment not for taking credit for something you did but compliment him in areas where you know he's lacking in confidence which is why he's trying to take credit in the first place if he thinks you admire and respect him he may feel guilty about taking the wind out of your sails in order to feed his ego even if he doesn't you've shown how much more competent gracious and mature you are to others who may be watching Humphrey Bogart Transactional analysis Friends Fahrenheit 9/11 Plame affair Social rule The Smoking Room Justification (theology) EastEnders Alex Ferguson Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Miss Saigon Theory of conduct The Amazing Race Sociolinguistics James T.
