avoidant personality disorder school is starting in a couple of weeks im deathly afraid of going back thing is that i stopped going to my continuation school last year during my senior year and i just now figured out that i have apd at first i thought i was just real shy but when i looked on wikipedia the description fitted me perfectly what do i do my mom cant afford to see a psychiatrist im behind in school credit and school gets my blood pressure up real high which results in nose bleeds im also overweight which doesnt help at all at your age hightened social anxiety is a common thing and can be tough to face the stressful situation of making it through school the good news is that this generally improves with age also personality disorders or not genetic and are learned behavoirs that can be treated through behavoir modification i bet if you read the description of symptoms for social anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety disorder you would feel like you would fit into this as well it does sound like your issues are very real and what's really important is how real they are to you so it is imperative that you seek help in some way you don't have to see a specialist to be treated for psychiatric issues esepcially if this would be your first time seeking psychiatric help if you don't have a family doctor there should be a health clinic in your area that treats people who cannot afford healthcare don't feel like you are being a burden on your mother she would rather see you happy than have a couple extra bucks in her pocket most doctors offices can point you in the right direction to get affordable healthcare if they themselves cannot provide it there are also solutions like seeing a school consuelor a priest a social worker or a trusted adult given that you have other health problem i think you should exhaust all avenues of seeking out a medical doctor before you seek out a therapist hang in there life will get easier little by little find what you enjoy doing help others and you'll make your world a better place Anxiety Clinical depression Borderline personality disorder Psychiatry Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Bipolar disorder Alcoholism Panic attack Autism Hypertension Hikikomori Mental illness Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Health insurance Reparative therapy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Procrastination Phobia Controversies in autism Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Adult attention-deficit disorder Nurse Psychoanalysis Stroke Narcissism Gender identity disorder Migraine Sigmund Freud Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Unemployment Chronic fatigue syndrome Stuttering Avoidant personality disorder Combat stress reaction Asperger syndrome Transactional analysis Binge eating disorder Stomach cancer Utilitarianism Mental Health Act 1983 Alzheimer's disease Abortion Schizophrenia Shyness National Health Service Sexual dysfunction Ex-gay Insomnia Urinary incontinence Agoraphobia Cognitive therapy Psychosis Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Involuntary commitment Mental health Eating disorder Down syndrome Coeliac disease Goodness and value theory Antidepressant Psychiatric hospital Fibromyalgia Childbirth Stress (medicine) Obesity Abortion debate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Charles Darwin's illness BDSM Physical therapy Electroconvulsive therapy Terri Schiavo Anti-psychiatry Chlorpromazine Pneumonia Social anxiety Ethics Genetic disorder Neurofeedback Baldness Tobacco smoking Folic acid
