sometimes i feel low sometimes i worry about nothing but i either just accept it or see it as a challenge to not let it overcome me and pretend im ok to myself untill i forget that im feeling low just keep busy and the next day after a nights sleep im fine and barely remember what a dull existence i was in yesterday my point is this if you dont try to put a finer point on anything and just go with it or accept it it doesnt seem to last long it goes away but when you try and find the root cause and question this and ask yourself that it stays alive and at the front of your mind for a long time because the whole of you is concerned with this bad thought and it just grows and gets worse just think to yourself oh so what tommorow is another day a devil may care attitude is the best way to fight off bad feelings do you think im right it works for me anyway i also find submitting the same question twice helps too lol acceptance is a powerful defense mechanism however this behavioral modification technique can backfire if we are too quick to use it most problems need to be analyzed to some level of cognition and must be at least categorized and compartmentalized we need to face each of our problems as they present themselves to us and immediately go about devising a plan of attack to alleviate the problem then we must actively immerse ourselves into solving the problem if after due diligence we find that we are incapable of solving the problem with the resources that are available to us we can then accept that outcome and move on we can defer the solution until we have the proper tools to fight so accept what is but only after you have made your best attempt to solve the problem using all of the resources available to you Strategic management Theory of conduct Hypnosis Richard Feynman A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Goodness and value theory Psychology Psychoanalysis Scientific method Battle of France M16 (rifle) Mach kernel Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sigmund Freud Theodicy Procrastination Clinical depression Current teachings of Prem Rawat T'Pol Stuttering Philosophy of mathematics Karen Horney The Skeptical Environmentalist Ethics Knife Software testing Animal cognition Social rule Utilitarianism Infantilism Autism Transsexuality Vegeta Project Blue Book Consciousness Avenue Q Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Risk Aikido The nature of God in Western theology Human Simone Weil Equine conformation Divorce Cultural relativism Computer chess Public good General relativity Microeconomics Postmodernism Cult Geopolitik Sexual orientation Operation Market Garden Cyprus dispute Milton H.
