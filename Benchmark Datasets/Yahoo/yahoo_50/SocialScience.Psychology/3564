i need some help dealing with intrusive bisxual thoughts these thoughts keep plauging me and i just want them out of my life so i can be in peace i am open minded if i am bisexual then i guess i am bisexual but i really really hope that i am not my thoughts are only about giving oral sex i know i dont want to be in a relationship with a guy or really am not even interested in recieving i think i dont want to do this but there is some kind of short circuit going on in my brain i try and be as honest as possible with myself but i am still lost i know i am attracted to women i just when i think of giving oral sex to a man it doesnt violently and instantly repulse me i dont know if this is because i have thought about it so much that i am desensitized or because i feel insecure in some way or what but i really really dont want to it would mess up my head and besides that i just want to be with a woman but these thoughts haunt me please dont say see a shrink i already know that i wouldn't worry about it too much you probably just have an oral fixation like a lot of other people you don't want to be homosexual you just want to use your mouth to achieve sexual gratification maybe you know how oral sex feels and you want to give that same gratification to someone else you probably just need the right girl who is willing to have you give her oral sex often it's always okay to be open minded try chewing gum often or some other oral activity talking lolly pops sunflower seeds and see if that helps you concentrate on other things besides giving a man oral sex Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Sigmund Freud Infantilism Bisexuality Child sexuality Homophobia Child sexual abuse Group sex Pedophilia Singapore gay equality movement Gay slang Reparative therapy Ex-gay Anal sex Sexual abstinence Social rule Transsexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sadism and masochism History of sex Gender role Sex Happiness About a Boy Biology and sexual orientation Stewie Griffin Casual relationship Sex and the City Theory of conduct Sex-positive feminism Transgender Vernon Schillinger Sex education Masturbation Asexuality Iago Lawrence v.
