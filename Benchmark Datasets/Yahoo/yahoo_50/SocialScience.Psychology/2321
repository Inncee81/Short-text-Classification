why do you think some people can feel chemistry between themself and another when the other person doesn't if there is chemistry shouldn't both people or neither feel it i'm not talking strictly about physical attraction that is something that is learned i'm talking about actually feeling a connection with someone that isn't based on looks thanks all i'm going to put this to a vote because i don't know what answer to pick most of you answered with a romantic context and i really meant more of the non physical friendship type all of your answers were interesting though personally i think that if one person feels it an the other doesn't it's either because one was faking it not just being nice because you can be nice without faking or one doesn't want to admit that they have changed we change over time and so does our chemistry with people usually it's not drastic but i guess it can be i am not trained in psychology hence my answer here is merely our of my personal common sense chemistry in my view is simply a match with a set of values these values could be physical behavioral psychological or even moral spiritual and are mostly held at our subconscious level when we get to believe or feel that a person is broadly matching our own set of values the chemistry comes to be that i think leads to the answer for the question it is perfectly possible that a broadly meets b's set of values but b doesn't meet a's primarily because we can not escape double standards we hold a set of values for others and a different one for ourselves moreover it is also possible that we may be inherently unable to meet our own preferences because we deliberately prefer what we are not or can not be for instance an ugly person valuing beauty a fair one preferring dark skin etc chemistry is no random occurrence like all else there is the cause and effect principle whether we are consciously aware of the causes or not hope this makes sense great probing question made me sit up and think through Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Meaning of life Human Coercion Science Infantilism Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Free will Tai Chi Chuan Ethics Atheism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Pedophilia Scientology beliefs and practices Transactional analysis Neuro-linguistic programming Human nature Consciousness Physical attractiveness Postmodernism Causality Objectivist philosophy Quantum mechanics Art Expert system Traumatic incident reduction God Emperor of Dune Love Unconscious mind Philosophy of language A Course In Miracles Carl Jung Soul Patriotism Religion Reality Cultural relativism Francis Crick Alcoholics Anonymous Psychotherapy Magic (paranormal) Altruism Milton H.
