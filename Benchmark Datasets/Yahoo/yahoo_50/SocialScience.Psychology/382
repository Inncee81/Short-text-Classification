do you like my story so far i just started this story randomly an hour ago soo nikki coleman rolled her black ten speed bike to a stop in front of the familiar crisp clean cut yard this particular yard belonged to her best bud corey nicholson or as she was referred to among close friends nickel nikki called nickel hoarsely to come out of the house she was way to lazy and tired to get off the small boyish bike nikki was very much the silly tomboy of her group she was always the one climbing up to the very top of the tallest trees mooning innocent passerby and getting dirty enough for people to mistake her for a totally different race some angry shouting was heard from inside the quaint little cottage nikki knew nickel had trouble with her parents they were big alcoholics and nickel often spent nights sleeping in the abandoned building them and the gang had broken into now this wasn t a real big building just about ft by ft brick and padlocked there was an opening in the roof you co there was an opening in the roof you could get to if you climbed a nearby tree and it was a very difficult tree to climb the others and i were aware that nickel did this every other night we understood we all had our problems i had even stayed with nickel a couple times before i would stay with her comfort her while she spilt her feelings and thoughts into me i felt her pain i usually kept all my pain inside i knew it wasn t healthy it would all burst out once it became too much i guess that was my problem i knew i was different from everyone else i was a piece from a different puzzle i didn t fit and others noticed on the outside i was a kooky confused teen that often said things that didn t make sense on the inside it was totally different the inside was dark dark and misunderstood and i never let anyone see nickel suddenly burst out of the peeling screen door it slammed behind her but was quickly yanked open again by her apparently wasted father you had better be back here by nighttime you bratty little twat roared the stumped little monster of a man swaying violently on his filthy paint splattered boots the horrid reek of alcohol waffing off of the tub o lard as if a fan were on medium behind him his trailer park potbelly hung over the rags of his good jeans and between the filthy black suspenders mr nicholson was a construction worker i doubted he would be any cleaner if he had a different job he looked momentarily confused before nickel nastily exclaimed go screw a goat you racist pig what what did you say to me you son of a wh re oh nickel jumped on the handlebars of my bike with excellent skill and we took off me peddling for dear life no one wanted to mess with mr nicholson once he had been crossed you could still see signs of nickel s last punishment across her left cheek and around her right temple the split lip had healed quickly nicholson s frustrated and drunken shouts had faded o nicholson s frustrated and drunken shouts had faded out once we rounded the corner that's all i go so far my favorite writer is stephen king the theme is friendship not quite sure what it's going to be about yet you are a talented writer what is the moral behind the story and what is it supposed to be about you have a few grammatical errors but otherwise it is very good One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Sin City Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Little Britain 1957 World Series Blood (computer game) Jon Secada Characters in the Smurfs Babe Ruth Social rule The Inside Russian joke The Isley Brothers Mountain bike Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ty Cobb Avenue Q The Time Machine Transformers: Cybertron Kodocha Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Great Teacher Onizuka Satchel Paige W.I.T.C.H.
