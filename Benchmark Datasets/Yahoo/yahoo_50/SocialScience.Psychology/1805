why is it that when ever people hurt me emotionally i can't hurt them back is not because i'm weak but just can't cause when i do i feel very bad in myself and then that could lead me to depression is something wrong with me you are absolutely wonderful to react that way the principle of love allows us to refrain from dishing back to someone the badness they do to us but that doesn't mean you can't use your backbone and tongue to stand tall and tell someone off folks need to hear about it when they hurt others it's not bad to be a mirror to make clear to them what they did wrong and how it hurts being sure of yourself helps to strengthen your own emotions and they might not be hurt so easily over time other's actions won't affect you as strongly if you can learn to regard your own opinions and feelings as valid worthy and appropriate there's nothing wrong with being sensitive and trusting but there's danger of being hurt because of the degree of vulnerability you have you can maintain your sense of self and still stand up to someone else it takes practice and trial and error to find the 'space' that feels most natural to you have faith in your own mind and heart you will be your own best friend until the day you die best wishes Theory of conduct Social rule Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
