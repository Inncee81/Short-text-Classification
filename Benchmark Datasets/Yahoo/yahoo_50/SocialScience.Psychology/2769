what does it mean when people can easily upset and confuse you destablize you just by them talking they no what buttons to press and they press them all you feel people use key words and insinuate at you just certain people though what is this is it me being over sensitive or is it them being nasty playing stupid mind games and if it is them how can i deal with it when it happens in the past ive experienced this in super markets people chatting near me behind me or in other checkouts by a gp doctor when theyve spoke to me detecting an air of indirect condesention and patronism different people basically i feel using key words to upset or confuse me i never no how to deal with it without anger building up and its like i become stunned into muteness im a year old bpd sufferer whos endured a very traumatic life and abuse i wait for therapy but as regards this problem can somebody tell me how to deal with that im a strait forward man i call a spade a spade i have no ulterior motives about me im full of integrity i tell it how it is and i hate mind games dont understand why people play them or where they come from but people who are like this are everywhere in society and society is the very place i have to go into if i want to vuild my life together so i dread coming into contact with these people i dont understand them or their behaviour i get angry at what i dont understand or if i dont no where a persons coming from with that boy do i know what it is to become stunned into muteness what i have found for myself is that my frame of mind and mood play a key role yes you do have to go out into society but you don't have to go out naked for all to see and poke fun at the behavior you are witinessing is what is called being human all of us posess actions of good and bad i would say there are several ways you can deal with this situation you can analize your intentions before you go out know what it is that you are going out for if you are also in need of human interaction decide just how far you want to carry this interaction as not to put you in a compromising situations stick to your plan take chances accept that people are going to be asses and that you need to take care of what you need in your life ask questions of those who aren't to frightening to you as to why they stated something or did something at the time it happens be pleasant and firm in your intonation you will be supprised by what some will say to you quite the opposite of what you were thinking or some may tell you that you are offensive in some way you can then work on correcting the offensiveness so this reduces the possibility of this happening in the future another senario is that although you say you don't go out of your way to get unwanted attention you may indeed be antagonizing others in your dealings with them by your attitude or body language aggressive or passive body language always gets attention and usually the wrong kind before you go out work on puttting yourself in a peaceful and focused state of mind do not reach out to others when they are not reaching out to you meaning if there is no intuitive connection between you and them leave them alone mind your own business ask god or your higher power to accompany you on your outings if you stay focused on an internal conversation with your higher power and ask for its help in dealing with others it is amazing how you can make it through hell and not get scorched join a support group at a local mental health agency or step program which can help you take the focus off of others and put it on where it belongs you you are indeed sensitive trust is a major issue with you i feel you it is important for you to feel comfortable within yourself i empathise i too have suffered for eighteen years of my life it is hard to feel apart of normal society when you feel like damaged goods it takes years to get a understanding of yourself and how your world impacts those around you that's all i can come up with off the top of my head hope something i have said has been of help to you good luck and god bless you Social rule Milton H.
