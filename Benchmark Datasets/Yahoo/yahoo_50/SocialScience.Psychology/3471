have you ever cried in your life why at birth as an infant when i had a need in the hospital at age for weeks having major surgery any time i fell down and scrapped a knee when some other kid would tease or bully me when i was molested at and was told i should have known better than to be alone with this person but then not at all for anything for years stone cold dry when my first love and i were broken up by my parents when i made all state chorus in hs tears of joy when life's choices didn't work out the way i'd hoped and i had to take a job in a factory to support my kids i'd always sworn i'd never follow in my parents' footsteps when my grandma died when the man i was seeing verbally abused me when i got up the guts to leave him almost a breakdown then nothing for years when i discovered that there are good men joy when i got married yrs ago joy when my grandsons were born joy when i see my daughters being friends having good husbands and darling sons and being happy such joy when i see any show or movie about middle aged sisters because i'd have given any appendage you might name to have had a sister and my life journey kept me too busy and too messed up emotionally to make female friends and now that is why i cry the most when i cry in sadness i don't know how to make friends EastEnders About a Boy Knots Landing Pitaten Kodocha Dead Like Me Boston Public Marie Antoinette Neighbours One Tree Hill (TV series) Fiddler on the Roof Good Times The Marshall Mathers LP Charmed One Life to Live Friends Shaggy dog story Butters Stotch Ren and Stimpy Past characters (Neighbours) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Emancipation of Mimi Melanie Wilkes The Death Gate Cycle George Burns Social rule Pok__mon (anime) Shawn Michaels The Giver The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Night (book) Billy Joel YuYu Hakusho Humphrey Bogart Family W.I.T.C.H.
