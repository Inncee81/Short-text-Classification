how dangerous is flirting in this situation i was talking to my niece this morning she got into trouble with her mother because although she was telling the truth it was more for teasing her mom her mom is seeing one guy across town on and off more on than off and she tells me it's not at all serious so she was talking on the phone with him and her daughter came into the room proclaiming her mom was flirting with so and so the other day on the quad in front of their apartment okay if her situation with guy wasn't serious then why did she flip out when her daughter teased her about flirting with new guy after she chastised her daughter she made up some cover story to guy what's the deal sounds like she doesn't want guy to know about guy but if neither relationship is serious what's the problem mom can play the field as long as she is unattached but may be inadvertently setting a not so good example for her daughter Social rule Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Recurring South Park characters Kodocha Ocean's Twelve Full Metal Panic?
