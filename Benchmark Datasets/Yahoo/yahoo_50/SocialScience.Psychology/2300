problems with a guy friend and his controlling girlfriend i have a good friend i've made this summer he's a guy and i'm a girl but there's nothing romantic going on between the two of us we genuinely are just friends here's where the problem lies however he has a girlfriend and i have to admit she does come off as a bit psychotically insecure and posessing extreme trust issues whenever i call my friend's phone she will take his phone and answer it then cusses me out and calls me every name in the book and that i have no reason to be talking to her boyfriend she emphasizes that quite a bit now normally i'd laugh it off but it's becoming rather extreme she's entered my name into his phone as don't answer and has been known to take his phone for weeks just to monitor who calls him she's also made him three way me a lot pretending to not be there and my friend will say something along the lines of you and i aren't friends i don't know how many times i must tell you this we still hang out behind her back any help she's also done this to a friend of mine named britt who is also his friend i guess she just does it to any girls who call his phone i'm not sure what to do about this though she seems as though she's wanting to fight me over the issue what should i do about this and how could i maybe convince my friend that she's unhealthy for him he's even admit to me before that he felt she might be crazy too and that he's fairly mixed on how he feels about her sometimes he wants to remain with her because the positive aspects of their relationship he really enjoys but also there's things like this he doesn't know how to handle the situation they've also broken up once but she goes into this wild cry fest and he feels too guilty to really end it they've been together for months now if you are confident in your ability to protect yourslef you may want to confront her and try as hard as you can to explain to her that she doesn't need to have this paranoia and jealousy or you can try to concince your friend to break up with her because behaviors like this are usually not concentrated in one area and she could be dangerous that's all i can say be careful Friends Theory of conduct Social rule Sharon Tate EastEnders Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Pitaten Time Out of Mind About a Boy Saved by the Bell Good Morning, Vietnam The Catcher in the Rye Something Positive Cool (song) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Charmed Phoebe Halliwell Humphrey Bogart Hermione Granger Kender One Tree Hill (TV series) George Costanza Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Daredevil Big Brother (USA TV series) Sin City Jean Grey Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The O.C.
