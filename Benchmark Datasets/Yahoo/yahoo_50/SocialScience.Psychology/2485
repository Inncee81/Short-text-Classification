can you imagine if your friends became long gone and you lost even your family strange turn of events for me had a big family everyone was real close done a lot of things in my life and lived in many places had many good friends but within a span of around five years i lost contact with past friends my family members all happened to pass away all from natural causes really strange to basically find myself an orphan with almost no contacts sort of like some kind of movie plot that i could ever imagine ever happening to me what would you do if suddenly you had no one no ties no obligations no reason but you could go anywhere do anything or not or why where would you go how i am years old now so i can relate to what you are saying in you statement most all of my friends from my past i've out lived my family on both my mom and dad sides are almost gone both that are still here are very sick i am blessed however to have two son's and five grand children on my side and two son's and one grand child on my wife's side i have made new friends having said all of that my suggestion to you would be to understand that you are still alive and can do anything you want without having to consider the needs of anyone else boy that opens a whole lot of doors from vegas to the great wall of china be out going don't be afraid to start a conversation you soon will find new friends life goes on don't be afraid to live it one last after thought stay away from alcohol it afflicts older people in such a detrimental way Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcoholics Anonymous About a Boy Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Simone Weil Jon Secada The Shining (film) Sant Thakar Singh The nature of God in Western theology Kodocha Xiaolin Showdown American Psycho Grandview, U.S.A.
