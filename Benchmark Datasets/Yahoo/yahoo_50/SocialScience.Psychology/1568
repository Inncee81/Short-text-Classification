have you ever had rage and anger against someone and didn't know why i have a nephew that has been on and off of drugs for the past years he is years old now his mom does everything she can to help him and is very patient with him he has agreed to go to a teen retreat for months to help with his problem he gets so enraged if she ask him any questions or tries to help him in anyway he says he doesn't know why himself but he stays mad at her and gets so furious and enraged at even thinking about her he admits she has only been good to him and he can't explain his feelings has anyone here ever been angry at someone whether they had a reason or not that just seemed to consume them to the point they couldn't let go and didn't know why if so what was the reason if there was one what did you do and how did you ever get past it he doesn't seem to have problems with anyone else than his mom anyone else can talk to him and ask the same questions but he gets so angry with her he doesn't seem to have problems with anyone else than his mom anyone else can talk to him and ask the same questions but he gets so angry with her the truth of the matter is that he is not mad at his mom but mad at himself that he is willing to accept help shows he knows he has his problems he probably has a lot of strong emotions within him and he does not know how to express it when his mom asks him questions it brings up these intense feelings that he cannot control them he is most likely not upset with his mom but with his then current state that the questions evoke though i hate to admit it i go through the same thing with my family when i am unhappy with myself i would withdraw inwardly i do not use rage as a form of expression but rather silence which i think is causing more problems than rage after some time i would realize i am not angry at others but at myself it is unlikely that he knows why this is happening but sadly he is the cause of the rage he will have to learn to accept that let him kow that he is loved but give him his space the rage is probably his defense mechanism against feelings that he may not fully understand yet give him time and be supportive but not over bearing encourage him to talk but do not push him if he is not ready to talk eventually he will understand his own feelings and be ready to open up Pok__mon Live!
