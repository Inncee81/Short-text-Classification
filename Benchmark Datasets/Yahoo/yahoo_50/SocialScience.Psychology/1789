friend thinks screaming is funny anxiety my friend think its hysterical to scream not only does she find screaming herself funny but hearing other people scream she is and records herself screaming and then begs me to listen to the recordings and laughs hysterically for hours at it this is not surprising to me considering her older brother records himself farting they also tell me they have recorded their screams and farts since they were children so they pretty much have a box set full of their screams and farts throughout the years this is a very annoying thing because whenever someone is being funny or laughing at something my friend will scream everyone will jump up and get irritated and then she will laugh about it i can't understand why she finds screaming so funny she even laughs when babies are crying she is a great friend but its so irritating has anyone else ever heard of finding screaming amusing could it be that she has a form of anxiety and releases it through screaming people just have those random things that make them laugh in your friend's case obviously it's screaming be real with her tell her it weirds people out when she screams to be funny or something but don't rain on her parade if she enjoys it after all it's the simple things in life that keep us going Shaggy dog story Spidey Super Stories Ron and Fez Rain Man Episodes of Lost (Season 1) I Want to Hold Your Hand AFI 100 Years series Good Morning, Vietnam Salad Fingers I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Doug Avenue Q Friends Highway 61 Revisited Squidward Tentacles EastEnders Spice Girls I Am Furious Yellow Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Timeline of alternative rock Have I Got News For You Humphrey Bogart Oasis (band) Time Out of Mind Bart chalkboard gags Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga The Care Bears (television series) Beatles for Sale The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Jennifer Lopez Internet phenomenon The Inside Undergrads Jackass: The Movie Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Dave Grohl Graham Kennedy Shit Mojave people Hide and Q (TNG episode) Toilet humour Unhinged The Ashlee Simpson Show Rich Mullins Aliens of London Family Guy The Amber Spyglass Real Love (song) God Emperor of Dune Papa Lazarou Marie Antoinette Dilbert Elijah Wood The Smiths The Doctor Dances Garfield Joke 3rd Rock from the Sun Futurama (TV series - season 5) Escape from New York Sampling (music) Cliff Richard Kender Horror film Milton H.
