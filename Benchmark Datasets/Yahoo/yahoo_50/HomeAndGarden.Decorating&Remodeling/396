hancock fabrics preferred customer card i was just wondering i purchased a fabric in hancock fabrics which i would like to return but i can't find the receipt of the purchase i bought the item less than days ago so i would get store credit for that fabric which is totally fine with me but it would be the lowest price that the fabric was for within last days my question is do they store information about previous purchases on the preferred customer card and would it work instead of a receipt so i could actually get back the same money i paid for the fabric thank you for any answers hi please see the hancock return policy on the link i read it and it states they ask for your receipt but considering you do have the customer card they certainly have records of your purchase and they should honor your return at least in my opinion anyway the contact info is easy so give it a try http www hancockfabrics com custserv customerservicemain jsp cid Internet fraud Electronic commerce Credit card Surveillance Annuity Commodore 64 Arbitrage Loyalty program Argos (retailer) Sears Holdings Corporation RFID JavaServer Pages $ale of the Century Plame affair EFTPOS ITunes Music Store Hyperinflation Filling station Domain Name System Oyster card Contract Data retention Illegal drug trade Taxation in the United States Wal-Mart Bulk vending Best Buy Credit card fraud HyperText Transfer Protocol United Kingdom corporation tax Citigroup Marks & Spencer Auto insurance Money Great Depression Mattress Babylonian law Automatic teller machine MetroCard Bank Phishing Animal Crossing Stock Online shop The Amazing Race Final Fantasy Tactics Advance British national identity card Supermarket Gross domestic product Rebate (marketing) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pricing Minimum wage United States Postal Service Monopoly (game) Fry's Electronics Economy of Chile Electronic money Octopus card Library catalog Inflation Cross site scripting Retailer ITunes Smart card Short selling Australian legislative election, 2004 HTTP cookie CPU design Revco Pseudoarchaeology Digital rights management FairTax Currency Gold standard Nintendo 64 Social Security (United States) Billboard Hot 100 Labor theory of value Jeopardy!
