outside corners on drywall comes with paper no holes things changed since the last time i bought corners now they come with no holes and pre covered in paper do i just drive nails through the whole thing no you do not you use no nails whatsoever what you do is spread mud on the corner of the wall fairly thickly then you take the outside corner and press it into the mud take some more mud and spread it over the outside corner run your taping knife down the length of the outside corner to get a fairly smooth spread let it dry come back the next day scrape off the rough bits and spread some more mud on do that another time after the next coat dries it's a step process coats getting gradually smoother just like all other spackle jobs i had to come back to emphasize something cause i see someone answered before me and he is incorrect like i already stated you must spread mud on the wall first and press the outside corner into it to embed it you then spread mud over the outside corner you never put a corner up like that without mud on the underside it'll pop off in a very short time mud must go on both sides it's the same principal as putting drywall tape on it gets embedded in the mud Drywall Seismic retrofit Knife Woodworking Mud People Tire Textile manufacturing Rail tracks Punch card 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wound Stairway Car handling Printed circuit board Evidence of evolution Opportunity rover Floppy disk Shroud of Turin Manicure Log cabin Tlingit Screw Wood Drag racing Gramophone record Violin Turing machine Casting Clarinet Green Day Sea ice Wire 1957 World Series Rathfarnham Laws of cricket Katana Diving suit Temporal bone Apollo Guidance Computer Barbed wire Central processing unit Nine Inch Nails Genericized trademark Wrigley Field Wood carving Equine conformation Book Professional wrestling throws Horse gait Textile manufacturing terminology Adobe Masonry Professional wrestling match types Radar Columbine High School massacre Shaggy dog story Solar cell Glossary of American football Hard disk Escape from New York Pottery Jackass: The Movie Nail (engineering) Nirvana (band) Baroque chess Mouse (computing) Ministry (band) Architecture of the California missions Upholstery Battle of Agincourt Sherlock Holmes Trish Stratus Skateboarding trick Virus Nunchaku Blood Simple Father's Day (Doctor Who) Archery Pavement (material) Lake Golf Radiohead Billboard Hot 100 Friction Comanche Postage stamp separation Professional wrestling attacks Table tennis Capernaum Paper CPU cache Leaf Compact disc Anchor Pinball Trench warfare MUD Betting (poker)
