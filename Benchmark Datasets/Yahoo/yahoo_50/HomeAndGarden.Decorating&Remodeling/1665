i think it's time that i redo my room it's been a few years since i've redone my room and even more years since i've painted it i'm getting laminate flooring by december i don't have a very big bugdet probably not too much more than other than ikea what are good cheap but pretty good quality stores and what are some good color schemes i was thinking about whites blues greens and purples or maybe red black and white you should probably choose neutral colors for your flooring and walls in my opinion so that you can update change the accent colors in the room as often as you like i change my accent colors based on seasons and my cream walls and wood floor go great with any colors good luck and have fun Color theory Color Lighting Light-emitting diode Liturgical colours Wood Koi Glass Wallpaper group Liturgical year Discus (fish) Black Upholstery Bubble Bobble Color space Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Harrow School Dragon Booster Yellow Dodge Charger Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Billiards Japanese tea ceremony Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room Cyndi Lauper Primary color Oakland Athletics Color blindness James McNeill Whistler Red Ribbon Army Saturday Night Live Gamut Color Graphics Adapter Double Dragon Collectibles in Bionicle The Warriors PNG Crayola Fluorescent lamp CMYK color model Aes Sedai Political colour Pysanka Yu-Gi-Oh!
