exterior paint job on home old color visible thru new color i've hired a company to paint my home they said they will apply one coat of paint i've noticed that there are many spots of the old color still visible through the new color you can see the paintbrush strokes as if it was just applied more thinly in the spot the house was light grey and is being painted a dark grey does that really count as one true coat should they go back and re do the parts where the old color is still visible up close thru the old color or is this being too perfectionistic i have never heard of a professional painter or painting company specifying that they would apply one coat of paint being the original color was a light grey and the new is dark grey you'r problem is simply there hasn't been enough of the new coating applied regardless of the specified number of coats of paint the first coat should have been applied adequately enough to have effectively covered your description tells me that they either thinned out the coating too much or used a cheap or maintenance grade product i would hold them to the mat and not pay until the house has a uniform color if they're providing you this service they should be professional and know better then to try to represent this as acceptable mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com Paint Union Pacific Railroad Drawing Blue Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Vitreous enamel Fluorescent lamp Tincture (heraldry) Frans Hals Color theory Glass Liquid crystal display Leopard Black Corrosion Textile manufacturing terminology Tag Titanium Casting Colours, standards and guidons Light-emitting diode Glaze Professional wrestling slang Stage lighting Microsoft Paint Diamond enhancement Wood Cat coat genetics Color blindness Photography Fancy rat Solar cell Wassily Kandinsky Plastic Wallpaper group Piet Mondrian Lighting Table tennis British Rail Class 317 Solar power Michel Henry Software engineering Professional wrestling throws Glasses Diamond cut HyperText Transfer Protocol Gray Wolf De Lorean DMC-12 Wayne Corporation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Zinc Primer (paint) Starfleet ranks and insignia Japanese tea ceremony Iris (anatomy) Loudspeaker Printed circuit board Stereoscopy Rendering (computer graphics) Tintoretto Brush Camouflage Compact fluorescent lamp Keeshond Motor oil Horse Pottery Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Education in the People's Republic of China Pixel Impressionism Snooker Georges-Pierre Seurat Logo Abstraction Software patent debate Leica Gamut New York City Subway nomenclature Eyepiece Pennsylvania Railroad BNSF Railway Wal-Mart Ontological argument DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Call centre Massage Painting Professional wrestling holds Stucco Great Dane Beret Incandescent light bulb Circuit design Watercolor painting Academic art Modern geocentrism Massachusetts State House Mattress
