can a renter demand new carpet it is dirty and old a combination of the answers already given is the best answer if the tenant agrees to rent with the carpet in that condition they have to accept it except in two cases if local laws have safety requirements and the product has become unsafe or if the unit is government subsidised and you can prove that the product does not meet minimum fha hud specifications otherwise the renter can only demand it be changed before renting or not take the unit note that even in the two cases above it could turn into a long and ugly court battle if the soiling is from renter's use the renter should be charged for not taking proper care of the carpet unless one of the above circumstances are present the best advice is try to work it out with the landlord by paying for it and having some taken off your rent or sharing the expense and work together this really is the best approach anyway as it is non confrontational in a case like this always simple respect for all parties and common sense should prevail hope that helps Rental agreement Leasehold estate Leasing Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Renting Eviction Contract Apartment Housing cooperative New Deal Neville Chamberlain Babylonian law Parliament of the United Kingdom Mortgage Labor theory of value Appeal United States labor law Treaty American individualist anarchism Trade union Unlawful combatant Abortion in the United States Abortion debate Supply and demand Organic farming Monopoly (game) Land use forecasting Rent control Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Explosive material Law of value Public good Barrister Copyright Royal Assent Annuity Liberalism Plame affair Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Property (ownership right) Australian constitutional law Divorce Scottish clan Fathers' rights movement in the UK Unreformed House of Commons Real estate economics Speed limit Trust (Law) USA Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Food and Drug Administration Waste (law) Politics of Russia Judiciary of Hong Kong Parliament of Canada President of Germany Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Socialist economics Supreme Court of the United States Section 8 (housing) Air traffic control Anarchism and capitalism Insurance Irish Land Act Charles I of England GNU General Public License Welding Negligence Subsidy Surplus value Education in the People's Republic of China Mediation Stairway Tax Epistemology Head of state Software engineering Blockbuster Video Jury trial Tithe Originalism Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Bretton Woods system Exploitation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme United States Senate Coercion Act of Parliament Abortion Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 9 ACORN Gross domestic product Who is a Jew?
