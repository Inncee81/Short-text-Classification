getting paint stains off of a parquet floor i spilt a can of white paint on my parquet floor and i am trying to get the stains off i have got virtually everything off with white spirits but there is still a little faded patch where the paint spilt could i get rid of this via varnishing or will anything else remove it or will i have to live with it do you still have paint on the floor or is the polyurethane worn if there is still paint on the floor and it was latex paint that was spilled see if you can find a product called krud kutter i use it to get paint off my hardwood floors and it works beautifully without taking up the top coat or stain it will also take care of any milky areas that are left from the white paint if the polyurethane is faded and there are no milky spots you can put another coat of polyurethane overtop of it and this will bring back the luster in your floor but if you still have some paint spots they will still be visable through the new coat of polyurethane sand lightly and reapply make sure the polyurethane is meant for floor traffic though also varethane makes a refinishing kit that will do this without sanding it down i've heard people have gotten good results with that the first thing to try however might be a good floor cleaner sometimes those will bring back the luster of wood floors Polyurethane Upholstery Paint Mattress Plastic Casting Parquetry Epoxy Varnish Wood Condom Drill bit Carpet Plywood Woodworking Violin Pottery Volleyball Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Safe sex Nunchaku Strap-on dildo Brush Wood carving Xanadu House Tibetan people Lapis lazuli Vacuum cleaner Menstrual cup Christmas tree Stairway Tire Home repair Heraldry Henri Murger Diving suit Jumpstart 3rd Grade Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Appaloosa Diamond cut Tobacco Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Peanut Cello Leather Wood finishing Latex Super Mario 64 Scale model Vertigo (film) Tattoo Dodge Charger Manhunt (video game) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Fancy rat Vitreous enamel Wassily Kandinsky Bonfires of Saint John Tag St. Peter's Basilica Glossary of partner dance terms Softball Customs and etiquette of Japan Black Ultraviolet Titanium Shroud of Turin The Dalek Invasion of Earth Horse Fire fighting Diamond Kitchen Clarinet Harrow School The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Logging The Human Stain Japanese tea ceremony Marquetry Hydrogen peroxide White House Professional wrestling holds Laser engraving Justification (theology) Netsuke Toyota Prius The Caves of Androzani Birthmark Hardwood Urinary incontinence Bulk vending BMW M5 Guinea pig Anchor Impact crater Manicure Sandpaper Social aspects of clothing Boom Town (Doctor Who)
