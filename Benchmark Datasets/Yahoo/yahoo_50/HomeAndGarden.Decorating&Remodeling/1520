is this a cool design idea for a baby girl's room i didn't know what category to put this in well i had tripets two boys and one girl three weeks ago and right now they are all in one room in a few weeks we're going to move our girl tallon into her own room and let the boy's merrick and chandler share i thought it would be really cool to do a really girly theme so my mom made a purple comforter i can't remember what it's called i'm a little brain dead thing for her crib and we have pink sheets but i wanted to paint the walls light pink with clouds and little jets going in between clocks real clocks with the times the actual times from some of the major fashion capitols of the world with the city's name by them and for pictures i have some swatches and patterns and other sewing things framed the boy's room is panted like under water themed the walls are blue and then there's sand colored with seaweed and shells and things at the bottom and there's fish the ceiling has like the bottom of a boat and then more blue with lighter blue to make it look like the sun is shining on it and some of the fish and things come off the wall they are velcrow ed on so a fashion design themed room and an under water room yay or neigh their rooms are connected by a door so we can leave it open and they can still hear each other and whatever in tallon's room we are going to put a full length mirror on the door to camoflage no clue how to spell that it and in the boy's room we just painted it blue and it blends in pretty well i envy people like you with creative ideas i have one boy and two girls and your ideas sound darling to me how are you coming up with such intricate details with triplet newborns good luck to you The Shining (film) Paul Is Dead Rococo Pink Floyd Castlevania: Symphony of the Night The Wall Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Samus Aran Traditional animation The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll EastEnders W.
