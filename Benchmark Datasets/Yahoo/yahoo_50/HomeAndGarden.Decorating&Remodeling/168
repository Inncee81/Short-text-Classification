i need idea's for a beach themed room hey everyone i could use some help i'm a teen and i want to redo my room i was thinking that a beach themed room would be so cool because i love the beach although i don't live near one i have a beautiful navy blue quilt that my grandma made i really want to use that but i don't know how to really match that with a beach themed room i love the color blue for my walls and for anything i also like sea shells dolphins and things like that most of the places i've found that have beach themed items are too old please give me something to work with thanks god bless sand sand lots of sand no just kidding that would be a nightmare maybe with your grandma's quilt you can make pillows from beach towels like the old fashioned red white striped towels that would be cute you could go a little retro and get one of those lamps filled with all sorts of sea shells but put a cool shade on top depending on the size shape of your room you could use a cool beachy type chair as extra seating or a reading chair for my friends room we were able to contact j crew which was popular at the time and get a life size poster of a model he was at the beach so we cut him out and used him on her wall maybe something like that use an ambercrombie fitch ad beachy scene on the walls or better yet snap some photo's of you and your friends at the beach or pool use a waterproof disposable so you dont' ruin a good camera do you know anyone that's good at art if so get an old window pane and take out the glass so it's just the wooden pane you can even buy these at craft stores paint it to look old weathered crackle paint and get a canvas backing that fits the back of the frame have you or a friend paint a beach landscape on the canvas to hang on the wall so it would look like a window looking outside for your furniture try a shabby chic style good luck Upholstery Lighting Mattress Glass Wilton House SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Wood carving Beach Rococo Napoleon Dynamite Sento Casting Door Window Animal Crossing Mary Cassatt Francis Bacon (painter) White House The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Fire fighting Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing terminology The Truman Show The Time Machine John Hancock Tower Garfield Frankie Laine Pok__mon Snap Ed, Edd n Eddy RuneScape quests Piet Mondrian Dodge Charger Wassily Kandinsky Color Pysanka Strap-on dildo Christmas tree Art Sunglasses The Beach Boys Brett Whiteley Traditional animation Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Tent Fluorescent lamp Harrow School Professional wrestling match types Color theory The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Martin Sharp Clothing Marilyn Monroe Hey Arnold!
