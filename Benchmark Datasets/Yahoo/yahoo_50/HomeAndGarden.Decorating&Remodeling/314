can i paint without sanding can i paint or stain on dressers without sanding them down first one i want to do an expresso color and the other like a navy blue for my sons room i want it to look good but all that sanding s down i do not really have time for if i have to sand what kind is good fast and pretty inexpensive typically a little sanding is best when you want the best results depending on the age of the piece it will already have some type of finish on it old paint will need to be removed using a striper of some sort hopefully your piece is newer and may only require a new primer coat using a piece of steel wool makes the sanding easier the sanding is required to make a new paint or primer coat adhere to the piece so all your really trying to do is scratch the surface lowe's has a lacquer based primer in a spray can this primer can be put over almost anything and oil or latex can be put over it Paint Casting Pottery Lacquer Plastic Glass Drill bit Mattress Internal ballistics Woodworking Radio controlled airplane Stucco Diving suit Solar cell Varnish Light-emitting diode Wood finishing Upholstery Friction Arcade cabinet Soap Brazing Welding Strap-on dildo Sand casting Leather Carpet Primer (molecular biology) Gunsmith Water purification Wok Wood carving Heinkel He 100 Domestic rabbit Fire extinguisher Volleyball Gramophone record Titanium Printed circuit board Saxophone Japanese tea ceremony Aluminium Sewage treatment Drawing Polymerase chain reaction Explosive material Billiards Amateur telescope making Dinghy Bulk vending Printmaking Lionel Corporation Brush Anchor Sunglasses Fire fighting Textile manufacturing terminology Airsoft Steel Cartridge (firearms) Theory of conduct Collecting fossils Condom Sundial Traditional animation Thermal power station Glossary of sculpting terms Brewery Laser engraving Compact disc Textile manufacturing Wind turbine Gas metal arc welding Diesel engine Knife CPU design Double bass Dune Stained glass Epoxy Table tennis Bullet Circuit design Sandpaper Firearm Chopsticks Vitreous enamel Hemp Menstrual cup Color Cat Gesso Hand grenade Corrosion Solar power Anti-aircraft warfare Diamond enhancement
