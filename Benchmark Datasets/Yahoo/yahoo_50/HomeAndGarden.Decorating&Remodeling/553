good color for a bathroom we just moved into a new house and one of the bathrooms is purple and i want to re paint it but can't decide on a good color we already have a blue one and a tan one any advice i'm not sure how much you're into color but gray is a nice color for a bathroom i decorated it with lavendar and chrome accessories otherwise maybe a sage green for a neutral look but more calming and neutral a dark sea green is a nice color for an ocean feel here's some other bathroom examples too Color theory Color Wassily Kandinsky Dragon Booster New York City Subway nomenclature Beret M&M's Wallpaper group Light-emitting diode Sunglasses Yohoho!
