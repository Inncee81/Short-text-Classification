what are the best paints for decorating a wooden chair i recently painted an old chair in an artsy craftsy style with all of those little dots squiggles etc in brights and pastels i used my acrylic tube paint for the base which seemed to be a possible mistake due to the amount i needed the decorative paints i used were mostly from paint pens that are oil based i did not know whether i needed to use some sort of protective cover after finishing either is there a better way to do this the arcylic tube paint was a good choice because actually the paints should be at least mixed with acrylic or acylic based all you need to do is now apply a clear laquer finish paint it all over the surface Lacquer Paint Painting Acrylic paint Brush Drawing Stucco Watercolor painting Plastic Tire Gesso Wood carving Cathode ray tube Paper marbling Lighting Lilo & Stitch Leather Bong Casting Dice Oscilloscope Christo and Jeanne-Claude Light-emitting diode Tempera Chair Wassily Kandinsky Panel painting Oil painting Pysanka Manicure Laser engraving Sento Printmaking Art Glaze Brewery Artillery Drill bit Painter and decorator Woodworking Bass guitar Socrates Barbell (piercing) Solar power Gas metal arc welding Francis Bacon (painter) Color theory Great Pyramid of Giza Epoxy Totem pole Tattoo Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Impressionism Drew Struzan Thermal power station Metal leaf Mattress Emily Kngwarreye London Underground Radio controlled airplane Diamond cut Strap-on dildo Welding Carol Biberstein Japanese tea ceremony Union Pacific Railroad Mary Cassatt Ocean thermal energy conversion Internal ballistics Seismic retrofit Vincent van Gogh Acid chloride Paintball Pottery Tile Palace of Westminster Operation Petticoat Massage French Rococo and Neoclassicism Pinturicchio Aluminium Japanese art Fluorescent lamp Wood finishing Cubism Solar cell Wire Table tennis Architecture of the California missions Motor oil Central processing unit Dialysis Brett Whiteley Biodiesel Georges-Pierre Seurat Air-raid shelter Bicycle lighting Knife Vitreous enamel
