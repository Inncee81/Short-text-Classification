what are some good room themes for a year old girl you can say a website expcept http girlsthemebedrooms com or www teenthemes com hi great question i actually design children's rooms for a living and have two daughters of my own so i hope i can give you some ideas to consider first i would recommend you consider not going with a theme they tend to appear dated and worn quickly they are outgrown quickly and almost always clash with your preteens next favorite trendy theme the best theme is her her interests her personality not a cartoon image of some other girl cute though she may be her room should reflect her personality but not necessarily be crowded with fussy stereotypical girl stuff certainly a feminine room is adorable but unless bubblegum pink frufru truly represents her personality or the personality of your family it becomes tiresome here are a few tried and true techniques but there are really no hard rules paint the walls a forgiving color sage green sky blue pale shell pink even a subdued lavender will give you an easy background to work with and will grow with her as her interests change and mature paint the ceiling in a deeper value of the same color or a complimentary color to add interest and give the room a finished look if you choose to use wallpaper it should be kept simple and limited to the lower half of the room divided by a chair rail with painted wall above create zones the bed for sleeping obviously an area for study reading with a desk bulletin board and bookcase a comfy upholstered reading chair is a bonus if you have the space and an area for play with appropriate toy storage make sure her closet is properly outfitted for usability by her either lower the clothing rail or make sure she has a good sturdy step stool so she can hang her own clothes and hooks for coats backpacks uniforms etc this will help her keep her own space organized and avoid a constantly cluttered look with toys books and clothes all over the place incorporate collections yours and or hers and keep them grouped neatly a teaset that was yours next to the teaset that is hers on a pretty wall mounted shelf makes a piece of artwork that isn't expensive and can be changed easily to say seashells she collects next year when you go to the beach frame or pieces of her best artwork make them bold and important with black frames and studio white mattes overscale ie an x watercolor in a x frame these can also be changed overtime and the frames need not be expensive i use ikea frames and have the artwork mounted at a local frame shop this is good for her self esteem of course and also trains her eye to selection and agreement of style as she chooses the next group of pieces she would like to display her interests can give you clues for other artwork music horses soccer you name it all can be tastefully incorporated as long as it is given pride of place and not just stuck around the room as an afterthought against everything you have probably heard invest in the best quality bed linens you can afford they will pay for themselves in the long run if you choose well choose the colors the same way recommended for the paint colors and launderability is highly recommended my favorite line is bella notte they're lasting and versatile all of their fabrics are prelaundered and launderable and their color selection is terrific add pattern with shams and or pillowcases this is also where you might bring in some of the themed pieces she likes without going to the expense of doing the whole room in it high quality task specific lighting is crucial cheap lighting and by cheap i mean low quality not low price can ruin an otherwise lovely room she needs an overhead central perhaps a chandelier if you like or a ceiling fan again no themes here with a good light kit if recessed lighting around the room is possible it is a worthy investment she also needs a desk lamp and a lamp on her nightstand and a pair on her dresser if she has one a pair of wall mounted sconces would work also the lamps need not match it's better if they don't but they should be appropriate for their application well planned lighting in even the plainest white room can make it look like a well designed space furniture should be kept simple and depending on your taste need not match it is rare to see a well designed room that is based on a suite of copycat pieces the catalogs show it all the time of course but most of us don't live on catalog pages this is another time to buy the best quality your budget allows and also to challenge your notion of what can be used to suit a particular purpose childrens rooms lend themselves well to incorporating old repurposed pieces with a twist my husband's grandmothers french server is way to formal for my dining room but is ideal as the dresser vanity in my girls room they're also learning to care for a piece that is important to the family not just another toy or disposable mom will take care of my mess piece their armoire was a splurge because we don't have closets but their night tables were ea at a garage sale with a coat of paint and new hardware no one knows they used to belong to a waterbed suite but me edit ruthlessly they don't need half of what we think they do i hope this gives you some useful information good luck and have fun with your project Light-emitting diode
