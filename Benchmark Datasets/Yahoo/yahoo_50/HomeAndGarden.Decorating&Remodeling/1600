is this a supporting wall in the basement i have a bedrooms in the basement and want to knock one wall down so it is a large bedroom i am not sure if it is a supporting wall one room is ft ft sq ft the other is ft and ft sq ft the lunary room is on the other side of the rooms and its the same length of both rooms there is a large metal thing that goes thur the middle of the basement its on the celling and there is also beams that support the metal thing it goes thur the whole house on the basement selling with the beams holding it is this a supporting wall or can i knock it down to make a bigger room the lunary room is the same length of both rooms without any walls i am an architect and as the previous guy said an expert has to look at the blueprints the large metal thing that you mention doesn't seem to be structural to me as those beams dont seem to be supporting it i'm only going on what you said beams support the upper structure and have to rest on columns that carry the loads down they cannot be used to carry the weight of horizontal members that lie on the same plane as they do look at where the beams end the nodes the columns would be at these points my guess is that that wall is structural as it is in the basement no one would put a wall there unless is was for a good reason either to create two separate spaces or to carry a load or both but as i said before your description is insufficient and no expert will be able to give you healthy advice unless they are shown the structural blueprints good luck with that wall Basement Ship Seismic retrofit Stairway Kitchen Equine conformation Doom engine Antenna (radio) Chatsworth House Timber framing Truss Bungalow Cantilever Collision detection Wood Passenger car Glossary of climbing terms Glossary of partner dance terms Solomon's Temple Solar cell Textile manufacturing Straw-bale construction White House Anchor Bristol Grammar School Basement Jaxx Terminal ballistics Chinese architecture Temporal bone Alhambra Bad Wolf Drill bit Buckling Beam (structure) Loudspeaker Deck (ship) Internal ballistics Le Corbusier Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Saturn V Jumpstart 3rd Grade Retaining wall The Brady Bunch Abbey Wonderland (McFly album) DNA Truss bridge Metal Gear (video game) Suspension bridge Heraldry Sydney Harbour Bridge Buckingham Palace Headlight Xanadu House Items in the Metroid series Horseshoe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Elevator McMansion Glacier Rigging Action potential Air-raid shelter Aluminium Spark plug Betting (poker) Prostate cancer Wilton House Irish Houses of Parliament Welding Palace of Westminster Expert system Linked list I Want to Hold Your Hand The Suffering (game) Otakon Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Electrophysiology The Pentagon Combine (Half-Life 2) Classical order Ocean's Twelve Space elevator Scenes from a Memory Dundas Square TARDIS Sin City Blood on the Tracks Sail-plan Meiosis SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Galaxy Angel XML Faster-than-light Mattress Vegeta Radiation therapy
