paint a rented room hi i am a student living on my own for the second year i'll be asking permission from my landlord and under the condition they accept it'll be a short time but because i tend to get extremely depressed during the winter and being half a continent from home i thought about painting the room that i've rented for the year and might intend to sublet for the last months i know that painting the whole place would be too much so i just want to paint the empty white wall wall only directly across from the door a light springy green however my parents are saying that it's very hard to make coloured rooms white again and in the case that i'm painting one wall if i repaint it to white afterwards the white might not match the rest of the room in which case i'd have to paint everything they said it'd be best if i find a kind of paint that is peel off but i can't seem to find such a thing a little sad and looking for help how would you stick up fabric would spray adhesives not leave marks peel off paint oh i have the best solution for you my husband and i are going to do this in our next apartment get a really large canvas or even just a large thin sheet of plywood or something on a frame and paint that the color you like and hang it on the wall that way it is colorful and artistic looking and you can take it with you when you move even if you knock together a frame yourself and stretch and staple a white sheet to it and paint the sheet it can be done very cheaply if you do it with fabric you might want to paint the fabric white first and let it dry and then paint it the color you like so the paint dries the color you want good luck Paint Seismic retrofit Casting Christmas tree Japanese tea ceremony Upholstery Color Plastic Wood Traditional animation Painting Screen-printing Curling Glass Bulk vending Pastel Canvas L.
