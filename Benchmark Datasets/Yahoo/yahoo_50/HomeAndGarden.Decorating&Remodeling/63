how do i get myself motivated to organize my room i need help to be motivated whenever i try to organize my room i start with the small things while i am doing the small things i stop and stare at something that i have not seen or used in a while and think to myself wow geez i wonder if should even use this or give it to someone else so please can someone help me be motivated thank you i know what you mean it often takes me a while to organize or rearrange rooms but i have found there are definite dos and don'ts vividly imagine what exactly you want plan to do most in that room map or list how you would like the big things arranged list any important smaller things that you want in the room take everything except furniture that stays in the room out of the room it doesn't matter if you box it up bag it or carry things out a few at a time it doesn't matter if you put in on the kitchen table the living room floor or out in the yard just get it out of the room do any cleaning that needs to be done in the room you'll never get a more perfect opportunity than when it is nearly empty and you'll regret it if you don't arrange the furniture as imagined in your mind leave the room for a break come back if you smile or sigh with relief when you come back the room is perfect otherwise figure out what's wrong and fix it now start going through the little things if you don't know if you want it in the room set it aside boxes or baskets should do once you have together everything you want back in the room put them exactly where you want them if there is a home for everything you'll always know where it goes now check to see if anything is missing do you need to get anything out of those boxes because the room just isn't right without it if so put the articles in place then set the boxes aside the room is done now you can go through the boxes at your leisure without it interfering with your project and it will be enjoyable instead of stressful hint starting with small things is deadly it's a trap that will keep you from getting the job done happy organizing G-Man (Half-Life) Social rule Poker jargon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Star Wars Holiday Special Aliens of London Episodes of Lost (Season 1) CPU cache Ocean's Twelve Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Hall & Oates Haven (TNG episode) Kitchen Friends Jumpstart 3rd Grade Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Glossary of partner dance terms God Emperor of Dune Milton H.
