can i paint the walls of my rented apartment hi i am renting my apartment the paint on the walls is quite old and i would like to change it is it allowed to paint the wall without asking the lodger i would like to go for a bright color like red i rent the apartment to a landlord i don't own it sorry it wasn't clear you would definatly have to ask them and would probably have to pay for it if they said yes if they say yes but only to neutral colours then try what i did show them samples of your intended colour scheme and offer to repaint it when you move out back to neutral and at your own expense if they don't go for it then there are ways of brightening up the wall without decorating you can create a feature wall using interesting black and white photos no order to them just scatterd over one wall use all different sizes with mix and match colour style frames or you can amke your own wall hangings with bright or bold patterned material again mixing and matching works well Lighting Color theory Color Camouflage Leasehold estate Color space Digital photography Harlem Wallpaper Christmas tree Grace Cossington Smith Monopoly (game) Pottery Color blindness Snooker Chatsworth House Public housing Wassily Kandinsky Fischer Random Chess Autostereogram Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Public Eye Wallpaper group Vehicle registration plate Sicilian Baroque Color Graphics Adapter Sistine Chapel Staining (biology) HTML element Original Amiga chipset Pablo Picasso Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Martin Sharp Door Apartment Wilton House White House Billboard (advertising) Who Framed Roger Rabbit Comanche Glaze Renting Vincent van Gogh Taxicab Wood carving Kimono Modding CIE 1931 color space White British Rail Class 317 NTSC Circuit design Light-emitting diode Art Piet Mondrian Art in Ancient Greece Casting Irish Land Act Bicycle lighting Compact disc Color temperature L.
