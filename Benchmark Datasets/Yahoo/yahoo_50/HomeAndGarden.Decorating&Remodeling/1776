painting question so i told the guy at wal mart i wanted satin paint and he gave me flat i didn't notice until part of one wall is pretty much dry is there a way to give it a satin finish without having to go buy more paint is there some sort of gloss i can get first mistake was wal mart paint notice the strong odor from the paint it is diluted with ammonia and the other paints they sell like glidden it is all the same paint they have actually ruined glidden they demanded a thinned down paint to sell cheap so you buy paint and ammonia mixed secondly any wall paint with a shine is going to show every imperfection you have and it will look worse if it is a newer home if you want a long lasting satin finish i would use a semi gloss or eggshell because the sheen is going to fade away after about a year anyway if they painted new house walls with semi gloss they would never sell one because most of the work on a new house is half ssed paint is like everything else you get what you pay for cheap paint looks cheap and normally takes twice as many coats to completely cover the surface to get a good finish it will take two coats of quality paint maybe three depending on the color change and i do not mean home depot or lowes when i say quality and no there is nothing you can get to go over the paint to make it satin you can try but be prepared for a color other than what you wanted because the clear stuff will turn yellow the only time i ever done that was on an estate that had black walls anymore questions just ask i now run the family biz painting comapny has been around for years and still have our original clients along with many new ones true professional not just a half ss chump with a brush and a truck Paint Typewriter Casting Titanium Glaze Illegal drug trade Plastic Textile manufacturing terminology Ammonia Wal-Mart Leather Hydrogen economy Totem pole Bat Lash Bulk vending Light-emitting diode Pottery Dairy AC/DC Brush Poker jargon Diving suit One Tree Hill (TV series) Wood carving Hey Jude Color theory Impressionism Theory of conduct Supply and demand Heinkel He 100 Aluminium Piet Mondrian Microeconomics Piccolo Junior Saga Guinea pig Mattress Frans Hals Solar power Drill bit Cosmetics Diamond cut Short selling Gameplay of StarCraft Red Hot Chili Peppers Carl Barks Color Sampling (music) Mutual fund Nintendo Entertainment System Laserdisc Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tofu Floppy disk Upholstery Lacquer Backstroke Hard disk Oakland Athletics Ocean's Twelve Cloud Barbed wire Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Digital photography Penske Racing YuYu Hakusho Wood Manicure Painting The Ashlee Simpson Show Photography Blood on the Tracks Paul Is Dead Lance Armstrong Craps Bicycle lighting Gilding Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Grammatical aspect Crystal Palace F.C.
