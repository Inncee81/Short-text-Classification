i want to try reglazing my bathroom tile tub and sink instead of remodeling does anyone know if this really works looks good and lasts if you are using some liquid i doubt it would look anywhere near as good as what the original did bathroom tile and even the glaze on a tub goes through a heating process to set it you aren't going to get that look with any after market application i think i'd recommend replacing them i'm surprized the tile needs reglazed that should only need cleaned a good tile glazing should last for years and years and years real glaze is basically the same thing as glass Pottery Glass Dishwasher Tessellation Cookware and bakeware Solar power Lead Tile St Albans Cathedral Kitchen Water (molecule) Uranium Mahjong Dymaxion house Top-bar hive Ceramics The Brady Bunch Window Drill bit Sydney Opera House Greenhouse effect Hot tub Casting Construction Nintendo Entertainment System Water Wallpaper group Dishwashing Bathroom Spark plug Laundry Bismuth Ra (board game) William De Morgan Glaze Margarine Upholstery Basement Mosaic Queensbridge Islamic Golden Age ROM hacking Plastic Hamster Fiberglass Soldering Jackass: The Movie Fecal incontinence Genericized trademark Tea Forge Have I Got News For You Chromium Pai Gow Turquoise Furnace A Tale of a Tub Polymethyl methacrylate Hydrochloric acid Tungsten Textile manufacturing Incandescent light bulb Heat shield Paul Is Dead L-system Epoxy STS-114 Color temperature Self-replication Korean art Home improvement Japanese toilet Slow cooker 30 St Mary Axe Sento Scrabble Korean tea ceremony Tap (valve) Centrifugal casting Abydos, Egypt Money Explosive material Embedded system Inflation Motor oil Stereoscopy Customs and etiquette of Japan Brewery Rummikub Sterilization (microbiology) Lithium Delftware Fluorine Crystal structure Tesla coil Ex-gay Ammonia Solar cell Camden Town tube station Pinoy Big Brother
