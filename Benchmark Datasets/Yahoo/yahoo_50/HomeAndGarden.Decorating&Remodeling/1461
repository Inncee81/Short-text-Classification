attention professional painters can you help me i bought a gal bucket of kilz latex primer there was no seal under the screw off cap i used it on an entire room whenever i would over lap with the roller it would come up in clumps and now that it's dry it has little alligator cracks in most of it i took the bucket back and got a new one now what should be my next step should i just go over it with the good stuff or try and take it off and if i should take it off how do i do it and what do i use i think someone might have used a gallon or so of it topped it off with some water then returned it then i bought it or maybe i didn't get all the wallpaper glue off maybe a combination of the two well without being able to see the container it came in or the primer before it was applied i can't say definitively what may have been wrong hopefully you'll purchase your painting supplies from a reputable paint store and feel safe with what you're using and always ask as many lay questions as you can think of but if in doubt apply a small amount to the wall let it dry and then evaluate your results unfortunately with the alligator cracks you now have you'll probably have to sand down the affected areas and begin all over again and be sure to wear a good quality dust mask it's a big pain in the neck but the results will be worth the effort and it'll be a lesson learned and i know that this is yahoo but google also can offer tons of advice on applying paint ect good luck and just take your time kilz dries quickly so it might not be so bad Upholstery Anchor Sento Goodness and value theory Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Paint Jumpstart 3rd Grade Menstrual cup Diving suit Dairy Internal ballistics Hamster Drill bit Wine Illegal drug trade Cruising (maritime) Fire extinguisher Mattress Microeconomics Welding Paintball Violin Password cracking Bong Tattoo Professional wrestling throws Japanese tea ceremony Drowning Professional wrestling match types Brewery Explosive material Equine conformation Supply and demand Naruto jutsu C programming language Blood on the Tracks Painting Tire Money Diving Zuiderzee Works 2000 Australian Grand Prix Philosophy of space and time Scientology beliefs and practices Seismic retrofit Ethics Oxyacetylene Jackass: The Movie Alexander Technique Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Bon Jovi Condom Concrete Animal Crossing Fire fighting Sin City Toyota Prius RuneScape locations Street-Legal Irrigation Spanking Glass The Caves of Androzani Team Rocket Aluminium Wood Glossary of climbing terms Copy protection Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glen Jacobs Harp FoxTrot Cartridge (firearms) Inflation Firefighter Comanche Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Painter and decorator Castle Wars Ammunition Panama Canal UK Singles Chart Clinical depression Breastfeeding The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Audiophile Amateur telescope making Gramophone record Montreal Screwjob Hash table Heinkel He 100 Cannabis cultivation Plastic The Joker's Wild
