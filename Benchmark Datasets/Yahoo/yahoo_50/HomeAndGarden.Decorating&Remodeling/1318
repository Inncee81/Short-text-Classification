is it tacky to put a bed in front of a window im rearranging my bedroom and i have only on window in my spacious room its on the wall directly opposite from where you walk in i think my bed should be the focal point but it it tacky to have the bed in front of the window even if i center it also its a daybed it has a small back plus i would be able to escape the window its way too high up no roof to climb onto i do it all of the time and it looks awesome particularly when you use the window treatment to glorify the bed you can really play up your bedding and linens by creating a window treatment that coordinates with the bed treatments you can add height by adding a cornice box or valance at the ceiling and really make the bed appear that it has a canopy by drawing back draperies to the side of the bed Wilton House Volleyball Basement Sento Buckingham Palace Wood carving Chatsworth House Compton Wynyates Bed (furniture) Molding (decorative) Passenger car The Time Machine Bungalow The Brady Bunch Domus Grace Cossington Smith Xanadu House Racquetball Vinyl roof Abbey Kedleston Hall Build engine McMansion Palladian architecture Pickup truck Car body style Quake III Arena American handball St Albans Cathedral Glossary of firefighting terms Shotgun house Textile manufacturing Duomo di Siena Monticello Wrigley Field Le Corbusier Kitchen Capernaum Collyer brothers Solar power King's Head Inn, Aylesbury Sewage treatment Doom engine Alhambra Window Donnie Darko Glossary of American football Lighting Out-of-body experience Lindy Basic The Empty Child Volkswagen Type 2 Badshahi Masjid Traumatic brain injury Grand Central Terminal Maxilla Irish Houses of Parliament Donald Neilson The Curse of Fenric Case modding Bedroom Glossary of climbing terms Thermal power station Lemmings (computer game) Eggerland series Real tennis FA Cup Sicilian Baroque Silent Night, Deadly Night Richard Chase Hamster Vowel Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Upholstery Villa Lante Chaco Culture National Historical Park Peterhouse, Cambridge Volkswagen Eurovan Cathedral of Magdeburg ITunes Milwaukee, Wisconsin Freedom Tower Columbine High School massacre Equine conformation Easton Neston DirectShow Holkham Hall Glossary of partner dance terms View camera Sundial The Shining (film) Hereford Cathedral RISC Carpet Mahjong Fire fighting Hogwarts Floor Directory
