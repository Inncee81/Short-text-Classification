when i get older i want to be an interior designer what kind of money would this carrier make i love the show flipthis house i'm only a teenager but do you have any tips on designing an room or house in alot of universities they have interior design majors but its not the decorating painting etc they teach the interior design majors how to build the interior of buildings like where to put support and walls and stuff so its sort of like architecture but i agree with the answer above a degree in design and then a minor in architecture or interior design would be extremely profitable it depends on what kind of design your interested in as well like would you be more interested in commercial design or residential design you can always talk to a school counselor whether it be high school or college preferibly college because they know more about what the school and the major has to offer they will point you in the right direction such as possible salaries and what you need to do to get started and to be prepared for college Boston College Interior decoration Education in Portugal Education in the United States College Islamic architecture St. Ignatius College Prep White House Duke University Rococo University of Michigan Alhambra Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Community college Solar power Japanese tea ceremony Cornell University House Christiansborg Palace Washington University in St. Louis Boeing 747 University of Massachusetts Amherst GED Robert Lawson (architect) CPU design Yale University Savannah College of Art and Design Timber framing Iranian architecture Graduate school Education in Germany Wilton House Frank Lloyd Wright University of Melbourne Wheel of Fortune Movie theater McMansion University of British Columbia Rice University Seismic retrofit Frank Gehry Blenheim Palace Harvard College Mapua Institute of Technology Bauhaus University of Houston Stanford White Sicilian Baroque RISC Basilica Soane Museum Illegal drug trade Lighting University of Texas at San Antonio University of Edinburgh Gothic Revival architecture Architecture University of Wales, Lampeter Great Teacher Onizuka Emerson College Architect Bosnian architecture Proportional representation Le Corbusier School counselor Passenger car Scholarship Irish Houses of Parliament Straw-bale construction The Catholic University of America Xanadu House University of Hartford University of Maryland Baltimore County University of North Carolina at Charlotte Psychotherapy Kitchen Student loan William Kent Bath Construction California Polytechnic State University Copyleft Paintball University of Central Florida Stairway University of California, Berkeley Syracuse University Saeima Naval architecture Education in Romania Sundial Boston Public Microeconomics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pennsylvania Railroad Josef Hoffmann Interior design Wood carving
