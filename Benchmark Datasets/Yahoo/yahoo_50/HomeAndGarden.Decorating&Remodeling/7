two doors on old homes just a little observation on many older homes that i have seen there are two doors in the front of the house leading onto the porch they are very close togather i would love to know the reasoning behind this anyone with some knowledge to old houses fill me in many houses from the th century had two front doors there's a very logical reason for this one door leads into the keeping room where the family keeps house the keeping room contains the large fireplace for cooking and of course a table and chairs for the family to relax this is not the room you want to introduce your guests into so a second door would lead into the living room which was probably only used for special occasions Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Wilton House Sento The Brady Bunch Property tax Monticello Passenger car Hogwarts Floor Directory McMansion 10 Downing Street Buckingham Palace Dining room Frankfurt kitchen The Birds (film) Grace Cossington Smith California Bungalow Xanadu House Car body style Gay bathhouse Wood carving Professional wrestling match types Compton Wynyates Country house Ryokan inn Solomon's Temple White House G-Man (Half-Life) Japanese toilet Abbey Elevator Shotgun house Logic Abigail Folger Norbert Wiener The Phantom Manor Courtyard The Time Machine Conspiracy (TNG episode) Abbot TARDIS Natural Selection (computer game) CPU cache Fireplace Library Peterhouse, Cambridge Palace of Westminster Richard Rahl Scenes from a Memory Lake Burley Griffin Epistemology Home of Franklin D.
