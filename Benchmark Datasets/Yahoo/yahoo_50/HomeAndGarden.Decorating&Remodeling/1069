painting delema i currently have a small ft x ft room it is painted red i would like to paint it a nice yellow how many gallons of paint will i need and how much will it cost to paint it i am planning on using an automatic paint sprayer thing wont i need to cover it with a primer how much will that be yes you will need to use a 'good white primer' in a 'flat' not shiny finish and with 'red' you will have to use at least coats up to coats of primer before you put the yellow paint on you may use the 'least expensive white flat paint' you can buy use approximately gallon per coat for that size room gallons if you are doing the ceiling too and the 'woodwork' then for your 'final color' get the most expensive brand you can afford preferably one that has a year 'guarantee' one other 'bit of good information' is that paint dries darker than it is in the can if it's a light color yellow and 'lighter' if it's a 'dark color' like brown dark blue or dark orange i assume you want a 'good color' so be sure you get a small 'test can' of paint that you can paint over a 'primed area' and shine 'lights' the same ones you will be using in the room plus light from outside with the 'right curtains' to be sure that the yellow on your walls is the 'yellow you want' to live with it's far easier and far less expensive to know for sure instead of being 'rudely awakened' to the fact that what 'looked great' on the swatch looks like 'baby poop' on the walls okay i had that happen to me once yuck so test and then test again until you are sure you can 'live with that color and lighting before you pay for the 'coats' of yellow you'll need to 'truly paint' your walls Color Light-emitting diode Paint Blue Primer (paint) Wood Lighting Pysanka Carpet Crayola Human skin color Items in the Metroid series Fancy rat Internal ballistics Dragon Booster Labrador Retriever Colours, standards and guidons Aes Sedai Gamut My Little Pony Sento Yoshi Yellow Wassily Kandinsky Casting Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Black body Technicolor Microeconomics Cartridge (firearms) Leopard BNSF Railway Fluorescent lamp Glaze Piet Mondrian Xanadu House Opportunity rover Alhambra Wood carving Rum Color space M&M's Bubble Bobble Upholstery Life insurance James McNeill Whistler Discus (fish) Impressionism Plastic Blenheim Palace Tintoretto Cube (film) Color temperature Common bean CMYK color model Nintendo 64 Amateur telescope making Blood (computer game) Rainbow Brite RGB color model Acrylic paint Collectibles in Bionicle Melanin Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Christo and Jeanne-Claude Wok Billiards 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mattress Panama Canal Soap bubble Wayne Corporation Christmas tree Traffic sign Material properties of diamond Lane Drill bit Wallpaper group Political colour Sin City Diamond simulant Microsoft Paint Vehicle registration plate Glass Georges-Pierre Seurat Chaos Emerald Red Staining (biology) Cuisine of Denmark Solar cell Drawing Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Union Pacific Railroad Metropolitan Area Express (Portland, Oregon) Bicycle lighting Black
