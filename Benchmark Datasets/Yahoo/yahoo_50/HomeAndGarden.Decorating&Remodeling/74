hanging kitchen cabs on cinder block walls i'm redoing a cinder block home that was originally a double the deviding wall is where the kitchen will go but its cinder block i thought about toggling x 's vertically and attaching the cabinets to that all ideas welcome having just done this very thing except that it was a poured concrete wall take a x and cut it in half lengthwise the length will depend on the width of your cabinets on a table saw but put the blade at a degree angle take one of the halves and secure it to the wall using mollies and concrete screws so that the degree is up and bevels back to the wall attach the other half to the cabinet so that the degree is facing down and bevels back to the cabinet you can then take the cabinet and hang it on the wall essentially putting the x back together for extra security go ahead and screw through the back of the cabinet and into the re assembled x but make sure the screws are short enough so that they don't go into the cinder blocks you can then proceed to screw the adjacent cabinets together i'm more than happy to draw you a side view of the assembly if my description isn't quite clear i couldn't fine you an online picture to direct you to because i don't know if this method has a name Drill bit Screw Woodworking Skateboarding trick Knife Textile manufacturing Rail terminology Table saw Equine conformation Kitchen Casting Temporal bone Gear Glossary of American football Cinder block Stairway Trigonometric function Movie projector Boat building Propeller Sailing Bass guitar Masonry Hangul Seismic retrofit Motility Upholstery Basement Plane (tool) The Wall Professional wrestling throws Glossary of climbing terms Snooker Retaining wall Saw Flag of India Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Microphone Sundial Spira Strap-on dildo GunZ The Duel Backstroke Oscilloscope Great Pyramid of Giza Internal ballistics Ship Sphenoid bone Volleyball Amateur telescope making Wallpaper group Anchor Wood carving Elevator Chess terminology Wind turbine Capital punishment Floyd Rose Pile Mercury Atlas 6 Wire Straw-bale construction Door Brewery Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Scapula Canal lock Bristol Grammar School Bong Swingout American football strategy Panama Canal Locks Dai shogi Poker jargon CPU cache Conker's Bad Fur Day Rigging Billiards Cabinet of the United Kingdom Traffic light Helicopter Colours, standards and guidons Antenna (radio) Abdomen Hogwarts Floor Directory Professional wrestling holds Archery Fuse (electrical) Backgammon Canoe Steering Suplex Tire View camera Original Amiga chipset Dinghy Chu shogi USS Tunny (SS-282) Point groups in three dimensions
