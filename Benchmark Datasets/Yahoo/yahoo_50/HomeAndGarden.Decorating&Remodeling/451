is there such a thing as a hammock bed i know this is a crazy question but i am in love with my hammock and i am wondering if there is a type of bed that is like a hammock i honestly thought i had seen them somewhere but i have checked the internet and tons of stores and just can not seem to find one any suggestions thanks and if so where can i find one i used to camp a lot and used a hammock shelter it was great and i feel ya on loving them it is a great night's sleep in the great outdoors there are hammocks on stands that you can get to sleep on and there are safe ways to tie up a hammock indoors if you wanted a do it yourself project you could try hanging a sheet of pretty plywood from chains like a porch swing and set a mattress on top to do this you need to be extremely sure that your ceiling joists can hold the weight of the bed the people in it the hardware and the multiplication of those forces when there is motion involved i would have a construction expert at least consult on the project so you know that you are doing this safely otherwise you will tear up your ceiling and injure yourself but there are times when a hammock doesn't cut it if you have a bed buddy you can't share a hammock even to sleep and makes sex damn near impossible the swing is awesome for relaxing but it complicates everything getting in and out of bed putting your book away turning out the lights getting a drink these actions require you to lean in on something that doesn't move and a hammock just goes with you no matter what Mattress Tent Avenue Q Bed (furniture) Theory of conduct Sailing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Seismic retrofit Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Hammock Anchor Treehouse of Horror XIII Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Tree Hill (TV series) Swingout EastEnders The Shining (film) Basement Humphrey Bogart Urinary incontinence The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Sin City Equine conformation Social rule Air-raid shelter Kill Bill Textile manufacturing Siegfried Line About a Boy Christmas tree Plywood Volleyball Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Knots Landing Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling throws Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garden W.
