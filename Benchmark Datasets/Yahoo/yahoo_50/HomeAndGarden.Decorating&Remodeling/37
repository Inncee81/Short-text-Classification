what color should i choose to paint over the wall paneling in my new cozy basement apt this apartment has so much character i love it the only thing that i don't like is the one wall that is covered in wood paneling blech my landlord is allowing me to paint it whatever color i choose i am looking for a bold different color that will help to make the room seem larger and brighter as the ceilings in the living room are much lower than the rest of the apartment since the wood paneling is only on one wall i guess it could be considered an accent wall i am leaning towards a nice vibrant red but would that be too much the rest of the walls are white and i won't be able to paint those if it helps there is an awesome exposed brick column in the middle of my living room and as it transitions into the kitchen wonderful black and white retro vinyl tile is covering the floor thanks for the suggestions that's what i was thinking when i was first saw the question red i painted the paneling in my living room i would suggets painting it with kilz first it's a primer paint and will make your color go on easier and look great Kitchen Wallpaper group Alhambra Wilton House Basement Wood carving Lighting Chatsworth House McMansion Brett Whiteley Seismic retrofit Sento Carpet Door Rococo House Bungalow Tile Jumpstart 3rd Grade Air-raid shelter Light-frame construction Paint Color theory Xanadu House Harrow School Grace Cossington Smith Plastic Distribution board The Wall House of Leaves Doom engine Dodge Charger Soane Museum Stucco Palace of Westminster Sicilian Baroque Francis Bacon (painter) Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Asbestos Billboard (advertising) Abbey Duomo di Siena Domus Aurea Little Britain Holkham Hall Irna Phillips Texaco Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Light-emitting diode Combine (Half-Life 2) Hogwarts Floor Directory TARDIS Wheel of Fortune Raphael Rooms Fan (implement) Rathfarnham Passenger car Clarinet Stairway I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Opportunity rover Qualia Palazzo Vecchio St Albans Cathedral Arlington House Timber framing The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Eight ball Johnny the Homicidal Maniac White House Sauna Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Hogwarts Houses Dundas Square Irish Houses of Parliament Typeface Chinese architecture Buckingham Palace Architecture of the California missions Christiansborg Palace Mario Antioch, Pisidia Blenheim Palace Shotgun house Game show Masonry Mahjong Sundial Humphrey Bogart Cello Volleyball M.C.
