whats the difference between deep base paint and accent base paint we got different colors blue and light blue the blue was deep base and needs about coats and still doesn't seem right but when we paint the light blue accent base it went on real easy and clean why is there a difference and how come the people at behr didn't tell us there was one should we bring it back and get our money back behr is the most labor intensive paint on the market if i have a client that wants me to use it i double my labor costs or won't do the job there is no negotiation i knew this was about behr when i read the first line of your question deep base is for dark colors and accent base is for the lighter ones now if you haven't tried the behr pure white don't as you'll be fit to be tied with what seems like having to neverendingly recoat here's what you do take the paint back to the depot and tell them you're not satisfied with the product have the paint tech mix up your color in the evermore line and watch the difference don't let them give you the bs about color or clarity not being the same trust me you'll be happy with the color less labor and evermore product quality every professional painter i have met hates behr paints the only justification in using it is if a person wants to match the fabrics color on a pillow or something perfectly those people are usually decorators and they'll pay for the extra labor costs because it doesn't matter to them they simply pass it on to their clients next time you paint use the evermore or cross over to lowe's and buy their american tradition by valspar this is an excelllent premium quality paint that's worth the money i had been a loyal home depot buyer contractor since i don't buy out my projects there because i have seen a rapid and steady decline in their product selection and quality it's now like the wal mart or big lots of the home improvement centers i'm a professional remodeler builder and i shop at lowe's now if i can be of more help to you just let me know mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Diamond Sears Holdings Corporation The Apprentice 2 Inflation Gross domestic product Mattress Life insurance Ford Motor Company Wassily Kandinsky Supply and demand Color theory Bulk vending Rum Drag racing Detroit Tigers Capitalism Titanium Mutual fund Upholstery Outsourcing Software engineering Wayne Corporation Insurance Plastic Publicly funded medicine Humphrey Bogart Welding Economics Tax Public good Tariff Surplus value Oakland Athletics Strap-on dildo Berkshire Hathaway The Apprentice 3 Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Land Rover (Series/Defender) Atari 8-bit family Labour economics Diamond cut Knots Landing Logo Major League Baseball television contracts Gamut Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Warren Buffett Light-emitting diode Stanton Macdonald-Wright Jennifer Lopez National Football League Trade union Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Annuity Violin Human skin color Surveillance Georges-Pierre Seurat Merit Illegal drug trade Apple Macintosh Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Internet fraud Pennsylvania Railroad Common Unix Printing System New York City Subway nomenclature Time Out of Mind Monopoly (game) Anarchism and capitalism American individualist anarchism Citigroup Economic inequality Primerica Financial Services Universal Studios Hyperinflation Screenplay Shaggy dog story Deflation (economics) Philosophical skepticism Carpet Mortgage Ethical consumerism Unemployment Wheel of Fortune Diamond enhancement New York Giants
