the last two offices i worked in were full of backstabbing co workers i was lucky enough to be moved out of this enviornment and into another office in the same company with wonderful co workers the old coworkers who are very jealous of my going to a better place continually spread nasty rumors such as my leaking company secrets to upper management none of this is true and i'm sick and tired of having to defend myself against this backstabbing any suggestions are welcome i was considering filing formal harassment complaints with the company's hr department leaving the company to go work elsewhere right now is not an option i've been with them years and am years away from retirement consider yourself lucky to be away from your old co workers i would definitely file a complaint with the hr especially if these nasty rumors begin to creep into the environment you are in now everyone begins to stop conversing with each other when you walk by and a cold tension begins to fill the office you can address it with them or your boss directly i couldn't work this way tip toeing on egg shells isn't fun and counter productive by the way upper management works for the company too your aren't leaking company secrets if you were talking to a competitor about products or services your company provides then this would be leaking company secrets if proven true your company could fire you and if not you may be demoted remember the woman from coca cola she tried to sell secrets to pepsi co and received jail time however if you made a light hearted comment to someone you knew in upper management about how certain people in your department spent days surfing the web or chatted on the phone to friends all the time and then somehow it got back to your co workers you tattled on them read the first paragraph again this is what will happen ever seen the show the office and you thought you graduated from high school be strong do your job and keep a stiff upper lip take care Plame affair Social rule New Coke Wal-Mart The Coca-Cola Company Coca-Cola Paul Is Dead The Apprentice 2 Avenue Q Karl Rove Internet fraud K' The Inside SCO-Linux controversies The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Nasty Boys Spam (electronic) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus One Tree Hill (TV series) Philosophical skepticism Bill O'Reilly (commentator) The Amber Spyglass The Contender (television series) Windows XP Roswell UFO incident Janet Jackson LiveJournal Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair timeline Battles of Lexington and Concord EastEnders ISO 9000 Time Out of Mind Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Humphrey Bogart Spice Girls StarCraft: Uprising Outsourcing The Devil Wears Prada United States Postal Service Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Bruce Johnson Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Badly Drawn Kitties Jean Charles de Menezes Boeing Velvet Revolution Days of our Lives Kill Bill Full Metal Panic?
