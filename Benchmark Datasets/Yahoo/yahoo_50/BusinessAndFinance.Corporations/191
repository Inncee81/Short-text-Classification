i am a bank teller often customers stare at me intently during the entire transaction it makes me nervous have you ever been on the giving or receiving end of this why do you think it happens cas i was a teller many years ago and i used to get stares by customers sometimes my best advice is to not take it personally some will watch you as you enter their info on your keyboard so they probably just like to make sure you enter everything correctly i had this same thing happen to me in retail again i don't take it personally sometimes customers just have an annoying habit of staring at people on the giving end whenever i go to my bank i never stare at the teller because it's rude so all you can do is try your best to ignore them and remember it's not you that has a problem they do hope this helps Automatic teller machine Shaggy dog story Password EFTPOS Social rule Beavis and Butt-head Bank of China (Hong Kong) Meme Eye contact Surveillance Wachovia Stare decisis The Apprentice 2 Debit card Theory of conduct Penn and Teller Morphogenetic field Darth Revan Internet fraud Transactional analysis 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sears Holdings Corporation The Star Wars Holiday Special Software engineering Originalism Bank Dilbert Storytelling Current teachings of Prem Rawat Citigroup Sento Customer relationship management The writing of Principia Mathematica Jon Secada Investment bank Value added tax United States dollar Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homer's Enemy Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Sharon Tate Contract Tesco Cheque Financial services Citibank Pok__mon Live!
