has pov ceremony been held yet did dick take himself off the block if not is it possible that he will take daniele off instead knowing that if he uses the pov on himself that daniele will most likely get voted out i guess i would only expect that of a father personally sacrafice himself for his daughter instead of getting out of the way of the firing squad and letting her take it i know he won it i was asking if he used it spoiler alert for those who don't watch feeds and don't want to know before the episode airs dick won the pov and then proceeded to pilfer through the houseguests drawers and report back to danielle with what he found namely in dustin's personally i think he won so that when it's up to him whether or not to use it he gives it to her so he can look like a hero to her so she'll let him back into her life when they're both out of the house and the show is over it would probably also speak to the mothers in the house a selfless act for a child however the ceremony has not happened yet so that's just a guess on my part everyone seems to think the ceremony will be tomorrow Big Brother (USA TV series) House Stark Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Three Stooges Pyramid (game show) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Haven (TNG episode) Ken Jennings Plame affair Spanish verbs Springfield Elementary School The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Knots Landing Megan Griffin Search for Tomorrow StarCraft Episode VI Dustin Hoffman The Mary Tyler Moore Show The Shining (film) Wheel of Fortune Day of the Daleks Shaggy dog story Dick Cavett Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends Whose Line Is It Anyway?
