i want to get a tattoo it would be my first i want it to be a celtic design and i have one picked out but i'm having trouble on where to put it i can deal with pain so i really don't care about that completely although i don't want it to be unbareable or anything i just want feedback i i was thinking about getting a small one on my wrist or any sized one anywhere on the top of my back i know that getting it in a place where you can see it is risky for jobs and stuff but the careers i'm interested in don't involve situations where i have to worry about that i don't want it to be a small pointless tattoo if i get one i want it to be worth it if it is something that you are really proud of and really means something to you i would get a decent sized one on your back i think that is the best place i want to get one soon too it is going to be an eagle with my moms face and some meaningful words about her in gaelic scottish i am putting it nice and big on my back New York Giants Picts Shaggy dog story Tattoo Scots language Humphrey Bogart Social rule Extreme Programming Stuttering Scottish Gaelic language Hal Trosky Irezumi The Inside New York Knicks Professional wrestling holds Harp Kilt Effeminacy Chess strategy and tactics Mark Calaway Poker jargon Pittsburgh Steelers Bagpipes Kurt Cobain Scottish clan Aerial (dance move) Goidelic languages Avril Lavigne Alex Ferguson Goodness and value theory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Skateboarding trick Namie Amuro Bond Irish language Celtic languages Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sheepshead AFI 100 Years series 2000 Australian Grand Prix Electrophysiology Roxette Kurt Angle Vanilla Ninja Crystal Palace F.C.
