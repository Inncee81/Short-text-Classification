how painful is a tattoo i knowit's gonna hurt loads also i've heard it hurts more in different places so out of the wrist the top of my foot and my back which is more painful and how painful can you compare it to anything there are many factors that influence the amount of pain involved in getting tattooed the size and placement of the tattoo are considerations but also the person doing the tattoo the larger the piece of artwork you want the longer you will spend getting tatttooed of course leading to more pain the placement of the artwork on your body is also a key factor places like the outside of your upper arm calf are much less painful than places like the inside of your upper arm top of feet one factor that is often overlooked by a person looking to get a tattoo is the artist doing the work some tatttooists are very heavy handed but only go over each line once or twice and some are very light handed but go over every line a million times if i ever find one with a light hand that only goes over each line a couple times i'll let ya know the placement of the tattoo on your body will also play a determining factor in how much pain you will be in during the healing process the tattoos on my arms neck were much more easily healed than the tattoos on my feet in my bikini area the tattoos that are subject to clothing shoes rubbing on them are much harder to keep clean and more likely to scab i cannot accurately describe the way it feels to get a tattoo i have experienced a different sensation with just about every one all pain sensations however the best thing i can say is that it starts out like an annoying pain bee sting or sandpaper but will progress with time irritation to a more substantial pain the skin will swell bleed so the longer it takes the more it will feel like you are rubbing sandpaper on a real bad sunburn i have too many tattoos to count and they were all well worth the pain i went through to get them they do not hurt everyday for the rest of your life suck it up and get inked have fun good luck Tattoo Scarification Diving Professional wrestling holds Weight training Carpal tunnel syndrome Pain Milton H.
