why do stamps have ridges on the sides just wondering if they serve any sort of purpose why not just make stamps square so the sheets of stamps wouldn't curl the rotary press printing method provided many advantages in the manufacture of u s postage stamps primarily in the speed of production allowing the printing of stamps on rolls of paper rather than on the single sheet at a time of the flat plate method it also allowed the gumming of stamps as a roll rather than by the individual sheet again a big time saver however when the rotary press rolls were cut down to sheets to be delivered to post offices the sheets tended to curl back into their rolled form this was not a problem with rotary coils which were sold in rolls but it was a problem for postal clerks who needed the sheets of stamps to lie flat in their drawers more pressing was the fact that it was exceptionally difficult to add pre cancels to the curled sheets without tearing the sheets apart at the perforations a problem that was alleviated somewhat as the bureau took over the pre canceling chore since un gummed sheets from the rotary rolls did not curl it was noted that the gum must be the cause of the curling by simply adding breaks in the gum the curling was reduced considerably Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Postage stamp Stamp collecting Postage stamp separation Envelope Drill bit Mail Postage stamp gum United States Postal Service Philately Welding Bookbinding View camera Gramophone record Penny Black Toilet paper Paper size Philatelic literature Transformer Screw Loudspeaker Table tennis Penny Red Printing press Topps Wire Inverted Jenny Cookware and bakeware Paper Mattress M60 machine gun Combine harvester Post office Autograph Seismic retrofit Equine conformation Glass Duplicating machines Brewery Printmaking Bacon Microeconomics Textile manufacturing terminology Genericized trademark Dice Private Express Statutes ZIP Code Mail art Sheet metal Solar cell RISC Oscilloscope Die (manufacturing) Offset printing Dither Terminal ballistics Cascading Style Sheets Stereoscopy Musical notation One-time pad Cancellation Craps Tax Textile manufacturing Carburetor Regular polytope Arado Ar 80 Hyperinflation Bulk vending Violin Knife Wankel engine Rotary engine Map projection Mach kernel Artistamp Solar power Microphone Direct marketing Flat tax Dairy Fender Telecaster Postmark Trombone Floppy disk Bullet Two-stroke cycle Rules of the road Pottery Printed circuit board
