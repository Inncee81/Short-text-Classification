whats the area of a prism if its bases are inches and inches and height is inches a prism wouldn't have an area it would have a volume area is flat volume is dimensional for a prism we use v a x h volume area of the base x height to find the area of the base we simply use a l x w area length x width so in your example v x x note is the same as i'll let you do this math but if you want to check that you know how then let's just try this if the base is inches and inches and the height is inches v x x v x v cubic inches it's cubic inches because it's dimensional cubic and we are working in inches inches add it's possible to help with homework without actually doing it for someone that'd be a good skill for everyone to learn thanks for the oppertunity to practice teaching math Volume Stereoscopy English unit U.S. customary units Collision detection Cube Stairway Polyhedron Engine displacement Teen Girl Squad Violin Sequoia Vector (spatial) Dog agility Diamond cut History of measurement Spline (mathematics) B__zier curve Fourth dimension Mount St. Helens Chair Sea level rise Density Andreini tessellation Craniometry Dimensional analysis Area (geometry) Mazda Miata Panama Canal Slide rule Geodesy Laws of cricket Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Point groups in three dimensions Archimedes Paper size Langstroth hive Lebesgue integration Ship model Pachypodium ambongense Daewoo Nubira Stage lighting Doctor Spectrum Vacuum Concrete Pachypodium baronii Scale model Cubic (crystal system) Sphere packing Manifold Binoculars Aberration in optical systems Monochromator Abacus Polynomial Golf club (equipment) Amateur telescope making Dice Devil sticks Music lesson Vowel Timpani Mathematics Fast bowling Metrication arguments and counter-arguments Hilbert's third problem Tire Kepler conjecture Learning Inch Waldorf Education Wood fuel Harley-Davidson Polychoron Bass guitar Ford Ranchero Cartridge (firearms) Pascal's triangle Matroid Cube (film) Multiple integral Roller hockey Education in Romania Unit Load Device Metric system 19-inch rack Bullet Turbo-Hydramatic Drag racing Apollo Command/Service Module Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Brassiere Gliding SI prefix Audio tape length and thickness Dispersion (optics) Saw Screenwriting Oceanic trench Quake III Arena
