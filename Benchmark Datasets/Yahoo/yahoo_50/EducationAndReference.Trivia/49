what was outlawed in prohibition during the prohibition in the 's was it only hard liquer that was outlawed or did they ban stuff like wine and champagne too actually it turns out the specifics of the th amendment were only the sale production and transportation of all types of alcohol there was an accompanying law that prohibited the consumption but it came later that same year it was enacted in as religious minded citizens blamed the consumption of alcohol on many different woes specifically there was a great fear of the american public when it came to the irish who were still trampled under foot to a large extent in there was also a great deal of concern regarding crime there were all sorts of groups which prohibited alcohol consumption kansas enacted it into their state constitution in there's more in the wiki reference in my link set but one of my favorite thoughts is that of a river if the water wants to go this way eventually it will find a way if you think of the ills of society markets for gambling sex drugs and alcohol these are all things people like to do no amount of law will stop them from doing what they need to do to be happy someone will be there to provide for this need whether it is a prostitute a casio boss a drug dealer or an al capone and the mafia who were bootleggers bringing what the country wanted to the masses and making a ton of dough on it it only took years for the us to realize this with regards to alcohol and now its just heavily regulated sadly the other sins have not found their way into the ok by the law but heavily regulated state yet and in the meantime we spend millions of dollars trying to stop the dam of need and support with some masking tape its far better to teach people why these things are good and bad for them and then let them manage on their own while those millions of dollars are spent doing things to take care of the people and the planet Prohibition Illegal drug trade Arguments for and against drug prohibition Prohibition (drugs) Alcoholic beverage Economy of the United States Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Smoking ban Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Food and Drug Administration Black market Prostitution Absinthe Child pornography Microeconomics Cuba Video game controversy Harm reduction Al Capone History of the United States (1918-1945) Gay rights Gun politics in the United States Controlled Substances Act Sin City United States Constitution Victimless crime Tax History of the United States FairTax Elections in the United States The Untouchables Freedom of speech Legal issues of cannabis Cocaine Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland Rum-running First Amendment to the United States Constitution Law French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Federal Marriage Amendment Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Drug abuse Gun politics Roaring Twenties Kansas Involuntary commitment Knots Landing Intellectual property Recreational drug use Convention on Psychotropic Substances Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Female genital cutting Motion picture rating system Human sexual behavior Civil rights Prohibition Party Church of Christ, Scientist Politics of the United States Capital punishment Tennessee State Constitution New Deal Laws of Singapore Cannabis (drug) Pornography U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Public policy Article One of the United States Constitution Culture of France Sodomy law Economy of Russia Religion and sexuality Libertarianism United States Bill of Rights Landmark decision Polygamy Alcoholism Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Mothers Against Drunk Driving Constitution Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Las Vegas, Nevada First Monday Human rights in the United States Teach the Controversy Hate speech Age of consent International Criminal Court
