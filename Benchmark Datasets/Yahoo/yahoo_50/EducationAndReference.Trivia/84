e which is the hottest place on earth the desert of sahara and libya there are many places on earth that are plenty hot record breaking hot in fact there's a good chance on the day this record breaking temperature was recorded by a meteorological station in el azizia in there were other places hundreds of miles away that were even hotter in all likelihood this record temperature has been exceeded since then in many places on earth but we have no official records of the temperatures it is important to note that when atmospheric temperatures are recorded it is not the surface temperature where it can sometimes reach f c but rather the air temperature at about feet m above the surface in an enclosed shelter of course it's important that the temperature sensor is not exposed to direct sunlight the shelter is louvered to permit air flow across the sensor most humans don't 'hang out' where some of the hottest tempertatures on earth are regularly experienced so there aren't a lot of meterological stations in these places to reliably record extreme temperatures facts on september the thermometer reached a blistering f c Desert Energy development Geography of Africa Jet engine Cyclone National Weather Service Water Solar power Sun Climate change Sunlight Temperature Global warming Nuclear fallout Ozone depletion Tropical cyclone Wind Underwater Engine cooling Weather satellite Ozone hole Climate of the United Kingdom Temperature inversion Planetary habitability Thermometer Instrumental temperature record Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Venus Mercury Atlas 6 Greenhouse effect Hiking Thermostat Weather forecasting Sensor Anemometer Tide Ecology Mercury (planet) Fuel injection Hot air balloon 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Environmental concerns with electricity generation Huygens probe Mount Pinatubo Carbon dioxide E85 Spark plug Weather lore Season Billboard Hot 100 Scramjet Geography of India Water vapor Colonization of Mars Pebble bed reactor Turbojet Solar variation Renewable energy Adiabatic lapse rate Ice core Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Paragliding Aluminium Severe weather terminology (United States) Brewery Volcano Apollo 6 Fusion power Earth's atmosphere X-ray astronomy Mars Terraforming Entropy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Sea ice Comet Yosemite National Park TV-FM DX STS-62 Galileo spacecraft Global climate model Fire fighting Cloud Flood geology Weather Convection Houston, Texas Subsidence SR-71 Blackbird Cave diving Thermal power station Cassini-Huygens Motor oil Liquid crystal Diamond dust
