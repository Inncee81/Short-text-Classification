do you read 'series' of books out of chronological order for example i've ready the bbc doctor who eda's out of order because i can't find them all in the library i also read the series of books that follow the three musketeers in the worng order by starting with the man in the iron mask i used to love reading animorphs yep read those in the wrong order as well mainly its getting hold of the right book that's the problem a lot of the time there's only one and its labeled as 'missing' lol typical it annoys me when they number them by when they are released rather than chronological order and there are some i'm not sure what order they should be read in like the agatha christie who dun its i do however i do try not too but sometimes you just can't help it for example if you go to the library sometimes you can get them in order but at other times you can't so you just have to read them when you find them Agatha Christie Doctor Who spin-offs Miss Marple The Three Musketeers Sleeping Murder The Chronicles of Narnia Whodunit Eighth Doctor Adventures Animorphs Texas Revolution CPU cache Fahrenheit 451 The Foundation Series Little Britain Douglas Adams Fantastic Four Legal research Crime film Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Shaw Festival Lance Parkin Indiana Jones Philosophy Doctor (Doctor Who) Joseph Campbell Crime fiction Billboard Hot 100 The Cure Church of Christ, Scientist Sherlock Holmes Golden Legend ITV Canon (fiction) Detective fiction The Curse of Fenric The Dark is Rising Sequence The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Electronic design automation The Daleks' Master Plan Chronology of Jesus Commedia dell'arte Register renaming The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Joan Hickson RuneScape quests John Peel Librarian Theory of conduct EastEnders Chronology of the Ancient Near East Doctor Who missing episodes Dirk Maggs 10cc The Art of Noise Frankie Goes to Hollywood The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Bulk vending The Chronicles of Amber Classic RISC pipeline Endianness Old Earth creationism Cardcaptor Sakura Fictional character C programming language We Belong Together The Man in the Iron Mask (film) On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences New Order Blackadder A Course In Miracles George Abbott The Beatles discography GED Fox Feature Syndicate Upstairs, Downstairs The Moving Finger Tony Hancock Locked room mystery The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references Bernice Summerfield The Mask The Murder of Roger Ackroyd Library catalog Jack Kirby Objective-C Fawlty Towers The Contender (television series) K-9 and Company Mach kernel Vorkosigan Saga Library (computer science) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Tony Jay Boston and Lowell Railroad Discordianism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an InuYasha (character) Library of Congress
