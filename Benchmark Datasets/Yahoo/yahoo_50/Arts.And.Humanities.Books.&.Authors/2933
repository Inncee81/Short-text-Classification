what was your reaction to the final harry potter book i personally liked it but i wish she would have went into more detail about the epiloge oh well i completely agree with you the seventh book brought excitement tears laughter and despair i seriously cried when tonks and lupin died dobby's death brought tears to my eyes the epilogue should've talked about others besides the trio ginny and their kids what about luna more about neville would be nice and the rest of the weasleys they should have an interview about that but for the book i think there should've been more neville vs bellatrix not so much molly vs bella i mean neville should've avenged his parents' deaths all in all awesome book second favorite next to ootp hope you find a satisfying answer toodles Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter (character) Neville Longbottom Ginny Weasley Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Nymphadora Tonks Luna Lovegood Hogwarts Houses Lord Voldemort Battle of Hogwarts Order of the Phoenix Minor Harry Potter Beasts Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts Lucius Malfoy Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Dumbledore's Army Death Eater Draco Malfoy Minor Ravenclaws Magic (Harry Potter) Weasley family Boggart (Harry Potter) Diagon Alley Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Hogwarts subjects The Slug Club Molly Weasley Hogwarts Floor Directory Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Fred and George Weasley Remus Lupin Shaggy dog story Bellatrix Lestrange James and Lily Potter Bill Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Peter Pettigrew House-elf Tom Riddle's diary Sybill Trelawney Dobby Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books J.
