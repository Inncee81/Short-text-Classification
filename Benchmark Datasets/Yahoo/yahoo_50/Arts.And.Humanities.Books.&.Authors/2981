in a book or a film the ending should be unpredictable how many types of endings have you come across these stories eg sherlock holmes always ends at the begining harry potter always has a continous flow but also ends some at the begining stupid ending for example everybody dies or it was all a dream what do you think i think a good ending should be unpredictable one of my favorites was the life of david gale it was about the death sentence and whether or not innocent ppl get put to death and by the end of the movie it shows that our main character was innocent and that he was executed kind of proving their point srryy i ruined it but its a really good movie Canon (fiction) Harry Potter The Great Mouse Detective Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Fan fiction Dorothy Gale Sherlock Holmes Pixar Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Murder by Decree The Avengers (TV series) George Lucas Paul W.
