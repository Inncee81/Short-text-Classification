im writing a book and im young and need help writing it like tips and guide lines i need a website that gives a how to or if u are a writer i would like an e mail giving me tips and also telling me what they did to write their book i have in mind a fantasy fiction book and if u need more details e mail me if ur a writer and i will give em to u that is all i can really say about it cause im thinking of taking a career in writing so i would like to keep in contact with any writer posible as an author and writer of many different genres the most important thing to do is write with passion write what's important to you first and worry about all the rules later too many writers get so caught up in following all the rules that they lose focus on the purpose of writing there are many style rule books but i would prefer to spend my money on writing classes where you can get advice from the instructor network with other writers and get give critiques for what you've already written so focus on the writing side first and the business rules after the creativity is over don't let the two bog you down Science fiction Fantasy Fan fiction Literature Social rule Extreme Programming Style guide Stewart Home C.
