deathly hallows spoilers anyone else think it was half a ed like the ministry of magic and gringotts horcrux retrieving seemed so short and easy not much depth or anything and she said people had to die because of sacrifice what sacrifice she practically made harry a pansy in this one and the battle of hogwarts like wth they lose at the beggining then centaurs come to fight for human cause w o prior explaining and why didnt they come sooner and i thinks its me but the book seemed a bit repetitive don't you think harry goes on adventure school days for chapters than pages voldemort dies flees then a chapter afterwards explaining why hes so special you could kinda tell what was going to happen duh so i think j k rowling deservers the following evaluation ideas writing how she puts those ideas ie plot english prepares for flaming can't wait to hear shes a billionaire she's not oops not she's not but you're not my bad by pansy i mean weak not scared you misunderstand he was a pansy in that he did not fight with any skill and he died and well now you're thinking harry potter to be a real character he is fictional and therefor made into a man of courage who did not fear death by j k rowling i think your perspective could use a little push for all that this series is certainly one of the most read and arguably one of the best we will see in our lifetimes let us remember that first and foremost it is a children's book taking things one at a time what would you suggest she have done differently with the gringott's bit or the ministry of magic part i can't see how she left any relative points out of the story perhaps she could have stretched it a bit but isn't that what she would have had to do stretching it out is not necessarily a good idea a writer tells the story there is such a thing as overtelling too personally i was satisfied with both of those sections i thought that they were well written exciting and highly immersing now calling harry a pansy surely you jest i mean come on what did you expect voldemort was hunting him and as the best hope of the wizarding world for voldemort's downfall naturally he was protected i think it was made pretty clear that harry didn't want to let people die for him but he had no choice they were all fighting something much bigger and when it came his turn to die i believe he met it with incredible courage rare courage hardly the act of a pansy nor was the moment he went against voldemort in the end the next statement the battle of hogwarts wth yes they lose at the begining because harry has not yet sacrificed himself for them remember when harry sacrifices himself it has the same effect on the troops at hogwarts his own mother's sacrifice had upon him refering to the protection that comes with someone dying for you in an act of love and sacrifice after harry's sacrifice none of voldemort's spells will hold on the masses at hogwarts it would seem that the protection extends to the death eaters as well which follows as otherwise harry would have been under attack at the dursley's as far as the centaurs go they wouldn't fight originally because it was all fated in their opinion they didn't have to fight because they knew harry would win when hagrid passed them and told them harry was dead and showed them what looked to be harry's dead body i believe they decided that they had better step in as things had obviously not gone in harry's favor perhaps the centaurs realized that they were the swing vote so to speak either way the centaurs were never partial to voldemort although they tried to play it neutral when push came to shove they knew what side they needed to fight for i did't think it was repetitive at all i thought that the whole of the book explored the characters in a new way i think rowling is brilliant the way she has managed to age these characters so artfully that we all take it for granted if you could tell what was going to happen and write it so artfully then i sincerely suggest you do so i am a writer and i found myself pleasantly surprised by everything except what was foreshadowed for so long it was obviously already in the works again remember this is a children's book it should have a happy ending that neatly sums up all plot lines i would go on further but you are saved from it from my need to be elsewhere sounds like you are ready for some higher level reading may i suggest tom clancy completely different genre but he has the in depth plot detail you seem to be searching for perhaps stephen king or the lord of the rings you would like better Magic (Harry Potter) Death Eater Harry Potter Wizarding world Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone J.
