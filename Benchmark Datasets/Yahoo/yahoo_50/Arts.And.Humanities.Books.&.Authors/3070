is there anyone who read th the vinci code written by dan brown plz contact with me i want to discuss about that nobel yes i've read it i thought it was quite entertaining but not really very good the writing and characterisation is lazy for example he repeats that the girl has 'olive green eyes' about six times and the plot is very contrived the idea on which it's based is also quite silly there's no real evidence that jesus got married and had children or that a secret society had information about it after all if it was true why should they keep it a secret for so long but overall it's perfectly good as a light read i actually prefer angels and demons though which is much more over the top and fun Angels and Demons Dan Brown Gospel of John Holy Blood, Holy Grail Mona Lisa Charmed Microeconomics Race of Jesus Gnosticism Angel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Charles Dickens Sinfest Secret Gospel of Mark Lord of the Flies Priory of Sion Jennifer Lopez Socrates Opus Dei Book of Mormon Freemasonry Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Frank Herbert Holy Grail Demon Little Britain Jon Secada Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Mary Magdalene Supply-side economics Timeline of alternative rock First Vision Deconstruction Novel Plato Intellectual property Theodicy I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Alice Liddell Kabbalah A Beautiful Mind Eagle (comic) Death Note Pride and Prejudice Thinks ...
