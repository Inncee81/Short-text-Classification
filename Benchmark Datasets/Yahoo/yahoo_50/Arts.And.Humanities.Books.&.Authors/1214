was a character raped in the new harry potter book i heard someone say so and it had me slightly concerned no no no one got raped that would be a bit extreme don't you i guess there is a very very small detail in the book about a character that could almost be taken that way but it definitely wasn't that spoiler warning below when my sister ariana dumbledore's sister was six years old she was attacked set upon by three muggle boys they'd seen her doing magic spying through the back garden hedge she was a kid she couldn't control it no with or wizard can at that age what they saw scared them i expect they forced their way through the hedge and when she couldn't show them the trick they got a bit carried away tyring to stop the freak doing it that could be what was inferred but i don't think she was raped so don't worry all is good Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Death Eater Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Albus Dumbledore Severus Snape Diagon Alley Lord Voldemort Dates in Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Magic (Harry Potter) Ministry of Magic Harry Potter Dursley family Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone James and Lily Potter Minor Ravenclaws Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Horace Slughorn Dolores Umbridge Minor Hufflepuffs R.A.B.
