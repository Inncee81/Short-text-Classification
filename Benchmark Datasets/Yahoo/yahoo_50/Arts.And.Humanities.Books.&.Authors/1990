what did you think about harry potter th spoilers neville's 'la resistance' did he aquire super strength in this book or what i was shocked that he was the one to step forth to voldemort and challenge him straight out like that even when he thought that voldemort had just killed harry wow neville got raw in that instant when neville killed nagini he became as important as harry had been during the whole series and in one scene it was totally unexpected in a way the prophecy meant both harry and neville after all when you think of it that way i mean voldemort couldn't have died if the last horcrux still existed so really they both destroyed him of course and also dumbledore ron hermionie r a b crabbe goyle draco they all played a part in destroying the horcrux but yeah if it wasn't for harry getting killed then voldemort wouldn't have let his guard down and if he didn't let his guard down then nagini would die but he had to die because voldemort had a horcrux in him thank god for reseruction Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death Eater Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Ron Weasley Draco Malfoy Magical objects in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Neville Longbottom Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts subjects Ginny Weasley Horace Slughorn Dumbledore's Army Severus Snape Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Blood purity (Harry Potter) James and Lily Potter Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Hogwarts R.A.B.
