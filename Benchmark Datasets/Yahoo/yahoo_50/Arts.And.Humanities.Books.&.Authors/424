how to get started on a novel i'm trying to write a novel but when ever i try to start writing i can think of anything start with a black and white marble notebook they work the best because they don't fall apart start brainstorming about anything that interests you write ideas thoughts draw pictures if you want just keep your thoughts flowing fill it with ideas when you have a lot of different disjointed thoughts in there sit down and read through them with some different color highlighters highlight different ideas that particularly interest you see if any of them hook together in any way try writing some short stories or even fragments with those ideas just very loose thoughts written quickly and freely don't worry about it making sense just write then sift through those stories and fragments for something that lends itself to a longer work there is the idea for a novel start with your homework character studies outline and research use your other thoughts to see if you come up with other ideas for backstories really focus on your character studies flesh out your characters and make them living beings with pasts give them dreams wishes thoughts as well as characteristics know as much about them as you know about your closest friends these people will become your closest friends as you write their lives will become your story as well as your backstories and subplots the next step is to figure the beginning middle and end that sounds silly but it is harder than you think the beginning represents a conflict something happens that starts this story in motion the middle is what your characters do regarding that conflict how they behave what they do etc the ending is how they manage to resolve it try a story curve draw a rainbow on one end put the beginning the conflict on the other end the ending the resolution at the top put the climax when something happens that leads to the resolution then pencil in events in the middle that is how you build your story then comes the hardest part of all a kick butt first sentence and five solid first pages that literally pull your reader into the story that first sentence is the hardest one to get on paper make it count imagine that a publisher is giving you one sentence to impress him use it as best you can then as a writer i advise you to treat writing as a job give yourself regular office hours certain hours a day to write the same time every day preferably write during those hours then save and shut the computer down walk away for the day this is how you learn to become a disciplined writer all great writers have their office hours some manage a couple hundred words a day others a couple thousand the pace depends on what is comfortable for you pushing it will only hurt the work savor the experience of writing so start brainstorming and good luck pax c Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Milton H.
