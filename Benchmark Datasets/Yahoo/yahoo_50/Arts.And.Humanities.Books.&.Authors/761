hp the sorcerer's stone question why was prof quirrell able to touch harry in the beginning of the book they shook hands and yet in the end he was burned by harry's touch i know voldemort using quirrell's body was hindered by the love left by lily potter but wouldn't you think the same reaction would have happened when quirrell voldemort touched him earlier is this because voldemort revealed himself to harry and was then suspectible that seems weird to me all the people telling you that they didn't shake hands are those people who only watched the movie you are indeed right that they shake hands at the beginning of the book here's how harry doesn't comment in his thoughts anyway on quirrel's turban until he gets to hogwarts that suggests that the turban is a new addition to the professor harry thinks it's wierd that he's wearing the turban if quirrel was wearing it in london that day then harry would either have mentioned it then as being wierd or not have mentioned it at all because it wouldn't be so wierd later if he had already seen it when they were in london if you think about the events of that day harry was there to get his school items they took the stone from gringotts then quirrel tried to steal it but it was too late at the end voldy explains that he had to watch quirrel more closely after that day because he failed which means after that day he joined with quirrels body that explains why the turban didn't show up until after that day and it explains why quirrel could touch harry before but not after that there was no voldy in quirrel in the beginning of the book when voldy joined quirrel's body the turban was added and quirrel could no longer touch harry Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban James and Lily Potter Dates in Harry Potter Death Eater Diagon Alley Hogwarts subjects Hermione Granger Rubeus Hagrid Ron Weasley Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Severus Snape Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Harry Potter: Book Seven Ginny Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Remus Lupin Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Minor Hufflepuffs Magic (Harry Potter) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Sirius Black Harry Potter Horace Slughorn Horcrux Sybill Trelawney Minor Hogwarts teachers Hogwarts Houses Piccolo Junior Saga Order of the Phoenix Neville Longbottom "Weird Al" Yankovic Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Minor Ravenclaws Rita Skeeter Half-Blood Prince (character) Battle of Hogwarts J.
