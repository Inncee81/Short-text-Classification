hello i'm writing a suspenseful dark story but i cannot develop a decent plot for the story any ideas please be a great plot and not plagarized from something else look up joseph campbell's hero of a thousand faces it distills the principles of class storytelling structure george lucas credited campbell's works as a major inspiration for the plot of star wars not specifically dark and suspenseful but it may give you some good pointers for plot development overall other than that i find the best way to draw out the plot of a story is simply to write it don't overthink it don't analyze it at all don't try too hard to plan and plot it simply let the first draft flow like a stream of consciousness you may toss most of it but often you'll be surprised how it seems to write itself and how much of that first draft you keep i solve my biggest plot problems that way and more often than not i discover a side to my characters and my story that i never expected along the way good luck Star Wars Storytelling The Foundation Series Joseph Campbell Extreme Programming Monomyth Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Screenwriting New York Knicks Legion of Super-Heroes Crisis on Infinite Earths Force (Star Wars) Chess terminology Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Objective-C Tonality Canon (fiction) Wheel of Fortune Pointer Genre fiction Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Transactional analysis George Lucas Ghost in the Shell Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Mythology Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Ewoks: The Battle for Endor WGA screenwriting credit system Chess strategy and tactics Laser Alan Moore Star Wars: Clone Wars C.
