how do i get my great book published and in the first place funded i am writing a great book and need to get some finance to allow me to concentrate on it and it will be great when complete ho wdo i do it many people are writing books and all will agree it is a precarious living you cannot submit to a publisher or agent until you have finished the book so you need income now why not find yourself a part time job and write during the rest of the time once the book is finished and edited send the first three chapters and a synopsis to agents to see if one will tke you on or you can submit straight to a publisher but one at a time you can of course self publish and sell the book yourself but this is not the best way to do things to get the best answers why not sign up for classes and attend courses on writing when you submit your manuscript to agents they will want to know what training you have had and what clubs etc you belong to this is to check that you are serious with your writing and not just playing at it good luck Publishing Laura Ingalls Wilder Graduate school Chuck Palahniuk The writing of Principia Mathematica The Hobbit Abraham ibn Ezra F.
