what are the various colors of edward's eyes we all know edward's eyes change different colors with his different moods but does anyone know the exact colors to which moods well they dont exactly change color with his moods but they change color when he gets thirstier when he has just gone hunting they are light brown which means he is in a good mood and when he gets thirstier they get darker until they are black and he cant control himself as much and he gets in a bad mood that is why when he first met bella his eyes were dark and he acted so strange around her because he couldnt control his thirst but before edward was a vampire his eyes were green edwards clan is different so unlike most others their eyes are golden and other vampires' are red i hope this helps Eye color Black Dragon Booster Kain (Legacy of Kain) Color Color theory Iris (anatomy) Hair color Color blindness Pysanka Sunglasses Sub-Zero Camouflage Heterochromia Light-emitting diode English grammar Wario Beret Grammatical mood Human skin color Eye Death rock CMYK color model Super Castlevania IV Melanin Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Ninja Primary color Vortigaunt Yu-Gi-Oh!
