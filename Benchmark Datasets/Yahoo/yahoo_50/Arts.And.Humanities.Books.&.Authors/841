what did you think of harry potter and the deathly hallows i thought it was absolutely amazing so good i can't describe it in words if i were to describe it in emotion it would be tear laugh and scream and then a jump for joy lol what did you think of it based on the number of people here who didn't understand it and the fact that jk rowling has had to come public for the first time to actually explain parts of her book i think it was unsuccessful i know that is an unpopular response here but if you stopped and thought about it you would realize what i mean the kings cross chapter is probably the most confusing chapter for most people there are thousands of questions about it here oddly i respect her the most for attempting that chapter but it doesn't work for the majority of people they don't get it also the epilogue was unsuccessful it asked more questions than it answered not a good thing for the last book in a series also i felt that the deaths were handled too haphazardly when you write about a character for whole books over several years you don't just throw them down like so much dead meat dead on a table and say they died the house elf was the only one who got a death scene the rest were poorly handled the camping and arguing scenes were far too long and got tedious if she cut out half of those scenes she could have given some attention to the deaths of her important characters heck she could have cut out or more pages alone by simply removing her superfluous use of the word that and the passive had seen etc tense her editor should have fixed that if you are writing a series and planning on ending it end it the ending should tie up all the loose ends this did not yes i read it yes i read all yes all are in my personal library a real library with a fireplace and leather furniture and the whole deal i just think she dropped ball it could have been much better there are many authors who handle the series ending thing a lot better pax c Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nicomachean Ethics Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J.
