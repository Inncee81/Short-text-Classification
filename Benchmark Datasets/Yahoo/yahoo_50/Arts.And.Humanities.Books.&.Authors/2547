there are some things i don't understand in harry potter and the deathly hallows spoliers alright so be warned this is your final chance there will be spoilers my first question why is it that harry was able to come back from ding so easily he died but was able to return to his body just by like jumping down to earth or something nd question did i totally misssomething or was it skipped over but how did neville get the sword of gryffindor after it had been stolen far away from hogwart's at gringott's what was up with that ring that turned dumbledore's hand black i am pretty sure it was a hocrux that cursed him and was going to spread and kill him but i was tired while reading that part and it jumbled me i also would like to know about a few of the characters because i forgot how they got into the series in the first place it's been a while since i read the half blood prince and the other books the chaacters are fleur tonks percy where'd he go again and why were his parents mad at him mundungus mad eye i know he was a former teacher of datda okay so enough about the characters i understand that as well as the whole sword thing that's been resolved the ring on dubledore's hand though it contained the ressurection stone and so harry never died the hocrux in him was killed when he was hit with the elder wand and not him because it was the elder wand and he was it's master did i get that right i remember all the other books now i plan on re reading the series sometime within the month now that i understand the series also i really didn't miss all that much to all of those that think i missed a lot it was mostly miniscule details i appreciate all of your help there were so many great answers i'm going to have a difficult time choosing the best one you definitely made the most of the points that would be deducted to you by asking a question this is quite a tall order you're the nth person to have asked the first questions but i'd answer them nonetheless harry was given the choice to either go on or go back because his decision to sacrifice himself to save others made all the difference in dying and living he was able to conquer death by not being afraid to die voldemort only killed his own bit of soul that was unintentionally put into harry neville got the sword of gryffindor because he displayed bravery and daringness griphook's claim that godric stole the sword for ragnook was not true gryffindor is the true owner of the sword and the sorting hat too and since he's considered a great wizard of the age he would have put advanced magic and enchantments on the sword that goes beyond whatever goblins' idea of ownership is or mere physical possession of it it was just like when harry was able to pull it out of the sorting hat it was securely hung at dumbledore's office yet it was there when he needed it voldemort performed dark magic on peverell's ring just like he did with the locket dumbledore on his desire to see his parents and sister put on the ring forgetting that it was already a horcrux and thus would be cursed snape was able to contain the poision on his one hand that's why it's blackened and control the spread of the poision for the time being fleur was the beauxbaton champion during the triwizard tournament she and bill met at hogwarts by then end of the book decided to work at gringotts to improve her eenglish and bill became

lupin who didn't want to pursue any relationship with her because of his condition she is a niece of bellatrix and narcissa her mother andromeda was their sister percy the big time careerist prat had a falling out with his family in book when he decided not to believe harry and dumbledore and disowned his family for doing so and instead put his loyalty to fudge and the ministry mundungus fletcher was a low life petty criminal who was a member of the order of the phoenix it was because of him that harry and dudley were attacked by the dementors he left his post as harry's guard to look into cheap cauldrons he could buy then resell mad eye alastor moody was a brilliant and very skilled auror and member of the order of the phoenix the real mad eye did not become dada professor it was barty
