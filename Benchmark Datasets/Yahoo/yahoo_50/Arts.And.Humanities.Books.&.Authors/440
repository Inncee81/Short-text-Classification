are you for gay marriage if so please expound on why thanks as a christian and a libertarian who hates control and fascism and inequality i can surely see both sides religion and government should not mix political scenes are turning my faith into a hotbed for power hungry debates and hatred instead of love and forgiveness and unconditional positive regard for others so here is the best solution i've ever heard abolish marriage completely for everybody remove it's legal standing it's a religious institution anyway allow every citizen the same rights under a civil union straight and gay alike the rights and priviledges for marriage now could be transfered to the civil union and that should be the document in the us to end this you have to compromise some things and be fair to both sides those who want to get married can acquire a certificate at a church ceremony that is not legally recognized this way christians and muslims will not see their sacred ceremony as defiled and all will be equal in this country pleases everybody there are churches that will marry gay people and the majority of churches will declare them married by a false church and the marriage invalid the church should also be happy to see atheist couples quit acting like they need a pastor to be joined but the point is that it ceases to be america's problem it becomes the church's and the church has been disagreeing on this anyway why not leave it all to it i don't want christians to be known for winning this battle in the political world we have others to fight that are more important like loving people and ending poverty and stuff it may be possible that the powers that be are trying to keep us distracted with this issue that so polarizes while when we are not looking they steal our money start wars and do other stuff behind our backs it's time to focus on our huge bullying government rather than constantly blather on about gay marriage it's a principle of the thing issue anyway Same-sex marriage Marriage Separation of church and state Same-sex marriage in Canada Ten Commandments Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Civil rights Gay rights Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage in the United States Civil union Federal Marriage Amendment Libertarianism Religion and sexuality Divorce Religion and sexual orientation Democratic Party (United States) American Civil Liberties Union History of the British constitution Calvinism Roman Catholic Church Democracy Parliament of the United Kingdom Fundamentalism Liberalism Pledge of Allegiance Christian right Capitalism Constitution Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Defense of Marriage Act French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Civil unions in the United Kingdom Christian-Jewish reconciliation Unitarian Universalism Homosexuality and Judaism Left-wing politics Status of religious freedom in France Eastern Orthodox Church Liberal Democrats (UK) Gay rights timeline Israeli Arab Baptism American Conservatism Conservatism Religious conversion Same-sex marriage in Alberta Property (ownership right) Sexual orientation Soviet Union Homophobia Thomas Jefferson Centre Party (Germany) Family First Party Dred Scott v.
