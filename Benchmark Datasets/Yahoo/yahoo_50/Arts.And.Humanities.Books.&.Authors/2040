looking for a book called hot potato katie my sister use to read this book to me in the early 's its about a girl who would put hot potato's in her pockets so that she wouldnt get cold on the way to school it's definitely from the katie john books they are among my absolute favorites and there is a fourth book published much later than the first three called katie john and heathcliff i think the hot potato episode is from honestly katie john but i'll have to check my copy of the book tomorrow and can edit and let you know for sure but i highly recommend the first three books anyway Katie Couric Minor characters associated with Quidditch Glen Jacobs Wuthering Heights Mary Poppins Mirmo!
