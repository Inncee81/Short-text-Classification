harry potter vs the real world ok so i was thinking about it and im sure you have also but there are so many similarities in the harry potter books with things in real life for instance voldemort is like hitler in the fact that voldemort wanted only pure bloods to rule when in fact he was half blood and hitler wanted all aryan people to rule when he was german so my question is what are some other similarities between the harry potter world and our world and no i dont believe magic is real and harry potter will rule the world i know its fiction so dont put stupid answers please thanks oh most definitely the importance of loyalty family friends and sticking up for what is right protecting each other truth in the media killing based on beliefs which i think translates to religious beliefs on who should be the chosen people Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lord Voldemort Harry Potter: Book Seven Severus Snape Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ginny Weasley Weasley family Hogwarts Neville Longbottom Death Eater Magic (Harry Potter) Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Order of the Phoenix Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tom Riddle's diary Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Rita Skeeter Horcrux Remus Lupin Draco Malfoy Luna Lovegood Diagon Alley Battle of Hogwarts Hogwarts Houses Hogwarts subjects Minor Hufflepuffs Coercion Mein Kampf Fan fiction Magic (paranormal) Confucius Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Bellatrix Lestrange Ministry of Magic Wizarding world Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Nazism Luck Horace Slughorn Barty Crouch Legilimency Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Harry Potter in translation Ludwig Wittgenstein Simone Weil Lucius Malfoy Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix John Wycliffe Canon (fiction) Rufus Scrimgeour Assassination Sybill Trelawney Supernatural Wizard Wand Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Fundamentalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Peter Pettigrew Epistemology Ghost Propaganda Aryan invasion theory Arthur Weasley A Course In Miracles Hitler's political beliefs Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of mathematics Biblical inerrancy Columbine High School massacre German student movement Yu-Gi-Oh!
