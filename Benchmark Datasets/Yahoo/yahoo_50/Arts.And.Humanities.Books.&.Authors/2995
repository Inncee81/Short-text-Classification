dumbledore and snape th and th book spoilers okay so i finished reading the th book the day after it came out and its more than two weeks later but something just dawned on me so did dumbledore keep snape from the defense against the dark arts job because it was cursed meaning did he keep it from him until the year that he knew he was going to die and snape would be the one to kill him and knew that snape would have to flee from hogwarts because no one knew the real circumstances i mean everyone that is a fan of the books know that snape was fond of this job but since it was cursed if he was allowed to take it at an earlier post would something else have happened to him any thoughts i finished the book on the rd day so i know what you are saying i think that dumbledore kept snape from the job because it was all part of his plan or that it was to protect him Severus Snape Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Albus Dumbledore Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts Harry Potter (character) Magic (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Death Eater Ginny Weasley Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Horace Slughorn Hermione Granger Professor Quirrell Order of the Phoenix Draco Malfoy James and Lily Potter Sybill Trelawney Minor Ravenclaws Hogwarts Floor Directory Legilimency Rubeus Hagrid Fan fiction Spoiler (media) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Bellatrix Lestrange Dumbledore's Army Unbreakable Vow Neville Longbottom Potions in Harry Potter Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Occlumency Dark Art Hogwarts Houses Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Sirius Black Minerva McGonagall Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Gilderoy Lockhart Minor characters associated with Quidditch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Aberforth Dumbledore Peter Pettigrew Blood purity (Harry Potter) Diagon Alley Minor Hogwarts teachers Hogwarts ghosts Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Fawkes Dolores Umbridge Ministry of Magic Wizarding world Poppy Pomfrey Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Ordinary Wizarding Level Barty Crouch Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Horcrux Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Filius Flitwick Alaga__sia Kain (Legacy of Kain) Alucard (Castlevania) Alan Rickman Year of the Spider Messiahs in fiction and fantasy R.A.B.
