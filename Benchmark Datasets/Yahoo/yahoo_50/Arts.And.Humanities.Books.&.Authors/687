will i like stephen king's dark tower series i'm i love fantasy like harry potter pendragon crhonicles of narnia what's the series about is it recommended is it easy to understan i've read carrie by him before and i loved it i love the series but the first one the gunslinger is kind of difficult to get through they are long books and there's some material that could be hard to wrap your brain around but ultimately it's worth it if you do start it just don't get discouraged if you run into any tough parts it'll all pay off oddly enough toward the end of the series he makes several harry potter references from the other stuff you enjoy it sounds like this series is a good choice for you The Chronicles of Narnia Harry Potter C.
