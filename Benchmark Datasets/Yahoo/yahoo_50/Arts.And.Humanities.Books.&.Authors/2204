what happens at book clubs i know that the group discusses the book but what kinds of things do they discuss symbolism morals book clubs are fun in my experience the people involved mainly discuss their opinions about the book why they liked it or didn't like it who their favorite character was and why things like that they were pretty informal but the host hostess of the week kept most of the chat on the book while also providing snacks and drinks yum and a fire in the fireplace in winter time great stuff the members also voted on which book to read next even if the one who started the club named the first book so keep that in mind too Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Have I Got News For You Milton H.
