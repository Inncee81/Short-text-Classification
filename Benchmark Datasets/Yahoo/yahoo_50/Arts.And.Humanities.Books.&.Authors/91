do you like stephen king i admire and like to read stephen king but sadly i have to say that his best years were when he was riddled with chemicals it may just be his age or station in life which probably hasn't changed that much in the last years but all of his stuff since like hearts in atlantis seems to be not up to the standards that he set with the shining and the stand dark tower series etc he also bugs me a little because he seems to play into the whole image of the baby boomer rock and roll music cars etc but i am sure that really appeals ot his baby boomer audience that has kept him in the game for so long so i really can't blame that plus he is of that generation and that is not his fault i read lisey's story a while ago and it just didn't jive with me there is supposed to be a gruesome scene with a can opener and i just could not conceptualize it even though he said the brand and everything the next time i went to the supermarket i looked at the can opener and still do every time i go to see how he accomplished the maiming scene but the can opener just wouldn't work in my opinion he just seems ot be falling off but has had a long and excellent career Stephen King Cincinnati Bengals The Dark Tower (series) Hearts in Atlantis Battlestar Galactica (2003) Time Out of Mind The Beatles' influence Conan the Barbarian Cliff Richard Randall Flagg Theory of conduct Demographics Baby boomer The Flintstones Macbeth Empire Burlesque Debugging The Inside Jon Secada Boomer Esiason Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
