harry potter deathly hallows why didn't harry feel any pain when he was hit by crucio i don't understand this chapter the flaw in the plan narcissa malfoy lies to voldemort that harry is dead then why didn't harry feel any pain when voldemort hit him with with the crucio curse harry was the true master of the elder wand the wand refuses to harm it's master but i don't understand why he was thrown up down times the curse should have just bounced off harry i don't agree with the theory that voldemort did not mean to inflict pain that won't be in keeping with voldemort's evil nature minimoo why was it so important that he had his mother's eyes because snape loved lily since harry has lily's eyes snape couldn't help but love protect harry this was despite the fact that harry looked liked james in many ways what did ginny end up doing with her life following hogwarts ginny joins the holyhead harpies and after spending a few years on the team as a celebrated player later retires to raise her family and becomes senior quidditch correspondent at the daily prophet did harry end up playing quidditch at some point surely he must have what a talent to waste not as a professional he didn't but he may have persued this as a hobby for sure with ginny playing all he it would be rather unnatural that he didn't play apparently both harry and ron became auro's eventually with harry being head of department does this mean harry ron and hermoine went back to hogwarts to finish school or did they just become aurors because they helped kill voldemort i'd like to belive they went to school since hogwart's did reopen what happened to all the death eaters after voldy died surely there must have been some of them that were a bit pissed off that he had died a second time sure death eaters were still there because if they were not then there would be no need for aurors we know that harry ron are aurours did somebody finally convince hagrid to get rid of aragog's offspring seeing as they attacked hogwarts students on voldy's command they must have tried but if they succeeded or not can t say for sure who is the new hogwarts principle as aparently professor mcgonnogal was too old for the position jkr didn't specify Magical objects in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter: Book Seven Hogwarts Houses Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix Hermione Granger Lucius Malfoy Draco Malfoy Horace Slughorn Magic (Harry Potter) Professor Quirrell Luna Lovegood Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ministry of Magic Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Minor Hufflepuffs Weasley family Half-Blood Prince (character) Tom Riddle's diary Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Minor Ravenclaws Peter Pettigrew Minor Harry Potter Beasts Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Dark Art Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Nymphadora Tonks Sybill Trelawney Wizarding world Minerva McGonagall Fred and George Weasley Remus Lupin House-elf Bellatrix Lestrange Cho Chang Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Fawkes Rita Skeeter Dolores Umbridge Minor Slytherins Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Knots Landing Potions in Harry Potter Dark Mark Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Unbreakable Vow Theory of conduct Cedric Diggory Horcrux Kain (Legacy of Kain) YuYu Hakusho Minor Hogwarts teachers Viktor Krum Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Igor Karkaroff Fan fiction Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Barty Crouch Ordinary Wizarding Level Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Kreacher Timeline of fictional historical events Legilimency Beauxbatons Dobby Hogwarts Express
