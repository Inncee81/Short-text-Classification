edward or jacob i'm team edward all the way for sure jacob is too annoying and possesive atleast all edward wanted was for bella to be happy even if she didn't end up being with him edward loved her so much that all he would want for her was to have her happy i think edward is the best choice and they are extremley cute when they're together with jacob it's too boring plus who would choose edward p he's edward okay the book i am talking about is a series the twilight series in fact don't post if you don't know who edward and jacob are i am a jacob black fan all the way but in no way do i want him to end up with bella that would just be wrong bella is edward's soul mate jacob is in love with bella but that is just because he doesn't know something better is out there for him he thinks bella is as good as it gets because he has never had another relationship of crush when he finds the person he imprints with he will be singing a whole different toon i think it will work out the same way it did for sam he thought he was in love with leah but then emily came along and turned his world upside down Little Britain Knots Landing Friends Taken EastEnders Glen Jacobs Humphrey Bogart Garfield Jon Secada Negima Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Shaggy dog story Genesis Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show Nicomachean Ethics Tiny Toon Adventures Predestination Pitaten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Insane Clown Posse Theory of conduct Sacrifice (computer game) Into the West (miniseries) Pok__mon Live!
