will harry potter survive the test of time what do you think will happen to harry potter in future i am a huge harry potter and i hope as well as think that it will be a piece of cake for children at least for the next years or so even though the final book disappointed me a bit see the other questions i have asked today from my profile still i will never be able to forget the phenomenon it has created myself the first ever harry potter book that i read was harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban in and even though i didn't understand half of it i didn't even know that there were two previous books i have stayed glued to the books ever since finally let's all raise a glass to harry potter the boy who lived and jkr the lady who stirred the world sorry for the horrible english i keep missing words in between that's an interesting questions people like you and i will certainly read the books to our children and give them to your children's children and so on however i don't think they will have the popularity with future generations that they do now a large part of the interest obsession was having to wait years for the next installment forming theories of what you think will happen waiting in line to get the book at midnight etc anyone who starts reading the books now won't have that suspense which largely led to the harry potter craze when we pass this series along to our children they will have access to all books at one time and could get through the entire series in a few weeks no suspense no sensation i think they will remain popular but not to present day standards Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) J.
