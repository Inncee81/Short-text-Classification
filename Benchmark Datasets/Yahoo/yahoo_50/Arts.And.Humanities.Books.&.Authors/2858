name help i'm writing a novel and i need to decide what the main character's name will be she is russian and a dancer yeah i know stereotypical but believe me the story is not in the least stereotypical i've narrowed it down to two here are the names and their meanings and yes they are spelled correctly jelena shining light or nika born on sunday personally i like nika because i've never heard it used in a novel before but what do you all think thanks and god bless nika is short spunky for someone who has a bit of an attitude a bit emotional or tempestuous younger sounding so definately not mature for her age a good name for a character who has to face outer conflict with things beyond her control rather than dealing with inner conflict depending on what it was jelena is an older more elegant and formal name brings to mind someone who is generally calm mature and quiet almost mysterious to those around her she sound slike someone who may seem like she has everything together because she wants to appear that way but is falling apart inside now which name fits your character better Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Joke Social psychology Non-native pronunciations of English Social rule The Fairly OddParents Hiberno-English Mantra The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie John Cage Aikido God Emperor of Dune Eastern Orthodox Church Jon Secada Literature Economics She Loves You Vegeta Fast bowling Ten Commandments Scientology beliefs and practices Leet Magic (paranormal) Maison Ikkoku Narrative Treehouse of Horror V Jiddu Krishnamurti Sinfest Psychoanalysis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Gender-neutral language Tamil language Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Hearing impairment Physical attractiveness Paul Is Dead Dither Azumanga Daioh Mobile Fighter G Gundam Pok__mon (anime) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Apology (Plato) Religious Society of Friends Hulk (comics) Human MP3 Hell Star Ocean: The Second Story Property (ownership right) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Advertising Goodness and value theory Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII International Phonetic Alphabet Infantilism Kanji Identity Crisis (comics) Ancient Greek Canadian English Link (Legend of Zelda) Equine conformation Music EastEnders Aristotle Emotions (album) Summa Theologiae Ethics Tom and Jerry (MGM) Miss Saigon American and British English differences John Berryman Sant Mat Modernism Mind (The Culture) John Howard Yoder Predestination Gestalt therapy Statutory rape Wood Ages of Myst Finnish language Theory of conduct Isaac Asimov Modem The Death Gate Cycle Epistemology Ed, Edd n Eddy Simone Weil Hwi Noree Asperger syndrome Information warfare Value system Scientific method Nicomachean Ethics Das Lied von der Erde Gender role Cupid and Psyche Art Nika riots
