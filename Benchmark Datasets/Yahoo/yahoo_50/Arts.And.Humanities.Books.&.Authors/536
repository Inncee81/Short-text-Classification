why did voldemort initially want to kill harry potter i may just be stupid but i still don't know why he wanted to kill harry potter it all started when dumbledore was interviewing trelawney for the divination job at hogwarts at the end of the interview which didn't go so well she made a real prediction about how a boy born at the end of july would have the power the dark lord knows not snape overheard and told his master he was a death eater at the time everything he heard the prophecy could have applied to either neville or harry but voldemort chose harry as his equal harry was half blood just like voldemort so then voldemort went after the potters and was unable to kill harry uh oh that meant danger for voldemort barely clinging to life he fled he knew he had an arch enemy he thought by getting rid of harry the only one who could ever dispose of him or the chose one it would be possible to conquer death Sybill Trelawney Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts subjects Severus Snape James and Lily Potter Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (character) Death Eater Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter: Book Seven Ministry of Magic Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hermione Granger Magical objects in Harry Potter Horcrux Blood purity (Harry Potter) Sirius Black Minor Hufflepuffs Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ginny Weasley Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hogwarts Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Bellatrix Lestrange Hogwarts Houses Dumbledore's Army Rita Skeeter Horace Slughorn Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Professor Quirrell Half-Blood Prince (character) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Peter Pettigrew Draco Malfoy R.A.B.
