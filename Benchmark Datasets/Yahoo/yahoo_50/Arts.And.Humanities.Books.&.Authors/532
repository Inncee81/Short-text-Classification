why are people all over freaking out over harry potter the book is mainly written for children but i see adults camping out days prior to the official launch of the latest edition of harry potter and the books are for themselves not for a child i just do not get it i love books and i know i have my favourites but someone please explain this phenomenon for me boy wizards to a child the subject matter does makes sense but to an adult huh it is one of the most incredible series of books ever written if i hadn't had a child i never would have read any of them but because she was reading them i wanted to find out what the hoopla was about so i picked up the first one it hooked me immediately i was an english major and have written all my life i recognize great writing when i see it whether it is marketed to children or not even though children are the main characters the story line is very complex and deep and it pulls you in to not read it would be like saying lord of the rings is only for hobbits now i am not one of those crazed fans who dresses up and camps out all night for the book release but everybody's gotta have their passion in life and there are much worse things to get obsessed with so i say kudos to them do what you wanna do Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Hobbit Elijah Wood Canon (fiction) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire The Chronicles of Narnia Children's literature Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) J.
