what qualities made you like the harry potter series and what would would you like to see in a similar book this was posted before but i still haven't got the spark i needed your other answers have been taken into account and are appreciated fully but i would still appreciate more i'm looking for some ideas and inspiration to start a series of books with a similar overall literary structure as the harry potter series ex centralized on three main characters an adventure quest toward a mutual goal that is not immediately realized by the main characters main characters are strangers but their relationship grows evolves strengthens through the predicaments and situations they are forced through i would like to know three things you believe would make the story enjoyable and gripping the setting time period i was thinking 's the antagonist just a rough example of who you would like our main characters to be fighting and anything else you would like to suggest i know this is a lot to ask but i would very much appreciate the help thanks in advance i liked the fact that jk wasn't like stephen king in the sense that she didn't spend way too much time on setting i was nervous after watching the first three movies that i wouldn't be able to get into the books because there would be too much description but their wasn't i also liked the fact that the characters weren't flat they were all complex just like real life people they all had their own secrets even if it took a long time to find out some of them i also like the fact that she kept it real spoiler in book harry ron and hermione weren't using magic that they didn't know previously they didn't all of a sudden turn into the worlds most talented wizards and witch they just used their brains and won because of that setting i'm not really into scifi books so i like settings to be places that are believable jk didn't need to describe every last detail of hogwarts and the surrounding grounds because you were supposedly still in the real world just out of the sight of muggles so you know what alot of things look like time period the 's are great kids would be able to read it because many kids reading young adult literature were born in the early to mid 's so they can remember being alive in the 's so it's not far fetched for them the antagonist i liked voldemort because he was shown to have been a real person when he was young and still tom riddle he was just a real kid with real dreams yes he was a jerk and turned evil but he wasn't some evil monster from birth so it was more realistic as long as you make your bad guy out to be a real person than it will be ok spoiler at the end of book he accidentally killed himself because he was so pompous and egomaniacal and that was only believable because we saw him as a real person good luck with your book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Ron Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter (character) Ginny Weasley Hogwarts subjects Hogwarts Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Lord Voldemort Harry Potter: Book Seven Hermione Granger Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Death Eater Severus Snape Magic (Harry Potter) Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Weasley family Minor Hufflepuffs Horace Slughorn Fictional character Draco Malfoy Minor Harry Potter Beasts Rubeus Hagrid Sirius Black Wizarding world Rita Skeeter Minor Ravenclaws Theory of conduct Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Daredevil Tom Riddle's diary The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) R.A.B.
