voldemort at king's cross why did voldemort look like a disfigured baby at king's cross with harry and dumbeldore by the way even in the th part before voldemort regained his body he was to some extent in the same form here the scene at king's cross happens when voldemort's soul which until now was within harry's body was destoyed by voldemort himself when he performed the avada kedavra on harry thus essentially destroying one of the last parts of his own soul and decreasing his strength and hence in a way him too to the form of a horribly disfigured child suffering 'struggling for breath' as a sign of life slowly ebbing away from him not that he was truly alive in the first place there's also the point of voldemort having drunk unicorn's blood in the 'philosopher's stone' for which firenze did say something about being cursed so this may be like that too suffering even in death or near death Lord Voldemort Death Eater Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter (character) Dates in Harry Potter Horcrux Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Cedric Diggory Battle of Hogwarts Professor Quirrell Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sybill Trelawney James and Lily Potter Hogwarts Dark Art Azkaban Ginny Weasley Peter Pettigrew Fawkes Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Blood purity (Harry Potter) Frank Bryce Lucius Malfoy Magic (Harry Potter) Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter Kain (Legacy of Kain) Ministry of Magic Harry Potter: Book Seven Tom Riddle's diary Days of our Lives Ron Weasley Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Barty Crouch Neville Longbottom Sirius Black Hogwarts subjects Resurrection of Jesus Twisted Metal Barty Crouch Jr. Bellatrix Lestrange Phaedo Firenze (Harry Potter) Horace Slughorn Order of the Phoenix Reincarnation Darth Vader Tom Riddle Dursley family Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Soul Weasley family R.A.B.
