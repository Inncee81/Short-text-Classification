truman capote's in cold blood i have just finished reading truman capote's in cold blood i loved the book but was a little confused by it i didnt really understand the main idea of the book what capote was trying to communicate or the important points in the book thanks i am interested to hear what others thought of the book so feel free to share things like what did you think of the author's writing style how this book may have changed your life or affected the way you think or act i have read the book and i was also around when it first came out it created quite a stir because it created a new genre which was the telling of a true story as if it were a novel capote did his best to balance the desire to be objective with the desire to make the story read like a novel i think he succeeded the reason the book seems confusing is that although it seems like a novel it isn't in a novel the reader expects things to be explained explicitly or implicitly it's also expected that the author have a 'message' of some sort especially in a 'serious' novel 'in cold blood' can not tie things up in a nice tidy manner and still remain faithful to the facts the novel format allows an author to 'show' or 'tell' you why things happened the way they did in real life things aren't that simple life isn't black and white even in the case of grizzly murders the book is confusing because life is confusing Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Extreme Programming Propaganda In Cold Blood Philosophical Investigations Free will Social psychology Objectivist philosophy Philosophical skepticism Debugging Universal pragmatics Simone Weil Deconstruction English grammar Ontological argument Scenes from a Memory Jacob Neusner David Hume Eucharist The Brothers Karamazov Yoga Sutras of Patanjali C programming language Social rule Economics Scientology beliefs and practices House of Leaves Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ethics Object-oriented programming Supply and demand Book of Mormon Phaedo Plame affair Slavoj __i__ek Summa Theologiae Sexual orientation Humphrey Bogart I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Law of value The nature of God in Western theology Microeconomics Meaning of life C.
