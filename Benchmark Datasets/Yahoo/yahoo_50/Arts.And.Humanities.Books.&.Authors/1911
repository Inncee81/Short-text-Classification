why are muggle borns scared to say voldemort's name i'm reading the harry potter series and i was wondering why do muggle borns freak out when people say voldemort's name they didn't grow up with the fear they just learned about it like harry i know that it isn't only muggle borns but i'm asking about muggle borns because they were born in a different situation thanks for the answers but it seems a little weak to me their good books though shurgs i think because some people think that if they totally ignore him that nothing will happen and after a life of ignoring him when someone says his name they get kind of freaked out just a thought Blood purity (Harry Potter) Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Magic (Harry Potter) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Horace Slughorn Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Severus Snape Ginny Weasley Dursley family Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Hogwarts Magical objects in Harry Potter Death Eater Albus Dumbledore Peter Pettigrew Draco Malfoy Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) R.A.B.
