is bonnie wright not pretty enough to play ginny weasley there's been a bit of discussion on the net i've read and people keep saying that bonnie wright who plays ginny in harry potter is not pretty enough to play her as ginny is depicted in the book as 'beautiful' people have said she is more 'cute' than beautiful and isn't even pretty and that hermione is way prettier i have also heard that she doesn't look old enough but go to http media movieweb com galleries posters poster jpg and i think she looks old enough shes the redhead girl on the left yes i do agree in the th movie she doesn't look that old but still and yes she is more cute than beautiful but seriously she is really pretty i think she looks prettier than hermione why do people keep saying bonnie isn't suitable to play ginny especially since she kisses harry in the next movie coz personally i think bonnie is gorgeous yea i know this is the book section but all the harry potter q's seem to be in this section so yea when bonny wright first appeared in the harry potter movies she isn't that good looking however when i saw the order of the phoenix i noticed a change in her she is growing up as a beautiful woman her beauty is different from emma watson and i think bonny is the right choice to play ginny all along since she can be pretty and tough at the same time Ginny Weasley Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Luna Lovegood Weasley family Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Emma Watson Cho Chang Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Neville Longbottom Tom Riddle's diary Death Eater Minor characters associated with Quidditch Rupert Grint Harry Potter Hogwarts Fawkes Nymphadora Tonks Viktor Krum Percy Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Minor Hufflepuffs Fleur Delacour Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter fandom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Hogwarts subjects Diagon Alley Lucius Malfoy Arthur Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Battle of Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Mary Sue Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter J.
