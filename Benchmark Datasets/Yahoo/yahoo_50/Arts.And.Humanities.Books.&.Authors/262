why do hradcovers come out before paperbacks i could never understand it paperbacks are cheper to mass produce and since they cost less more people could afford them also is there a specific amount of time before the hardcover makes it to paperback there are some good reasons and some silly reasons that hardcovers usually come out first as a silly reason it's traditional it doesn't always happen either there are quite a few genre publishers that go straight to hardback particularly in romance and similar genres there are some good reasons though hardback books are generally printed on finer paper with beautiful dust jackets nice artwork and are put together in a very durable way this makes them ideal for collectors who want to buy a first edition hardback and keep it for personal reasons or later resale this is very common with authors in high demand like j k rowling and stephen king for example since the hardbacks are also expensive and collectors will pay it it is usually worth it to the publisher they make a great deal of money on the initial first edition hardback run on a known author and that money can fund later paperbacks and reprints to make even more money if a publisher has a new author that they believe has potential to be a big seller especially with literary fiction they will still print hardbacks but in smaller numbers and this is a 'test' market if readers and collectors agree and buy the books quickly the publisher knows they have a gem and they'll move to a larger paperback run if readers don't buy that initial test book well at all and or it gets poor reviews it won't even make it to paperback you'll find it on bargain shelves and off stores as to the time between hardback and paperback that would vary a great deal publishers and authors of course want to make as much as they can so if hardbacks keep selling well it can take quite awhile to move the the lesser quality and cheaper paperback versions if the hardback sells only moderately well it may go to paperback quickly to get more everyday genre readers buying it hope that helps check out a couple of my blogs for more book stuff if you like http lynnfo blogspot com http onlybooks blogspot com Publishing Crime fiction Science fiction Microeconomics Bookbinding Book Comic book Novel Supply and demand Alan Moore Poker jargon Trade paperback (comics) Illegal drug trade Bestseller The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Pharmaceutical company Autograph Communist Party USA The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as international phenomenon Price discrimination Doctor Who spin-offs Inflation Manga Monster Manual Romance novel Money Open access Hyperinflation Book collecting FairTax Harry Potter Aubrey-Maturin series Annuity Stardust (book) United States dollar Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Mutual fund Contract Fawcett Publications Digital photography Sailor Moon Vanity press The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Gross domestic product Capitalism Tax Vladimir Nabokov American individualist anarchism Graphic novel Neil Gaiman American comic book Literature Robert A.
