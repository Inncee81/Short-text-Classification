moral ambiguity in his dark materials from amazon com reviewing his dark materials the first book in this series was very well written and engaging however the second book seemed to muddle the difference between good vs evil and left me feeling disappointed and uneasy isn't this a very positive thing isn't it a mark of a good writer that the characters aren't one sided goodies and baddies what do you think i agree that one sided characters aren't as interesting as multi dimensional ones who can identify with a character who always does the right thing and never makes any mistakes in this particular book i identify with the characters' struggles and motivations it's also important to note that the greatest damage the characters do is something they're unaware of using the knife i think this is a great thing in a novel for young people we can't know all the consequences of our actions and having respect for that is important i really love the whole series and am looking forward to the first film in december i'll be very disappointed if the film isn't good i don't expect it to fully cover the book because books are books and movies are movies but i'm hoping for a good movie Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Nicomachean Ethics Slayers Human nature Goodness and value theory Poker jargon Utilitarianism Social rule Yes, Minister Julia Stiles Evil Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Tenchi Muyo!
