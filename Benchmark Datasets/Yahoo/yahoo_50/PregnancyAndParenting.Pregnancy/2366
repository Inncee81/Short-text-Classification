still birth my friend recently lost her baby at months pregnant she had no movement one day and went to the hospital where she was told there was no heartbeat she was then sent home and told to come back in days and then they would remove the baby i think that this was terrible that she was sent home and made to carry a dead baby for days its traumatic enough finding out that your baby has died i know that it is a very sensitive issue but i was wondering if anybody else has ever experienced or knows someone who has experienced this kind of treatment from a hospital i think that the way she was treated was a disgrace and should make a formal complaint it is a very hard thing to go through i had a freind that this happened to she was months pregnant and it was a boy and because she was so far a long she was made to give birth naturally she named him harry and had a little funeral for him its very hard and im sure your friend will get through this you sound like a good friend so when she needs to talk then let her and just listen try to support her as much as you can i can tell you my friend got through it and came out the other side its a long road but she needs to grieve my freind had a baby girl after and everything went fine so a happy ending to a sad story i'm so sorry for the loss EastEnders Kodocha Childbirth Jam (TV series) Miscarriage Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Pregnancy Friends Urinary incontinence Cliff Richard The Beatles discography Days of our Lives Abortion debate Scenes from a Memory Funeral Sex and the City Marilyn Monroe Boston Public Hearing impairment Bringing It All Back Home John Sheridan (Babylon 5) AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story Leo Wyatt Knots Landing Charmed History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Neighbours Laguna Loire Grunge music Jean Grey Love and Theft Alois Hitler Cindy Sheehan Infantilism Sharon Tate Theory of conduct Beatles for Sale Sant Thakar Singh Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Earth Girl Arjuna Abortion Paranoia Agent Characters of Lost Cytomegalovirus Incarnations of Immortality Coeliac disease Kingdom Hospital Post-traumatic stress disorder Clinical depression Phoebe Halliwell Elephant About a Boy Laci Peterson Taxi Driver Alf Stewart Past characters (Neighbours) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sugo Dead Like Me Sin City Origin belief Psoriasis One Tree Hill (TV series) Vernon Schillinger Circumcision Hollyoaks Blood purity (Harry Potter) Folic acid Stomach cancer Kender Melanie Wilkes 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Le Malade imaginaire One Life to Live History of intersex surgery Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dragonfly (film) Trainspotting (novel) Mojave people Peter Pan Time Out of Mind Random Harvest Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Grandview, U.S.A.
