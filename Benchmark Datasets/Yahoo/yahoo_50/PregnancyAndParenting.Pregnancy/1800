baby shower for i'm currentally weeks days pregnant with number and i'm not wanting to have a baby shower but my husband wants me to our situation is his job travels and we use our own car and pack everything that we need into it i'm affrad that people will give me things that i will not be able to carry and use expecially since we are going to hawaii for months at the end of this month and the baby will be born there i was thinking that if people wanted to give me anything to just ask for a gift certificate and i could buy the things that i know we would be able to carry with us do you think that its rude just to ask for money or is it best just to go with the shower and return thing usually people only have baby shower for their first baby the only time i've ever heard of someone having more than shower is if there's a very long stretch between babies like years meaning that the mother would probably need all new baby things if it's normal with your family friends to have a second shower i wouldn't just ask straight up for money only offer it as a suggestion if asked you could register though and on the baby shower invites say where you are registered that way you may get more of the things that you want otherwise just take what you get and return if necessary most people like to pick out a gift instead of just giving over the cash and it's also a little presumptuous to ask for cash as if they have no choice but to give you something good luck Social rule Wheel of Fortune EastEnders Ayyavazhi mythology Neighbours Pregnancy $ale of the Century Humphrey Bogart Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Winning Streak Elvis and Me Charmed Married... with Children Friends Laci Peterson The Family from One End Street Ocean's Twelve Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Characters in the Smurfs Alois Hitler Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Phoebe Buffay's songs Characters of Lost The Catcher in the Rye John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Eddie Guerrero Psycho Marilyn Monroe Tupac Shakur Jam (TV series) Fancy Crane Breastfeeding The Joker's Wild Life insurance Cruising (maritime) Satchel Paige Warren Buffett Let's Make a Deal The Amazing Race Jiddu Krishnamurti We Belong Together Big Brother UK series 6 Jon Secada Mutual fund What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
