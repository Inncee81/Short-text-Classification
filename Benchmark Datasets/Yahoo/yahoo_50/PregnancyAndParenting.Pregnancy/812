doctors and hospital selection i recently found out that my ob's practice only delivers at one hospital this hospital is just under a half hour from my home although that is not very far there is a branch of the exact same hospital less than five minutes from my home this is where i assumed i would be having my baby and where i want to have my baby my sister who is also pregnant and sees the same doctor said they don't make exceptions and i should find another doctor if i really want to deliver at the hospital by my home i have been seeing this doctor for many years now and don't want to switch i am only in my third month but now i am frustrated about this situation and want to make a decision have it settled soon what can i say to my doctor about my preference of another hospital what happens if want to stay with my doctor but still choose a different hospital can i do that would a random on call doctor at the other hospital deliver my child i would say pick the ob over the actual hospital you have to assume other than the minute commute the hospitals are probably pretty similar if there is something that one has that you would love to see at the other one ie large tubs for births neo natal unit etc that ask your ob she will tell you what they do in that situation she also may be able to recommend someone you will also like but i have to say liking your doc is just as important as anything else you have to be able to trust his her opinion in a crisis time and at am you need to feel comfortable so that you can always talk freely about your symptoms so talk to your ob now and see what she says but hurry after weeks it will be too late to switch practices good luck Pregnancy Breastfeeding Childbirth Stomach cancer Friends Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Physician Kodocha Theory of conduct Social rule Days of our Lives Neighbours Pitaten Mental Health Act 1983 Melanie Wilkes The Empty Child Partial-birth abortion Nurse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Malaria Hikikomori History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Breech birth Humphrey Bogart Random Harvest Medicine Miscarriage Infantilism Liza of Lambeth Milton H.
