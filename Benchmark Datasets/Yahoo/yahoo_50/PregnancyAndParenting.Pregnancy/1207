proactive face wash during pregnancy hi there i'm wondering if anyone knows if it is safe okay to use proactive face wash during pregnancy i am currently not pregnant but wondered if it is safe if i would get pregnant it's perfectly safe and it's actually recommended to wash your face more often with a good oil free cleanser like proactive because you're more prone to break outs when you're pregnant proactive contains basically gentle surface exfoliants and benzoyl peroxide which will smooth the skin and penetrate the pores nothing will enter the bloodstream and get to the placenta even if it did it would be in amounts so miniscule that there would be no possible risk to the fetus soap and water alone tend to dry out your skin and my ob said that having skin too dry will actually make you prone to breaking out if you just can't get past the fact that there are tiny amounts of alcohol in the proactive renewing cleanser you can switch to their revitalizing toner while you're pregnant it's alcohol free removes dead skin unplugs pores helps remove excess oil and balances your skin tone Acne Cleanser Psoriasis Soap Tattoo Childbirth Pregnancy Coffee Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Organic peroxide Skin Dandruff Fecal incontinence Wood 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Sulfuric acid Abortion Rosacea Birth control Eczema Omega-3 fatty acid Leather Breastfeeding Tooth enamel Paracetamol Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Tobacco smoking Ectopic pregnancy Dry cleaning Pneumonia Oral sex Tocopherol Body piercing Swimming Birth weight Glycerin Washing machine Intact dilation and extraction Nuclear fallout Alcohol fuel Hydrogen peroxide First aid Vinegar Folic acid Placenta E85 Abortion debate Spina bifida Aspartame Hard water Diving suit Mesothelioma Cytomegalovirus Oscilloscope Olive oil Weight training Scarification Weathering Benzoyl peroxide Menstrual cycle Brewery Manicure Shaving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat EastEnders Progesterone Wound Stroke Baseball Traumatic brain injury Knife Guinea pig Energy development Dishwasher Amniotic sac Dialysis Scientology beliefs and practices Safe sex Laundry detergent Cancer Smegma Heinkel He 100 Malaria Nutrition Scabies Leaf Renewable energy Hearing impairment Electrophysiology Anal sex Alcoholics Anonymous Hemp
