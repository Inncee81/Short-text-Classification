could i be pregnant im having symptoms of being pregnant but i'm a little confused i want to take a home test but i haven't had aperiod for a while my doctor said it was because of my birth control but said to still be cautious because birth control isn't always effective etc so could i still be pregnant w o a period and if so how do i know when to take the test since i don't have a period well if you already have symptoms then take the test usually by the time the symptoms show up implantation have taken place and you're producing hcg the pregnancy hormone so it should show up on a home pregnancy test use the first wee in the morning to do the test because the hormone will be more concentrated if the test comes back negative and you're still convinced you're pregnant then wait a week and do it again sometimes there's not enough hormones in the urine to show up on a test false negatives are fairly common but false positives are not and yes you can get pregnant even if your period doesn't show up your doctor is absolutely right no birth control is Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Prostate cancer Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Human chorionic gonadotropin Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Birth control Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Prenatal diagnosis In vitro fertilisation HIV test Coeliac disease Cytomegalovirus Abortion Gonorrhoea Insulin Guinea pig Drug test Ben Johnson (athlete) Prolactinoma Progesterone Turner syndrome Morning sickness Hypoglycemia Friends Maprotiline Diabetes insipidus Cancer Haloperidol Ovarian cancer Spina bifida Hyperprolactinaemia Ectopic pregnancy Breast cancer Clinical depression Thalidomide Health issues and the effects of cannabis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Doxepin Postpartum depression Lupus erythematosus Childbirth Psoriasis Philosophical skepticism Folic acid Hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Thyroid Cyanide Acne Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinalysis Neighbours Amiodarone Clomipramine Intrauterine device Breastfeeding Caffeine Ovarian cyst Paroxetine Abortion debate Breech birth EastEnders Tocopherol Hyperglycemia Infertility Cryptorchidism Placebo effect Anemia Hypospadias Sleep The Gap Cycle Pneumonia Premature birth Anabolic steroid Ovary Isotretinoin Puberty Cephalic disorder Knots Landing Group A streptococcal infection Endocrine system Twin Tobacco smoking I Married Marge Ebola Hyperthyroidism Sulfasalazine Post Polio syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Transsexuality
