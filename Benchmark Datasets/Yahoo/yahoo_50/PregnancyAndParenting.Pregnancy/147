personal qustion ok well like months ago i had an abortion n my bf was really crushed bout it n he wont let me forget bout it n ive been thinking dat i shuld jst get pg againg jst too make him happy wat do u think i mean i had da ab a good reason im only i just graduated high school n i wnt go college n i thought dat a baby wuld ruin my plans so wat do u think shuld i get pg i'll be straight with you if you get pregnant again it doesn't mean he will forgive you for an abortion if you are having a baby just to make him happy you are missing why he was upset not that you were pregnant but that you didn't give him a say you have to look from his viewpoint as well who's to say you wouldn't get an abortion again i'm not saying you would but without him having a say in the matter you could get an abortion again and it wont replace what was lost if you are doing it just for him you may not be happy wait until you are ready for the responsibility and be able to care for the child on your own don't think having a baby will solve your problem and that it is deeper than just his wanting a baby you would have to put yourself in his shoes yes it is your body but why should he get attached if he can't be sure he can have a say with his baby i realize you have your reasons for having an abortion but it does not mean it will solve all your problems the only way for him to regain your trust is for time and knowing that you wont do it again also no offense but wait until you are older having a baby because he wants one isn't the smartest thing to do get an education first and then when you are ready have a baby mommy of three week old baby girl on thurs Abortion debate EastEnders Friends Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Pitaten Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct The Emancipation of Mimi Pregnancy The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomic Kitten Alois Hitler Marilyn Monroe Boston Public Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed Miscarriage Social rule Days of our Lives God Emperor of Dune Abortion Something Positive Too Short a Season (TNG episode) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Philosophical skepticism Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Drawn Together Sharon Tate The Ashlee Simpson Show Kyle Broflovski Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Singlish Theodicy Street-Legal Scenes from a Memory Hall & Oates John Howard Yoder Miss Saigon Current teachings of Prem Rawat About a Boy Abortion in the United States The McGuire Sisters Ocean's Twelve Jean Grey The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 1957 World Series Pim Fortuyn Characters of Lost Cliff Richard U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Peter Singer Apollo 8 The Death Gate Cycle Phoebe Halliwell Frankie Laine The Star Wars Holiday Special The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) She Loves You AFI 100 Years series Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Amber Spyglass Negima Pok__mon Live!
