tips for safe healthy pregnancy i don't smoke or drink and i try to stay away from secondhand smoke though i'm not always completely successful i already take prenatal vitamins what should i eat and not eat are there any good kinds of exercises to do what should i avoid other than paint fumes and kitty litter anything else i should know please provide links to sources for anything and everything the person that answers all questions and provides links will be chosen as best answer first of all it sounds like you are on the right track for having a healthy pregnancy i have spoken to my doctor and my dietition and you want to make sure you eat foods that have folic acid in them this is particularly important during the beginning of your pregnancy because it helps the baby properly develop foods that contain folic acid are your dark green leafy vegetables such as spinich and broccoli and certain cereals such as grape nuts and malt o meal there are also tablets you can buy in the vitamen section of your store labeled folic acid but chances are you won't need to buy a suppliment because they are already in your prenatal vitaments you also want to make sure you stay very hydrated drink plenty of water water is the best thing you can drink it's good to drink plenty of milk as well my dietician told me it's best to drink plenty of water drink more water than juice but juice is better than soda you may have heard that later in your pregnancy constipation can become an issue my dietician said that even halfway through my pregnancy i should be eating things high in fiber fiber keeps you regular but you need extra fiber when you are pregnant things she recommended to me eating cereal wheat bread wheat noodles fruits and veggies she also said that getting enough iron is important again most prenatals have iron included but if you are like me you are low in iron eat unprocessed meats such as ground turkey ground beef and chicken breasts processed meats are things like hot dogs and lunch meat also eating vegetables especially your dark leafy greens again spinich broccoli ect and fruits it's hard to get a high concentration of iron out of any one food but you can get small traces by eating all those different things fruits veggies unprocessed meats as for things not to eat stay away from uncooked eggs and eating too much fish fish is okay in moderation but you have to be wary of mercury in the fish two fish that are good to completely avoid because of their mercury content are swordfish and albocore tuna as for exercises the doctor recommended plenty of walking the first trimester you can jog but after that simply walking do not strain yourself walking helps strengthen the muscles that help labor and delivery go easier and decrease your changes of tearing also doing kegels helps strengthen the muscles in your lower abdomen which helps prevent against unexpected leaks when you laugh cough ect and can help increase the strength of your orgasms as an added bonus kegels aren't necessary but they just make the later part of pregnancy a touch easier avoid any heavy lifting do not strain yourself also stay away from chemicals such as cleaning supplies bleach amoania ect the fumes are bad for you just like paint fumes are unfortunately i can't give you any links because the advice i am giving you was given to me orally by both my doctor and my registered dietician the only link i can get you is for wic which is a program that helps you along with your pregnancy both with advice and by giving you montly checks for certain foods that are good
