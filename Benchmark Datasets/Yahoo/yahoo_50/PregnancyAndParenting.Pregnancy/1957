what now this is really getting old so here it goes again i'm almost weeks pregnant and my fiance ex is acting like a moron again she has recently told by the police that she was no longer allowed to contact us her mother too because they were harrassing us and leaving nasty messages anyways he has asked several times for a dna test and she just does not get it she keeps asking why he wants the test and doing nothing about it we have called around and explained the situation to several people including a lawyer and they all keep telling us to wait so that is what we are doing well she tried to contact us again over the internet myspace and when she was denied she wrote some dumb crap about us on her profile next week there is this picnic for my fiance's work and she will be there probably her dad works there too i plan to ignore her but what should we do if her or her family tries to talk to us call the police they told her she would be arrested i really feel bad for the baby it is not her fault that all this is going on and i wish it never would have gone this far i just wish that she would act like an adult and i just don't know how to deal with her if she tries to talk to me should i just say you know your not suppose to contact us or what and no i was not the other woman or anything like that i don't know why some people think that they were not together for very long yes the baby is already here she is almost months old he did not sign the birth certficate or go to the hospital we have only seen her once when she was almost weeks old it was only for about mins her mother acted like everything was fine and they would be getting the dna test soon and since then everything has been a nightmare i'm guessing she is either pregnant too or already had a baby that is supposdesly your fiance's you can make her take a paternity test just get a court order all he has to do is say he doesn't think he is the father of the baby that would get one problem out of the way ingore the dumb stuff on myspace as for the picnic if she tries to speak to you remind her and or her family that there is a restraining order and if they don't leave you alone you will call the police if they continue call the police EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Pregnancy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ocean's Twelve Divorce Avenue Q Fathers' rights movement in the UK Sharon Tate Neighbours Fathers' rights Breastfeeding Porgy and Bess Father Pitaten Sin City Laci Peterson Kyle Broflovski Obstetrics Cindy Sheehan Richard Chase Mumia Abu-Jamal Tupac Shakur The Inside Abortion debate Prenatal diagnosis Phoebe Buffay's songs Babe Carey Beetle in an Anthill Fred Phelps The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Plame affair About a Boy Shit Cytomegalovirus The Lovely Bones Survivor (novel) Ranma __ characters Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Peter Griffin Knots Landing Schapelle Corby Married... with Children U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Sydney Bristow Katelyn Faber Kodocha Theodicy Baby Blues Vernon Schillinger Futurama (TV series - season 5) David Blunkett Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Genealogical DNA test Jam (TV series) Alois Hitler K' Fancy Crane Plame affair timeline What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
