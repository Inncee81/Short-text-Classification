pregnant sneezing hey guys just a quick question i searched this before i asked every time i sneeze i get a pain in my lower abdomin i am only about six weeks though so i was just wondering if this is normal to feel so early or if this is something to worry about i have lost babies already so every little feeling is like hmmm what's going on has anyone ever felt this so early is it normal yes it's normal i've had it from the very beginning too and it used to freak me out no end i had three miscarriages and i know exactly the kind of fear you talk about i'm weeks pregnant now and have kinda learned to grab that part of my tummy every time i sneeze as it still hurts even worse now lol it does kind of help if you hold on to those muscles you'd be surprised what kind of pounding it takes every time you have a good sneeze and right now those muscles are already taking strain because your uterus is growing muscle pain is very normal straight through pregnancy and i know every twinge will send you into a panic as it did me congrats and stop worrying if you can i know it's not easy stress isn't good for baby Pregnancy Miscarriage Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Futurama (TV series - season 5) Breastfeeding Abortion Childbirth Milton H.
