what are some good coping mechinisms for being so parinoid during pregnancy it's those early weeks and i haven't gotten past the month 'safety marker' yet i'm very nervous as this baby is really wanted by myself and my fiance i had a miscarriage recently and can't stop trying to associate any slight twinge to what i felt then i am weeks i already have general anxiety disorder and have had panic attacks i haven't had one in a while because im learning to control them but i am becoming parinoid about my current situation and i want to avoid a panic attack does anyone know how i feel or can relate if so what are some ways you sort of talked yourself out and relaxed thanks so much and i'm not a complete crazy i just had a difficult childhood but i've dealt with that and have moved on any advise would be greatly appreciated i know exactly how you feel poor thing i have had an anxiety disorder which you can't take anything for because you're prego and i was a nervous wreck my entire pregnancy even after i made it past the danger zone i was paranoid that i would roll over on my stomach in my sleep and crush the baby i was afraid that i would get in a car accident and the force of the seat belt would hurt the baby i would lie in bed at night and worry that someone was going to do a drive by and accidentally shoot me in my sleep and i would die and they wouldn't be able to get the baby out in time and i live in a very nice neighborhood i could go on and on these are the two things that made me feel better when i would get overwhelmed with mad thoughts i would calm myself by rationally thinking about how incredibly unlikely it is that would ever happen to me and then accept that i was being a little nuts and had no control over it and then laugh on a off at myself for being so silly second when i went in get my ultrasound and saw that there was nothing wrong with my baby it cut my worrying in half some good news after the first week or two of being paranoid that my son was going to die in his sleep my anxiety almost completely disappeared i'm not just talking about the anxiety surrounding my son i mean in general my midwife said that for whatever reason this is actually fairly common so that's something to look forward to best of luck and remember it is incredibly unlikely anything will happen to you Anxiety EastEnders Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Charles Darwin's illness Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Knots Landing Theory of conduct Panic attack Social rule Stuttering Friends Insomnia Sharon Tate Miscarriage Anorexia nervosa Pregnancy Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion Jon Secada Diazepam Hypnosis Daredevil Obstetrics Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga Transsexuality Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Post-traumatic stress disorder Defence mechanism Ranma __ characters Charmed The Death Gate Cycle Clomipramine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Daylight saving time Bipolar disorder Psychoanalysis God Emperor of Dune Sleeping Murder Kodocha Traumatic brain injury Philosophical skepticism One Life to Live Pitaten Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Negima Marilyn Monroe Cliff Richard Autism Manual transmission Dog Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DSM-IV Codes Kim Possible Melanie Wilkes One Tree Hill (TV series) Galaxy Angel 24 Hours of Le Mans Meditation Psychosis Schizophrenia Good Times Agoraphobia I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Child sexuality Traumatic incident reduction The Contender (television series) Procrastination The Amazing Race Zhao Yun Sleep The Amber Spyglass Stroke Recurring South Park characters Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Infantilism The Smoking Room Abortion debate Singlish Grandview, U.S.A.
