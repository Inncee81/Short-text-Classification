cervical cerclage i had my first daughter when i was and learned at weeks that i needed to have an emergency cerclage put in because have a really small thin cervix by nature and it was starting to open a tiny bit this means that i'll need to have a cerclage every time i have a child while i had my first one in i had to be on bedrest for weeks which was an inconvenience but could be accomodated to i'm worried however about the next time i have one because i'm a mom now and there's no way i'd be able to stay laying down for weeks is there anyone who's been through this if so how did you deal with being on bedrest with a child with my second child i was put on bedrest for the last months or so and i had a year old i just did as little as possible i limited how much i was on my feet and i didn't lift anything but it is impossible to lay in bed when you have a child so just do what you can and rest when ever you can Childbirth Miscarriage Fertility awareness Cervix Melanie Wilkes Birth control Premature birth Social rule Gliding Apollo 8 Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Newcastle United F.C.
