uterus question i have one of those uteruses where it is leaning back i forget the actual name they call it anyway could that be a bad thing if it doesn't get into the normal position i heard it does a lot but does it go leaning back afterwards and does that mean more pain more peeing more contractions more whatever or anything else the nurse who gave me my first ultrasound said she had it and it never came forward for any pregnancy and so she didn't poke out as much as she would've thats could a be a positive thing i have a retroverted or backwards tilting uterus as did my mom both my aunts and my grandmother i say did because they've all had hysterectomies now not because of the position though my doctor said that the weight of the baby will cause the uterus to fall forward into a regular position once baby and uterus get bigger and heavier just due to gravity and that has been true for me when i am standing up but when i'm sitting down or lying on my back it tends to fall backwards onto my spine more than a normal uterus probably would so until i got really far along like past weeks my stomach would go mushy whenever i sat down and when i lay down the only hard part was right where baby was which was neat because i could always find his little body from the time i was about weeks on the weight on my spine is uncomfortable but good posture and lying on my side rather than my back helped relieve the pressure no the uterus doesn't fall on the bladder more if it's retroverted because the bladder is actually in front of your uterus more so than behind it so i actually don't have frequent trips to the bathroom if i'm sitting or lying but i do when i'm standing and my womb falls forward if that makes sense i can't say as far as labor because i'm still pregnant but my mom had natural childbrith twice in the 's when epidurals were available she just chose not to have them and in her videos of the births all she says is ow once or twice so it must not have been too bad lol good luck Childbirth Pregnancy Professional wrestling holds Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Breech birth Abortion Equine conformation Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) Uterus Professional wrestling throws Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human position Prostate cancer Caesarean section Endometriosis Premature birth Prenatal diagnosis Breastfeeding Intact dilation and extraction Urination Diving Suplex Endometrial cancer Sexual reproduction Skateboarding trick EastEnders Friends Stomach cancer Sexual intercourse Swingout Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling attacks Muscle Abortion debate Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Incarnations of Immortality Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Puberty Intersex surgery Fecal incontinence Intrauterine device Hysterectomy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Shaggy dog story Charmed Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
