is there anything i should know about breastfeeding wks and wondering although im at home all the time should i buy a pump can i take tylenol midol or any pain medicine i want any advice itll help thanks the most important thing you should know is how to get your baby to latch on properly i'm sure there's a lactation specialist at the hospital that can help you out with that and to feed on demand even though you're at home all the time you might want to look into buying a pump so that when the baby is a little older you can go out for a little while and not worry about your baby being fed as with during your pregnancy tylenol is fine for you to take i don't know about midol or anything else but most otcs are ok when you're breastfeeding ask your doctor to be sure make sure you've got a couple soft comfortable nursing bras and plenty of nursing pads you're almost guaranteed to leak from time to time and i'm sure you don't want to walk around in a wet shirt if you end up with sore cracked nipples it would probably be due to the baby not latching on quite right there are creams that will take care of that ask your lactation consultant about which one she recommends but don't give up breastfeeding is the healthiest most natural way to feed your baby it's always ready at a moments notice and it doesn't cost a thing congratulations good luck and god bless Fertility awareness Nipple piercing Brassiere Breast Nipple Infant Breast pump Mastitis Folic acid Urinary incontinence Prolactin Stomach cancer Infant formula Baby bottle Pregnancy Fecal incontinence Medicine Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Mattress Haloperidol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Health insurance Dairy Massage Nursing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Domestic rabbit Obstetrics Medical prescription Carpal tunnel syndrome Nurse Midwifery Upholstery Coffee Nestl__ Abortion Canadian and American health care systems compared Milk Horseshoe Jon Secada Russian joke Publicly funded medicine Thermal power station Psoriasis Knots Landing Intensive care medicine The Amber Spyglass History of corsets Nestl__ boycott Infantilism Social rule Intravenous therapy Abortion debate Jam (TV series) Platypus Cliff Richard Male lactation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Certified Nursing Assistant Theory of conduct Cruising (maritime) Frankie Laine Myocardial infarction Equine conformation Cancer Paracetamol RuneScape quests Pneumonia Premature birth Postpartum depression STS-61 Lactic acid Prolactinoma Masturbation Air conditioning Stroke Le Malade imaginaire Oxytocin Freddy Fender First aid Prescription drug Hillary Rodham Clinton Eastern Orthodox Church Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bart chalkboard gags Co-sleeping M60 machine gun Body piercing Diving Elimination communication Strap-on dildo Characters of Lost Richard Feynman
