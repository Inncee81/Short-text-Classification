took plan b not sure if ovulating please answer somewhat confused last month i had my period on july th till about the th on the th during protected sex the condom ripped hours later i took the plan b pills and experienced no symptoms i've heard that your most fertile around ovulation which is days into your cycle it was only days after having my period so i think that mean's i wasn't ovulating or whatever i don't understand most of it anyways days after taking the pill this past thursday i began to spot bleed barely anything brown pinkish and when i used a tampon thinking it was my period a very small amount of red period blood occasionally showed i stopped spotting on sunday and than sunday night monday morning i had some clear discharge i'm not due for my next period till the th of august but am pretty nervous please don't be mean i did everything i could to protect myself what are my chances of being pregnant i do have a tiny bit of pain in my lower lower abdomen every blue moon maybe it's in my head i'm really just looking to see if the spotting and everything is normal not to so much about ovulating but thankyou what you are experiencing is quite normal it is common to experience period abnormalities after taking plan b plan b is about effective if both doses are taken you can still get pregnant if you take emergency contraception and then have sex again without using another kind of contraception or your birth control fails within the next month you should get a regular period if not then see your doctor for an exam and testing to determine exactly what is going on it's possible that pregnancy did occur of which you should then be tested Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Miscarriage Prostate cancer Obstetrics Puberty Ovarian cancer Childbirth Gonorrhoea Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stomach cancer Tocopherol In vitro fertilisation Condom Psoriasis Cancer Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Sleep Acne Gregorian calendar Hypoglycemia Malaria Depo Provera Cephalic disorder Herpes simplex virus Breastfeeding Premature birth Ectopic pregnancy Diabetes mellitus Migraine Infertility Pelvic inflammatory disease Hypertension Caffeine Medicine Diabetic retinopathy Safe sex Coeliac disease Milton H.
