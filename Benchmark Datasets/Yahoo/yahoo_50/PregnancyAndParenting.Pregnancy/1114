anybody agree with me that it should be illegal to smoke while you are pregnant i think smoking should be outlawed altogether i think it should be a grandfather law for example if they enforce the law on january st then the law would state that anyone born on or before december turned this year can smoke anyone born on or after january st cannot smoke this would slowly lower the number of smokers as they all die of cancer at young ages and with in years we would be a smoke free country i am personally allergic to cigarette smoke and don't appreciate being forced to breathe it in the general public don't get me wrong my grandmother my favorite aunt my uncle and several friends are smokers i love the person i hate the habit Cigarette Smoking ban Cigar Cigarette Smoking Man Arguments for and against drug prohibition The Smoking Room Tobacco advertising Cannabis (drug) One Piece minor characters Causality Cancer Illegal drug trade Tobacco Medical cannabis Smoking pipe Joni Mitchell Health issues and the effects of cannabis Waterworld Neighbours Paradox Jaina Solo Calvin and Hobbes Rosa Parks Theory of conduct Knots Landing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cocaine John Lennon Kurt Cobain Polygamy Family Smoking fetishism Emperor Yuan of Han Tocopherol EastEnders James Bond Spliff Mojave people Legal drinking age Marilyn Monroe Bong Child pornography Friends DNA repair House of Bourbon Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Warez Humphrey Bogart Liam Gallagher Colorectal cancer GNU General Public License Fancy Crane Adolf Hitler Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Separation of church and state Drug abuse Babe Ruth Hikaru no Go Tlingit Snus Abortion Tupac Shakur Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jim Crow law Abortion debate Nero Wedding Crashers Freedom of speech British Doctors Study Camel (cigarette) Jackie Chan Adventures Empress Shangguan Barbecue Jacen Solo Luke Skywalker Age of consent Lucille Ball Epidemiology Legal issues of cannabis Trailer Park Boys Roger Miller Cancer of the larynx Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Douglas Adams Fruits Basket History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Back to the Future timeline Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Anakin Solo Austin Bradford Hill Heartbeat (television) Emperor Cheng of Han Kitchen Uncle Simon (The Twilight Zone)
