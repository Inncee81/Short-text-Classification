how big is big for a baby i am weeks pregnant and my doctor said that my daughter is measuring big which is fine with me i am just thankful she is healthy but my question is if she is going to weigh like to pounds or more what size clothes will she be wearing when i bring her home i have an outfit bought for her but i am afraid it may be too small i wouldnt' worry too much about the clothes not fitting but my son was born lbs oz and when i put the clothes on him the fit but not for long most newborn clothes are made for infants weighing under lbs i think when i had my second child i thought i would be smart and buy months so that i wouldn't have a access of newborn clothes that didnt' fit instead she was lbs and easliy fit into the newborn clothes lol when my son was two weeks old he could fit in months clothes i think it has alot to do with the size of the clothing when you pack for the hospital pack a newborn outfit but also pack maybe a month one just in case and don't waste too much money on newborn diapers buy the size s they are almost the same size and are more equipt to handle baby messes lol Infant Kimberly-Clark Corporation Childbirth Breastfeeding Pregnancy Pound Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Knots Landing Comanche Shaggy dog story EastEnders Elephant Car safety Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Sudden infant death syndrome Cytomegalovirus Baby Blues Neighbours Clothing Sex assignment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Birth weight Urinary incontinence Health insurance Vampire Premature birth Baby transport Abortion debate Jennifer Lopez Super Size Me Heracles Dialysis Hypoglycemia Pneumonia Mary I of Scotland Bicycle lighting Ammunition Eid ul-Fitr Undergarment Punisher Infant baptism Friends Miscarriage Shotgun Menstrual cycle The Sims 2 Characters in the Smurfs Neonatal intensive care unit Gonorrhoea Red Deer Midwifery Toxoplasmosis Cephalic disorder Tocopherol Milk Cat Roy Meadow Heidi Klum Kodocha Congenital hypothyroidism Great White Shark IBM PC compatible Code: Lyoko Melanie Wilkes First Battle of the Atlantic Meat Loaf The Family from One End Street The Apprentice 2 Handloading Elvis and Me Britney Spears Guinea pig Cheese Gary Ackerman Largest organism Kurt Cobain Skinhead Alena Marilyn Monroe Blue Whale Intact dilation and extraction Hat Make money fast Mattress Economy of the United States Obstetrics Andre Agassi Respiratory rate Terri Schiavo Aquemini Stomach cancer Bruce Johnson Moe Berg Circumcision The Skeptical Environmentalist Spanking Parenting
