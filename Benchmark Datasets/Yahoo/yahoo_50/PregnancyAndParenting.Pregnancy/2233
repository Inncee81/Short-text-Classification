can babies throw fits in the womb last night i was laying in bed waiting for my baby to stop jazzercising in my tummy and wondered if maybe she was throwing a fit i know that sounds kinda silly i'm weeks pregnant and i've read just about everything i can get my hands on about pregnancy and babies in the womb but i've yet to find any information on whether or not babies get upset enough in the womb to have a little hissy fit my fiance thinks i'm silly but i just have to know thanks i know they're in there doing walking exercises and practicing coordination but i just want to know if they every get frustrated and throw a little fit that's hilarious julie c i'm hoping to get an d soon i wanna see what she looks like thanks maber i feel like such an idiot after reading your answer i remember reading about babies reacting to flashlights by covering their eyes and maybe trying to cover their ears if the dog barks duh lol so i suppose they do have little upset moments i'm such a typical pregnant chick reading about the babies in the womb doing all of that makes me teary eyed because it's just so damn cute they have been known to react negatively to outside stimuli very loud noises for instance or those incessantly ridiculous headphones you can force your unborn child to listen to mozart with make them kick and thrash and actually open their mouths as if they are screaming and bring their fists up to their ears and jerk around in a not so pleasant fashion however if it's nice and quiet and you're just laying there trying to sleep chances are you have rocked your baby to sleep by moving around during the day and now he is up and ready to play he doesn't have a lot of swim room but he's making the most of all of it he's having fun it's just unfortunately at your expense d Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Social rule Pregnancy Friends EastEnders Jon Secada Futurama (TV series - season 5) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Kodocha Avenue Q The Death Gate Cycle Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart Dog Garfield Breastfeeding Russian joke Knots Landing It's All Gone Pete Tong Tag Care Bears Charmed Rod Stewart Miscarriage Childbirth Kakapo The Shining (film) Aerial (dance move) Sharon Tate Milton H.
