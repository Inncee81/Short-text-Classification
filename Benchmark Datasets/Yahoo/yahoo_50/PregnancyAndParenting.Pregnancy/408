hpv question i recently found out that my pap test came back abnormal and i have a low risk type of hpv just a few cells were abnormal the doctor said that it normally will clear up on its own but my question is should my husband be concerned should he go to the doctor or what should he do they said that the doctor will put a vinegar type solution on my cervix that will turn the cells white and that he will just look at them check it all out but he didnt say anything about what my husband should do please don't listen to the people above who said your husband should go to the doctor he can't be tested for hpv at all if you have the type of hpv that causes genital warts then your husband may eventually get one on his penis at that time he can go get it removed but the virus will never go away in either one of you the symptoms may go away but the virus stays with you forever if you have hpv that causes cervical cancer then he will not ever have any symptoms because he doesn't have a cervix good luck Cervical cancer Human papillomavirus Cancer Prostate cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Colposcopy Herpes simplex virus Stomach cancer AIDS reappraisal Sexually-transmitted infection Circumcision Gonorrhoea Endometrial cancer Colorectal cancer Cytomegalovirus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pap smear Penile cancer Cancer of the larynx Cervix Homeopathy Leukemia Intersex surgery Pneumonia Apoptosis Lung cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Childbirth Oral sex Endometriosis Breast cancer Lupus erythematosus Miscarriage Abortion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medicine Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Cryptorchidism Rabies Gynaecology Psoriasis Obstetrics Infectious mononucleosis Avian influenza Cystic fibrosis Kaposi's sarcoma Hepatitis C Wart Mesothelioma Computer virus Vinegar Folic acid Cirrhosis Cardiac stress test AIDS Extreme Programming Crohn's disease Condom Diabetic retinopathy Duesberg hypothesis Eczema Chronic fatigue syndrome Singlish Chiropractic Stem cell HIV Coeliac disease Autism Strap-on dildo Anorexia nervosa Multiple myeloma Plantar wart History of intersex surgery Testicular cancer Hypoglycemia Breech birth Alzheimer's disease Myelodysplastic syndrome Ebola Sexual reproduction Turner syndrome Huntington's disease Jam (TV series) Antiretroviral drug Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Hyperplasia Metastasis Recumbent bicycle HIV test Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Pasteur Institute Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Sickle-cell disease Gender identity Multiple sclerosis
