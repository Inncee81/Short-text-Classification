moms opinion needed please this is a true story were you the one chosen to decide how much would you give this mother in compensatory damages a mom goes into the hospital to give birth to her baby a csection is required due to babys large size after c section mom needs to be taken to icu and receive units of blood after another exploratory surgery they discover that while the dr was suturing the csection she sutured through a part of moms bowel causing massive bleeding and severe infection mom goes on to need more surgeries and codes times because all the infection got into bloodstream and caused a systemic sepsis which caused a heart infection which progressed into heart failure she was in a medical coma for nearly months and didnt see her newborn until he was over months old she still has the heart failure and is unable to have any more children what would you award her if anything any punishment to the dr million easy a doctor that stitches a woman's bowels during a c section suture has no business dealing with newborns no less adults the poor woman didn't have bad luck she had a bad doctor the problem is whether or not you want to bring suit against the doctor sure the doc has malpractice insurance but do you want to go over every detail over and over so the insurance company can try to catch you in an inconsistency insurance companies don't want to pay out and the effect on the doctor can be a loss of the ability to be insured which can result in the doctor not being able to practice i know the mom doesn't care but the insurance company does mom definitely has a case based on what i have read but it isn't easy to get the money she is owed and sadly no amount of money will bring back the first months of her baby's life and the memories she lost it is a tragic situation and i hope her life can improve so she can be the mother she wants to be for her baby this breaks my heart Childbirth Medical malpractice Cephalic disorder Breastfeeding Insurance Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Pneumonia Infantilism Miscarriage Stomach cancer Spina bifida Fecal incontinence Health insurance Cytomegalovirus Prostate cancer Stroke Female genital cutting Cancer Medicine Abortion Caesarean section Terri Schiavo Group A streptococcal infection Theory of conduct Shock Myocardial infarction Publicly funded medicine Organ transplant EastEnders Unemployment Days of our Lives Blood Anemia Crohn's disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetes mellitus Acute respiratory distress syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intensive care medicine Blood pressure Medicare (Canada) Pitaten Health care in the United States Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Ulcerative colitis Pharmaceutical company Suture Tourniquet Transsexuality Growth hormone treatment Herpes simplex virus Infant Emergency Medical Services Intersex surgery Gonorrhoea Abortion debate Medical analysis of circumcision Obstetrics Non-economic damages caps Bleeding Prenatal diagnosis Malaria Multiple sclerosis Endocarditis Rabies Canadian and American health care systems compared Intact dilation and extraction Duesberg hypothesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Microeconomics Diarrhea Kodocha Insulin Leukemia Medical prescription Chlorpromazine Procrastination Adjustable gastric band Medicare (United States) Psoriasis Endometriosis AIDS Knots Landing Radiation therapy
