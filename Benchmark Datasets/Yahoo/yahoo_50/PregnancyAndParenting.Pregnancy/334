hi i am weeks pregnant and was wondering if it would be safe to do a mile walk in septemember as i have mentioned above i am thinking of doingan mile run in september i will be about weeks roughly the walk is in aid of a cancer hospice in weswton i am years old have had two misscarriages in the last year and my father passed away in febuary he suffered with terminal cancer for the past year and the hospice that looked after him are doing a moonlight walk i would love to take part but not sure how i might feel in myself at that stage of pregnancy and if it is a great idea i do not want to put myself or my baby at risk i did take part in the walk for life in may that was miles and all was okay any advice on this would be great thanks i think walking would be ok but i would suggest that you walk as far as you can but when you get tired stop what you want to do is a wonderful thing but like you said you don't want to put yourself or baby at risk and since you said you've had miscarriages i would be very very careful don't push yourself to finish if you get tired if you don't think you'll be able to quit when you need to then i wouldn't do the walk best of luck to you Marilyn Monroe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miscarriage Breastfeeding Pregnancy Palliative care Neighbours Knots Landing Abortion Friends Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cancer Coeliac disease Humphrey Bogart Obstetrics Prostate cancer Abortion debate Hollyoaks Milton H.
