so scared of being induced im being induced thursday days and im scared to death ive read everything i can get my hands on but i still feel like i just dont know what to expect this is my first child and i am a nervous wreck if you were induced what did you do to calm yourself down or relax what happened right when you got to the hospital thanks anything and everything is appreciated i was induced with my first one he was weeks late after that i had all of my others on my own i must say to go into labor naturally is much better than being induced with induction the meds throw you in to hard labor which is very painful if you don't have an epidural i have never had one even with the induction when you go into labor naturally then your body is sort of prepped through the first stages for the big moment all i can say is to try and stay calm and focous on your breathing and try and keep your abs and everything else below the waits relaxed at all times the more you fight the longer it will take bring some cards or a book to the hospital too sometime induction takes a long time hours for me and only min naturally good luck Childbirth Breastfeeding Hypnosis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Tai Chi Chuan Paracetamol Social rule Lucid dreaming Local anesthesia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Milton H.
