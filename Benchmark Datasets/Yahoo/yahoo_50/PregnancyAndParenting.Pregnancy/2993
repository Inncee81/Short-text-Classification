can i get pregnant if if my boyfriend pulls out cums then puts it back in could i get pregnant i know i should be using protection and usually i do but for what ever reason this past weekend we have been messing around without using any my boyfriend freaked out after the fact saying that he has a feeling that he got me pregnant one minute he says if you are pregnant maybe you should have it and the next he is telling me i might have to have an abortion which i don't think i can do i took the morning after pill yesterday after we had sex all weekend and monday morning i checked my ovulation calendar after he freaked out and it turns out that the whole weekend including yesterday those were my most fertile days we had sex this morning so stupid he didn't cum inside me but he put it back in a few minutes after he came what do u think are the chances that i might be pregnant i've never been pregnant before i've always tried to be careful i don't know why i'm messing up now please don't pass judgment just answer the question as best u can i hate it when other people try to make you feel bad like they have never made shitty decisions to double trouble i take it you've never made any mistakes in your life i do not appreciate your comment this is real life people make mistakes we don't always excercise the best judgment that's what makes us human next time keep your judgment to your damn self to everyone other than double trouble thanks for your comments for the record i've never been in this position before and i've never had an abortion i hope i don't have to have one now thanks again to all the people with good intentions and comments if you took the morning after pill you should be fine however how immature does your boyfriend sound if you get pregnant you should get an abortion i'm not saying he's fully to blame in this but if he's got the balls to say that kind of stuff to you he's not worth your time if you guys don't want a baby wear a condom and or get on birth control it's as simple as that get an abortion if you must but it's not a form a birth control Birth control Fertility awareness Abortion debate Social rule Knots Landing Oral contraceptive Pregnancy EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Emergency contraception Sydney Riot of 1879 Boston Public Ocean's Twelve Hey Jude Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shit Neighbours Futurama (TV series - season 5) Roe v.
