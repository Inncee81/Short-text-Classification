i got my induction date but have a question i finally got my induction date i will be induced when i am weeks i forgot to ask the nurse this question and i will because i know the answer can vary but i thought i would ask you gals and get your experiences i am scheduled to be induced at pm this is my first bith and i know they can last up to three days my dr is giving me hours then doing a c section because i am high risk and this will lessen the complications but anyways i was wondering for those of you who were induced at night was anyone able to stay with you all through the night can more than one stay with you i don't want my mom to miss it this grandchild means the world to her and my dad just passed away so i don't want her to miss it anyways so what did you gals get to do thanks for the kind comments each hospital has different rules i know for me i was allowed to have as many people with me as i wanted but i only wanted my husband there i would call the hospital directly if there is a c section then most likely only one person will be allowed with you if it is not an emergency when i was in recovery days due to c section my husband was not allowed to stay with me because i had a shared room if you were able to get a single room you could have one guest stay with you Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Terri Schiavo Social rule Breastfeeding The Emancipation of Mimi Big Brother UK series 6 Milton H.
