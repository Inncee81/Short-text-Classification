help prego and working i am weeks prego and i am working at a job i have recently begun to hate there have been a number of things that have really turned me off about my job when first hired they told me about the wonderful benefits k dental health ect well my dental doesn t start for an entire year i have been there since april my health benefits premium is a week not including that baby they told me that it would all start after days they are having me do things that aren t in my job description and have yet to give me my raise i was suppose to receive that whenever i have a doctor's appointment or go to class early they seem to have an attitude when i told them about my classes and i give them week notice on all appointments i recently applied at another company and i have an interview the benefits are great the job is sitting down and i will be making more and the hours are lot more flexible the main thing i am worried about being is prego i have a slight belly yet i am still fully capable of working do you think they won t hire me because i am prego i really want this job or i should stay here and ride it out i would say definetly go to the job interview they cannot ask you whether you are pregnant whether you have kids etc and they also cannot use that as an excuse not to hire you that is illegal as i said just go to the job interview and if they offer you the job take it you want to make sure that you are comfortable and not super stressed especially while you are pregnant good luck Social rule Unemployment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insurance EastEnders Wal-Mart Breastfeeding Professor Friends Oral sex Knots Landing Health insurance Kodocha New York Giants Warren Buffett Milton H.
