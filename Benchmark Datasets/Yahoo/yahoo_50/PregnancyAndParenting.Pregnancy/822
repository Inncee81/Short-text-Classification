pregnancy i think i hate my soon to be mother in law i got pregnant unexpectedly and my fiance and i are going to have a small chapel wedding during labor day i am devistated that i got pregnant but wasn't careless just had bad luck moving from the pill to the patch anyways so i got pregnant since my due date is i can't attend college this semester because if i had a premature delivery i would go into labor during classes my parents were devistated i still am but am coping with the issue and plan on being a good mom despite how unprepared we may be it bothers me how excited my fiances mother is she had him as a teenager and was unable to get pregnant again she likes kids and has a overwhelming personality im not happy about this but shes extatic and it makes me sick she holds my stomach and says things about her grandchild to be and it just makes me so angry im worried that when im having a hormonal day around her i might go off on a rampage any advice on this hmmm i'm guessing but maybe because you're conflicted about the baby her overwhelming positiveness about it rubs you to wrong way since your parents aren't too thrilled about you being pregnant it's really actually wonderful that at least she is this may not be apparent to you now but someday you may see it differently maybe try to let her enthusiasm rub off on you a bit because since the baby's already on the way you might as well get really into it as far as her touching you just tell her that you're feeling sensitive due to the hormones and stuff and you don't want to be touched once the baby comes try to be grateful for the extra help she'll surely be offering you may want her to just go away but you really do need all the help you can get with a new baby it's so exhausting good luck and congratulations EastEnders Pregnancy Friends Boston Public Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Charmed Abortion Avenue Q Jam (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Kodocha Series finale Childbirth Futurama (TV series - season 5) Birth control Obstetrics AFI 100 Years series Futurama (TV series - season 2) Neighbours Premature birth Fruits Basket Sharon Tate Days of our Lives Kurt Cobain Baby Blues One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lorelai Gilmore Prenatal diagnosis Anne Boleyn Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Kim Possible Charles Darwin's illness The Contender (television series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fertility awareness Springfield Elementary School One Life to Live Miscarriage The Critic Philosophical skepticism Marriage 2000 Australian Grand Prix Everwood Laura Schlessinger Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kimi Finster Salad Fingers Great Teacher Onizuka Melanie Wilkes Teenage pregnancy History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Marshall Mathers LP My Family (television) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Elvis Presley Dawson's Creek KaBlam!
