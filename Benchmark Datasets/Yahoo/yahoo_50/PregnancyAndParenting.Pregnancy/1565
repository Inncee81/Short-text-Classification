apathetic husband my pregnant friend's husband confessed to me the other night that he doesn't care about his unborn child or even think about it he's attentive to her and does everything he can but really doesn't seem to have any joy at the prospect of being a father is there something wrong with him should i mention this to my friend maybe it wasn't his idea to have a child come into this world and he is scared abou it all sometimes fear comes across as apathy i think you should not tell her right now just wait and see how he reacts in the delivery room and the days and weeks following that great event it could change his mind in favor of his new role if it doesn't then you can think about telling her what he said he probably just needed someone to talk to and he chose you just venting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Melanie Wilkes Pregnancy Pitaten Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Good Times Great Teacher Onizuka Coming of Age (TNG episode) Big Brother UK series 6 Friends Montreal Screwjob Shaggy dog story Everwood Kodocha Sin City Neighbours Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jumpstart 3rd Grade About a Boy Night (book) Kylie Minogue Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Abortion debate Theory of conduct One Life to Live Blonde on Blonde Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye Garfield Ocean's Twelve Beetle in an Anthill Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Liza of Lambeth W.I.T.C.H.
