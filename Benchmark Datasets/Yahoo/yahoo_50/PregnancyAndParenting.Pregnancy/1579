i'm confused regarding how old my embryo is according to my lmp which was june th i'm supposedly weeks pregnant but the gyno at the office after doing an ultrasound sais the embryo does not look like a weeker but a weeker and even the screen gives my due date as march whereas if she enters my lmp the date comes up as march what gives how many weeks am i should i go by my lmp or what the sonogram sais go by the sonogram and what the doctor says they measure certain things and are more experienced at detecting fetal age you go by the st day of your last period but you may have ovulated sooner or later than expected and that would change the day you conceived a bit even if you have a due date of a certain day it still could be a few weeks sooner or a week later so the date is just a guideline not set in stone Obstetrics Miscarriage Abortion In vitro fertilisation Medical ultrasonography Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Prenatal diagnosis Prostate cancer Childbirth Emergency contraception Cancelled Apollo missions Abortion debate Flowering plant Embryo transfer Turner syndrome 24 Hours of Le Mans Abortion in the United States Intersexuality Ectopic pregnancy Fertilisation Birth weight Cephalic disorder Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovulation Infertility Puberty Fetal development Oral contraceptive Chimera (genetics) Anencephaly Seed Breech birth Gregorian calendar Multiple birth Malaria Human cloning Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dominical letter Drug test Prenatal care USS Tunny (SS-282) Blonde on Blonde Shark Partial-birth abortion Le Mans Prototype Ovarian cyst Marsupial Progress of the SARS outbreak Beetle in an Anthill Mandible Spina bifida Intact dilation and extraction Twin Luck USS Ammen (DD-527) Medical prescription Fetus USS Stanly (DD-478) Coptic calendar Pregnancy test Infantilism Diamond simulant Alien (film) Birth control Alcoholism Season USS Wedderburn (DD-684) USS Taussig (DD-746) USS Wallace L.
