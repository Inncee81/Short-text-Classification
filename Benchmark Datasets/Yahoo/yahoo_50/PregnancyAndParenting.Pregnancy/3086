premature labor or braxton hicks or just cramps im weeks pregnant and i've felt this cramping sensation on saturday and once this morning saturday was the worste it felt kind of like menstrual cramps but bad and it burned my back hurt and hips and even my upper thighs it would last about seconds and leave and come back a min later but it only happened times and then stopped are these signs of premature labor or the baby dropping or something my appt is next week and wanted some advice until then this is my nd child but i was induced the first time at weeks with an epideral and didnt really feel any contractions so i dont know what to compare this to is this normal or a sign he might come earlier than planned how bad or frequent should they be for me to call the doctor i dont want to call all the time and seem like a hyprocondriac although i understand my babies health is number one priority anybody else experience this and what was the outcome or what did your doctors say thanks i smoke about half pack a day so i worry about premature labor but first born was wks and lbs my guess would be the baby moving around and making room although pre mature labor is a possibility it's nothing to mess with i would make my way to the er if it happens again your chances of your baby surviving right now are not in the greatest favor if it is pre mature labor your doctor will pump meds to stop labor and hopefully it will work but braxton hicks are very common at this stage too the best thing is get into the er or see if your doctor can see you later on this afternoon good luck and god bless Premature birth Pregnancy Breech birth Breastfeeding Miscarriage Puberty Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obstetrics Prostate cancer Toni Braxton Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cycle Jon Secada Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jennifer Lopez 2000 Australian Grand Prix Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Atomic Kitten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb USS Tunny (SS-282) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fertility awareness Sharon Tate The Contender (television series) Abortion Oh My Goddess!
