not feeling well period due next week your thoughts for the last two weeks i've plain just not felt well light headaches almost every day bloated feeling i'm on yaz birth control pill i'm in a sexual relationship the pill is the only method of birthcontrol we use i take it regularly but i'm not very good about taking it every day at the same time and i've missed a pill every now and then yes i realize that means i'm not fully protected so don't gripe at me for that my breasts have seriously grown in the last month they're not tender they're just growing all of a sudden sometimes i'm extremely hungry all the time craving certain foods other times i dont feel like eating at all due to start my period next wednesday i fully realize i could be pregnant and if i dont start next week ill take a test and if im not pregnant ill still go to the dr to find out why i havent been feeling well my question is did any other women feel sick like this in the early weeks of their pg not morning sickness just bad overall oh fyi i've been on yaz for a year and i was on yasmine for years before that so it's not just yaz that's making me feel sick i've never experienced these symptoms before and i've been on it for a year well my breasts grew my mom told me i was pregnant before i told her i was about mos then i also lost weight then too for about mos no real morning sickness just sick at times from certain smells and yes cravings for different than normal things for me well whatever happens i wish you well also the pill does trick your body into thinking it is pregnant that is how it keeps you from getting pregnant so that can also be a side effect growing breasts and feeling not so well over time this should go away if you aren't pregnant if it doesn't after several months see the dr they have many choices i ended up using an iud which was great no side effects or anything to remember but it is only good for a few years if you try taking the pill when you do something else every day like brush your teeth in the morning or evening associate it with some other habit or routine you do all ready this will help make it a habit for you hope this helps Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fasting Obstetrics Prostate cancer Tocopherol Birth control Stomach cancer Kodocha EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Folic acid Acne Morning sickness Social rule Migraine Anorexia nervosa Procrastination Abortion debate Friends Coeliac disease Decompression sickness Fecal incontinence Foodborne illness Breast cancer Alcoholism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
