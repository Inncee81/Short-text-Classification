i am pregnant and don't know how to tell my boss it's my second baby but i just started this job suggestions all these people are right you do not have to tell but my suggestion is to wait until you're about months before it's obvious because you want to bring it up don't wait to take the chance for your boss bring it up angrily then bring it up calmly making eye contact with someting like i really love this job and i feel like im fitting right in and so i just wanted to let you know so it's not a problem i am pregnant but act allconcerned so your boss can tell you're being respectful hopefully a calm respectful approach will convince your boss that you're a keeper lol but if all does not go well keep in mind you do have rights as an employee p s congratulations Friends Knots Landing Sharon Tate G-Man (Half-Life) EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Michael Garibaldi Alex Ferguson Oasis (band) Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct W.
