why are people so shocked by an abortion at weeks i'm begining to think people don't really understand abortion there are many countries who allow abortion right up to the point of birth look you are either for abortion or you're not why put a time limit on it in a pregnant woman's womb is a life a life which at days has its own blood cells which two days later is developing eyes and the day after has an entire nervous system established a life that at days is forming arms and legs at days is developing ears and nose and at days is a miniature person with complete fingers and toes why is that week old life any less valuable than a week life yeah fanatic i kind of thought so thanks though i just don't understand the mentality that it's ok at this point but not ok at this point you get thumbs up from me lovemyangel i'm opposed to it too i understand what you're saying jamie but if that is the mentality should we just let diabetics die how about kidney patients people on oxygen machines they can't survive either without some kind of intervention if they can't survive on their own should we just let them die glutenfreegirl and others you obviously are missing my point and glutenfreegirl i have seen an abortion the point i am making is there a lot of people who think it's okay at weeks but not at weeks i'm trying to say it's wrong at any stage all the people condemning me did you actually read the whole question geeze i am completely with you i personally don't see the difference either its a person however developed thats like comparing a year old and a teenagers right to live kinda silly Abortion Pregnancy Cephalic disorder Turner syndrome Religion and abortion Partial-birth abortion Childbirth Miscarriage Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Abortion in the United States Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine EastEnders Fetal development Traumatic brain injury Birth control Days of our Lives Triage Diabetes mellitus Psoriasis Stuttering Stem cell Human cloning Theory of conduct Human anatomy Ethics Roe v.
