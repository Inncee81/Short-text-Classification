okay so i know it is just old wives tales but were you sicker with a boy or a female if you have both this is just for fun please well i do have one son so i wouldn't be able to compare between the two but i was pretty sick w him the normal sickness for the first months nausea vomiting couldn't keep anything down except it was all day not just morning or night the first day of month the nausea went away but i would still throw up constantly i had to learn a whole new way of eating had to eat much slower and often like every hrs or less couldn't drink if my stomach was empty had to eat first couldn't eat anything acidic never could keep down grape juice or salad couldn't eat anything greasy and unfortunately i hated chocolate and i'm a chocoholic as i got further along i had to always carry snacks w me or i would faint i fainted twice in the store this was really embarrassing plus the constant heartburn i would eat tums and a gallon of milk a day add that with the still vomiting etc it was hard really interesting how that all panned out i hope if i ever get pregnant again that it's much easier whether it be a boy or a girl Vomiting Breakfast Chocolate Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Morning sickness Coffee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Joke Gastroesophageal reflux disease Foodborne illness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Obstetrics First aid Kurt Cobain Comanche Cuisine of the Philippines Alois Hitler Urinary incontinence YuYu Hakusho Heartburn Omega-3 fatty acid Food Breastfeeding Gastroparesis Jackass: The Movie Mnemonic Meal Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Joe DiMaggio Cheese Kodocha Charles Darwin's illness Milk Ginger Marathon (sport) Conker's Bad Fur Day Hyperemesis gravidarum Fasting Trailer Park Boys Cuisine of Denmark Tooth Kosher foods Tomato Charmed Trainspotting (novel) Kim Possible Dehydration Trichinosis Veganism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ron and Fez Piccolo Junior Saga Coeliac disease Watermelon Hangover Cat Peter Pan Rehydration Jewish cuisine Adjustable gastric band Diarrhea Chemotherapy Sukkot Motion sickness FoxTrot The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rapunzel Migraine Pregnancy Matt Hardy EastEnders Days of our Lives Dim sum Humphrey Bogart Roman eating and drinking Little Britain Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wine Married... with Children Sulfasalazine Cuisine of Austria Milton H.
