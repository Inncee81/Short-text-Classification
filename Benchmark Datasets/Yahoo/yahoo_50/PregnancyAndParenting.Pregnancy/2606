please lots of answers no one seems to be able to answer me i'm weeks pregnant and i know at this point it seems pointless but i could use the encouragement the last month and a half of my pregnancy has been glittered with complications my most recent trip to the hospital involved and i am sorry to gross people out an insane amount of vomiting i can keep nothing down not even crackers they sent me home saying the baby is perfectly healthy and living well off of me but i feel terrible and on top of it all it hinders me from sleeping no one i've had plenty of professional opinions can tell me what is wrong or even suggest something to help has anyone experienced this anyone have any advice regardless what of many doctors and hospitals say i cannot spend another night puking my guts up thanks that is encouraging about the inducing my doctor won't do it at weeks i had a severe bout with anemia and the baby tried to come early he gave me these meds to keep it from happening i have an appointment tomorrow because the running concern now is that the baby is too big for me to have naturally so i will most likely be having a cesarean which he will not do until the th week so maybe next week hopefully oh and i realized i sounded sarcastic didn't mean to it really was encouraging i was vomiting the last week of my pregnancy with my mos old daughter it was horrible and i kept being sent home to saying wait for contractions i drank water and it would come back up crackers everything i did to recover from morning sickness didn't stay down i tried eating dry toast and that stayed down longer than other foods but after a week of doctors telling me i was fine i finally said i can't do this anymore went to the hospital told them even if my baby was getting nutrients i was too weak to give birth they scheduled me for an induction and i was induced at weeks exactly the maternity nurses even felt sorry for me cause when they were giving me the iv they couldn't find my veins because i couldn't even keep down water i would tell my doctor that you are completely uncomfortable and you want an induction or to have the membranes stripped which hurts a lot to start labor because you don't deserve to be puking no doctor can say sorry you have to stay malnurished usually around weeks they do start to take pity on you hope this helps Childbirth Pregnancy Obstetrics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer EastEnders Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Prostate cancer Miscarriage Days of our Lives Urinary incontinence Milton H.
