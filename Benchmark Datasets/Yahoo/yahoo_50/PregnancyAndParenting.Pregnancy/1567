im a little worried im and weeks pregnant im kinda worried about delivering even though its a long time off what is an episotomy does it hurt is there anything i can do avoid it i had an episiotomy with my first child when i was he was stuck in me and they did a little cut at the base of my vagina towards my bottom and he came out very easily because of the pressure of his head crowning i didn't even feel it which is why they do it then when you skin is stretched as tightly as it can go without tearing being cut is better than tearing as it is more easily sewn up you shouldn't need one though unless your baby is really big with my second and third babies i didn't have one at all the midwives i had with my last births made sure i stopped pushing as the babies head was coming out so i wouldn't force it and tear make sure you tell your doctor or midwife when you discuss your birth plan later on in your pregnancy that you want to avoid an episiotomy if possible and also let your doctor know your fears they can put your mind at rest as much as my births hurt i really look forward to them as i know that as soon as it is over i get to meet my new little baby for the first time it's a rush best of luck to you i am sure you will be fine Breech birth Breastfeeding Knots Landing Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Premature birth Midwifery Urinary incontinence Female genital cutting Obstetrics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Melanie Wilkes Intact dilation and extraction Shaggy dog story The Contender (television series) Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Jon Secada Tears for Fears Comanche Ayyavazhi mythology Birth control Abortion Jam (TV series) Sharon Tate Androgen insensitivity syndrome One Tree Hill (TV series) Forceps Caesarean section Muslim ibn Aqeel Condom Equine conformation B-47 Stratojet Adoption Aerial (dance move) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Humphrey Bogart Socrates Fertility awareness Miscarriage The Inside Friends In vitro fertilisation Bernice Summerfield Marilyn Monroe Psoriasis History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Professional wrestling holds Continuation War Prenatal diagnosis Birth weight Characters of Lost Wound Babe Carey The Caves of Androzani Characters in the Smurfs Charmed Infant Operation Market Garden Tupac Shakur Hollyoaks New York Giants Internal ballistics Maya calendar Vegeta 1957 World Series W.I.T.C.H.
