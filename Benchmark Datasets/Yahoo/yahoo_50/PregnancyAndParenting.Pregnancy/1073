i'm very confused is this pregnancy ok i've been off the depo shot for almost months my period has been regular for the past couple of months it comes exactly on the th day my period was supposed to come today and it hasn't but a week ago i went to the doctor and they told me i have an ovarian cyst they did an ultrasound took blood samples and a urinalysis and they said it didn't look like i was pregnant but for the past few days i've been getting fatigued very nauseous after i eat boobs sore everything but no bleeding i've heard stories before where women have gotten blood tests that come bak negative only to find out later that they were pregnant could this be happening to me could i be pregnant because my period should not be late and no i'm not stressing or anything like that i also have slight cramping and i took an early response test last night and it came out negative is it too early to tell serious answers only please yes i have been having unprotected sex i'm not on bc we don't use condoms but he pulls out okay if you say you're period was supposed to come today then it probably is too early for either a blood test or a urine test the earliest a blood test can tell is days after conception and a urine test most of them is days a person usually conceives days before their first missed period because that is when ovulation occurs so if you went to the doctor last week it was too early for them to detect a pregnancy i would wait until a week after this period if it doesn't start and then take another home pregnancy test hope this helps Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Pregnancy test Ovarian cyst Endometriosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Stomach cancer Oral contraceptive Cytomegalovirus Prenatal diagnosis Gonorrhoea Drug test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Puberty Ovarian cancer Endometrial cancer Abortion Ben Johnson (athlete) Psoriasis Infertility Neighbours Coeliac disease AIDS EastEnders In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Stroke Ectopic pregnancy Spina bifida Gynecologic hemorrhage Oral sex Childbirth Anal sex Group A streptococcal infection Human chorionic gonadotropin Herpes simplex virus Guinea pig Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Cancer The Inside Turner syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Traumatic brain injury Acne IgA nephropathy Sami Brady Vitamin C Abortion debate Condom Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Toxoplasmosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Big Brother UK series 6 Sharon Tate Ovulation Prolactinoma The Venture Bros.
