im confused on this so im confused about ovulation this is thanks to wonderful sex ed lol so if someone's ovulation chart ends a day b they might or might not have unprotected sex can they still get pregnant or does it only happen if its before or on ovulation day thanks an ovulation calendar isn't necessarily correct just because it says you're ovulating on day for example you could actually ovulate a few days later so if you have sex before you ovulate the sperm can survive several days and then you ovulate and end up pregnant if you have sex after you think you ovulate you could get pregnant becauseyou might not actually ovulate when you think you do either way if you don't want a child use some sort of birth control pill ring shot iud condom etc visit your local doctor of planned parenthood to find out which one is best for you Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Birth control Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Intrauterine device Puberty Condom In vitro fertilisation Pornographic movie Fertilisation Abortion debate Sexual abstinence Sex education Ovulation Infertility Flowering plant Sexual reproduction Miscarriage Ovary Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual intercourse Planned Parenthood Jam (TV series) Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Moss Oral sex Ovum Pregnancy test Safe sex AIDS Neighbours Polycystic ovary syndrome Friends Endometriosis Psoriasis EastEnders Pelvic inflammatory disease Teenage pregnancy Multiple birth Female reproductive system (human) Ovarian cyst Partial-birth abortion Carpel Survivor (novel) History of sex Marchantiophyta Gonorrhoea Gregory Goodwin Pincus Margaret Sanger Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cliffhanger Gregorian calendar Roe v.
