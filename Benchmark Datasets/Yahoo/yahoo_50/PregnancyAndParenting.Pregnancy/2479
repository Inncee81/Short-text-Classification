i dont know what i should do ok well my last period was june i havent had a period in july well i spotted a couple of time in july i never got my period i have been sexually active so i thought i could be pregnant i took a home pregnancy test and it came back negative it has been almost a week since i took it and i dont know if i should take another home test or just go to the doctor what should i do i'm not on birth control i dont believe in it i would definitly make a doctor's appointment and maybe in the mean time take a cheap home pregnancy test that way even if the test comes back negative you can still try to find out what's stopping your period and also have a more inclusive blood test and know for sure for sure whether you are pregnant or not i hope this helps and you get the answer you are hoping for Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy test Prostate cancer Cytomegalovirus Obstetrics Miscarriage Endometriosis Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Friends Abortion debate Psoriasis Gonorrhoea Teenage pregnancy Abortion Turner syndrome Roe v.
