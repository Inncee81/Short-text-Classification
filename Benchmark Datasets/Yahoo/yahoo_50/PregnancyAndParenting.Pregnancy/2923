experienced mothers pls could you tell me i want to know those signs one would have if a baby is about comng to life and what one should do even in the labour room you may first feel low back or abdominal pain and or pressure this is called labor the uterus is contracting when this happens the uterus is pushing the baby down the birth canal the contractions last about a minute to a minute and a half you should breathe calmly and slowly taking deep breaths through your nose and blowing them out of your mouth as if through a straw until the contraction subsides when contractions are about minutes apart it is time to head to the hospital time them from when the first one is over to the start of the next one your water anmiotic fluid surrounding the baby may break either before or after labor begins it may either gush out or trickle when this happens you should head for the hosptial whether or not your contractions are minutes apart at the hospital you may receive an iv needle in a vein with a glucose solution in case medications need to be given to you through your vein you may have a fetal monitor placed around your abdomen to monitor the baby's heart a blood pressure cuff may be placed on your arm to monitor that you will be asked not to eat or drink but you will be given ice chips for thirst you should walk around if permitted that will help labor periodically the doctor will examine you to see how much your cervix the neck of the womb has opened from the contractions when you reach centimeters you will be taken to the delivery room in the labor room listen to the doctor's instructions he will alternately tell you to push bear down as if having a bowel movement and to stop pushing although the urge may be great to continue you will be propped up to push and laid back between contractions continue breathing normally between contractions this is the fastest part of birthing within a few minutes your beautiful baby will be born congratulations don't be afraid remember your body was made for this it may be painful but you will be in good hands stay calm breathing is important for you and the baby oxygen is needed if you are extremely uncomfortable medication can be administered in a variety of ways i do caution you against an epidural needle inserted into the spine to administer medication as this procedure numbs you from the waist down and slows labor making contractions less productive and since you can't feel anything pushing is often ineffective too most epidural births end in cecerean deliveries which is fine if that is necessary however it is done too often imo i wish you a speedy delivery and a healthy happy baby Breech birth Epidural Premature birth Intravenous therapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Urinary incontinence Drowning Intact dilation and extraction Abortion Traumatic brain injury Pregnancy Dialysis Caesarean section First aid Pneumonia Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Equine conformation Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Professional wrestling holds Hypoglycemia Local anesthesia Fecal incontinence Cocaine In vitro fertilisation Insulin Diving Fetus Lethal injection Menstrual cup Lumbar puncture Shaggy dog story Weight training Diabetes mellitus Emergency Medical Services Aerial (dance move) Menstrual cycle Blood pressure Physical examination Breaststroke Fire fighting Spina bifida Kidney Fertility awareness Endometriosis Triage Stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Butterfly stroke Acupuncture Subdural hematoma Elephant Mesothelioma Infant respiratory distress syndrome Syringomyelia Carbon dioxide Euthanasia Cardiac arrhythmia Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scuba set Anesthesia Panic attack Tightlacing Suicide methods General anaesthesia Group A streptococcal infection Swimming Partial-birth abortion Massage Diabetic retinopathy Sexual intercourse Orgasm Swingout Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fetal development Reptile Terri Schiavo Shock Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005
