i'm weeks and my belly is so sore on the inside any ideas i know what normal pregnancy pains feel like this pain is different it feels like it's on the inside of my uterus because it's really sore in one area on the front where my belly button is and the surrounding area i know it's normal for some women to have sensitive belly buttons but it doesn't hurt when i touch my belly button it hurts mostly when my baby moves in a way that touches that area it doesn't feel sore when he touches other areas of my belly i know from previous ultrasound when i was weeks that the placenta is attached on the front could something possibly be wrong with the placenta could it be something else has anyone else ever experienced anything like that it could just be that the muscles in that area are stretching due to the position of the baby and cramping as a result of the tension i don't believe that most women feel where the placenta pulls off if it was a problem with the placenta enough to cause pain there would more then likely be quite a bit of bleeding too Obstetrics Pregnancy Miscarriage Abortion Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Prenatal diagnosis Breech birth Equine conformation Placenta praevia Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Placental abruption Diving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Caesarean section Placenta Progesterone First aid Cramp EastEnders Twin Poker jargon Professional wrestling holds Vaginal bleeding Lyme disease Amniotic sac Gonorrhoea Abdomen Stroke Massage Game controller Fertility awareness Abortion debate Muscle Fecal incontinence Premature birth Snake Intact dilation and extraction Strap-on dildo Sexual reproduction Aerial (dance move) Weight training Endometrial cancer Traumatic brain injury Orgasm Fetus Radiation therapy Friends Milton H.
