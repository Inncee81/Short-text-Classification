my girlfriend wants to get an abortion what should i do i told her if she do that it is over what do you think i don't think there is much you can do being that it's her body she can choose to whatever she wants try talking to her maybe you can get her to change her mind maybe she wants to go through with the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption or if you want to keep your baby then maybe she'll relinquish all parental rights and you can become a single father i admire you for wanting to step up to the plate and wanting to take responsibility for your baby it takes a real man to do that and she is stupid for not realizing that there are plenty single mothers out there that would have loved to be in her shoes with a man that wanted to be responsible i understand why you would want to breakup with her she would be killing a part of you something that was created from the love you both supposedly feel for one another someone that is willing to let go of something so precious like a child such a big blessing from god does not deserve to have someone next to her i wish you the best of luck and truly hope everything comes out the way you want it to hopefully she'll change her mind god bless you edit i'm not sure if you have any rights but since it's your baby their might be something you can do about it ask a lawyer you have nothing to loose just a few minutes of your time take a look at this website so that you can get an idea of what abortion is like maybe she hasn't seen the procedures it's horrible http www lifesite net abortiontypes Abortion debate EastEnders Adoption Knots Landing Abortion in the United States Sex and the City Sharon Tate Kodocha Marriage Jon Secada Friends Gregg Alexander Original sin Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Pregnancy Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Something Positive Abortion in Canada Fancy Crane The Emancipation of Mimi Rais massacre Cliff Richard Frankie Laine Sant Thakar Singh Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Summa Theologiae The Catcher in the Rye Miss Saigon Good Times Miscarriage The Death Gate Cycle Everwood Darth Vader History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Peter Singer Justification (theology) Pro-choice Stewie Griffin The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Recurring South Park characters Infantilism Breastfeeding Person Property (ownership right) Phoebe Buffay's songs Romulus and Remus Domain Name System Shaggy dog story My Sassy Girl Days of our Lives U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The Rutles Baby Blues Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion and abortion Married... with Children Milton H.
