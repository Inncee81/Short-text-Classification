an inconclusive pregnancy test has anyone had this happen ok so i am about sure im preg which was backed up by the sleepless night i had last night due to my horrible nausea so i took an equate pregnancy test this morning since it says thats the best time and i anxiously awaited the results and then all i got wat one window filled w pee eww and it was very dark so i cant even make out the line and the second window was still blank and white so what exactly doest this mean does this mean i could be preg though in may of this year i had a blood test at the doctors office that was inconclusive i personally believe that the technician did the test wrong medical technician or not he works at the front desk and they shouldn't be allowed to do it when it comes to the personal hpt's my theory is never use a pregnancy test that is not digital the ones with the urine windows are sometimes too hard to determine any results even though they come with instructions of how to tell if it's negative or postitive always buy at least two different brands of digital and maybe a different brand of regular test with the two windows edit clear blue and first response are the best IBM PC compatible Prostate cancer HIV test Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Abortion Drug test Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Medical record Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Oscilloscope Urine Pregnancy test Endometriosis Prolactinoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Emergency contraception Blood type Fertility awareness Coeliac disease Diabetes mellitus Insomnia 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Anxiety Traumatic brain injury Diabetic retinopathy In vitro fertilisation Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polycystic ovary syndrome I Married Marge Multiple sclerosis Red Bull Wheel of Fortune Chlorpromazine Myocardial infarction Stomach cancer Medical prescription Technicolor Tobacco smoking Crossing Jordan Lighting Haloperidol Folic acid Gonorrhoea Maprotiline Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Clinical depression Derivative Speed of light Hypertension Theodicy Prenatal diagnosis Paracetamol Dice Acupuncture Friends Condom Doxepin Morning sickness Microsoft Cannabis (drug) The Five Doctors Ebola Stroke Abortion debate Human chorionic gonadotropin Sin City Shaggy dog story Apple Macintosh Konica Minolta Theory of conduct Cardiac stress test Controversies in autism Paralegal Chronic fatigue syndrome Mattress Cephalic disorder Microsoft Windows Ovarian cancer Hiberno-English Group A streptococcal infection The Den (television) Password Hepatitis C G-Man (Half-Life) Emergency Medical Services Diabetes insipidus Blood test Vomiting Autism Health issues and the effects of cannabis Telephone exchange Medicine Vitamin C Experiment
