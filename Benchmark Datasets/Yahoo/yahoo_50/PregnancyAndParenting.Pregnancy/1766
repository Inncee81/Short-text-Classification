can you use a massage chair during late pregnancy and labor hi ladies i was just wondering if it is safe to use a massage chair during the last few weeks of prenancy im weeks and also while you are in labor i have one at home and use it every now and then but it seems to get the baby moving a lot i also took a hospital tour and they had a spa tub and massage chair but one of the nurses said the massage chair cant be used during labor due to the electrical currents or something she said it was there for the support people or the nurses to use i dont believe her and just wondered if anyones hospital had one to use and if you used it i think the nurse is correct some doctors also will tell you not to use an electric blanket this was found to be a problem back in the mid s for some women and rather than risk it they recommend that no pregnant women use them many massage chairs say right on the chair that they are not to be used by pregnant women it is the electric current not the vibration that is the perceived problem Childbirth Breastfeeding Pregnancy Premature birth Obstetrics Breech birth Sento Folic acid Midwifery Miscarriage Melanie Wilkes Prolactinoma Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Turner syndrome Reflexology Sybian Gay bathhouse Physical therapy Vibrator Urinary incontinence Roe v.
