lb baby at weeks pregnant i have just been up to my hospital this week and had a scan in which the sonographer has measured my baby at lbs in weight already being as i have weeks left and babies gain half a pound a week in those weeks this leads to the possibility that i would have an lb baby i have a consultant appt on the th and want to be induced or have a c section at weeks what is the likelihood of this also i actually think that they have my due date wrong and i am actually weeks just need to know if anyone has had similar experiance and what happened to them i have had a lb oz baby years ago however i have tried to tell them that not all labours are the same or babies and i am not prepared to go through it again to lucioliana i don't want either of these to happen this is why i think that they have my dates wrong due to size of baby the fact i know my body etc i don't think i actually said i wanted either these were just options that the midwife triage said may be an option and i am aware of the risks with both i believe in having a natural birth wherever possible unless of it is neseccary medically i asked the question to obtain an overview with anyone who had experianced similar i am not being a selfish person and i resent the fact that you say i would put my baby at risk for my own self satisfaction you dont even know me by all means give advice but dont judge everyone by such little information obtained i am a diagnostic medical sonographer and i will tell you that the estimated fetal weight is just that estimated they sonographer did not explain that it is plus or minus more than a pound it gets less and less accurate as the due date approaches ultrasound is not as accurate during the later month of pregnancy your ob doctor realizes this and can explain what his opinion is on this during your next visit relax you won't have an pound baby it also depends on the skills of the sonographer measuring the head and abdominal circumference determines the weigh if these measurements are not done accurately then the fetal weigh value is worthless good luck do not stress over this if the baby is too large then a c section is not the end of the world the due date that is determined by ultrasound is also plus or minus a few weeks during the rd trimester the most accurate dating is done during the st trimester if you had this done then go by the date they gave you then you will have a gorgeous baby soon i had a pound inch long son about years ago i was a happy camper on delivery day trust your doctor to help you make the best decision of you and your child Miscarriage Childbirth Breastfeeding Birth weight Prenatal diagnosis Breech birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Roe v.
