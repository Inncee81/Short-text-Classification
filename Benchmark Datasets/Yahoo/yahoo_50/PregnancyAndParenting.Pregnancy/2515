better to have a girl or a boy my first child is years old and i am pregnant again the baby is due in march so the kids will be and a half years apart my year old is a boy do you think it would be better to have a boy or a girl do you think my son will be able to play with either a sister or a brother since they will be fairly close in age i know it's all just a guess i'm just wondering what other people's experiences have been thanks by the way we don't plan on having any more kids after this my sister and i were two and a half years apart to the day we fought like cats and dogs my oldest and second oldest daughters are two and a half years apart almost to the day if you count due dates it's to the day lol they also fight like cats and dogs my theory is that like gendered children close together in age like that tend to be competitive to clash more to engage in more sibling rivalry etc they have too much in common of course that's purely speculation on my part my only firstand experience is with girls as my first boy won't be arriving until november but that's been my experience perhaps this only applies to girls you know how we can be lol but a lot of the brother sister pairs that i know for example my niece and nephew tend to get along well overall they're not necessarily super close but neither do they get into eachother's stuff or bicker over clothes friends etc like pairs of sisters seem to my husband was one of three boys but they were spaced farther apart so there wasn't as much rivalry between them then again their relationships were never super close either a pair of boys might really entertain eachother whatever you end up with i hope it's a match made in heaven best wishes Incest EastEnders Friends Family Doug Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy Neighbours Child sexuality Days of our Lives Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Ranma __ characters Peanuts Infantilism Trailer Park Boys Order of succession Anne Boleyn The Fairly OddParents Past characters (Neighbours) Edward Gibbon Wakefield Birthday Side Characters (Xenosaga) Multiple birth One Tree Hill (TV series) Hilary Duff Origin belief My Life as a Teenage Robot Pride and Prejudice A.J.
