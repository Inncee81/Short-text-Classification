sushi pregnant today i took bites of a sushi role small circular bites it has spicy tuna in it i am weeks pregnant do you think my baby will be fine i rararly eat suhi since i am pregnant yes yes yes the whole sushi paranoia is a bit of a myth relax but this isn t because scientific research has concluded that unborn children have been damaged by sushi rather it s because the speculative risk of food borne illnesses especially parasites has captured the public imagination there are several reasons however that these fears are unfounded while americans tend to associate raw fish with sushi and japan we have been eating raw seafood for centuries namely oysters and clams and it is these raw mollusks not the fish typically used in sushi that are responsible for the overwhelming majority about percent of seafood related illnesses as the national academy of sciences institute of medicine concluded in a report on illness from eating seafood most seafood associated illness is reported from consumers of raw bivalve mollusks the majority of incidents are due to consumption of shellfish from fecally polluted water if you take raw and partly cooked shellfish out of the equation the risk of falling ill from eating seafood is in million servings the government calculated some years back by comparison the risk from eating chicken is in over all million cases of food poisoning are reported a year the main risk of illness from non mollusks isn t from eating them raw rather as the institute of medicine reports the problem is cross contamination of cooked by raw product which is usually associated with time temperature abuse in other words no matter what you order in a restaurant if it s not kept at a proper temperature and protected from contamination you re at risk conversely if the restaurant follows good food safety practices there is little to worry about http www nytimes com opinion shaw html ex en a ce c ba ei Sushi Foodborne illness Japanese cuisine Veganism Vegetarianism Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fishing Food Omega-3 fatty acid Taboo food and drink Oyster Atkins Nutritional Approach Organic farming Kashrut Toxoplasmosis Seafood Nuclear power Conveyor belt sushi Shellfish Genetically modified food Wasabi DDT Breastfeeding Healthy eating Whaling Abortion Norwalk virus group Pizza French cuisine Livestock Economy of the United States Tea Kosher foods Shark Dioxin Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Cuisine of Brazil Tofu Fugu Peruvian cuisine Restaurant Cantonese cuisine Pregnancy Salmon Thimerosal Autism epidemic Economy of Macau Cajun cuisine Fish Egg (food) Cuisine of Denmark Food and Drug Administration Sashimi Barbecue Aspartame Folic acid Coffee Cuisine of the Southern United States Meat Common cold Diarrhea Pasteurization Medical analysis of circumcision Capitalism Tlingit Coeliac disease German cuisine Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Malaysia Halaal Crohn's disease Ramen Guinea pig Malaria Precautionary principle Microeconomics Roman eating and drinking Charles Darwin's illness Common Fisheries Policy Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Fishery Mercury (element) Sewage treatment Welding Poliomyelitis Salad Biodiesel Agriculture
