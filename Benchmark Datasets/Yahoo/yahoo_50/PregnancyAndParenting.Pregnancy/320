why is my baby stop growing at week i am currently weeks pregnant and doctor found out that baby's measurement is about weeks weeks behind so doctor told me that my baby is not growing very much and thinks that i could have very small baby so what causes the baby to be so small is it normal for people to give baby in smaller size than unexpected just wondering early in a pregnancy all babies fetuses grow at a similar rate but the longer your pregnancy progresses the more differences in size may become apparent that's why some people have pound babies at weeks and others have pound babies don't be concerned unless your dr gives you reason to be he she seems to think you'll just have a smaller baby it can be absolutely normal to have a baby measure slightly behind or ahead just read some other answers really the dr would only be concerned if the baby was below the th percentile here is a link for the intrauterine weight vs fetal age if it falls above th percentile and your dr said it just seems small then believe the dr http www ob ultrasound net weight html good luck Birth weight Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Childbirth Cephalic disorder Abortion Fetus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion in the United States Prenatal care Prenatal diagnosis Breastfeeding Premature birth Partial-birth abortion Urinary incontinence Hypertension Ectopic pregnancy Human height Congenital disorder Coeliac disease Roe v.
