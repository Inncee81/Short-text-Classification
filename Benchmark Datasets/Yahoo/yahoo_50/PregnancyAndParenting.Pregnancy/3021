is abortion at any stage from conception to birth wrong i want to hear your opinions on this i am not interested in answers like well seems like it could be or it depends give me a well thought out answer bc this is an important question i have an opinion which i will give after the main opinions on this topic have been presented the real question here is when does a baby fetus zygote become human i argue that there are differences between a baby in the womb at any stage of development past conception none of which are good reasons to kill it size the baby is smaller than a grown person so is a toddler killing a toddler is murder level of dependency it depends on the mother for life so does a breast fed baby killing a breast fed baby is murder environment it is encased in fluid so am i when i am swimming it is murder to kill me when i am swimming degree of development it is much less developed than an adult so is a three week old it is murder to kill a week old abortion is wrong period the second the woman conceives there is a baby are you not a person now so you try to tell me your weren't a person when you first started you were simply small and undeveloped but a person nonetheless the best argument i could see is the what ifs what if i she was raped incest and other situation of that extreme yes it may have been against your will with your brother sister family member but it is still a person if you were raped and had gotten pregnant don't kill it but put it up for adoption there are plenty of loving couples you love to take care of your baby for various reason they may not be able to have kids or like to take care and raise kids give your baby a chance to live what if your mom and dad decided they didn't want the responsibility of raising you and had you aborted you never had a chance to experience what have now and you didnt even have a choice life is precious if you think you are responsible enough to have sex before you are married which you shound not be doing anyways you must accept the realities not consequences of what can happen there are other options besides murdering your baby you wouldn't kill it when its years old why kill it when its weeks you have to start somewhere no matter the age its still a baby you stop smoking for years but the first week you stopped you have only quit for week you had gotten pregnant and now your kid is years old but the first week when it conceive it was still a week old it all starts somewhere it still a baby inside it is undeveloped and tiny but a still a baby Abortion Pregnancy Birth control EastEnders Roe v.
