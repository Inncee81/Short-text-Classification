can i test negative and actually be pregnant i should have gotten my period last monday today is sunday and still nothing i took a test on friday and again today both were negative i've been sick off and on when i lay down at night or right after eating my breasts are tender but don't hurt my face is breaking out i was on birth control and have been for the past year or more i was just wondering if anyone had ever been pregnant and tested negative multiple times pregnancy tests that you buy can only read positive once your hcg level gets high enough some women are much more sensitive to the changes in their bodies when they are pregnant while some would never even know they were prego if it weren't for the test reading positive i had the same thing happen to me with the tenderness nausea and the test kept saying negative your doctor can run a blood sample to see where the hcg level is sometimes with an ectopic tubal pregnancy the hormone level will never get high enough for a urine test to detect and can only be detected by a blood test with my ectopic pregnancy my hcg level never went above so the urine test couldn't pick up on it the typical hcg level of a non pregnant woman is i think every other day that you are pregnant your hcg level will double so if day is hcg level of than day 's hcg level would be also your cold could have affected your hormone level so maybe another week or so and the urine test will read positive if not then you really should get to a doctor the sooner they detect ectopic pregnancies the less damage it will take on your body ectopic pregnancies can be very dangerous for the well being of your tubes but sometimes take care of themselves my doc just told me that i wasn't pregnant and attempted to put me on a medication to start my cycle but i knew something was not right this wasn't just me running late i was having too many signs of being pregnant so i denied the medication and demanded a blood test my hcg level was at but didn't change over subsequent testing i began to have abdominal pain and she finally found the ectopic pregnancy so if something really seems outta whack for you keep being persistant with your doc tubal pregnancies aren't frequent enough for most docs to just believe you good luck though Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Human chorionic gonadotropin Prostate cancer Miscarriage Gonorrhoea Cytomegalovirus Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Diabetes mellitus Abortion Coeliac disease EastEnders Hypertension Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Ovarian cancer Breastfeeding Emergency contraception Drug test Childbirth HIV test Psoriasis Prolactinoma Pneumonia Cancer Morning sickness Chlamydia Birth control Turner syndrome Insulin Folic acid Androgen insensitivity syndrome In vitro fertilisation Infertility Marilyn Monroe Stomach cancer Acne Breast cancer Haloperidol Tour de France Schistosomiasis Lupus erythematosus Knots Landing Progesterone One Tree Hill (TV series) Chronic fatigue syndrome Aortic dissection Kidney Stroke Urinalysis Terri Schiavo Traumatic brain injury Friends Guinea pig Malaria Sharon Tate Doxepin Milton H.
