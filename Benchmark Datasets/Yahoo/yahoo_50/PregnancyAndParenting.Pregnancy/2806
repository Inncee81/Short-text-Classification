question about food during pregnancy what types of food are not good to eat during pregnancy the only one i know of so far is cold lunch meat what other types of food are not good for the baby where did you get the idea that you shouldn't eat 'cold lunch meat' while you are pregnant you may want to 'cut back' on it since much 'lunch meat' is treated with 'nitrites' but so is ham and that is not a 'cold lunch meat' since it's eaten at every meal and even then just 'be aware' and don't overindulge not 'stop eating it entirely use what my oncologist taught me when i had cancer 'listen to your body' and if it says you 'really want' some 'weird' food go ahead and eat it because when the body 'craves' something it's because there is something in that food that the body 'needs' to stay healthy as possible that's why pregnant women often have 'weird cravings' for stuff like 'pickles and ice cream' i used hot dog relish which is made with sweet pickles and had a 'sundae' that was pretty good their bodies need it or the baby needs it you should not 'drink alcohol' according to most doctors these days because of the possibility of having a child with 'prenatal alcohol syndrome' a type of 'retardation' with physical 'signs' you should not 'smoke' either because that's 'bad' for the human body but in reality if you do either but 'less than normal' you may be 'okay' and so may your baby people tend not to want to 'think' so they 'do' what 'they tell us' to do but especially on the internet anyone can 'pass themselves off' as an 'expert' and some people will 'believe them' and 'do what they say' you should eat a 'well balanced diet' while you are pregnant but you should eat a 'well balanced diet' when you aren't pregnant so there's really 'nothing different' about pregnancy and 'eating' at all you may gain weight you may lose weight but if you eat a 'well balanced diet' with 'little salt' and get 'good exercise' you'll be much healthier which will make your baby healthier which means that you 'can eat what you want' as long as it 'fits' into that 'well balanced diet' so enjoy your meals and don't feel 'deprived' for your baby's sake or you may end up with a 'picky eater' who wants to 'live' on something basically 'bad' like only peanut butter or only milk and i don't think you want that either Breakfast Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Pregnancy Tofu Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of the Philippines Dieting Veganism Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hamburger Coeliac disease Hot dog Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Healthy eating Milk Guinea pig Cuisine of the Southern United States Cat Japanese cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Hypoglycemia Jewish cuisine Obesity French cuisine Nutrition Chocolate Meal Binge eating disorder Ramen Cuisine of Africa Adjustable gastric band Coffee Foodborne illness Soul food German cuisine Bread Food preservation Egg (food) Diabetes mellitus Abortion debate McDonald's Kashrut Tea Vampire Sandwich Anemia Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Korean cuisine Insulin Fasting Vitamin C Tobacco smoking Serbian cuisine Cha chaan teng Bodybuilding Peruvian cuisine Dog Tooth Miscarriage Animal rights Obstetrics Cuisine of Laos EastEnders Japanese tea ceremony Domesticated turkey Human height Word of Wisdom Russian cuisine Prostate cancer Domestic rabbit Raw food diet Weight training Social rule Psoriasis Theory of conduct Meat analogue Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Alcoholic beverage Dim sum Crohn's disease Hypertension Sauerkraut Miso Cirrhosis Low-carbohydrate diet Birth weight
