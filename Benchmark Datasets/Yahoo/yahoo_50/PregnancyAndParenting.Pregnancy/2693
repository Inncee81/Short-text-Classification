baby shower registry question i registered for my baby shower at two places target and a local store that sells cloth diapers i really would rather have the cloth diapers than anything from target but i know that store will be inconvenient for many people my sister and mother are hosting the shower my question is can they add something at the end of the invitation a polite way of saying please don't buy me disposable diapers maybe something like the mother to be would like to note that if you wish to purchase diapers she is registered at name of store that way they'll see that i am not using disposables is that rude i just know a lot of people buy diapers for showers and i'm not going to use disposables and would rather them buy the cloth ones i've registered for is there a polite way to say that i've seen on invitation if you bring a pack of diaper you will be entered for a drawing you could put on there bring clothe diaper from and you will enter into a drawing with a great prize for me that sounds like a no pressure way of asking for clothe diaper and it will get the point across that your choosing clothe instead of disposable i wouldn't put don't buy disposable diapers just sound rude good luck and congrats Infantilism Diaper Procter & Gamble Social rule Kimberly-Clark Corporation Animal Crossing Sears Holdings Corporation Target Corporation Advertising Knots Landing Sauna Teen Girl Squad Trademark Ammunition Fecal incontinence Tesco Sento Humphrey Bogart Craps Cruising (maritime) Urinary incontinence Neopets Gaia Online Guild Wars Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Destiny's Child MapleStory Infant Changeroom Genericized trademark The Apprentice 2 Bus models used in New York City Transit Political economy Dairy Psycho Jackass: The Movie Fable (video game) The Marshall Mathers LP Phil Hendrie Best Buy Data mining Brewery Domain Name System Shen Gong Wu X86 assembly language Customs and etiquette of Japan Elimination communication Password Handloading Breastfeeding Halo 2 Jamaican English Marshall Field's $ale of the Century Monopoly (game) About a Boy Beverly Hills, California The Dalek Invasion of Earth Copy protection Philosophy of business Windows 2000 The Amazing Race Supply and demand Loss leader Jennifer Lopez Big Brother (USA TV series) Friends Windows XP Missouri Compromise Ayyavazhi mythology Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Neighbours Comanche Winning Streak Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Poker jargon Phoebe Buffay's songs Jeopardy!
