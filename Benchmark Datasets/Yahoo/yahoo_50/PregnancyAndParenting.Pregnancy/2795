why won't people respect my wish to have a natural birth instead try to push me to deliver in a hospital i mean i really hate hospitals that's me personally i've had bad experiences and they make me nervous anxious tense and i cannot relax in one at all not to mention i'm not sick i'm pregnant i also don't want drugs that's my own preference as i don't feel that saving myself a bit of pain is worth the risks but so many people just brush off my wishes and say oh go to the hospital cuz this this this could happen they try to scare me into it or get the epidural no just get it if you don't you'll be sorry and they try manipulate me into doing what they would do which is fine for them but this is after i specifically state what i want it's like they think i'm stupid can't manage to research my options and make an informed decision on my own i feel so insulted what do you think yeah i really want a water birth too http www waterbirth org mc page do everyone looks at me funny when i say that i'm trying to find a birthing center that's equiped for one ms vocal coach excuse me i'm being rude for wanting to deliver my baby the way i want what you think that i want my baby to die and complete strangers care more about my baby than i do btw if you had any real knowledge about what you're talking aobut you would know that only a fraction of women who birth at home or in a birthing center have complications less than those that deliver in hospitals the c section rate is less than of the national average as well not a chance wtf is your problem for one i said nothing about doctors manipulating me for two you don't know wtf you're talking about btw i know that things don't always go as planned the birthing centers i'm looking at are min from the hospital they are equipped with everything but surgical equipement if an emergency c section is necessary they will call ahead to the hospital and my wait will me no longer than if i were already there it takes time to get the anesthesiologist there ready too even in an emergency not stressed just annoyed and cranky wish i had some support ya know thankfully i just made a friend a few weeks before i found out i was pregnant that is a doula gave birth to her son at a birthing center she's been so great and of course my husband stands by what i want he knows i would do nothing to endanger our baby rules of life people are stupid b no exceptions c that includes you and me d no matter how dumb you think they are they are dumber everyone is ignorant in some field the sad thing is most people are ignorant about childbirth they don't realize that homebirths are safer than hospital births they don't realize that most of the scary stories you hear or they experienced were either lies over exaggerated to make the doctor look better or caused by the doctor hospital they have been taught to fear childbirth their whole lives and it takes a lot to get over that mostly they mean well although the people who push epidurals can all take a flying leap seriously how can you argue those are safer for mom and baby than not having them you want one go nuts but don't make out like they are mandatory people think having the baby's cord around the neck is some sort of emergency when in fact it is protective for the baby if the baby has a long cord it will be wrapped around them to prevent a cord prolapse the smallest and softest part of a baby is the neck therefore if the cord is wrapped around the neck it is least likely to be compressed during delivery babies don't breathe they get their oxygen from the umbilical cord until such point as they do breathe there were a few experiments done that show the average human baby can be kept submerged for as long as minutes after birth and still receive adequate oxygenation from the mother yes i find that experiment offensive and of course making a woman lie down epidurals pitocin etc etc etc all lead to further interventions every intervention has potential side effects good luck with your homebirth stick to your guns i transferred because i had some minor concerns i should have left after the hospital did a fetal stress test and said i could go back home they gave my son the wrong iv after birth which i knew he didn't need but they were threatening me with cps if i didn't consent and i was tired and it was already in before they asked permission it shut down his kidneys and he gained a half a pound in hours from excess water that wasn't the only medical problem caused by the hospital never ever again i would have to be on deaths door Medicine Epidural Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Drowning Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Premature birth Decompression sickness Birth control Prostate cancer Jon Secada Anesthesia Abortion Pitaten Myocardial infarction Sin City First aid Kodocha Milton H.
