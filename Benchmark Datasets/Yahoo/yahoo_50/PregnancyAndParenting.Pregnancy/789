ok could i be preg ok guys i started me cycle on the th are the nd of july i had sex on the rd of august yes he did release in me i really have no earthly idea on the length of my cycles but it starts around the same time every month i'm and out of school but the only bad things is that the guy and i have been dating for only months could it really be i have had one abortion when i was and never gotten prego after that i also smoke a little green could that put in a risk of me not being able to get preg didn't really think i could i'm so stressed careless but will be blessed if i am thanks for you guys help whether or not you were ovulating at the time of sex depends of your individual cycle but remember sperm can live inside you for up to one week smoking the green affects men's fertility more than womens it has also been proven that thc in marijuana has some same effects as ciggarette smoking on the fetus it is wise to quit but smoking during conception time isnt likely to severly hurt the baby dont worry yourself about it i know lots of girls who continue to smoke all months and their babies turn out just fine it comes down the moral decision about what you want for your future baby as for the abortion they should have had you go for a check up a few weeks afterward keep an eye on any symptoms for the first few months and everything should be ok and the months of dating this guy just be straight forward and honest be prepared for everything his affection and his abandonment just think about whats right for you after everyone else is gone you have to live with you hint if you have a regular monthly cycle you will prob be ovulating around days to count it out and see also the internet has a wide variety of early pregnancy symptoms to look into just remember everyone is different i hope you get the outcome you desire and dont worry about these people judging you everyone has an opinion about something that isnt happening to them Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Birth control In vitro fertilisation Abortion Health issues and the effects of cannabis Tobacco smoking Prostate cancer Sexual intercourse EastEnders Androgen insensitivity syndrome Theory of conduct Cannabis sativa Multiple sclerosis Social rule Causality Ovulation Extreme Programming Obstetrics Cannabis (drug) Abortion in the United States Infertility Predestination Sexual abstinence Atomic Kitten Sexual orientation Cephalic disorder Prenatal diagnosis Maya calendar Friends Infantilism Roe v.
