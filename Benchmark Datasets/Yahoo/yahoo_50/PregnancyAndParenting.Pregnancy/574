should i ask her doctor my best friend slept with her boyfriend and now shes months pregnant she told about it when she first found out and now she wants me to tell her mom about it and ask her doctor for an abortion i told her that i would try to figure out a way for her to talk to her mom but i still dont know about the abortion do u think i should ask her doctor or not i think that its your friend's responsibility no offence but if you aren't ready for the consequences of sex then you shouldn't be doing it she needs to grow up no matter what her age is and tell both her doctor and her mother its not your responsibility to do these things for her legally you can only get an abortion within a certain amount of time of conception and i think months is pushing it so she may be waiting too long goodluck to you and your friend Pregnancy EastEnders Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Laura Schlessinger Friends Sex and the City Abortion Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Boom Town (Doctor Who) Soap opera Miscarriage Social rule Teenage pregnancy Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Jam (TV series) Child sexuality History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Tupac Shakur Roe v.
