pleasee answer this question i have no one to talk too last week on friday i had sex and the condom broke i took the plan b pill within hours of taking it thursday days after taking the pill i started off spotting brown discharge than was slightly pink i thought maybe i was getting my period i put a tampon in and when i took the applicator out it had red blood on it looked like period blood that was thursday today is saturday and i still have a very small amount of brown discharge it looks a lot like old blood i've been told that plan b can cause this but i'm very scared i've told my mother and unfortunatley she's not being as supportive as i hoped she'd be i just want to know how long this will last and does it count as my period or will i get it again when i'm actually due on august th please give me good advice i have no one else to talk too thank you you're probably just spotting because of the pill if the doctor told you it might happen it probably will don't be too worried there's nothing to worry about when your af is due it'll probably come then since what you're having is just spotting so don't worry no babies yet Menstrual cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness EastEnders Hurricane Katrina timeline Emergency contraception Father's Day (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ocean's Twelve Condom Billboard Hot 100 Apollo 8 Gregorian calendar Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Knots Landing Taxi Driver Cleveland Browns Saturday Night Live Neighbours 1957 World Series Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Blood on the Tracks Menstrual cup God Emperor of Dune Tampon Sydney Riot of 1879 Mid-Autumn Festival Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cindy Sheehan Captain Thunderbolt Jeopardy!
