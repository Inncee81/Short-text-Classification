i had a positive pregnancy test but the sonogram showed nothing i am breastfeeding my month old girl and have had irregular periods since feb on may i had a day period and then on july i had a day period with bad cramping well i have been really tired felt yucky so i took a pregnancy test and it was positive i am in europe and went to a doc and she did a vaginal sonogram but it showed nothing so i wonder if weeks pregnant is too early to see a baby do you think i could be pregnant i forgot to tell the lady i have a tipped backwards uterus when i got home i thought about my first sonogram and remembered it was hard at first for the lady to see my girl when she was weeks old any similar exprience should i buy more test or go get a blood test done when does a baby appear on sonogram thanks i'd get a blood test done she may have missed it on the sonagram since you wouldn't really be able to see the baby i think that at weeks along the only internal signs you'd really be able to see would be the thicker lining and things like that i don't think you'd be able to distinquish the actual baby or sac Pregnancy Miscarriage Childbirth Fertility awareness Obstetrics Menstrual cycle Friends Endometrial cancer Pregnancy test Abortion Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prenatal diagnosis Menstrual cup Kurt Cobain Breech birth Endometriosis Coeliac disease Gonorrhoea In vitro fertilisation Puberty Marilyn Monroe The Beatles discography Premature birth Amniotic sac Prolactinoma Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Twin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Neighbours Stomach cancer Jon Secada Pregnancy fetishism Ectopic pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Spina bifida HIV test Intact dilation and extraction Beatles for Sale Abortion debate Sharon Tate Caesarean section Strap-on dildo EastEnders Cytomegalovirus Orgasm Guinea pig Cephalic disorder Infant Uterus Billboard Hot 100 Infant respiratory distress syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Chemical abortion Knots Landing Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Condom Days of our Lives Hyperprolactinaemia Infertility Blood on the Tracks Sex assignment Spice Girls Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hall & Oates Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fetal development Sex and the City Partial-birth abortion Tupac Shakur HIV Estrus cycle Donna Summer Psoriasis Vanilla Ninja Ben Johnson (athlete) Vaginal bleeding Journey (band) U2 (band) Pornographic movie Anal sex Cliff Richard Pregnancy (mammals) Pelvic inflammatory disease Leeds United F.C.
