how do u tll the in laws ur pregnant even if u kow they re not going to be thrilled i'm and weeks pregnant i'm starting to show now but i'm dredding telling the in laws thanxs guys i really wanted to tell them together but ur right not my parents not my problem lol ijust dont want them to say that it's a bad thing we are over the moon about this baby and just want them to share our happiness but i know she thinks we are to young to have kids tough sh t i fell pregnant on the pill months after me and my partner got together and he has a little boy to a previous partner too his parents live down south so we don't see them very often and i hadn't met them yet at the time i fell pregnant he told his parents over the phone and the first thing his mother said was 'well she'll have to have an abortion ' to some extent i can understand she said it in the spur of the moment but i thought 'how dare she ' how would she have liked it if someone had said one of her daughters was to kill their baby any time she see's my daughter she's all over her and she's never been nasty to me since but i can never forget what she said to my partner and she's never apologised for saying it any time she speaks to my daughter on the phone or sees her i can't help but thinking to myself if she had her way in the beginning my daughter wouldn't even be here it doesn't matter what they think it might matter to your partner and if they take it badly all you can really do is support him through it don't get yourself worked up about it though it's not good for you the baby or your relationship you and your partner might know they are in the wrong but he won't thank you for pointing that out to him or kicking off about it he'll still stick up for them to a certain extent their his parents after all no matter how wrong they are as i said before f ck them just enjoy your pregnancy and let your partner worry about them congratulations and good luck p s sorry for going on a bit EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Friends Abortion debate Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Neighbours Social rule Abortion Boston Public Sharon Tate Theory of conduct Phoebe Halliwell Good Times True Crime: Streets of LA Teenage pregnancy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Everwood The Emancipation of Mimi The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Charmed Janet Jackson Reservoir Dogs The Contender (television series) Tupac Shakur The Fairly OddParents Kyle Broflovski Sex and the City Laura Schlessinger Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Prenatal diagnosis Days of our Lives History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Teachers (film) Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Life to Live Hey Jude Hillary Rodham Clinton U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Pitaten Futurama (TV series - season 5) Malcolm in the Middle George Costanza The Death Gate Cycle Scenes from a Memory Samuel Goldwyn Guinea pig Miscarriage Philosophical skepticism Rent (musical) Infidels Abortion in the United States John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Critic Ocean's Twelve Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Human Stain Wonderland (McFly album) Elvis and Me Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Tenchi Muyo!
