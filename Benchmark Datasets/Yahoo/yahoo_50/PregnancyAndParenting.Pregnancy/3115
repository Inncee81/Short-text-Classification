my ex is at to weeks maybe mine maybe not help my ex is pregnant and the doctor said that she is due in september sometime he did not give her a exact date she is either or weeks as of today she said that she was concevied in november and that it is her ex boyfriends before me i was with her dec feb and we were together because she broke up with that other guy so is it really his or mine im confoosed on what to do it will be my first and i think that this might be mine i dont know help she never cheated when she was with me well counting the weeks i would say that it has a good shot of being yours woman ovulate about mid cycle that is the only time a woman can get pregnant if her period is about always on time you can do a little searching to see if it is you might need to ask if she knows wheh her last period was and then add about weeks to that and that is close to when she got knocked up i guess a paternaty test after the baby is born would be the best way to know until then enjoy the whole thing a woman giving birth and being pregnant is the coolest thing in the world if it is yours you wont want to miss this time and they can do a paternaty test right now but its at a higher risk to the baby then you would want to have and it should be only a few more weeks and baby will be coming do yourself a favor and enjoy this time if it is not yours then you have some experiance and know what to expect when its for real and if it is yours you will be glad you experianced this wonderful think EastEnders Jennifer Lopez In vitro fertilisation Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Friends Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Miscarriage Billboard Hot 100 Eddie Guerrero Atomic Kitten Knots Landing Premature birth Characters of Lost Breech birth Prenatal diagnosis Multiple birth Gonorrhoea Neighbours Abortion debate Charmed Sex and the City Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sharon Tate Glen Jacobs Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Psoriasis Jacqueline Moore Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Something Positive Abortion Pregnancy test Rod Stewart The Brittas Empire Shot of Love Jon Secada Human cloning Spina bifida Urinary incontinence Laci Peterson Maya calendar Fantastic Four Breastfeeding The Invisibles The Inside Polycystic ovary syndrome Leo Wyatt Kodocha Social rule Infantilism History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Abortion in the United States Oral contraceptive Bowl Championship Series Past characters (Neighbours) Extreme Programming Jam (TV series) Pregnancy fetishism Rais massacre Springfield Elementary School Dead Like Me I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Liturgical year George Costanza Coeliac disease Unemployment Coronation Street She Loves You Game show Cytomegalovirus 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression The Beatles discography Turner syndrome Babe Carey One Tree Hill (TV series) Ian Beale Charles Lee Ray Malaria The Island (2005 film) Slow Train Coming Doomsday argument Jan Hus Gregorian calendar USS Trigger (SS-237) Lucille Ball Infertility Methotrexate Academic term Caesarean section Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Emancipation of Mimi RuneScape quests StarCraft: Uprising
