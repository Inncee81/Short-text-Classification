what exactly does giving birth and labor feel like i just want to know what i have to look forward to please be as detailed and precise as possible thanks unfortunately it is not only different for every mother it is also different for every pregnancy st tightening painless contractions every minutes for three days at two weeks overdue they did a non stress test surprise i was dilated to and baby was in distress augmented with pitocin tightening painful contractions every seconds and i felt like my tailbone was breaking this is called back labor and happens when the baby is completely face up rather than turning her head slightly sideways so that with each contraction the crown of her head grates against the tailbone smooshing everything inbetween given demerol i got soooo high on that stuff that i got paranoid and started crying because i thought everyone was laughing at me got an epidural pain went away and i fell asleep for the next six hours i woke up when i felt like my epidural is wearing off silly girl the nursie says it's a drip it won't wear off i was crowning and could feel enormous pressure and needed to push pushing was hard work there was a lot of pressure but no pain nd my water broke at home two weeks overdue the night before i was scheduled for another non stress tests and then the familiar non painful tighting contractions those gradually became stronger not a period type cramp at all just an intense tightening of the muscles it was really kind of neat to watch my body work like that feeling it crest like a wave and feeling my belly get so hard and then relax again however after hours there was no dilation beyond the and her heartbeat was decreasing during contractions so i got pitocin again back to a painful contraction every seconds with no breathers inbetween but at least no back labor still no dilation doctor opts for an epidural to help me relax went from a to a in minutes no pain upon pushing rd lost mucus plug and began contractions around lunchtime gave the girls lunch a nap a bath packed their bags fixed dinner fed my husband then said time to go the contractions are around minutes apart now i just didn't want to sit in the hospital for hours again took the girls up to my neighbor thank god she volunteered and he drove like a freakin' maniac to sulzbach at o'clock at night it was really cool same cresting waves uncomfortably tight in the belly so that i couldn't speak or walk in the middle of a contraction but i wsn't crying either the midwife on duty at the hospital put some hormonal ointment on my cervix to help it soften faster then they let me sit in a warm bath for an hour the water was lovely warm and cradling my body so that the contractions didn't even hurt then they asked me to get out so they could check me and move me to the delivery room i cried like a baby because i didn't want to leave the water they put in an iv shunt just in case and i asked if i could get an epidural because outside of the water it really hurt quite a bit she slapped my hand and said you don't vant an epidural you big tough momma with two babies already i almost punched her i don't have a very clear memory of the delivery because i had an out of body experience it felt like a bowling ball covered in glass shards was being ripped from my body and then i was floating on the ceiling going who is that screaming will somebody shut her up oh my gawd that's me that particular baby was lb oz and never wore newborn size clothes he went home in months size th my doc wanted me to go in early for induction because she hates delivering big babies i was due december on november days before thanksgiving she tried to talk me into admitting myself but i stubbornly insisted on going home and making thanksgiving dinner for my family i promised to come in friday but she wouldn't let me because the nurses would skin her alive if she admitted an induction on a holiday weekend so i went home cleaned my house roasted a turkey and all the stuff with it called my mom and told her i needed her to come sunday sunday night i checked myself in to the hospital where they inserted a cervadil hormones on the cervix and i sent my husband home to get a good night's sleep i was already having regular contractions and i probably would have been in there the next morning even without induction anyhow my water broke at am and the contractions weren't so bad about like the ones before just some really nifty stuff then about am it started to feel like my hips were coming out of joint i cried and they brought me the sweetest person on earth the anesthesiologist the epidural only worked on half my body so now it only felt like my left hip was coming out of it's socket delivery wasn't as painful as with my son no floating on the ceiling just a bowling ball no glass this time Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Shining (film) Major League Baseball television
