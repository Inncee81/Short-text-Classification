has anyone had sore and swollen boobs and not been pregnant i've been pregnant before so i would think i would know the difference my breasts usually swell some before i have my period but this has been around weeks now although they are not swelling so much as to have to change bras but i can tell they're bigger also i'm really bad at keeping track of when i'm supposed to have my period but i don't really have any other symptoms with my prior pregnancy i was nauseous all the time and could smell everything should i be concerned sorry i forgot to note and this is kinda gross that i've had an increase of discharge as well i would always have breast pain before my period was due and sometimes it would last longer than just the week before you might want to invest in a test just to ease your mind if you haven't had your period yet this month Pregnancy Obstetrics Breastfeeding Menstrual cycle Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Gonorrhoea Brassiere Mumps Psoriasis Herpes simplex virus Turner syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Gout Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premature birth Conjunctivitis Folic acid Infectious mononucleosis Urinary incontinence Cytomegalovirus Breast fetishism Endometriosis Traumatic brain injury Radiation therapy Breast implant Fertility awareness Breast cancer Prostate cancer Haloperidol Tocopherol Milton H.
