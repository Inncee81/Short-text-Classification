pregnant or have been ladies only i'm weeks and i'm getting period like cramps i'm getting period like cramps but not quite as bad as the cramps i normally get when i have a period also since saturday i have been getting a brownish discharge it was actually a pinkish brown but now it is just a light brown i know it is normal to get clear discharge but what does brown mean could this be a sign i could be going into labour soon or could this still go on for the next couple of weeks thanks in advance i'm stressing out a bit well i went to the hospital and was sent back home the midwife said it is just braxton hicks and the discharge is torn membrane or something old blood anyway thank you to all of you i'm glad i went to the hospital just for reassurance brown discharge is nothing to worry about that means old blood it could be from a small tear in your cervix either an exam sex or just the baby kicking wrong as long as the blood is not bright red or fills up a heavy pad your fine i too had the brown disharge this also could very likely mean you are losing your mucus plug a 'plug' that covers the cervix from conception to a few weeks or hours before labor and that's fine too as for the cramps this could be braxton hicks contractions or the baby pressing wrong it could be something you ate the start of labor it could mean labor will start soon but don't get your hopes up i lost my mucous plug weeks before i went into labor but anyway everything sounds normal so don't stress that's bad for the baby Childbirth Premature birth Menstrual cycle Cervix Pregnancy Obstetrics Breech birth Gonorrhoea Fertility awareness Toni Braxton Stomach cancer Miscarriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Discus (fish) Strap-on dildo Tobacco Spider Iris (anatomy) Dialysis Midwifery First aid Wound healing phases San Francisco 49ers Abortion Breastfeeding House Mouse Cleveland Browns Endometrial cancer Mucus Static Shock New York Giants Comanche EastEnders Endometriosis Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Elephant Oral contraceptive Equine conformation Carburetor 2000 Australian Grand Prix Unemployment New York Jets Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kodocha Capercaillie Caesarean section Cramp Traffic light Pump It Up The Beatles discography Fluorescent lamp Social rule Nurse National Football League Jaundice Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Thermal power station The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Coeliac disease Casting Blackground Records One Life to Live Stroke Vampire Guy's Hospital Intact dilation and extraction TLC Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Eye Myocardial infarction Babe Ruth Cytomegalovirus Sexual reproduction Labor theory of value Blood pressure Wheel of Fortune Van Morrison Aortic dissection Diabetic retinopathy Anxiety Sin City Psoriasis LSD The Twelve Labours Prenatal diagnosis Tire Giraffe U2 (band) Characters in the Smurfs Cat Jam (TV series) Pulmonary alveolus Norway national football team Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jennifer Lopez Epithelium Jon Secada Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina
