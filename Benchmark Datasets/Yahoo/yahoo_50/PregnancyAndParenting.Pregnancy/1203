weeks preggo question the babyis really starting to get active it still feels like big bubble pops but i was just wondering when will my hubby be able to feel it usually after weeks the baby has to get just big enough and strong enough to make those kicks really count when he first feels the movements they will be soft like gentle bumps against your belly but later on he might really be surprised at how strong they are my husband actually yelled owww one night when my baby's elbow or foot or something poked him while i was sleeping up against him lol Professional wrestling attacks Aerial (dance move) EastEnders Cliff Richard R.
