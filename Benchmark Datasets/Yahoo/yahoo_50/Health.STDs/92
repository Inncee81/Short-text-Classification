std question iwas just wondering if it's even remotely possible to contract an std if niether partner has one i've always wondered because if they have to be transmitted from someone else then where did they come from i imagine that they evolved from some other diseases but i still have to ask bettter safe than sorry i'm asking if it's possible during intercourse to get an std if niether person has it think about it if an std has to be transmitted from another person then someone somewhere spontaneously contracted it from something other than another person no if neither partner has an std they cannot transmit it to someone else stds cannot and do not spontaneously appear one person has to do something that would put them in a position to contract an std i get what you're saying about things having to start somewhere you're right everything has to start somewhere in the case of stds it starts when a person comes into contact with a bacteria or virus that can be transmitted sexually so with hiv the current consensus is that people in africa killed and ate chimpanzees that were infected with the chimpanzee version of immuno deficiency virus called siv when people came into contact with infected blood the virus was able to mutate and become dangerous to humans being a sexually transmitted disease the virus was able to quickly spread as you can see by the example it was not a spontaneous event the first person did not simply wake up one day and have hiv there was a specific event outside of his body that occurred that's how it works someone a long time ago came into contact with a virus or bacteria and passed it along so no stds will be transmitted or appear if neither partner has one hope this answers your question Sexually-transmitted infection AIDS AIDS reappraisal Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS HIV Oral sex AIDS pandemic Duesberg hypothesis Human sexual behavior Gonorrhoea OPV AIDS hypothesis Hepatitis C HIV test Safe sex HIV vaccine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cytomegalovirus Virus Common cold Condom Medical analysis of circumcision Anal sex Human papillomavirus Ebola Smallpox Herpes simplex virus Computer virus AIDS origin H5N1 Sexual intercourse Syphilis Hepatitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Unsafe sexual practices Tuberculosis Rabies Hepatitis B Infectious disease Evolution Lymphogranuloma venereum AIDS in Africa Simian immunodeficiency virus Prostitution Index case Foodborne illness Malaria Influenza Sexual abstinence Methamphetamine Immune system Autism AIDS in the United States West Nile virus Human Meme Monkeypox Monogamy Cancer Sexual orientation Kaposi's sarcoma Sex education Gene therapy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Antiviral drug AIDS conspiracy theories Antiretroviral drug 28 Days Later Lassa fever Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Foot-and-mouth disease Orgy Sexual dysfunction Crystal methamphetamine and sex Rape Birth control Chimpanzee Sexual network Genetically modified food Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Spanish flu Zoonosis Pandemic Child sexuality Promiscuity Measles Genetically modified organism Infectious mononucleosis Nutrition Chronic fatigue syndrome
