what does everyone think of tna being interested in some of the wwe's past talent a few to tell are ariel kevin thorne's gf nidia tough enough winner a train rikishi and scotty hotty so what do you think a few things to consider they no longer work for the wwe and are probably in need of a paycheck tna doesn't have to pay them as much as the wwe did some of them were not properly utilized by the wwe christian for example after they dissolved the edge christian tag team and rhino and they are will be getting better opportunities in tna name recognition wwe has a much wider and larger audience so having former wwe wrestlers gives tna some credibility as a big time wrestling company tna isn't global meaning they don't travel nearly as extensively as the wwe the guys can actually put down roots someplace instead of living out of a suitcase attractive to those who don't like the killer travel schedule of the wwe i think it's great that tna is giving these guys opportunities we see match ups not possible in the wwe or wcw such as the dudleys team d vs the steiner brothers or christian vs sting the younger and lesser known guys get to show off their talents and perform for larger audiences guys such as styles and daniels i don't look at it as tna scooping up wwe rejects i look at it as new possibilities the evolution of abyss for example the possibility of rvd coming to tna maybe even chris jericho the possibility of rvd vs jericho is awesome tna gives former wwe wrestlers another opportunity for work and it beats the hell out of the sordid way wcw did business under eric bischoff's reign WWE No Way Out Kurt Angle World Wrestling Entertainment Extreme Championship Wrestling Chris Jericho Page Falkenberg Professional wrestling match types WWE Unforgiven Survivor Series Eddie Guerrero Scott Levy WWE Vengeance Paul Levesque Jeff Hardy Shawn Michaels Glen Jacobs Dudley Boyz A.J.
