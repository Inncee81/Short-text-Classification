why did kane take his mask of f i liked him better with it on kane had to remove the mask after losing a mask vs championship against triple h during triple h's infamous 'reign of terror' during the storyline behind this was basically to freshen up the kane character which it did he went on a rampage for months taking out linda mcmahon shane mcmahon rob van dam and matt hardy the kane matt hardy lita storyline was a huge storyline because at first it reflected the real life love triangle between edge hardy lita the new demented kane also had what seemed like a fresh feud with his kayfabe brother the undertaker which was 'the' build up for wwe towards wrestlemania no other match really got the build up hype that that one received however after kane turned face after feuding with edge the character became stale again i've always thought kane's character was much better suited as a monster heel i agree i think he looked more imposing with the mask on who knows maybe when wwe decide to focus on kane for a decent storyline they'll decide his character needs freshening up a bit and have him have some sort of 'accident' and have to wear the mask again here's hoping anyway Kurt Angle Adam Copeland Professional wrestling match types WWE No Mercy Vince McMahon Paul Levesque Chris Benoit Eddie Guerrero Paul Wight Professional wrestling slang WWE Unforgiven Survivor Series WWE Judgment Day Stephanie McMahon-Levesque World Wrestling Entertainment Leon White WWE Vengeance WWE Backlash David Bautista Shawn Michaels SummerSlam Trish Stratus WrestleMania X8 Booker Huffman Hulk Hogan Gregory Helms WWE No Way Out WWE Armageddon Shoot (professional wrestling) Linda McMahon Shane McMahon Bret Hart Jacqueline Moore Taboo Tuesday Oscar Gutierrez Jim Ross Ric Flair World Championship Wrestling Extreme Championship Wrestling WWE Intercontinental Championship Mick Foley Jason Reso World Tag-Team Championship Brock Lesnar Montreal Screwjob Randy Orton McMahon-Helmsley Faction Page Falkenberg Joanie Laurer WrestleMania XX John Cena Brothers of Destruction Greg Valentine The Rock (entertainer) WrestleMania XVI Jeff Hardy Jon Heidenreich WWE Homecoming Nelson Frazier, Jr. Professional wrestling Solofa Fatu Lisa Marie Varon Professional wrestling throws Gimmick (professional wrestling) Paul Heyman WrestleMania Royal Rumble The Alliance The Invasion Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Perry Satullo WrestleMania 21 Bill Goldberg NWo Ministry of Darkness Chris Kanyon Mark Copani Nick Dinsmore Stacy Keibler Professional wrestling attacks Carly Colon Kayfabe Debra Marshall Terri Poch Tables, Ladders, and Chairs Match World Heavyweight Championship
