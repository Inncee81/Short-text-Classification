why do people act like the fake wrestling they watch isn't fake do they really think that a wrestler actually won a match and that the wrestlers actually behave that way in real life when they are being told that it's all choreographed and scripted do the fans stick their fingers in their ears and say i can't hear you and la la la la la la until the person stops talking don't they know that all of those wrestlers need to be members of sag screen actors guild because wrestling is considered acting do these same people believe in the easter bunny people know those other shows are fake and only a very small percentage thinks something friends is real most wrestling fans think wrestling is real and act like the wrestlers are really the characters they portray themselves as in the ring plus they think that the wrestlers actually have a say in the winning or losing of their matches yahoo ninja and sharpie one source i get my information from are postings placed here anytime someone mentions that professional wrestling is fake and scripted in any way then there are dozens of thumbs down given in response and or angry comments as though the responders are reacting to news that you just killed their family of course i am only taking their actions as implication that they believe wrestling to be real but why would they react so violently if they knew it wasn't and knew the person was speaking the truth my other source is from some of the wrestlers themselves and seeing and hearing how the fans react to them when in their company the fans will ask why didn't you do this and how could you let that happen as if the wrestlers had any control over the matter at all and just because the wrestler may portray a dumb or evil character doesn't mean he is really hat way but the fans act like he is when they are in his company not just in the stadium and the wrestlers wonder just how dense some of these people really are it's not that they don't appreciate having fans it's just that they get asked the same inane questions over and over and wonder if they should just perpetuate this fantasy world those fans are living in or speak up and burst their bubble so i'm not asking out of ignorance or because i'm a moron maybe the people you hang out with are more perceptive than the average wrestling fan so it is you that is getting a misguided picture of what the majority of the fans out there are like oh and i know that wrestling is a real as any stunt done in a show or film is real duh and even though those stunts are called gags by those who perform them the stunts themselves require physical effort and deliver physical pain to some degree even if they are done precisely right but this is true of any physical activity or sport and another thing that indicates they think it's real is when they say things like so and so deserves this or that because they are the better wrestler really and how does on reasonably make that assessment after all if everything has been planned out then you've never actually seen any of them really wrestle so you don't know just how good any of them really are the only way to tell how good someone is would be by watching them perform for real thinking you know how good they are when you've never done this is implying that you think they are doing it without a script and asking someone why they thought they lost a game isn't an inane question since it reasonably ask a player for their opinion on what occurred to bring this about it is however a repetitive question which they can get tired of answering an inane question would be why did you let the coach make that play as though they had any say in the matter or why didn't god let you win these being of the caliber i mentioned and being truly inane and not simply annoying and the easter bunny comment was direct towards those fans who really believe that wrestling is really real which there seems to be aplenty of and not those who know better keyring you make my point about many wrestling fans saying so and so deserves this because they're a better wrestler is exactly the same as so and so deserves this because they're a better actor honestly your arguments are retarded you can judge one actor against another because they are both acting but the wrestlers at least the ones you guys go on about aren't wrestlers they are performers with some wrestling skills you don't actually ever see them competing against each other in real bouts all you see are performances so you can answer who you think is the better performer but you can't honestly answer who the better wrestler is because you have nothing to use for comparison concerning their skills as an actual wrestler get it you don't know what they would be able to do and who would actually win if everything was suddenly unscripted and all of them were just wrestling and trying to win their matches because you've never seen it being done oh and people respond violently when someone says wrestling is fake because those comments more often than not are trying to undermine wrestling really i've heard plenty of real wrestlers make those comments about professional wrestling being fake not the performers pretending to be wrestlers you speak of but the ones who have matches where they win or lose a match based on their actual skills as a wrestler they say them because they are trying to bring some dignity to actual wrestling and feel that the wrestling you go on about undermines true wrestling giving everyone the impression that all wrestling matches everywhere are planned out how would you like people walking away from a match you were trying to win saying they should have let the other guy win i like him better professional wrestling fights are previously decided who will win and who will lose like scripted but the action in the ring is very real and the injuries are real too Humphrey Bogart Montreal Screwjob Paul Levesque Glen Jacobs Professional
