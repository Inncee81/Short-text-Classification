wrestling is going to die a slow painful death to ufc i used to be a huge wwf fan back in late 's and all through the 's i quit watching in because it dawned on me this new era plain and simple sucks yeah i know people watch it cause the like seeing high flying acrobatics and yada yada yada has any one watched a ufc competition then go and watch a wwe event it makes wwe all the cheesier yeah some will answer it's sports entertainment it's not supposed to be real i know its not supposed to be real but they need to take cues from ufc as to what will knock you out or make you tap then build on that and try to make it more fakailistic about every years or so wwe goes through a period where they get really really good think of the wrestling boom during the late 's then think of the attitude era in the late 's i predict within a year or so wwe will be really good again Professional wrestling World Wrestling Entertainment Kurt Angle Shawn Michaels World Championship Wrestling Bret Hart Hulk Hogan Stone Cold Steve Austin Ric Flair Spike TV Professional wrestling slang Paul Levesque Vince McMahon Eddie Guerrero Chris Benoit Ultimate Fighting Championship John Cena Glen Jacobs WWE Draft The Rock (entertainer) Mark Calaway WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
