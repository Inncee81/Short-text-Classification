i have a question regarding your opinions on wrestling in other countries before vince russo became the head booker of wcw in he was quoted on a wrestling chat room saying some pretty ignorant things about foregin wrestlers the gist of what he said is that american wrestling fans including himself are ignorant and don't give a damn about wrestling in japan or mexico as someone who personally loves both it got me thinking i only really know of the best wrestlers in those two countries i don't follow it i can't really because i don't get cmll up here and the japanese tapes i come across might as well be silent movies i love seeing the likes of kenta and mistico in action but i really don't follow foregin promotions because well i'm ignorant so if you look at it that way do you think vince russo was right that most american fans are too ignorant to really care about foregin wrestling most yes i care about foreign wrestling which should be made obvious by my avatar but it's difficult to keep up with it and that's none of my doing Professional wrestling World Championship Wrestling Vince Russo Virgil Runnels III Eric Bischoff National Wrestling Alliance World Wrestling Entertainment Adolfo Tapia Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Bret Hart Extreme Championship Wrestling Shoot (professional wrestling) Booker Huffman Jim Duggan Ric Flair NWo WCW Monday Nitro Bill Goldberg Professional wrestling match types Pro Wrestling Illustrated The Invasion Charles Ashenoff Randy Savage The Rock (entertainer) Nikita Koloff Chris Jericho Kurt Angle Jeff Jarrett Mick Foley Tag team Vince McMahon Chris Benoit Norman Smiley Professional wrestling attacks Marcus Bagwell Robert Rechsteiner Matt Hardy Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Scott Hall Richard Vigneault C__sar Gonz__lez Chris Harris (wrestler) Paul Levesque Stone Cold Steve Austin Jim Ross Chris Kanyon Montreal Screwjob All Japan Pro Wrestling John Cena Warrior (wrestler) American Wrestling Association Sting (wrestler) Sean Waltman Scott Levy Gimmick (professional wrestling) The Great American Bash David Flair Harley Race The Alliance Lance Storm Greg Valentine Shawn Michaels Jeremy Borash Professional wrestling throws Ron Harris (wrestler) Terry Funk Rodney Anoai Don Harris Trish Stratus World Class Championship Wrestling Bobby Heenan Sean O'Haire Wrestling Jim Crockett Promotions Jerry Jarrett Kimberly Page David Arquette Lawrence Whistler BG James Paul Heyman WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
