how will wwe improve their roster smackdown ecw raw when willduden domino lose the belts to who have exclusiveness smack down already has cruiser weights but take it a step further and put high end lucha libre in there less talking more sport purer wrestling if you would give ecw an extra hour and make it somewhat closer to it's roots than it use to be not exactly the same but i always liked the idea of the ref getting involved physically and that of the time it was no holds barred doesn't have to be as vicious as it was no burning tables or scaffold matches but something to make sure it's different raw on the other hand you can keep pretty much keep the same the exact opposite of smackdown more talk and entertainment than wrestling just need to bring in new talent every once in a while i know you didn't ask for it but here is tna i think they can improve if they don't go the way of wcw keep fresh talent and always have them mix it up with the established talent if a storyline doesn't work out just end it and and keep the wrestling going Eddie Guerrero Kurt Angle Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling slang WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
