question about having to defend the title every days the rule is you have to defend the title every days right but some of the lower ranked titles like the cruiserweight title and the tag team titles aren't defended every days and the champs don't have to forfeit the title ex after chavo won the cruiserweight title he didn't defend it untill vengeance which was months after he won it so whats the point of having a rule if you don't enforce it all the titme you do realize wwe runs minimum shows a week with two separate travel schedules so sometimes different cards a week obviously the titles get defended more than enough times a month just because you don't see it doesn't mean it isn't happening Eddie Guerrero WrestleMania XX Chavo Guerrero, Jr. Championship unification WWE Judgment Day WWE Cruiserweight Championship Chris Jericho NWA World Heavyweight Championship Juventud Guerrera The Great American Bash Kurt Angle Paul London World Heavyweight Championship WWE Armageddon Shawn Michaels David Bautista Leon White John Cena Bash At The Beach Jacqueline Moore WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
