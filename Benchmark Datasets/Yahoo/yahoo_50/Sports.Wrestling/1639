major spoiler angle vs joe outcome angle has to win the match because he is iwgp heavyweight champion and joe doesn't work for iwgp so angle must win not to mention angle has complete control over his character which is a load of shit so unfortunately angle will win joe's not above touring and new japan isn't hard to get into which is where the iwgp third belt comes from inoki and tna have been working on talent exchanges for a few months now and that's why angle's actually allowed to carry that belt around on tna television so joe winning the belt shouldn't be an issue as for angle having creative control that's true but that doesn't mean he's going to be a bitch and hold on to all of the titles just because it makes him look good kurt doesn't have that sort of ego with all that being said i hope angle does win i'd rather joe win at bound for glory in days it's tna's equivilant of wrestlemania and it would mean a lot more of joe were to win the world there here's how i see things going down angle's wife helps him win at hard justice cornette comes out and tells angle that there's no way he could ever defend all of the titles he's holding onto so effective immediately he'll have to drop two the tag and the x division after a month of angle fighting someone else it'll probably be sting or abyss joe pops up and wins a number one contender match at the same ppv and joe v angle five is set i honestly don't mind angle as champion he's a great performer and a great character i'll admit the current storyline is very weak but if you're not going to have your camera on christian you might as well have it on angle Leon White Kurt Angle Hulk Hogan A.J.
