getting more agressive ok i wrestle in high school this is my second year and i have no problems getting into the state tournament my issue is that wrestling is really just conditioning for track season for me and i'm a really passive person so how do i get more agressive i an very strong for my weight and very fast but in a lot of my matches i dont really care because its more about conditioning to be so what can i do to get meaner at least on the mat i know football has a way of pulling the anger out of people but i dont know how they do it can you help me out in the few matches where i was already pissed i went in slam and pinned the other guy first round and i'd like to do that more either you gotta come pissed or you just have to have the mindset that im bigger than you stronger than you and faster than you so im going to kick your as and then go do it practice with your team get a guy your weight class or smaller and have someone simulate the start of a match and then try to be the first one to make contact Professional wrestling Shawn Michaels Suplex Professional wrestling throws Extreme Championship Wrestling Kurt Angle Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Rugby union Professional wrestling holds Leon White Lucha libre Professional wrestling slang Professional wrestling match types Chris Jericho Amateur wrestling Andr__ the Giant Adam Copeland Tennis The Rock (entertainer) Paul Wight World Championship Wrestling Wrestling Brock Lesnar NWo Norway national football team Paul Levesque Eddie Guerrero Trish Stratus Glen Jacobs Judo John Cena Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Internal ballistics WrestleMania X8 Hulk Hogan Association of Tennis Professionals Nelson Frazier, Jr. Jet engine FC Rostov Bill Goldberg Chris Benoit World Class Championship Wrestling Greg Valentine Ring of Honor Gustavo Kuerten Professional wrestling attacks National Football League Swingout Martial art PRIDE Professional wrestling in Japan John McEnroe Solofa Fatu Steve Corino Genichiro Tenryu Mick Foley Pro Wrestling Illustrated Royce Gracie Mark Calaway Electrophysiology Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bob Holly Roger Federer David Beckham Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Booker Huffman Playoff Shoot boxing WWE No Mercy Virgil Runnels III Ron Killings Bj__rn Borg Pittsburgh Steelers Lex Luger Professional wrestling aerial techniques Bryan Robson Roddy Piper Ultimate (sport) Computer Andre Agassi WrestleMania XX Rugby football Cartridge (firearms) Nikita Koloff International cricket in 2005 FA Cup Jack Charlton Jim Duggan Policy Debate Wales national rugby union team Rodney Anoai Brazil national football team David Bautista Ric Flair
