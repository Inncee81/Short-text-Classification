what is the best way to get in the wwe i'm and i'm thinking about my future and i've decided that if i don't make it into the nfl i will go to the wwe but i need work yep you'll have to learn to rassle pretty good and then get in the practise ring with a bunch of those other big bazookas and be prepared to get the tar whupped out of ya over and over and over again if you survive and start being able to beat them up instead you might end up on t v in the meantime you'd better stay in school and get an education because more likely than not you're not going to make it in the wrestling business World Wrestling Entertainment Paul Levesque Jim Ross Extreme Championship Wrestling Brock Lesnar David Bautista Kurt Angle Bobby Heenan Shawn Michaels Glen Jacobs John Cena Ric Flair Trish Stratus Roddy Piper Vince McMahon WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
