i want to grow raspberries and blackberries in containers does anyone know if this is possible has anyone ever tried to grow these plants in containers i don't have the area to put them in the ground thanks well you don't know what you can do until you try personally i think that raspberries need a deeper area for their roots than the pots that are available i don't know about blackberries but anyway there are some very large planter pots available at walmart i mean the ones that are inches deep and inches across just plant plants in there in regular potting soil mixed with peat moss and place on your patio add a little sheep manure to the top stir it in with your hand rake and water it in well water about twice a week or whenever the soil begins to dry out they will need sun or part sun to thrive when the plants start growing well they will send out suckers you will have a pot full of raspberry canes in a few months they should produce fruit the second year cover them well in the winter time with snow to protect them from winter kill in spring break off the dead canes after the leaves have begun to fill out in time the canes will fill up the space in the pot then you will have to thin them but i think you will see good results all in all pick your raspberries morning and evening and then the birds won't get them all good luck with your project p s i have all kinds of growing things in my garden many in pots some of these plants are not recommended for container gardening but i have had success with them anyway Houseplant Garden Strawberry Bonsai Loganberry Hydroponics Carnivorous plant Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Tea Sugar beet Raspberry Comfrey Vermicompost Hamster Tobacco Maize Hemp Fruit tree propagation Plant Japanese tea ceremony Weed control Wood Root Fruit Desert Hippeastrum Gooseberry Brewery Basil Compost Gardening Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Lake Stratification (botany) Pachypodium baronii Earthworm Pachypodium ambongense Blackberry Green manure Pea Drainage American Black Bear Renewable energy Begonia Tillandsia Biodynamic agriculture Potato Customs and etiquette of Japan Irrigation RuneScape quests Leaf Moss Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Betting (poker) Grand Teton National Park Flowering plant Sugar Mattress Soil Peach Campfire Cannabis cultivation Wine Death Valley National Park Pysanka Gypsy moth Venus Flytrap Flax Peanut Pot Noodle Carbon dioxide sink Biology of the Sierra Nevada Soils retrogression and degradation Black pepper Capercaillie Atlanta metropolitan area Dundas Square Coffee Climate of the United Kingdom Cajun cuisine Soil pH Peat Prosopis cineraria Glossary of wildland fire terms Bramble Apricot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sphagnum Dewberry Pisco
