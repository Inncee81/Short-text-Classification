can i transplant my own sod i'm building a new house on acres as you know around the house there is no grass but i have grass further away from the house i was wondering if i rented a sod cutter and transplanted from a different section of my property if this would work i just dont want to have mud for months around the immediate area of the house thanks of course it will work grass actually is one of the easiest and tolerable plants to work with a good soaking will be a necessity after the transplant perhaps you could rent a roller to smush it down after you move it then soak it real good it should take off like nothing happened assuming the soil is the same where you move it as where it came from sandy soil typically found around new home sites will obviously need to be mostly black dirt as grass roots prefer good dirt i'm sure you know that though i know my yard varies from dirt soil to clay almost in a definite line that may be your only hindrance although minor the answerer below me doesn't realize that you're apparently trying to avoid hundreds of dollars worth of grass seed or transplanting wouldn't be your first choice believe me you will spend hundreds on seed by the time it's all over stick with your fist idea if you decide not to transplant try hydroseeding for what you get it's a far better deal than seeding yourself and re seeding the bare spots good luck Tobacco Textile manufacturing Flax Weed control Agriculture Apple Microeconomics Soil Tillage A151 road Bamboo Weed Building material Theory of conduct European Beech Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Illegal drug trade Lawn Lechaina Acorn Seed Anchor Piccolo Junior Saga Brewery Republic Plough Hydroponics Wildfire Flowering plant Mount Sinai, New York McMansion Road transport Agricultural machinery Herbicide Fruit tree propagation Theodicy Erosion Elis Prefecture Deforestation Rice Gypsy moth Bone marrow transplant Garden Strawberry Turnip (brassica rapa) Desert Drooping Brome Satchel Paige Chess strategy and tactics Estoppel Orchidaceae Hemp Sorghum Barley Playoff Mulch Pok__mon Abilities Monopoly (game) Baseball Kitchen Fast bowling Sowing Fertilizer Liberalism Mnemonic Wetland Avenue Q Comfrey Sugar beet Compost Predestination Lawn mower Seismic retrofit Squatting Dune Goodness and value theory Natural building Genetically modified food Hamster Plant Coast Douglas-fir Coercion Sandworm (Dune) Cheating in poker Breastfeeding Peanut Democracy Mud People Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Good Times Leukemia Rachel Corrie Crop circle Labor theory of value Dolly Sods Wilderness Car washing techniques Harlem Alcohol fuel
