help me i have no tomatoes my plants look fine however i have no tomatoes lots of little yellow flowers that simply dry out please help not sure why the best answer got a thumbs down that answer was right tomatoes don't set in extremely hot weather i go through this every year since i live in southern california and i've read about it in almost every garden reference book i've picked up the sources i've read said degrees if you plant in the early spring you'll get some fruit by now but through july and august the flowers tend to dry up and fall off without setting fruit it can depend on what variety you have and where they are located in your garden obviously varieties developed for hot climates and plants getting a bit of shade at the hottest part of the day might perform better be patient and keep up the watering once the days get a little cooler the fruit will set up just fine and if the frost is late this year you may even have tomatoes on into november Tomato Garden Strawberry Climate of the United Kingdom Apple Rose Cereal Carnivorous plant Flax Basil Physiological plant disorders Climate of Salt Lake City Breakfast Gooseberry Leaf Coffea arabica Maize Watermelon Potato Air conditioning El Ni__o Loganberry Climate of India Solanaceae Coffee Illegal drug trade Flower Flowering plant Plant Cannabis cultivation Banksia Elis Prefecture Hamster Laguna province Luther Burbank Death Valley National Park Berry Banana In-N-Out Burger Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Sage Japanese cuisine Citrus Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Geography of Peru Tofu Alfalfa Sugar beet Season Compost Survival skills K__ppen climate classification Coconut Agriculture Yosemite National Park Energy development Customs and etiquette of Japan Cuisine of the Philippines Comfrey Black pepper Wine Avocado Arizona Billboard Hot 100 Strawberry Hippeastrum Peach Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Peruvian cuisine Geography of Spain Thermoregulation Biological pest control Broccoli Hemp Pollination Grafting Hop (plant) Pansy Solar power 1997 Pacific hurricane season Quang Ninh Province Cuisine of Africa Bird migration Organic food Xeriscaping Date Palm Species Cajun cuisine Perfume Dogwood California Pea Hydroponics Tina Turner Green tea Adam and Eve Pachypodium Squash (fruit) Mango
