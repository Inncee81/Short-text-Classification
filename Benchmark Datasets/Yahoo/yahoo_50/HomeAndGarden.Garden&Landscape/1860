my rosebush doesn't bloom i have a rosebush i planted a few years back it's a hybrid tea type but i forget the specific breed it bloomed beautiful large blossoms the first couple of years i had it after that it bloomed one year as though it were a floribunda type in the two years since it hasn't bloomed at all just grown to ridiculous heights anybody know why it's not blooming thanks alot for all the input guys i think the problem is that the rootstock overcame the grafted plant it did indeed take a hard hit from a particularly harsh winter but right when i was going to dig it up i noticed canes still growing i did check now and they appear to be growing from the roots so i guess it probably won't bloom again if the rootstock was a one time only thing oh well i guess i'll dig it up and try again i guess i should add that the rose gets plenty of sun so that's not the problem and i don't use pesticides or chemical fertilizers at all i try not to get my plants addicted to drugs the blooms that happened after the change were dr huey blooms from the sounds of it they were deep red and semi doubled oh well i'm just going to dig it up then at least i still have my double delights to please the girls with for the most part hybrid teas are grafted onto a root stock this root stock is usually an old fashioned climbing rose called dr huey dr huey is red and blooms in clusters in the spring i don't think that it reblooms any growth that comes up from the roots on any grafted rose should be pruned out these shoots will quite literally steal water and nutrients from the desired 'hybrid' rose if you pruned your rose very 'hard' you could have been the culprit too most likely what happened is that the rose took a strong kill back a couple winters ago but a few canes remained 'good' so you thought it would grow back some of these shoots came up from the ground and suddenly your rose looked terrific so you thought it would be okay eventually most or all of the hybrid tea died out and left you only dear old dr huey regardless of how it came to be dr huey is never worth the trouble i'd dig him out and try again with another rose if you want to try a carefree rose consider a salt spray rose rosa rugosa they are very easy to grow rarely are grafted and are practically pest free i hope that this helped good luck Apple Fruit tree propagation Rose Grafting Agriculture Wisteria Organic farming Biodynamic agriculture Apricot Weed control Theory of conduct Pollination Houseplant Bamboo Bonsai Hydroponics Pruning fruit trees Cannabis cultivation Maize Illegal drug trade Gypsy moth Biological pest control Humphrey Bogart Diseases of the honeybee Phylloxera Volleyball Lake Fertilizer Tea Pansy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Olive Malus Piccolo Junior Saga Eutrophication Wheat RuneScape quests Carnivorous plant Equine conformation Plant breeding Nutrient Renewable energy Species Gooseberry Grunge music Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Russian joke Ty Cobb Pesticide Opportunity rover Hemp Hash table Scenes from a Memory Crop rotation Goldenrod Characters in the Smurfs Flowering plant EastEnders Collision detection Jon Secada Sorghum Dog Orchidaceae The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story Coffee Citrus Pitaten Comfrey Poker jargon Herbicide Ron Weasley Pollinator decline Organic food Sugar beet Alfalfa Japanese tea ceremony Hop (plant) Sustainable agriculture Caffeine Cannabis (drug) Wheel of Fortune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Peach Directed-energy weapon Red Hot Chili Peppers Cosmic year Jute Addiction The Tale of Genji Fish farming Social rule
