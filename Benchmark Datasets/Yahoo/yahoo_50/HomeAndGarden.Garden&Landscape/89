i want to keep and grow lavender inside but how would i take care of it lavender does not like to be bothered at all it likes to be planted in a very sunny spot and does not like much water it is heat and drought tolerant and likes it that way you can prune it a little for the flowers but if you prune it just a little too much it will start to blacken and die it will behave the same way with too much water the simple truth is that lavender is not that easy to grow and that will be especially true for an indoor plant you may be able to get away with bringing in a potted lavender plant for the winter provided you have a short winter no more than months or so you will need to provided it with very bright light and watch that it does not get too much water it does not take much to kill lavender so don't be disappointed if it doesn't survive Carnivorous plant Bonsai Hippeastrum Lavender Houseplant Pruning fruit trees Cannabis cultivation Ron Weasley Honey Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Begonia Renewable energy Garden Strawberry Pruning Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Ann Coulter Plant Sorghum Tillandsia Japanese tea ceremony Perfume Cyclamen Solar power Lighting Gardening Apricot Olive Fruit tree propagation Shrub Hydroponics Coffea arabica Tobacco Grafting Plum Discus (fish) Kelp forest Hamster Sunlight The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Coal Rocky Mountains Essential oil Theory of conduct Lavender Line Autonomous building Solar panel Basil Venus Flytrap Collision detection Gooseberry Survival skills The Legend of Zelda series enemies Greenhouse Wisteria Sauna Geyser Passive solar Ficus elastica Stage lighting Hebburn Leaf Capercaillie Desert Bamboo RuneScape quests Creosote bush Apple Time Out of Mind Kitchen Arable land Nuclear power Characters in the Smurfs Rosemary Bladderwort Religion Tea Pig (zodiac) Garden Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Perennial plant Pea Thermal power station Sea-lavender Moth Pachypodium Licence Renewed Shaggy dog story Lilac Cannabis (drug) Monarda The Amber Spyglass Swimming pool Gypsy moth Comfrey Auxin Social rule The Smoking Room Death Note Sperm Whale
