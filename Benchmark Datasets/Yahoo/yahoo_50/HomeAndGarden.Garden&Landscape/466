a question about pruning trees and shrubs what time of year is it best to do this thank you though i have so got to catch up on my pruning i have alot of shrubs and a few trees that need pruning it depends some on the tree shrub if you are just doing light pruning its okay to do it whenever but heavy pruning should be done in the late fall or winter deciduous plants retrieve the nutrients from their leaves in the fall and store the goodies in the roots so wait for the leaves to fall before you do a lot of pruning evergreens don't seem so bothered but you can shock them cutting off too much general rule of thumb is to never cut off more than a third at any one time some plants need to be pruned after they bloom which may at different times spring or fall too much info there is so much more Pruning fruit trees Bonsai Shrub Plant Alder Pruning Pinophyta Hydrangea Kudzu Bamboo Apricot Wisteria Lilac Wood Perennial plant Cannabis cultivation Gypsy moth Apical dominance Tobacco Fruit tree propagation Orchidaceae Apple Eucalyptus Leaf Rose Grafting Auxin Fireblight Prunus Ivy Berberis Oak Manzanita Willow Plum Elm Vegetation Tree Coffea arabica Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests Coffea Cupressaceae Osmanthus Flowering plant Christmas tree Apocynaceae Houseplant Caatinga Broom (shrub) Cotoneaster Jasmine Pachypodium Sequoia Almond Coast Douglas-fir Forsythia Honeysuckle Banksia Weed control Collision detection Peach Maple Pachypodium ambongense Domain Name System Mediterranean Basin Nutrient Physiological plant disorders Aesculus Eucryphia Fern Expert system Atlanta metropolitan area Valdivian temperate rain forests Tea Palearctic Scissors Hazel AVL tree Desert Temperate coniferous forests Tamarix Elis Prefecture Pine Zion National Park Begonia Desert willow Carnivorous plant Gooseberry Malus Sudden Oak Death Comfrey Deforestation Illegal drug trade Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests Aucuba Topiary
