what's the deal with asparagus i planted asparagus in my garden and now someone told me that i have to replant them next year when can i dine hi asparagus is a perennial you will be enjoying it for many years it is the first crop that you harvest in the spring you harvest the shoots that would otherwise become big plants if you harvest too much or too long the plant will have no energy left and will not thrive over time it will die so the longer you wait to harvest the bigger the root system will get thus producing bigger crops in the future i would lightly harvest next year and then do a full harvest the following years good luck Potato Good King Henry Sugar beet Asparagus Sugarcane Hop (plant) Sustainable agriculture Fruit tree propagation Cereal Green tea Maize Bamboo Comfrey Plant Sorghum Irrigation Alfalfa Wheat Pea Cannabis cultivation Broccoli Cotton Jute Tobacco Coast Douglas-fir Apple Market gardening Vicia faba Pioneer Valley Oat Green Revolution Houseplant Alcohol fuel Permaculture Sweet potato Crop rotation Taro Combine harvester Coffea arabica Barley Chauntea Peach Percy Schmeiser Renewable energy Harvest Moon series Hemp Hydroponics Pruning fruit trees Sugar Cassava Textile manufacturing Coconut Bonsai Slavic mythology Energy development Araucaria araucana Great Famine of 1315-1317 Palouse Wild rice Biodiesel Acorn Olive Banana Agricultural machinery Kosher foods Clover Phytophthora infestans Overpopulation Eryngium Water resources Winged bean Garden Strawberry Bean Asparagus (genus) Grafting Pysanka Turnip (brassica rapa) Pine Compost Wine Loganberry Truffle Coffea Peanut Habanero chile Growing degree day Culture of Korea Deforestation Great Depression Globe artichoke Herbicide Auxin Root Black-eyed pea Hippeastrum Honey fungus
