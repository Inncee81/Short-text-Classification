why are the vines of my moon flower purple i have moon flower plans ipomoea alba and i collected seeds form one and planted them the seeds came up beautiful but with one problem the vine and leaves have a purple color the vines are completely a rich purple and the veins in the leaves are purple as well i am wondering if they are some sort of hybrid or something or perhaps there is something too rich or lacking for that matter in the soil will they still produce the beautiful white flowers it was not labeled incorrectly because it was a seed from a moon flower plant i have already grown i purchased new seeds form burpee and put them in the same soil and those vines are purple as well glenn is correct the alba is a hybrid seeds from hybrid plants very often do not appear the same as the plant you collected them from i've experienced this with the heavenly blue hybrid of convolulus morning glory it reseeded itself and the following years all those seedlings produced nondescript purple flowers best to purchase new plants or seeds year to year hon Morning glory Orchidaceae Rose Loganberry Flowering plant Pansy Vine Carnivorous plant Sweet potato Flax Common bean Hemp Flower Apple Toxicodendron Tomato Hydrangea Broom (shrub) Plant Kudzu Kiwifruit Alfalfa Wisteria Sage Convolvulaceae Lilac Willow Cuscuta Ipomoea violacea Morphology of Pachypodium Iris (plant) Comfrey European Beech Apricot Seed Phalaenopsis Clover Leaf Monarda Garlic Bougainvillea Garden Strawberry Peanut Weed control Grape Watermelon Eucalyptus Sunflower Vanilla Camellia Nepeta Pikmin Cucumber Pysanka Pinophyta Anthurium Purple loosestrife Cultivar Allamanda Green Revolution Sorghum Elm Noni Rubber Cannabis cultivation Pikmin series Maple Potato Poison-ivy Coffea arabica Cottonwood Pachypodium brevicaule Anemone Anemone nemorosa Coast Douglas-fir Pine Nymphaea Phylloxera Banksia Okra Pachypodium bicolor Ethylene Winged bean Wine Delphinium Fruit tree propagation Gorse Tree Hop (plant) Brugmansia Aspen Sarracenia Jute Agriculture Pachypodium Wood carving Cirsium Ayahuasca Juncaceae
