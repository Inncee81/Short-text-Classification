seed and aerate my lawn i live in the subarbs of chicago il and i wanted to know when should i seed and aerate my lawn i have been plauged with a fungus on my lawn and i want the brown large areas spots to be replaced by new grass for next season i also have dog damage to my lawn as well i had re seeded thoses areas with dog damage earlier in the season only to have grass grow and then die by the fungus i plan to do the aeration and then seed mixed uses grass the entire lawn including areas that are healthy don't know if this is a good idea or not but i figure it shouldn't be bad any advice would be greatly appreciated i live in the northwest suburbs of chicago and i'm a university of illinois extension mg volunteer the best time to reseed in the chicago area is during the first week of september temps start to moderate the rains usually return on a regular basis and our cool season grasses start their second seasonal growth spurt few of the grassy weeds germinate at this period so you will find that early september really is the absolute best time to establish turf grass in our area use a slit seeder to overseed the best germination occurs when grass seed is in direct contact with soil no other technique does it better than a slit seeder you can also aerate at this same time as far as the fungus goes you need to identify the fugal pathogen that's causing your problem when selecting your grass seed spend a couple of dollars on good grass seed pick a grass seed mix with named grass seed cultivars that have good to excellent resistance to a wide range of fungal pathogens make certain that they are also resistant to the fungal pathogen currently infecting your lawn now fungicides are preventative and can never remove the pathogen from your lawn once a lawn is infected the pathogen is there even if you could remove the pathogen from your lawn new spores could blow in on the wind from your neighbor's lawn or the park down the street when it comes to turf diseases planting disease resistant cultivars and modifying your turf cultural practices to prevent disease are a much better way to deal with a fungal pathogen rather than the never ending use of preventative fungicides below are some great articles published by the university of illinois extension service on selecting grass seed mixtures selecting named cultivars lawn repair lawn aeration managing diseases all specific to the unique needs of a northern illinois lawn Stratification (botany) Herbicide Rice Pansy Magnaporthe grisea Lawn Pneumonia Norman Borlaug Fungus Weed control Banana Agriculture Compost Apple Dutch elm disease Sewage treatment Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Orchidaceae Hemp Antiviral drug Fish farming Myxobolus cerebralis Peanut Comfrey Rose Fruit tree propagation Gypsy moth Sorghum San Pedro cactus Pesticide Maize Foodborne illness Tomato Rocky Mountain spotted fever Malaria Organic farming Phytophthora infestans Cancer Soil life Bacteria Moss Domestication Immune system Pathogen Plant Agar plate Tick Medical analysis of circumcision Citrus canker Shrimp farm Alfalfa Bonsai Biological pest control Mycoplasma Spore Elm Ergot Hydroponics Root Hamster National Football League Giant Sequoia Chlorophyta Germination Legionellosis Aspergillosis Antibiotic Houseplant Sickle-cell disease Eczema H5N1 Anchor Chemotherapy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tattoo Mulch Crop circle Cell wall Lyme disease Fancy rat Ebola Common cold Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan
