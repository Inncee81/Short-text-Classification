i have a questions about flower seeds and how wide they grow this might seem like a stupid question but i am buying a lot of seeds next year for spring and it says how wide the flower will grow here is any example a hollhock grows about inches wide does this mean seed will grow that wide or all of the seeds together will grow that wide sorry this is a dumb question but i don't know thanks in advance wow i really should have used spell check uh oh i'm going to have way to many flowers then oh well i guess the more the better i have about seeds the width is for each individual seed there are a couple of things to remember however the germination rate won't be so one option is to put seeds in each 'hole' and pull the weaker if germinate another consideration is how dense you would like the planting to be for some things like hollyhocks a nice solid wall can be grown if you have plants coming up about every feet and you can plant a front row and a back row giving depth to your 'hedge' sure hope your garden is beautiful it takes patience as plants grow and some plants are biennials which means a whole year to wait for flowers but i think it is well worth the wait Flowering plant Flower Plant Wood Maize Weed control Peanut Hemp Fruit tree propagation Textile manufacturing Cotton thistle Tire Seed Germination Pansy Species Apple Kudzu Sage Sunflower Pachypodium baronii Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Orchidaceae Vanilla Pachypodium bicolor Chatsworth House Acorn Floppy disk Drooping Brome Brewery Potato Comfrey Watermelon Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Hamster Chess strategy and tactics CPU cache Ethylene Coconut Darwin from Orchids to Variation Japanese tea ceremony Alfalfa Pachypodium ambongense Tobacco Sugar beet Time Out of Mind Stratification (botany) Pollen Apricot Cuscuta Flax Mahjong Cereal Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 European Beech Singlish K.F.C.
