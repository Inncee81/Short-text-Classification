are plant guilds desirable to use in a permaculture style garden is it possible to design a permaculture garden by using plant guilds how does the size of the plot affect the decision what are the advantages and disadvantages http www edibleforestgardens com about gardening http www greenhousebed com permaculture permaculture examples htm permaculture answer yes it is a guide line for bio diversity planting permaculture gardens should be collections of guilds into niches as many as or more plants planted with the same time frame in mind tall trees such as coconut palms and mangos guan abana or papapya underneath them depending the specie of papapya maradol is a pigmy papapya and comes a level lower banana to follow vines on the coconuts and the mango like vanilla sugar can beneath that maybe some lines of corn half shade corn or bushes with fruits then things from half to one meter pine apple or articoke pumpkins or other ground cover plants on the floor some low herbs and root plants like carrots depending the climate each place has its own species this is just a tropical example the whole resulting in a rough pyramid of plants there are no disadvantages the soil ends up healthy and there are few pests the only possible disadvantage is small amounts of produce but of a great diversity making the idea not so comercial the mexican indigenous peoples of oaxaca plant in a consecative time frame which is a traditional style first they plant agave tequila cactus in lines with a corn that is planted singular instead of the usual seeds to a hole in between and the stem is stronger when the corn has reached a certain hight they follow this up with a small climbing bean that utilizes the corn stem and pumpkins and herbs are planted as ground cover that will not be ripe untill well after first the beans then the corn has been harvested guilds are models of compatibility merging with the concept of companion planting so bio diversity is the overall concept that is streamlined into companion planting plants that are physically and chemically compateble and guilds is how we end up with stylized grouping to act as a guideline for the farmers consisting of usually permanent plants or trees to provide shelter from the wind vertical coverage to act as niches or shade from the sun high crowns or structural poles mixed with seasonals like vegetables or other utility plants you can do a heck of a lot on less than half an acre the minimum size is a circle of a diameter of metres niches ideally because you want part of it as trees to provide a canopy that locks in the humidity as well as to bring shade and cool ness to part of the garden the perimetre should be a wall of some sort like bamboo or bushes to have a niche effect and to further lock in humidity as well as temperature a tightly niched garden can differ by as much as ten degrees with the outside going in both directions my garden in mexico is ten degrees cooler than the road but in cold places it can be ten degrees warmer making all the difference of life or death in places that can have night frost example if you plant trees in a circle their crowns will shade maybe metres each across so in order to remain with a sunny spot in the middle for those veggies that need the light the trees have to be about metres apart but you can be smaller if you do a half moon garden Coffee Tree Leaf Flowering plant Fruit tree propagation Bamboo Pachypodium Plant Carnivorous plant Wood Ecology Apple Gypsy moth Fruit Weed control Bonsai Autonomous building Maize Mango Rainforest East Province, Cameroon Banana Vegetation Capercaillie Cannabis cultivation Wind power Hemp Houseplant Yosemite National Park Permaculture Global warming and agriculture K__ppen climate classification Renewable energy South Africa Peruvian cuisine Geography of Bolivia Sun Bong Gooseberry Sugar beet Hop (plant) Tobacco Hydroponics Albedo Organic farming Brewery Climate of the United Kingdom Beer Food Atlanta metropolitan area Pea Equine conformation Glacier Christmas tree Coconut Earthworm Climate of the Alps California Geography of Brazil Flax Orchidaceae Tomato Miami, Florida Coffea Botany Great Pyramid of Giza Species Solar variation Forest gardening Drill bit Microeconomics Transformer Cuisine of Brazil King Khalid International Airport Centre Province, Cameroon Acorn Wood carving Gramophone record Anarchism and society Erosion Peanut Dundas Square Internal ballistics Florida Keys Olive Seismic retrofit
