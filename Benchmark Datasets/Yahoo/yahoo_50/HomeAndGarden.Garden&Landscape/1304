organic garden i'm tired of always worrying about not washing out all the pesticides herbicides and god knows what els out of my vegtables so i decided that i should grow my own vegatebles but i've never grown anything in my life does anyone have any tips that will help me start out right i want to grow tomatoes bell peppers carrots squash and possible my own green tea where should i go shopping begin with what you have and prepare the soil for next year healthy soil grows healthy plants doing it organically means it takes a bit more time for things to break down and beneficial soil communities including actinomycetes and arbuscular mycorrhizae need to recover if you till in any amendments they are your partners in preparing the soil and growing the plants know your beneficial flora fauna in the soil and on top it seems like a lot to learn but it really will help http www primalseeds org compost htm http www css cornell edu compost invertebrates html http www ext vt edu departments entomology ornamentals beneficials html http www govlink org hazwaste house yard problems goodbugs cfm to begin asses your soil what is the mineral content sand silt and clay ratio next how much organic is in the soil here are two methods to familiarize yourself with the soil optimum soil percentages are sand silt clay organic material you need quart jar cups water t water softener or three drops detergent just enough to separate the minerals not to foam up take a soil sample from the top inches in your garden beds since your soil may vary throughout your property take samples from each area you plan to amend and test each one separately place your soil sample water and water softener in a quart jar cover with a tight fitting lid on the jar shake vigorously until everything is floating in the water if it foams you used to much soap set the jar aside for hours what settles first is the sand the next layer is the silt followed by the clay and frosting all the layers is the organic material on top when everything has settled after hours measure each layer then divide the thickness of each layer by the total depth of all layers together to get the percentages multiply the answers by alternate assessment method check your soil's texture by picking up a handful and squeeze gently if it feels sticky and stays in a tight mass your soil is likely too high in clay if it feels harsh or gritty and won't hold any shape or crumbles it is likely too high in sand if it feels silky smooth or floury and won't hold any shape it's likely too high in silt if it molds into your hand yet crumbles apart when squeezed it has the perfect texture it is loam if it formed a sticky ball try to squeeze it upward to form a ribbon measure the length of the ribbon now wet the soil in your palm til muddy rub the soil against your palm with your other fingertips is it smooth gritty or both gritty ribbon is sandy loam smooth ribbon is silty loam both is loam gritty ribbon is sandy clay loam smooth ribbon is silty clay loam both is clay loam gt gritty ribbon is sandy clay gt smooth ribbon is silty clay gt both is clay black color indicates high organic matter gray indicates medium organic matter red tan or blue color indicates little organic matter and high clay blue color indicates that there is no oxygen in the clay therefore no roots will grow in blue clay normally the organic matter is mainly in the topsoil next you take a fertility test for the ph and nitrogen phosphorous potassium content you can easily do this or send off for it the results of the test tell you exactly how much you need to add to bring the soil to its optimal fertility without adding extra that will end up in the water runoff testing saves you money and prevents polluting the water if you need help calculating how much and what to add there are lots of sites that specialize in organic gardening Soil pH Coffee Sewage treatment Tea Pottery Vermicompost Comfrey Desert Mattress Hydroponics Soil life Plastic Organic farming Opportunity rover Chlorophyta Leaf Houseplant Brewery Breastfeeding Carnivorous plant Hemp Garden Strawberry Drainage Fertilizer Soap Geology of the Grand Canyon area Earthworm Explosive material Wood Green Revolution Agriculture Glass Tofu Organic gardening Dairy Portland cement Flax Waste management Root Strap-on dildo Pachypodium habitats Mouse (computing) Iron Erosion Cannabis cultivation Phosphorus Fire extinguisher Drawing Gypsy moth Biological pest control Fire fighting Alcohol fuel Weed control Carbon dioxide Seismic retrofit Glacier Microeconomics Composting toilet Thar Desert Ice core Water purification Bonsai Welding A151 road Organic horticulture Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dead Sea Upholstery Water (molecule) Ecology Bread Diamond Volleyball Horse Apple Electrophysiology Cascading Style Sheets Christmas tree Plant Peanut Organic food Caliche 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Japanese tea ceremony Lightning Thermal power station Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area
