is there a metal detector that can find platinum i've asked a lot of questions concerning my earrings that i lost yesterday in the grass i've purchased and taken back two different metal detectors today i have pulled grass out around the areas that i think they may have fallen i have waited until night and shined a flashlight on the grass to see them sparkle nothing the metal detector beeps no matter what it even beeped on it's side up in the air i'm running out of steam but refuse to give up on them what the hell am i doing wrong are there any reliable metal dtectors out there i know the earrings aren't in the ground maybe an inch below the ground but i keep getting beeps for stuff i do not see help you might want to buy a big magnet and comb your garden with it until your earrings are found but it'll take a very strong magnet to find it as platinum is not that paramagnetic attracted to magnets you could use the magnet inside a useless hard disk for this ask your local computer wiz on where to get one you could calibrate your metal detector since you already have one and it's a much better way to solve your problem to do this try to find another piece of platinum of about the same size also get some other pieces of metal moce the knobs on your detector until it only beeps when it's over the platinum you can repeat the test burying the metals under some soil a couple of inches like it must be on your garden if you can't get more platinum gold or silver will work more or less like platinum if it has a dial just see the value it gives when passed over gold or silver if it is just sound pay attention to the noise it makes when passed over a piece of gold or silver that's the size of your earrings good luck Floppy disk Magnet Gramophone record Vacuum tube Money Platinum Hard disk Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shen Gong Wu Mass spectrometry United States dollar Shaggy dog story Nine Inch Nails Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Time Machine Uranium Commodore 64 Video game music Oscilloscope Sound recording Amateur telescope making ATLAS experiment X-ray Mattress RuneScape quests Tag Violin Microphone Full Metal Panic?
