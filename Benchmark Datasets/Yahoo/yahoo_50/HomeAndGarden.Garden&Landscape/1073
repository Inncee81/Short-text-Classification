what is a good tree to plant along a fence for privacy our neighbors apparently don't believe in blinds and we put up a fence already but we can still see way too much of each other what is a good tree to put up that will grow fairly tall without having awful roots spreading out everywhere we have mostly clay soil and this would be southern exposure thanks there are evergreens that can grow quickly including some arborvites just keep in mind how tall it will get how much shade you may be adding to your yard and that the plant will need to be hardy to your zone how high will you have to get the trees to provide the privacy you need keep this in mind when shopping for them how much do you want to spend places like home depot and lowes carry a number of evergreens ready to plant once you get your trees keep them alive the best time to plant trees is in the fall because they aren't actively growing new foliage needles and the trees can put all their energy into developing their root systems water the roots really thoroughly the day before you plant this is very important as it will reduce shock dig the hole at the same depth as the current rootball but twice as wide do not add lots of amendments to the soil you need to encourage the roots to grow into their native soil water the trees well and often hoepfully the weather will help lastly do not mulch up against the trunks or you will encourage diseases good luck Christmas tree Gypsy moth Houseplant Bonsai Bamboo Pachypodium Giant Sequoia Irrigation Vegetation Sequoia Prosopis cineraria Apple Eucalyptus Grand Teton National Park Soil pH Equine conformation Desert Desertification Erosion Ecology Comfrey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plant Fruit tree propagation Wildfire Hydroponics Dune Wood Peanut Sorghum Hemp Honey fungus Sewage treatment European Beech Southern live oak Pine Perennial plant Coffee Hop (plant) Grafting Deforestation 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Tasmanian Tree Fern Flax Geography of Albania Weed control Tamarix Cannabis cultivation Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Root Tree Mulch Great Depression Carbon dioxide sink Chernobyl accident Juniper Elis Prefecture Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Opportunity rover Soil life Fertilizer Potato Avalanche Anchor Kudzu Peach Nuclear power Sugar beet Drainage Thuja plicata Solar power Neem Hippeastrum Weed Biological pest control Leaf Johnny Appleseed Pansy Glossary of wildland fire terms Organic farming King City, Ontario Callitropsis nootkatensis Agriculture Energy development Liriodendron Araucaria araucana Orchidaceae Old growth forest Campfire Nuclear reactor Banana Volleyball Black pepper Comanche
