what is the best way to grow a nectarine tree from a pit i've read that putting them in potting soil or tossing them out into the garden doesn't really work and that they need a period of cold if i put it in the freezer for a time will that help if so how long should it stay in there btw i can't really afford to buy a tree that's why i'd like to plant one from seed btw i can't really afford to buy a tree that's why i'd like to grow one from seed let the seed dry completely nectarines do not need a freezing cold to stimulate germination plant in a pot and keep moist but not soggy stone fruits like nectarines and peaches may take quite awhile to sprout they do not require a second variety as a polinator peaches nectarine and european plums are self polinating but will usually produce better with a second tree nearby it will take several years to bear fruit and the fruit will probably not be the same as what the seed came from Peach Fruit tree propagation Apricot Seed Drupe Luther Burbank Stratification (botany) Garden Strawberry Hemp Plum Bonsai Pruning fruit trees Pollination Avocado Apple Coconut Pine Acorn Flowering plant Food preservation Pea Black pepper Plant Giant Sequoia Vanilla Prunus Potato Cereal Weed control Peanut Mango Tomato Banksia Orchidaceae Citrus Tobacco San Pedro cactus Organic food Johnny Appleseed Vermicompost Onion Common bean Almond Sunflower Coffee Ginkgo Sequoia Tree Coffea arabica Coriander Eucalyptus Basil Tea Sprouting Maize Carnivorous plant Rambutan Barley Durian Rowan Sugar beet Gardening Kiwifruit Olive Biological dispersal Orchard Fruitarianism Biological pest control Cycad Mushroom hunting European Black Pine Flax Brandy Smilax Agriculture Rice Refrigerator car Honey locust Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Food storage Tambalacoque Drainage Germination Lychee Banana Watermelon Capsicum Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nut (fruit) Alfalfa Vitamin C Date Palm Spore Weed Jute Botany Hydroponics Cashew
