why aren't our pumpkins growing we planted a pumpkin patch and we've followed all the directions our plants are big and healthy looking we water them everyday i was told they need lots of water there are tons of flower but there are no pumpkins our neighbor has pumpkins the size of softballs what did we do wrong thanks so much looks like i better break out the paint brush thanks it sounds to me as though your vines are not being pollinated one way you can do it is to get a soft round cosmetic brush and dust it on one flower and then on the next and so on just as a bee would go from flower to flower also be aware that there are male and female flowers so of course you need to go from the male flowers to the female flowers if you can use it on a few of your neighbor's vines' flowers then that would be good as they are almost certainly not the same strain hopefully you still have time to get some pumpkins off your vines if you pollinate them now i'm including a link on how to do this and how to identify the gender of the flowers good luck Flower Pumpkin Apple Pollination Flowering plant Honey Kiwifruit Vanilla Rambutan Vine Pollinator decline Cucumber Fruit Pollinator Plant sexuality Passion flower Clover Pollen Orchidaceae Watermelon Date Palm Alfalfa Greenhouse Factory farming Malus Peanut Sunflower Honeybee Pollination management Carnivorous plant Alder Bee Sex Cannabis cultivation Pollen source Tooth Ovary Hashish The Smashing Pumpkins Vanilla (orchid) Brush Plant Tomato Naruto jutsu Conifer cones Garden Strawberry Carpenter bee Ecology Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Spider New Zealand flax Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Morning glory Organic farming Magnolia Aristolochia Blackberry Softball Kudzu Timeline of alternative rock Rocko's Modern Life The Legend of Zelda series races Black pepper Leaf Cannabis sativa Hummingbird Bread Agriculture Gladiolus Diseases of the honeybee Biodiversity Equine conformation Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins Flax Sexual reproduction Burdock Donkey Kong 3 Stinging nettle Dodecatheon Hemp Transgender Cherimoya Pruning fruit trees Animal Crossing Mountain Gorilla Cactus Illegal drug trade Hop (plant) Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Biological pest control Bladderwort Disa (orchid) Pea Hermaphrodite Aphid The Time Machine Puncture Vine Pansy
