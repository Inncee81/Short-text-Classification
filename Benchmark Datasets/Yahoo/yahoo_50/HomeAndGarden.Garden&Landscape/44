bay tree laurus nobilis a few months ago my baytree was badly infested with mealy bug upon discovering the bug i cut off any infected branches and was left with a thick stem no leaves and only high i considered disposing of the root stock and whatever had remained but never got round to it after about months new shoots appeared on the stem and i let them grow and they are now about high the problem is the leaves don't look like laurus nobilis and certainly don't have the bay leaf smell i would appreciate some advice as to why i seem to be getting a different plant one of your problems may be that lauris nobilis is not bay leaf the botanical name for the plant most commonly called bay leaf is pimenta racemosa from which bay rum is made and which is closely related to allspice pimenta dioica both of these have strong spicy fragrances lauris nobilis is commonly called sweet bay and has little odor compared to the pimenta grafted trees respond to severe pruning by sprouting from below the graft and reverting to the parent root stock although i don't know way any of the above would be grafted since they are so easy to grow mealy bug can be controlled with horticultural oil available at your neighborhood garden center follow label directions Grafting Fruit tree propagation Allspice Leaf Ginkgo Olive Bamboo Plant Eucalyptus Apricot Orchidaceae Bonsai Cannabis cultivation Flowering plant Wisteria Coffea Apple Perfume Essential oil Sassafras Hop (plant) Gooseberry Citrus Vegetative reproduction Laurus Rose Gypsy moth Tomato Auxin Elderberry Glossary of graph theory Garlic Carnivorous plant Moss Sequoia Orange (fruit) Weed control Pinophyta Desert Apical dominance Tea Botany Pachypodium Sudden Oak Death Avocado Banana Oak Nettle Glastonbury Abbey Hair Comfrey Coriander Kudzu Peach Cinnamon Pachypodium brevicaule Honey fungus Ivy Pine Aspen Budding YuYu Hakusho Shrub Coffea arabica Flower Rum Bone marrow transplant Cycad Fecal incontinence Banksia Pollination Vietnamese Coriander Giant Sequoia Watermelon Durian Brooklyn Botanic Garden Pruning Wollemia Jute Fern Dutch elm disease Pachypodium bicolor Psoriasis Hepatica Tree of heaven Boise, Idaho Potato Basil American Elm Prosopis cineraria Tree data structure Black pepper Sugar beet Black cohosh Pachypodium key to species
