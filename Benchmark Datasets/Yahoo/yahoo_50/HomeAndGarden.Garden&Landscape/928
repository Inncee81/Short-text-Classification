have you ever designed your ideal playground or garden yep i just finished the project too i built a shed that i designed to look like a minature version of my house i dug out two gardens one in the front and one on the side i installed a trellis in the side garden under the window and window box and placed a very cute little wrought iron bench with two potted herb plants on it in the front garden i have another tiny wrought iron garden chair with an impatien plant on it and on the wall i hung a large wrought iron planter with a basket that coordinates with the window box on the side i lined both gardens with rocks i found while digging out the pad for the shed and used cedar mulch to finish both gardens it looks absolutely charming and gives an adorable finishing touch to my side yard it is an absolute pleasure to look out my windows and see it and it was fun to design fun to create and we did all of the work ourselves so it is a source of great pride Kitchen Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Irrigation Wilton House Hamster Passenger car Tag Garden Cannabis cultivation Drill bit Abbey Japanese tea ceremony Comfrey Perl Gardening Loudspeaker Microsoft Windows Houseplant Chatsworth House Grand Central Terminal Door Wood carving Palladian architecture Weed control Basement King Khalid International Airport Passive solar Dairy Amusement park Carlton Gardens, Melbourne Palace of Westminster Cascading Style Sheets Volleyball Christiansborg Palace Earthworm Grace Cossington Smith Irish Houses of Parliament Charleston, South Carolina Landscape architecture Plant Castle Ashby Lawn mower Textile manufacturing Chair Predynastic Egypt McMansion Mozilla Firefox Australian War Memorial Wan Chai Tobacco Professional wrestling match types Vauxhall Mid-levels Kennington Park Sento Rathfarnham Wrigley Field Mac OS X Isetta Washroom Solar power Lighting Where's Wally?
