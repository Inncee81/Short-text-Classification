my dream is to grow an incredibly beautiful rose garden i started this year but i want to be very selective with my plants i bought david austin mary rose plants the flowers i'm choosing are namesakes of people i love that have passed on a grandma's garden so to speak my question can i add a few new plants each year until the garden is developed or do you think it should be established at one time it's just fine to do it little by little that is how i have put together my rose collection i have found over the years that it pays to buy only quality roses that have been bred to resist disease david austin are great roses and there is a company called heirloom roses that breed their own roses both these breeders specialize in own root roses which is optimal as well i would warn you about the hybrid tea they are beautiful but they are very disease prone very fragile and tend to have a short life span they also tend to loose their graft unions anyhow if you are interested here is the site for heirloom roses i purchases four of their roses just this year http www heirloomroses com cgi browse cgi page item cat item happy planting Rose Heirloom plant Grafting Agriculture Guns N' Roses Tomato Plant breeding Flower Brooklyn Botanic Garden Tournament of Roses Parade Domestication Domestic rabbit Japanese tea ceremony Beverly Hills, California Pasadena, California World Wide Web Hellebore Potato Health insurance Pansy Selective breeding Livestock Animal Crossing Leaf Darwin from Orchids to Variation Flowering plant HTTP cookie Plant Organic food Aberdeen Fruit tree propagation The Secret Garden Final Fantasy XI Novel Mid-levels PHP Loganberry Illegal drug trade Cannabis cultivation Web browser Watermelon Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Species Hybrid Sears Holdings Corporation Capercaillie Music radio Frankie Laine RuneScape quests Maize American Pit Bull Terrier Tea Web analytics Dog Current teachings of Prem Rawat Ginkgo Britpop International Rose Test Garden Machinima Elm Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Comfrey The Amber Spyglass Donna Summer Horticulture Miss Saigon Luther Burbank Kylie Minogue Phoebe Buffay's songs Supply and demand Green Revolution Wars of the Roses Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Search engine optimization Canary Goodness and value theory Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Norman Borlaug Arabian horse Bene Gesserit My Little Pony Cigarette Spine (biology) Monopoly (game) Avenue Q Philosophy of language Care Bears Strap-on dildo Hydroponics Timeline of alternative rock Sugar Universal Studios Italian Greyhound Coffee Discus (fish) Topps Spyware Carnivorous plant
