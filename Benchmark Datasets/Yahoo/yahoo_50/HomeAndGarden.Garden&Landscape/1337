how can i compost secretly i would like to start composting my trash but my homeowners association does not allow compost heaps is there a way i can compost secretly no smell no bugs no obvious eyesore whatever that means i've seen some composting products on the web they do cost a lot but do they really work and is there a smell or bugs that might be attracted to them any ideas are welcomed thanks great answers so far the bench idea is great maybe i can combine it with the worms suggestions the tumbler idea was what i was looking for originally but it does cost a lot of money i mean is a lot of money for us we already have a garbage disposal but there are some things you should never put down the garbage disposal potato peel and cooked rice will gum up your pipes and sewage system putting down banana peels and chicken bones are just well not smart although having your neighborhood smell of garbage is not nice either thanks everyone i would recommend getting a composting bench basically the composter is part of the seat is doesn't become an eyesore the other thing you could try is make it to look like part of your landscaping make a false raised bed out of wood and surround it with stones then make a lid for it in the lid plant flowers ect then you can just lift the lid off when you need to stir the compost Vermicompost Dustbin Compost Plumbing fixture Composting toilet Waste management Biodynamic agriculture Comfrey Microeconomics Toilet Extreme Programming Kitchen Recycling Brewery Dairy Incineration The Star Wars Holiday Special Garbage collection (computer science) Organic farming Potato Java programming language SimCity 4 Barbecue Textile manufacturing EastEnders Plastic Avenue Q Stir frying Landfill Fertilizer Computer virus Tea Japanese toilet The Lovely Bones Basic English Orillia, Ontario Water purification Cantonese cuisine Renewable energy Cuisine of Malaysia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Japanese cuisine Debugging PaX Theory of conduct John Cage Food Peruvian cuisine Surveillance Apostrophe (mark) Carnivorous plant Chopsticks William Murdoch Cremation Houseplant Trademark Philosophy of language Toronto Permaculture Insurance Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Capital accumulation Primitive accumulation of capital Sampling (music) Garbage truck RuneScape quests Hemp Ramen Cuisine of Africa Great Lakes Palindrome Ice cream Cajun cuisine Agricultural wastewater treatment Jean Schmidt The Sims 2 French fries Social rule Veganism Naruto jutsu Wood carving Energy development PlayStation 3 Bruce Johnson Weed control Earthworm Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Australian words Flower Star Trek Customizable Card Game Waste Flowering plant Babe Ruth Pottery God Emperor of Dune Highway 61 Revisited Fruits Basket
