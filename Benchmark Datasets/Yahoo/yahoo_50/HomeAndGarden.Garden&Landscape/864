i received black eyed susans from my neighbor yrs ago why do they not bloom hers bloom and mine never have she gave me quite a bit of the root and i have nice leaves no blooms they are in full sun and i don't over water them just starting on my own flower garden please help thanks lots of times when plants don't bloom it's because they're receiving too much nitrogen are your black eyed susans near a lawn by any chance if they are and you fertilize your lawn then they are getting a lot more nitrogen than they need that's the primary component of lawn fertilizer if that's the case you may want to move them to a different location otherwise try using a fertilizer with a high middle number phosphorous to give them a bit of an impetus to bloom good luck Fertilizer Flowering plant Eutrophication Wisteria Comfrey Houseplant Algal bloom Bonsai Peach Hippeastrum Flower Irrigation Alfalfa Lawn Nitrogen Sunflower Ultraviolet Weed control Plant Lawn mower Phosphorus Goldenrod Pansy Phosphate Wheat Pysanka Creeping Charlie Cyanobacteria Pollination Sewage treatment Soil Algae Nutrient Compost Bloom filter Soil pH Garden Strawberry Gardening Carnivorous plant Aquarium Beverly Hills, California Aphid Ethylene Nuclear fuel cycle Tillandsia Pollen Xeriscaping Social rule Textile manufacturing Alder Biodynamic agriculture Fern Ammonia Pachypodium brevicaule Pollinator decline Rose Pinophyta Soil life Titan arum Pollution Leaf Nitrogen cycle Hash table Absinth Wormwood Begonia Decompression sickness Species Weed Earthworm Snooker Moss Phosphoric acid Sharon Tate Sorghum Tea Gulf of Mexico Physiological plant disorders Internal combustion engine Nitrogen fixation Fish farming Agriculture Ra (board game) Breathing gas Plutonium Sugar beet Brooklyn Botanic Garden Garden Fruit tree propagation Desert Photosynthesis Organic gardening Brugmansia Pachypodium ambongense Loganberry Ammonium nitrate Earth's atmosphere Black-eyed pea Spider Vegetation
