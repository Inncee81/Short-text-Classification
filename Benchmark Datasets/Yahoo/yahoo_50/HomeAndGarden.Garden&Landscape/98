what's wrong with my tomatoes they look really nice when they're green but as soon as the start to ripen they get a black rotten spot on them i end up having to throw away half the tomato what's wrong with them it's blossom end rot which is caused by the inability of calcium to make its way to the developing tomatoes it can occur even when there is abundant calcium in the soil poor drainage root damage soil ph that is too high or too far below the optimum inconsistent watering or too much nitrogen can be contributing factors remove affected tomatoes when symptoms are first observed to promote subsequent sound development of the other tomatoes on the plant you can correct the problem by improving drainage watering plants consistently as needed mulching plants to conserve moisture and to provide a more uniform water supply to provide calcium eggshells can be crushed and added to the soil foliar sprays of calcium won't correct blossom end rot once it has occurred on the fruit but it can help prevent the condition from occurring on developing fruit soil applied treatments and prevention by cultural practices are generally preferred over sprays chelated calcium solutions also provide an excellent source of calcium improve drainage by adding gypsum compost water early in the day give plants room so they don't stay wet fluctuations in soil moisture during periods of rapid plant growth create moisture stress and limits calcium distribution to the fruit make sure the plants are getting at least and inch of water per week windy conditions coupled with low relative humidity can cause high transpiration rates that can induce blossom end rot if plants were planted too early while the soil was still cold their first fruits are likely to be affected by blossom end rot fortunately by the time a second set of tomatoes begins developing your plants will have expanded and developed a root system capable of gathering and delivering calcium to the newly formed tomatoes good luck hope this helps Carnivorous plant Soil pH Houseplant Desert Fertilizer Thermal power station Irrigation Global warming and agriculture Soil Carbon dioxide Vermicompost Sewage treatment Agriculture Tomato Compost Hydroponics Vitamin C Eutrophication Gypsy moth Comfrey Psoriasis Weathering Sugar beet Garden Strawberry Tooth Sorghum Explosive material Water Portland cement Gas metal arc welding Extreme Programming Hemp Desertification Pachypodium Cannabis cultivation Urinary incontinence Vegetation Tofu Soil life Earthworm Weed control Milk Twelve leverage points Plant Cheese Lake Fire fighting Green Revolution Organic farming Hamster Banana Drainage Equine conformation Osteoporosis Shifting cultivation Fecal incontinence Bonsai Acid rain Seismic retrofit Hardpan Nutrient Iron Sulfur DDT Inflation Coffee Olive Jet engine Fusion power Asthma Peach Caliche Battery (electricity) Legionellosis Ecology Mulch Soil salination Air conditioning Insulin Transformer Black pepper Prostate cancer Wind power Organic horticulture Phytophthora infestans Corrosion Hypoglycemia Cancer Dune
