are daffodils self unfruitful i searched google and i've read a lot of comments people made about daffodils people like to cross pollinate daffodils but i am wondering is it possible for one daffodil flower to self pollinate is it self unfruitful some of the wild species are most you see are cultivars and i don't think they are self pollinating and it's a moot point anyway because if you want more of the same daffodil it's by far faster to just let it reproduce through the multiplying of the bulbs and then you get clones you know what kind of flower the new bulblet will produce i doubt anyone would bother even seeing if cultivars are self pollinating a waste of time since there's a far far better and faster and more reliable way to make more daffodils if you want to make new different daffodils they have to be carefully cross pollinated to produce new species then you have to wait a gazillion years okay more like twelve before the resulting seed grows big enough to form a bulb and then a flower to even know what the heck you just spent years growing breeders will oten toss the majority of what they produce keeping only the good ones which are few and far between Daffodil Apple Cultivar Pollination Fruit Flower Tulip Flowering plant Plant breeding Rambutan Insect Malus Watermelon Olive Fruit tree propagation Pollinator decline Fig Rose Cannabis cultivation Peanut Cucumber Weed control Snowdrop Species Orchidaceae F1 hybrid Agriculture Rice Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Pollination management Tomato Pollen Sunflower Banana Pumpkin Iris (plant) Date Palm Daylily Cannabis sativa Houseplant Pawpaw Fennel Blackberry Reproduction Garden Strawberry Giant Sequoia Gloucester County, Virginia Pollinator Alfalfa Plant Lilac Bee Banksia Mango Light pollution Fuchsia Barley Vanilla Coffea arabica Flower album Plant sexuality Almond Charles Darwin Delphinium Horse Ginkgo Potato Onion Copihue Cyclamen Cloning Gladiolus European Beech Garlic Honey Common Hazel CPU design Sequoia Lilium Cherry Monarda Taxus Camellia Durian Honeybee Rapeseed Sexual reproduction Plum Computer On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Strawberry Orange (fruit) Sarracenia Discus (fish) Wheat Hamster Monocotyledon Saintpaulia Pansy
