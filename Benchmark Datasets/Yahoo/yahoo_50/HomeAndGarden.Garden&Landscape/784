quesion about orchids i bought an orchid a few months ago but about a month ago all the flowers fell off it i still have it now but i wondering if they flower more than once is there any point in hanging on to it til next flowering or should i just throw it out and buy a new one orchids are my favourite flowers i think they are so beautiful so i was disappointed about losing its flowers what should i do with it now most orchids have a foliage growing phase and a leaf growing phase your orchid should grow a leaf then be ready for another flower if its a phalaenopsis it will need cooler night temperatures and the shortening of day length try putting it in a location where you get cooler nights but not too cold below f should do the trick orchids are perhaps the most beautiful house plants one can have they certainly make a great conversation piece have fun and good luck Orchidaceae Flowering plant Vanda Darwin from Orchids to Variation Dendrobium Leaf Cymbidium Autumn The Amber Spyglass Cypripedium Chinese calendar Houseplant Laelia Peacock orchid Flower National emblem Pansy Phragmipedium Bamboo Sweet potato The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Eucalyptus Garden Strawberry Christmas tree Coffea arabica Vanilla (orchid) Sage Vanilla Tomato Wood carving Perfume Coelogyne Charles Darwin Mahjong Pinophyta Customs and etiquette of Japan Capercaillie Dendrochilum Hippeastrum Apple Diving suit Potato The Ashlee Simpson Show Pruning fruit trees Pea Apricot Masdevallia Monocotyledon Time Out of Mind Paphiopedilum Pollination Ragweed Hemp Dactylorhiza Hop (plant) Pachypodium baronii Spinach Pachypodium brevicaule Tung Chung Autonomous building Maxillaria Perennial plant Pachypodium ambongense Aladdin (1992 film) Malus Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Frankie Laine Climate of the United Kingdom Desert Temperature Plant Hashish Koala Geography of Afghanistan Smilax Animal Crossing Coriander Stamen Rose Cattleya Air conditioning Johannes Jacobus Smith Thermoregulation Ophrys Dracula orchid Wild Orchid (band) Bauhinia blakeana Disa (orchid) Bladderwort Black Orchid (Doctor Who) Bonfires of Saint John Peltier-Seebeck effect Craps Banana Cruising (maritime) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Overclocking Alkane Gooseberry
