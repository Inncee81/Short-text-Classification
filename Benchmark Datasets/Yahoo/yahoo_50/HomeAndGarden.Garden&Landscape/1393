how do i get chile pepper seeds to sprout first of all fresh seeds work better what i would do is soak the seeds in distilled water for hours then take a ziplock bag and fill it about halfway with moist dirt not too wet just slightly moist you won't need fertilizer for this so you could purchase topsoil it's cheaper or you can try the kind of soil that is packaged just for seed bulb starting mix in your seeds with the bag of dirt and seal the bag then you can simply place the bag on top of your fridge or some other place where it stays consistently warm pretty much i've found the top of the fridge to work very well as it is out of the way and the fridge puts off plenty of heat then has a green house effect on the seeds it makes it very humid in the bag because the moisture can't escape unless you open the bag you can keep a check on the seeds every so often after you notice the seeds germinating you can then remove them from the bag and plant them you obviously won't need any light source until the germinated seeds actually sprout when you plant them find a better soil than the topsoil used for germinating good luck Stratification (botany) San Pedro cactus Tobacco Houseplant Cannabis cultivation Orchidaceae Tofu Black pepper Jute Coffee Acorn Onion Soil Bong Tea Illegal drug trade Germination Water Hemp Vermicompost Rice Carnivorous plant Mattress Flowering plant Desert Common bean Solar power Weed control Textile manufacturing Compost Garden Strawberry Hydroponics Sprouting Pine Weed Coconut Bread Peanut Refrigerator Apple Mulch Diving suit Garlic Idli Lighting Campfire Flax Johnny Appleseed Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Dialysis Mercury Atlas 6 Air conditioning Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Incandescent light bulb Nitrogen Barley Venus Flytrap Soil life Nepenthes Plant Chile pepper Water purification Wood Hippeastrum Okra Hamster Sleeping bag Potato Perfume Glossary of wildland fire terms Alfalfa Ocean thermal energy conversion Chlorophyta Eucalyptus Sunflower Dry cleaning Humidity Gypsy moth Date Palm Autonomous building Fossil fuel power plant Rum Wine making Cheese Weather lore Natural building Organic food Beer European Beech Fruit Hydrogen economy Norman Borlaug Poker jargon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME
