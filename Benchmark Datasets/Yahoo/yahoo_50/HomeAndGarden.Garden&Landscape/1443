why do zucchini blossoms fall off rather than produce a mid summer heat wave high day and night time temperatures will cause plant stress the tiny pollinated fruit may abort as a result extreme temperatures during flowering below degrees or above degrees can reduce fruit set a heat wave can also deter bees from their job making hand pollination more important at the bottom of the blossom of a female is a tiny vegetable or fruit ovary if the blossom is male there is nothing there pollination will be more successful if several male flowers are used to pollinate one female flower pollination needs to be made to all segments of the female flower do this before a m because pollination carried out at the end of the morning during warm weather has very little chance of success because the pollen will have heated up and fermented and will no longer be viable make sure you don't water overhead early in the morning so the male flowers can have a chance to pollinate the female flowers male flowers are short lived they will open up before dawn and will close completely by mid morning the male flowers possess both pollen and nectar the female flowers only nectar if the plants are watered from overhead early in the day that may prevent all further pollination for that day everything gets washed off of the short lived male flowers replacement flowers do not open then until the following morning too much shade or not enough light is another cause of poor fruit set most fruiting vegetables do best in full sun all day they need at least to hours of sunlight other factors such as too much nitrogen can delay the setting of fruit on the vine good luck hope this helps Rambutan Flower Honey Fruit Apple Pollinator Carnivorous plant Ecology Orchidaceae Flowering plant Pollen Vanilla Solar power Bee Pollination management Watermelon Blackberry Cannabis cultivation Pumpkin Pollen source Fruit tree pollination Pollinator decline Plant Insect Pachypodium baronii Greenhouse Plant sexuality Zucchini Malus Brewery Global warming and agriculture Fruit tree propagation Kiwifruit Passion flower Kudzu Houseplant Carbon dioxide Date Palm Passive solar Renewable energy Energy development Venus Almond Top-bar hive Peach Sun Gypsy moth Japanese tea ceremony Fertilisation Vitamin C Customs and etiquette of Japan Sorghum Carpenter bee Grafting Honeybee Plum Peanut Megabat Global climate model Asteraceae Thermoregulation Beekeeping Prostate cancer Hummingbird Ovary Banana Pachypodium brevicaule Rapeseed Weather lore Climate of the Alps Worker bee Fusion power Mercury (planet) Climate change Compost Alder Sunflower Autonomous building Climate of the United Kingdom Biological pest control Incandescent light bulb Capercaillie Explosive material Bladderwort Alfalfa Carburetor Welding Leaf Pysanka Banksia
