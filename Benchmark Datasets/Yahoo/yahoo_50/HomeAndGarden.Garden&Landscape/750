how can you tell if a eggplant is ready to be harvested allready pulled one off today it was not easy it took some pulling and tugging but finally got it to come off hi you can harvest at any size some people me included like to eat them small when the seeds haven't formed yet this is a great approach if you have a lot of epplant growing otherwise you will get a huge crop and not know what to do with it all you can also look at the shape size depending on the variety you are growing japanese millionaire type should be thin the regular type should be shiny purple if it is soft it is too late how hard it is to pull off is not an indicator of ripeness they are all a pain to pull off i would recommend cutting them because if you pull you can break a whole brance of the plant off very easily good luck Textile manufacturing Potato Hemp Illegal drug trade Flax Tobacco Common bean Watermelon Knife Jute Alfalfa Drill bit Sugar beet Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Date Palm Apple Wheat Fast bowling Fruit Loganberry Equine conformation Wood Acorn Pottery Turnip (brassica rapa) Durian Peanut Anchor Eggplant Mattress Cereal Maize Bamboo Pine Fecal incontinence Pineapple Sugarcane Domestic rabbit Banana Skateboarding trick Bean Agricultural machinery Cannabis cultivation Globe artichoke Japanese tea ceremony Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garden Strawberry Oat Fruit tree propagation Vicia faba Netsuke Livestock Frogman Pea Green Revolution Axe Seed Tofu Agriculture Coconut crab Frugivore Food Comfrey Kitesurfing Sowing Fancy rat Irrigation Garlic RuneScape skills Taro Wine Weight training Vegetarianism Stomach cancer Mango Coffea arabica Peach Carnivorous plant Cheese Barley BS 1363 Combine harvester Ramen Prostate cancer Pumpkin Breastfeeding Panama Canal Locks Stage lighting Tlingit Orchidaceae Tomato Strap-on dildo Domesticated turkey Radio controlled airplane Cuisine of Brazil Tooth Monsanto Coffea
