transplanting rasberries how much of the root do you need to dig up hi to be really successful i would wait until the end of the season when the plants die back and then trim the tops of the canes off as low as possible first then you can dig them up and replant them either in the fall or spring while they are still dormant if you do it int he summer you won't have much luck from my experience to do the actual transplant i used a pitchform to loosten and then pulled they were bareroot for a few days until i planted them and i had about success this way good luck Bamboo Cyatheales Troms__ I.L.
