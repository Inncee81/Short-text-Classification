lawn care service me and my friend are both and we are planning to start doing lawn care for people in out town what should we charge them for cuts and stuff give me lots of answers i run a pretty large lawn care company we mow about million square feet a week we give a set price per mow but we try to get per man hour with a minimum charge of so if the lawn would take people hour to complete it should be but we would probably make it to give us a little room for things that might make it take longer also we mow every week if the customer demands every weeks then we charge more per mow because the grass will be longer when we cut it you have to decide what you need to get per hour to cover your costs your costs are things like gas for the mower oil changes for the mower gas for the string trimmer paying some one to help you don't forget that if you bag the clippings you need to get rid of them somewhere you probably should be charging less than i do because your costs will be lower and per hour you will get less work done because you don't have professional equipment that mows acres per hour our customers are ok paying for an hour because we can mow acres in that time because we have fast mowers and we are good at what we do nobody can really tell you what to charge you have to figure that out my opinion is that you should feel pretty good if you can put dollars per hour in your pocket at years old that's pretty good money if the lawn will take people hour than should cover costs and give you each to pocket don't be afraid to make a company bank account to put away some money to cover repairs and gas and oil if there is any money left over at the end of the year you guys can split it keep track of the hours you spend on each lawn each week and what you get paid and you can figure out what you are making per hour on each lawn use that info to raise the price on the lawns that earn you less money per hour have fun and feel good about having your own business you are in control don't let customers make you do what you don't want to just say that's not something we do i think i know someone who does that peace Wal-Mart Health insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Poker jargon Tennis Mutual fund Sears Holdings Corporation Mower Lawn Wall Street Tax Warren Buffett Value added tax Tractor Economy of the United States Bank Wheel of Fortune The Lawnmower Man Social rule Natural monopoly Deflation (economics) Insurance Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Cruising (maritime) Inflation Eric Bischoff Monopoly The Apprentice 2 MMORPG Internet fraud Minimum wage Enron Corporation Privatization PE ratio National Kidney Foundation Singapore Donald Trump Opportunity cost Dead Putting Society U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Publicly funded medicine The Adventures of Pete & Pete Health care in the United States Ra (board game) Extreme Programming The Amazing Race Solar power FairTax Filling station Capital accumulation Arthur Laffer Call centre Business process reengineering McMansion Price discrimination Common Agricultural Policy Bond Citigroup Baseball Outsourcing Emergency preparedness Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Motor oil Tesco Nuclear power phase-out Economy of the Republic of Ireland Sampling (music) Supply and demand Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Nine Inch Nails Progressive tax Beltway sniper attacks Hay Internal ballistics Port Authority Trans-Hudson Caddy Economic inequality Graduate school Avenue Q ITunes Music Store Short selling Health savings account Campaign finance reform $ale of the Century Big Brother UK series 6 1973 oil crisis The Emancipation of Mimi Keynesian economics
