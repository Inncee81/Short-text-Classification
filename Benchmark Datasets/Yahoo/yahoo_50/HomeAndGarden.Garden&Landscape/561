low voltage lighting transformer location i asked this question a week or so ago and think i may have confused folks all of these power packs state for outdoor installation only i called malibu technical service and all she told me was that it was the ul code more simply put does anyone know of a concern if i mount and plug in my transformer in my basement and run the low voltage wiring through a small hole to the outside for my outdoor ground lighting hope that's clearer thanks for any thoughts i have mine mounted in a garage i've had several mounted outside and the connections corrode away after a couple of years so i got a little smarter this time they do get a little hot so just make sure you don't have a leaky propane bottle or open container of gasoline or your meth lab right next to it Spark plug Thermostat Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transistor Transformer Three-phase electric power Fuse (electrical) Circuit breaker Alternating current Electrical wiring (UK) Tesla coil Electrical generator Hydrogen economy Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Relay Antenna (radio) High-voltage direct current Thermal power station Circuit design Electrical wiring Residual-current device Electric power transmission Elevator Carburetor Vacuum tube Split phase TGV Portable stove Electricity meter Oscilloscope Solar cell Power line communication Seismic retrofit Resistor Fusor National Electrical Code (US) Bicycle lighting Earthing system Battery (electricity) Energy development Hybrid vehicle Diode Ground and neutral Lineman (occupation) Motor oil Modem Electricity distribution Impedance matching Hot air balloon Electrophysiology Light-emitting diode Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Gas metal arc welding Welding Incandescent light bulb Capacitor Universal Serial Bus Maxwell's equations Laptop MOSFET Overhead lines Reading spark plugs for racing Impedance Hall effect Barbecue USB flash drive X10 (industry standard) Kitchen Operational amplifier Switch Moonshine High-voltage hazards Battery electric vehicle Electrician Internal combustion engine Directed-energy weapon Spark gap Lighting Illegal drug trade Fluorescent lamp Tire Wind turbine Electroshock gun Wardenclyffe Tower Electric power Siphon Copy protection TRS connector Radio controlled airplane Volt Fire Entropy Christmas lights Hybrid Synergy Drive Naval mine The Apprentice 2 Pebble bed reactor Membrane potential Sinclair ZX81 SCART
