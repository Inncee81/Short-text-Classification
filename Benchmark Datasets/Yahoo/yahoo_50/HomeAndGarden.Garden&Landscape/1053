how many lettuce seeds should i sow in one container do i put just one seed or scatter a lot the lettuce is called buttercrunch bibb the seeds are also very small like bird seeds i just don't know if one seed will sprout a whole head of lettuce or if i am supposed to put more seeds in one pot thanks i would place about a dozen seeds around in a pattern that spaces them out once the plants sprout when they have leaves thin out half of the seedlings taking every other one by clipping with scissors at ground level so the spacing remains nice and even and you do not disturb the soil use the thinnings in salad this is why you planted so many you get to sample them early let them grow more until the leaves touch the other seedlings then thin them to plants spaced around the pot use these larger thinnings in another salad yum let the remaining grow and you can cut them one at a time as the pot looks crowded leaving then to grow to full size this is a container version of intensive gardening it gives you several cuttings of lettuce and still lets the final head grow without crowding as you clip off the competition every time it gets crowded in the pot Lettuce Seed Hydroponics Fruit tree propagation Hamster Tobacco Garden Strawberry Carnivorous plant Pine Coast Douglas-fir Tea Textile manufacturing Avocado Giant Sequoia Flax Alfalfa Banksia Brewery Pinophyta Sunflower Hemp Pea Sugar beet Japanese tea ceremony Compost Sprouting Apricot Betting (poker) Potato Leaf Rapunzel Flowering plant Ginkgo Orchidaceae Johnny Appleseed Coconut Logging Celery Comfrey Tree Kudzu Snooker Turnip (brassica rapa) Sonchus Dandelion Bonsai Sequoia Plant Germination Jute Coriander Onion Cannabis cultivation Professional wrestling throws Hyssop Cuscuta Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Gypsy moth Mandrake (plant) Hamburger Weed Watermelon San Pedro cactus Peanut Cannabis (drug) Glossary of American football Houseplant Pikmin Pachypodium baronii Photosynthesis Illegal drug trade Mulch Vermicompost Bladderwort Dim sum Conifer cones Sowing Draw poker Knife Christmas tree Chicken Wisteria Root Irrigation Cheating in poker Professional wrestling holds Quicksort Bamboo Sorghum Apple Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Escherichia coli O157:H7 Soil pH Poker jargon Common bean Agriculture
