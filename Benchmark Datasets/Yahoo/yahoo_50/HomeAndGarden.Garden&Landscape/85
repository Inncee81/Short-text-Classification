calling all garden pros i have a lilac bush that i planted about months ago it looked like it died about a week after i planted it it never bloomed looks sad but not completely done do they come back did i plant it at a bad time is there anything i can do to bring it back tell me all you know please first make sure you took it out of the pot i know but it's like the did you plug it in question when people have computer problems and i have seen this happen second look for animal damage i'm trying to resurrect a lilac that a chipmunk tunneled under roots don't grow well in air third how did you plant it shrubs should have a hole dug that's about twice the size of the pot in that hole you should mix some good soil some compost or peat moss some organic fertilizer then pour some water in wait until the water is all absorbed then plant your plant filling the hole around the plant with more of the soil peat or compost mix press the soil down well around the roots i actually tromp it down with shrubs take the rest of the soil that was in the hole and make a raised ring around the now filled hole this makes a little basin that you can fill with water put a layer of mulch over the soil in the basin for the first few months of the shrub's life especially for the first month and the dry months of july august keep the shrub watered by deeply watering it at least twice a week perhaps every other day in the dry months fill the basin with water a shrub will take an entire large watering can of water or use the hose to fill the basin if the water doesn't absorb then you might have clay soil or be planting in a soil so hard and rocky that water can't absorb in this case you need to dig an even bigger hole like times the size of the pot or more or the roots will not thrive fill the bigger hole with the soil plus peat compost mix until it's back to twice the size of the pot then continue Irrigation Compost Hydroponics Vermicompost Soil Fertilizer Weed control Desert Lake Wood Carnivorous plant Tea Earthworm Soil pH Peat Biodynamic agriculture Mulch Pachypodium Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Moss Desertification Sewage treatment Dairy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Flowering plant Bog Soil life Stratification (botany) Seismic retrofit Composting toilet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Deforestation Organic farming Casting Carbon dioxide Plant Coffee Gypsy moth Christmas tree Tobacco No-dig gardening Drainage Ecology Deluge (mythology) The Fens Geology of the Moon Mount Pinatubo Weed Sorghum Sphagnum Fruit tree propagation Root Betting (poker) Begonia Hamster Textile manufacturing Agriculture Gardening Pottery Zuiderzee Works Legionellosis Physiological plant disorders Cannabis cultivation Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Shrub Hardpan Campfire Pile Organic gardening Elis Prefecture Erie Canal Fire fighting Rocky Mountains Lilac Tillandsia Rainforest Yerba mate Plough Pea Photosynthesis Piccolo Junior Saga Rose Caatinga Pachypodium habitats Chernobyl accident Brewery
