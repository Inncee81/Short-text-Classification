i have a huge play area full of weeds no time or ability to weed what do i do the previous owners didn't put plastic or weed barrier fabric under and now there's weeds everywhere i am completely overwhelmed it looks terrible what do i do i have several young children and it's very hard to find the time or energy to do it i already have so much on my plate none of the yardwork will get done unless i do it i need a solution to get rid of large areas of weeds quickly and in a cost effective way and to keep them away i don't want to have to hire help if possible it's such a big job i can see someone charging inordinate amounts of money is there a quick effective way for me to get rid of them myself there are woodchips in the play area too which complicates it a little the weeds are getting really embarrassing sounds like you have yourself a pickle of a situation perhaps you could make it a game and get the kids to help you with the smaller ones see if you can get the whole root out yeahhh that could be fun the one who gets the most with a whole root is the winner you could add the botanical aspect of the exercise by explaining roots and leaves and seeds and proliferation and how to make mummy really happy ok just brainstorming here get hubby family friends to do it or atleast help fence off the area and use roundup as horrid as that stuff is and hopefully you will choose not to go that route but it is fast and effective set a goal of a very small section at a time each day so you will feel some sense of accomplishment focussing on a small section will help with the overwhelmed feeling you are experiencing get some landscape plastic and cover the entire area with it followed by new bark mulch this is immediate and effective but not the longterm solution pave it over have it all dug out line with thick plastic and add sea sand the salt in the sea sand will inhibit germination of weeds and be a lovely base for your playground area dig up all bark mulch and weeds add new soil layer and sod over weed and feed as necessary or just mow the works down and keep a grassy area there instead although you wish to have an inexpensive solution it would appear to me that the best solution is to have it done and then you'll be starting from scratch and better able to maintain it so it does not get so out of hand i'll add more if i think of more ideas but methinks there's really no way to get around it weeds are the nemesis of many people and there's a good reason why good luck Weed control Weed Comfrey Baseball Poker jargon Electrophysiology Mulch Animal Crossing Organic farming Illegal drug trade Anchor Wood Sewage treatment Irrigation Volleyball Bamboo RISC Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Second Battle of the Atlantic Zuiderzee Works M16 (rifle) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct Tag CPU design Seismic retrofit Pottery Hamster The Apprentice 2 Tai Chi Chuan Glass Solar cell Dog agility Internal ballistics Microeconomics Cannabis cultivation Betting (poker) Tobacco Welding Vermicompost RuneScape quests Mao (game) Extreme Programming President (game) Opportunity rover Plough No-dig gardening Sugar beet Campfire Casting Scrooge McDuck Carl Barks Objective-C Hydroponics Tank The Amazing Race Terminal ballistics Craps Agriculture Halo: Combat Evolved Drill bit Textile manufacturing Botany Sea-Monkey Invasive species Vegetation Seed Broom (shrub) Wind turbine Computer Theodicy Gramophone record Handloading Drainage Action potential Kudzu Chatsworth House Transactional analysis Flowering plant Public domain Credit card Jute Agricultural machinery Lawn Don Rosa Brewery
