why do people keep moving my lawn gnomes at first i thought i was going crazy becuase i would have my garden gnomes you know those little elf like things you put in your yard standing in one place and then when i come back they are moved somewhere totally different and sometimes would change positions so i set up my camera and guess what i saw people would just walk by and see them and just move them to some random places in my yard and it happens like every day and it's never the same people and then i saw my neighbor do it except he got a different one wearing the same clothes and same color and everything but in a different pose and he would just switch them so when i saw it i almost even started going to therapy why are they doing this it's irritating the mess out of me the garden gnome liberation front http en wikipedia org wiki garden gnome liberation front is dedicated to freeing unjustly imprisoned garden gnomes your neighbors may not be members but many people cannot resist moving the gnomes around it's been a fad for several years hopefully no one is actually stealing the gnomes read more about it at http www freethegnomes com unless you want to confront people or charge them with trespassing you may have to view the situation humorously even if you put the gnomes in the ground with a spike that may not stop some of the gnome movers i know it's irritating but they're not doing it to irritate or upset you they think it's funny short of legal action or a sign saying keep off the gnomes you may have to grow a slightly bizarre sense of humor to live through this one Gnome RuneScape quests Invader Zim GNOME IPod Whose Line Is It Anyway?
