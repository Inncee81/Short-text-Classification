is there any safe organic or non toxic way to kill grass fast i have a month old son and two dogs that use my lawn everyday but i have lost something very valuable in it and need to find it fast any ideas if it is metal get a metal detector i wouldn't kill the grass though cause in the time it takes to kill it someone will have stomped it into the ground try cutting it really short with one of those rotary mowers that way it won't go flying and get chopped up like with a motorized mower if you really must kill it though just fill our yard sprayer with white vinegar and go spray happy it should completely die in a few day in about a month you can even lay down turf grass without any lingering effects Lawn mower Herbicide Lawn Golf Weed control Combine harvester The Lawnmower Man Super Mario Bros. 3 Pollinator decline Mercury (element) Crop circle Autonomous robot Motor oil Pok__mon types Steam engine Blood (computer game) Unreal Sonic the Hedgehog Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Coachella Valley Indianapolis 500 Shaggy dog story Ultraviolet Omega-3 fatty acid Thermal power station Terran (StarCraft) Africanized bee Ultimate (sport) Fast bowling Pikmin Jackass: The Movie Lechaina Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Christmas tree Waste management Silver Dog agility The Championships, Wimbledon Aerial firefighting Tick Autonomous building Rigging Professional wrestling attacks Kodocha Softball Happy Tree Friends Fire extinguisher Cricket Avalanche Professional wrestling aerial techniques Table tennis Galileo spacecraft Internal combustion engine Sod String trimmer Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Drill bit Airport Artificial turf Beltway sniper attacks Agrostis Arsenic Casting Ice resurfacer Air safety Tennis Drainage Land mine Naval mine McMansion Tractor USS Wadsworth (DD-516) The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Genetic engineering Capercaillie Copper Shen Gong Wu Vinegar Transmission (mechanics) Farthing (coin) Timeline of invention Overkill (band) Pok__mon Abilities Eldfell Days of our Lives Breathing gas The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Vermicompost Hay The Adventures of Pete & Pete Battle of the Somme (1916) Briggs & Stratton Three Stooges Silage Second Battle of the Atlantic Knife
