xbox disk so okay i just bot a rferbished xbox and a used halo disk i was playing the game saved shut down the consol but when i went to play it again half hour or so latter it said that the xbox did not recognize the cd and to check to make sure the sisk was not damaged sure enough when i checked the disk it had a milimeter crack at the edge of the disk my question is this could this be caused by the xbox itself or did i just get unlucky and get a crappy disk was playing it for hours before i shut it down im assuming your talking about original xbox if so then your problem is simple most of the original xbox's come stock with a thompson dvd drive which just plain suck they break very easily and often give disc read errors your disc is dirty or damaged the mm crack you wrote about could possibly be the problem but if you already played the game with no problems then i'd bet its the drive if you want to replace it its very easy about seven screws and you can buy a samsung dvd drive for xbox off ebay for around Xbox DVD Modchip Floppy disk Hard disk PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Copy protection Blu-ray Disc Halo 2 Poker jargon Xbox Live Halo: Combat Evolved Commodore 64 Redundant array of independent disks Computer and video games Universal Serial Bus Data recovery Amstrad CPC Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic ZX Spectrum MAME Rare (video game company) Nintendo Entertainment System Steam (content delivery) Sega Dreamcast Blue screen of death Compact disc Computer forensics Nintendo GameCube GunBound Atari ST Embedded system Karaoke Disc brake Commodore 1541 Sega Saturn Action Replay The Sims 2 DVD-RAM CD-ROM Cache Atari 8-bit family Video game music Halo (video game series) Machinima The Amazing Race Unreal series Regional lockout Oscilloscope Apple II family Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Timeline of computing 1990-forward Famicom Disk System Game controller Atari Electronic Arts Nintendo Revolution Computer virus Disk image IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Warez ROM image True Crime: Streets of LA PlayStation Portable USB flash drive Disk storage Draw poker Nintendo Carburetor Nine Inch Nails Grand Theft Auto III History of operating systems 2004 World Series Enterprise content management Computer chess Debugging IBook System/36 Goatse.cx Video game console Screw Dead or Alive (video game) Sega Game programmer Microsoft Digital rights management Visual Basic Computer and video game packaging Read-only memory History of computer and video games IPod Computer bus
