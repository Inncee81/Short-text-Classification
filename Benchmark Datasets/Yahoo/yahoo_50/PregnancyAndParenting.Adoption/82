nd part to my last post on sending adopted kids back i have given these kids everything they lack nothing not even the love from me but they still like to make my life miserable there has been countless arguments w my husband over them which ppl think im stupid for standing up to my husband over them they have received yrs of therapy and i think even their own phyciatrist is getting frustrated b c every med he prescribes they become immune to after a few weeks when they become upset usually b c they are not given their ways they destroy everything in sight i have a son with epilepsy also adopted and everytime they throw a fit and hes around they hit him on the head so he can have seizures b c they know it rages me also if i piss them off in the am before school they will go to school and make stuff up to get me in trouble something they learned from the system they will pretend like i beat them or something i know them better than anyone and ppl act like they are crazy but i call them brats b c i know thats exactly what they are they are not crazy they are actually very smart ppl i know you think i am such a bad person but when dealing with these kids you eventually hit a dead end something i learned by hard and hope my family can forgive me for b c of my stubborness thinking my love for them would get them through it all richelle no i didnt adopt them to make myself look good as a matter of fact everyone dislikes them including teachers and day care workers they were all hoping i would send them back instead of adopting so they wouldnt have to see them anymore but i didnt have the heart to do so so what are you saying do you want me to hit them ive tried praising them rewarding them using sticker chart in which they tear up in rage when they are mad when they are bad i give them time outs or take away toys and priviledges nothing works nothing apprehended hit the nail on the head shes right work on rebuilding your family that is who god holds you responsible for you cant fix the system its too messed up you tried now its o k to say you cant do it anymore i want to adopt but i will not let anything threaten my marriage of my other four children so i would never do foster care my neice fostered two teen girls and it was a nightmare some bad parenting and mostly the system screwed up these kids and then you get dumped with these traumatized kids that need some healing and some real disapline disapline is gone replaced by medication even a dog deserves to be disaplined when i quitt homeschooling i fealt like a failure but sometimes its ok to say i have had enough its smart that you know your limits think about kids in the olden days they would have appreciated what you were trying to do for them not today you cant fix this its bigger than you give it to god move on and put your little family first Kodocha Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Traumatic brain injury One Tree Hill (TV series) Dead Like Me Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Beavis and Butt-head Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Laura Schlessinger Shawn Michaels Cliff Richard Miss Saigon KaBlam!
