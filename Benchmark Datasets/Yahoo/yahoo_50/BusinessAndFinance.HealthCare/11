is ukranian wife a real rn hi my son recently married a girl from the ukraine she said she is a registered nurse and her name is on the california list of rn's here is my question is it possible for this person to be spervisor or director of nursing without ever having taken an anatomy class she admits this because my daughter was taking a class and she couldn't answer any questions in my daughters book and also when i asked her what my son'd blook pressure was she stumbled a bit then said over my son and her have been together for less than a year and she is leaving her job to follow here to follow her boss who is moving to sacramento hours away my son will need to quit his job and move she refuses to work for anyone but this one person i always thought it was very difficult to pass the rn exam in california hours of testing etc she is currently working in a convelescent hospital any input on whether it is possible to be what she says she is would be helpful thanks my concern is not them moving away as we are moving even further away in sept my concern is the marriage being built on dishonesty the straw that broke the camels back was the fact that in order to continue working in her industry she insisted on following her boss and the fact that this decision has to made and completed by the end of august seems like a a situation with no time think i am sure it would be a simple matter to check out her claim that she is listed in california rn listing ask her to show you proof of her credentials certificates awards degrees etc like you i find it a little incredulous that a rn would not know simple anatomy and give weird answers on blood pressure maybe you just have to snoop around a little there are such schemes as marrying to get into the us and then once the lady has her green card she dumps the guy and sues him for his assets alimony etc Knots Landing Friends Expert system GED Consensus decision-making St. Elmo's Fire (film) Divorce Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Complexity classes P and NP Jaime Escalante Neighbours Marilyn Monroe Graduate school Days of our Lives Driver's license Notary public Stomach cancer Legal aspects of transsexualism Grade (education) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Halting problem Code: Lyoko Avenue Q Education in Portugal Humphrey Bogart Seinfeld Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Romania Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dead Like Me Whose Line Is It Anyway?
