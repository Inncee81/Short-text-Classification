if you got fired from a job is it a good idea to list that job on your resume i worked there for a year and a half just wondering if it's ethical to list the job this is a tough one a lot of big companies will only verify that someone was employed or not some might offer if the employee left in good standing or not but companies tend to be afraid of liability so they will not offer details at all find out what your company's policy is heck you might even try calling as if you were a potential employer to see what they say or offer when asked about your status and standing with the company i'm calling to verify employment for so and so i have here that she worked from start date to end date did she leave in good standing with the company may we ask why her employment ended with you those answers will give you an idea about how you will handle this having a gap of years on your resume could do damage so you really want to know if they will only verify employment or if they give some information if you do list the job you must be truthful about why you left you can find a way to put the most positive professional spin on it my leadership at company a and i could not come to an agreement on how duty should be performed and in the end it was better if we parted ways my employment was terminated i learned so much from the experience and would do such and thus differently you can't bad mouth the leadership or the company it must be discussed very professionally and what you got from the experience for sure don't list a supervisor unless they can give you a positive reference i can't believe how many people list references that don't actually have anything positive to say about the former employee if the company is gabby about why you were let go you might look into hr laws in your state there tends to be legal limitations on what they are allowed to discuss and if your former company is crossing those boundaries then you have some action you can take after all of this i think it would probably be worth your time and money to work with a career counselor dbm is someone i've worked with in the past and found to be tremendously helpful they aren't cheap but this is your career you are talking about here Plame affair Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ethics Mediation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Annuity Graduate school Business ethics Civil rights Corporate governance Call centre Outsourcing Unemployment Software engineering Life insurance Goodness and value theory Contract Steve Jobs Poker jargon Insurance Milton H.
