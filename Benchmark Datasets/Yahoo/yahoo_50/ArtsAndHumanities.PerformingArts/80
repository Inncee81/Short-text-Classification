am i too old to be moving into a new and creative industry i am and about to move into the health pathway my dream is to work in theatre act dance sing and be creative however unlike most i am not bothered about fame i have no experience in this field and am not the best singer i am however very outgoing energetic creatively inspired and hate the thought of being unforfilled in a medical career am i too old to go to uni and do performing arts do i need a great voice help me wow we have a really refreshing bunch of idealists here no offence intendeded to them but unfortunately their answers are somewhat naieve i'm going on and i work in the performing arts so i think i have some perspective on this the short answer is that yes you are actually too old but please let me qualify that firstly and most importantly you should bear in mind that onoly an extreme minority of people working in the performing arts are making a career or even a living of it the chances are so slim that anyone who does it for that reason should have his or her head examined so your primary reason for getting into the performing arts should be sheer enjoyment and your own happiness and fulfillment and you're never too old to enjoy yourself and to make yourself feel happy and fulfilled so whatever else you read here please get yourself on stage and have a blast as for going to university for a degree remember that this will take at least four more years of your life in fact with performing arts degree programs it often takes more since people in these programs are often doing a full load of coursework while trying to gain professional experience at the same time so now you're over by the time you're done and you're looking for roles that suit someone of your age but the people who are casting people for those roles expect to be casting people in those roles who have eight or ten years or more i have students who started in musical theater and dance when they were in the single digits of age of experience playing younger roles already and those people are your competition so unless you bring something really special to the table you're going to have a tough row to hoe the advice i often give people going into the performing arts is that if you can avoid it don't do it as a career you invite the problem that your hobby your passion really get tied up in making your living most people experience dislike for their job at some point or another so performers often find themselves disliking something they should love also few activities are so tied up in your own sense of self as performing so there's a danger of finding yourself disliking yourself as they say the highs are incredibly high but the lows are incredibly low too if you can keep performing uninvolved with making a living it removes much of that danger but if you're dead set on it only if you feel performing is the only thing you can see yourself doing then you have to do it but if you can find something else you enjoy or at least something else you can tolerate to do for a living and get involved in some good community theater or something along those lines you're in for a healthier attitude about the whole thing edm Graduate school Theatre Avenue Q Education in the United States Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Software engineering Ethics Happiness Drama Infantilism Master's degree Tai Chi Chuan John Cage CPU cache Objectivist philosophy Jon Secada Poker jargon Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Little Britain Kylie Minogue Alexander Technique Prostate cancer The Star Wars Holiday Special Current teachings of Prem Rawat Altruism Social rule Cliff Richard Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Charmed Knots Landing Coercion Goodness and value theory Time Out of Mind About a Boy The nature of God in Western theology Ranma __ characters Education in the People's Republic of China Abortion debate Philosophy of language The Emancipation of Mimi Past teachings of Prem Rawat David Hume Michael J.
