ok i got a big guitar problem i broke my vibrato arm off in the bridge and i don't know how to get it out anyone know how to fix this other than replace the bridge whew that's rough man you have a few options though i'm going to assume we're talking about a strat style vibrato where the arm threads into a hole in a metal block under the bridge or at least something similar to that the easy way to explain what to do would be to send you to a hardware store and tell them you need to extract a screw they should be able to explain it to you but i'll go with it first off is any of the arm still protruding from the hole if so you can cut a slot in the top of it and use a flathead screwdriver to remove it you can use a hacksaw or metal file to cut the slot but a dremel tool with a cutoff wheel works best even if the arm is broken off flush with the bridge you might leave a mark on the surface of the bridge but you'll get the broken piece out if the arm is broken anywhere below the level of the surface of the bridge you'll need a screw extractor these are available at any hardware store you'll need a power drill using the bit that comes with the extractor drill a hole right down the middle of the broken arm as close to the center as possible the extractor itself will look something like a screw but with threads that go the wrong way and which are in much less tight of a spiral than the threads of a screw you put the extractor into the hole and turn it counterclockwise as if to loosen it since the threads on the extractor go the opposite way of the threads on a screw they tighten into the hole as you loosen the screw and the broken piece of the arm will come out as a last resort you can get a drill bit about the diameter of the arm itself and drill the whole thing out but then you'll have to find some way to re tap the hole to accept a standard arm and that will be tough you'd be better off just taking the thing apart and getting a new block for it you can get just the block without replacing the whole bridge but these things shouldn't be screwed in too tight so a screw extractor should do the trick if you're not confident with power tools around your guitar though take it to a shop good luck edm Metalworking Woodworking Wrench Tire Violin Floyd Rose Lathe Floppy disk Vise (tool) Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Knife Guitar Drill Drilling and threading Screw thread Reamer Casting Gramophone record Screwdriver Poker jargon Chuck (engineering) Glossary of firefighting equipment Tap wrench Glossary of climbing terms Upholstery Hydraulic machinery Professional wrestling throws Harmonica Chess strategy and tactics Table saw Clinker (boat building) Seismic retrofit CPU cache Zippo Piccolo Junior Saga Bong Clockwise and counterclockwise Machine tapers Kitchen Machine tool Anchor Timpani Aluminium Glossary of American football Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Professional wrestling holds Oscilloscope Compiler optimization Diving Textile manufacturing terminology STS-114 Electric guitar Glossary of partner dance terms Drill bit sizes Printed circuit board Diamond Redundant array of independent disks Incandescent light bulb Western concert flute Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bolted joint Cartridge (firearms) Rifle IPod Windows XP Brewery Equine conformation Nine Inch Nails Wood carving Terminal ballistics Figure skating Cello Amateur telescope making Saw Aerial (dance move) Atari 8-bit family Wire Disc brake Lathe (metal) Sail-plan Fender Stratocaster Motor oil Swingout Headlight Spark plug Plane (tool) Dodge Neon Springfield 1903 rifle Ethernet Rigging Lawn mower
