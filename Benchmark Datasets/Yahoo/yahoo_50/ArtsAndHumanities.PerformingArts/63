i have a problem when i play the piano no matter what i play especially scales my pinky finger curls up it puts a lot of stress on both of my hands the only thing that somewhat makes this stop are some of hanon's excercises but only after i play them for a long time i know that the th and th fingers share some of the same muscle groups too anybody have any ideas on how to overcome this problem the pinky curling is actually the result of tension not the cause this is a very common problem for students who are starting to play with greater velocity speed x power practicing scales slowly is a great habit and hanon exercises are also a great tool for building velocity and are the ones i like for developing fingers my guess is that the problem is more pronounced in the left hand try playing the exercises and scales with left hand alone when you feel the least bit of tension move your wrist down or up very slightly and then move it back again tension usually builds from the wrists being locked and subsequently transfers to the fingers don't practice with overly curved fingers or high wrists that is an antiquated technique that has caused more injury for players than it was ever worth as you sit at the piano let your arms and hands dangle relaxed and loose at your sides look at the shape and position of your hands it is completely relaxed and the perfect position for playing the piano just bend your elbows and keep that same relaxed position with your hands at the keys stay focused on letting the wrists move slightly through the musical phrase if the wrists are able to move the tension will release don't curl the fingers too much only slight relaxed curve bad bad bad keep the wrists level relaxed and supple Equine conformation Aikido Professional wrestling holds Harp Double bass Tai Chi Chuan Gesture Carpal tunnel syndrome Horizontal bar Violin Aerial (dance move) Hand Volleyball Repetitive strain injury Backstroke Professional wrestling throws Swingout Internal ballistics Diving Stuttering Urinary incontinence Wing Chun Native American music Fast bowling Archery Suplex Piano Menstrual cup Saxophone Swimming Music lesson Weight training Strike (attack) Tenshinhan Sling (weapon) Table tennis Punch (strike) Clarinet Milton H.
