where can i find cello music for grade five i mean good cello music not naff ones i get bored on the cello sometimes understatement and i know if i get fun pieces to play i will enjoy it more because thats what i did with the piano and it was fun thankyou i know what you mean i am bored on my cello right now too there's only so much fun you can have plowing through exercises and trying to figure out a bach cello suite on your own more like frustrating for me it will definitely help to find some new fun pieces i'm not sure if you mean you're in fifth grade or a grade five like a book five playing ability if you're at a book five playing ability a really fun piece is called danse rustique by w h squire it's energetic very fun another good one that i like is tarantella also by squire it might be a bit of a stretch there's a little scale in treble clef but actually like most music it is so much easier than it appears i would be willing to be that anything by squire is fun golterman's concerto no fun it looks a little scary because of the eighth rests but it's not it kind of bounces along it reminds me of a classical ice cream truck song also go to your local music store and see what they have to offer you might see something that sparks your interest there are usually arrangements of pop songs and movie music like star wars and lord of the rings if you like that kind of thing they usually come with a cd of orchestra accompaniment to play along with it which makes it even more interesting really the possibilities are endess it just depends on what you like to play although i have found that it's easier to find fun music for violin than it is for cello hope this helps have fun Cello Double bass Yo-Yo Ma Viola Violin Sonata (music) Concerto Witold Lutos__awski Igor Stravinsky Philip Glass Max Reger Timpani Johann Sebastian Bach Violin concerto Authentic performance Fugue Claude Debussy Heitor Villa-Lobos Niccol__ Paganini Clef Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra) Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) Brandenburg concertos Musical notation Steve Reich Maurice Ravel Trombone Sonata form Ralph Vaughan Williams Olivier Messiaen Anton Webern Dmitri Shostakovich Sinfonia concertante George Gershwin Piano trio George Crumb Violoncello concerto Sofia Gubaidulina Grammy Awards of 1998 Kurt Weill Schubert compositions D number 505-998 Suzuki method Pachelbel's Canon Figured bass B__la Bart__k Grammy Awards of 1995 Musical works of Mozart Bassoon Electric Light Orchestra Ren__ Leibowitz Mikis Theodorakis Symphony Mario Davidovsky Elliott Carter Grammy Awards of 1990 Elodie Lauten Zolt__n Kod__ly Lou Harrison Arvo P__rt Mauro Giuliani George Enescu Ladislav Kupkovi__ Benjamin Britten Johannes Brahms Transposing instrument Orchestra Klezmer Joseph Haydn Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Progressive rock Schubert compositions D number 1-504 Piano concerto Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance Krzysztof Penderecki Baroque music Program music Charles Wuorinen The Beach Boys P.
