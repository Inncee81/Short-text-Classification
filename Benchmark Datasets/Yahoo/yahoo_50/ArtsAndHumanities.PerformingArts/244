i'm suppose to drum hey i want to learn how to play the drums there is one problem i only have drum sticks is there anyway i can learn how to get some idea of playing without the whole set for a little while actually yeah if you can go to a music store and look at a drum set and see where each drum sits the snare is going to be important to know and then the kick drum but try to get a good idea of all of them then when you're sitting around listening to music just air drum and actually try to play along for example listen to the low drum the kick drum and move your foot along with the song as if you're playing i know it sounds kinda lame but i was told to do the same thing when i wanted to drum and it actually does work good luck Drum kit Bass drum Marching band Timpani Snare drum Highway 61 Revisited Drum She Loves You Hey Jude 2Step Empire Burlesque Therion (band) Blackfoot music House music Hip hop music Joy Division (band) Bouncy techno Timbaland The Beatles' influence Real Love (song) Marching percussion Blood on the Tracks Big band Percussion instrument Whose Line Is It Anyway?
