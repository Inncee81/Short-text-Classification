what musical instrument can you play with small hands i have always wanted to learn how to play an instrument preferably not a woodwind one like the flute but i have always found it difficult because i have rather small hands and my fingers aren't that long when i spread out my fingers from thumb tip to pinky it is inches and the length of my middle finger from where the pslam knuckle meet up to the tip is inches i was wondering if there was an instrument that wouldn't be hard to learn play with small hands ah also i'm tone deaf when it comes to singing so voice doesn't work for me don't let your small hands deter you from choosing any instrument that people traditionally say you need long fingers for most people look at my hands i have long slender fingers and just naturally assume that is why i ended up playing guitar the fact is that great finger reach is almost never needed when playing the guitar andre segovia had fat short fingers and he played brilliantly with them pick an instrument based on your pleasure and you'll figure out what techniques you need to use to overcome reach limitations enjoy Clarinet Double bass Flute Harp Saxophone Native American music Western concert flute Recorder Fast bowling Timpani Guitar Authentic performance Sitar Knife Tin whistle Hand Guqin Chopsticks String instrument Multiphonic Equine conformation Berimbau Classical music era Tablature Non-native pronunciations of English Andr__s Segovia Drill bit Louis Armstrong Transposing instrument Terminal ballistics Harmonica Hearing impairment Trumpet Horn (instrument) Old-time music Strap-on dildo Gesture Viola Trombone Humphrey Bogart Banjo Salad Fingers Brass instrument Musical instrument Music of Ireland Lute Blood on the Tracks Vibrato Embouchure Harmonic series (music) Sin City Milton H.
