is a epiphone les paul a good guitar is haven't played that particuler model but epiphone's have impressed me as pretty decent guitars over the last several years at one time they were cheap guitars and played like them the epiphone's i've picked up more recently played well and had a good sound to them the pickups will be one of the biggest differences they won't be the same quality as a les paul the wood will be a lower quality and the specs won't be as right so your not getting a les paul your getting a les paul copy that's at least made by a company owned by gibson i suggest actually playing one they might be a great guitar for joe x down the road and suck for what you want to do Epiphone Electric guitar Bass guitar Guitar Gibson Les Paul Gibson Les Paul Gibson ES-335 Gibson Firebird Fender Telecaster Gibson SG Acoustic guitar Double bass Gary Rossington James Hetfield The Beatles' influence Harmonica Zakk Wylde Pete Townshend Gibson Explorer Keith Richards Fender Stratocaster Ibanez Sonic Youth Adam Jones Green Day Mandolin Fender Kirk Hammett Gramophone record Multitrack recording Brian May Chet Atkins Eddie Van Halen Humbucker Glay (band) Les Claypool Effects unit Eric Clapton Sound recording Ler LaLonde Mike Bloomfield Dobro Violin Judas Priest Primus (band) Floyd Rose Cheap Trick Pickup (music) Gary Moore Mike Watt Cincinnati Bengals Toyota Land Cruiser Dean Guitars Detroit Red Wings C.F.
