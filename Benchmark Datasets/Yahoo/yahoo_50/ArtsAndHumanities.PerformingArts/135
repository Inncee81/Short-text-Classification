how can i book any artist in my hometown what re the procedures where should i call to book them etc im looking to start booking artist of high caliber but don't know the hows nor the capital needed to start bringing at least one of them on one of the artist's cds there should be a credit line for their professional management do not waste their time unless you have money up front to pay them do not expect to have them play for gate meaning you'll pay them when you count the money from all the tickets you hopefully sell they want their money up front and it it is up to you to promote the event in such a manner that they get paid all your expenses get paid you've never done this before have you no clue about what needs to be done and how much is costs and hopefully a little sumthin' sumthin' left over for you do not touch this unless you are already wealthy enough that you can afford to drop a significant amount of before you hear a note and then it would be nice if you got that money back plus but no guarantee do not expect any financial institution lend you money for this either and if you want to know how much money you have to front like the old saying goes if you need to ask you can't afford it you are responsible for everything insurance security publicity electric janitorial services a bond in the city you perform in ushers food just let your mind wrap itself around this a little bit run forrest run Bond Insurance Life insurance Mutual fund Gold standard Government debt Corporation Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Economy of Russia Finance Stock Gross domestic product Credit card Citigroup Money Taxation in the United States Mortgage Hyperinflation Annuity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Money supply Bretton Woods system Tax Privatization Debt Public policy Inflation Social Security debate (United States) Predatory lending Capitalism Microcredit Social Security (United States) BC Rail Graduate school Economy of the United States Canadian and American health care systems compared Monetary policy Contract National Health Service Government National Mortgage Association Ponzi scheme Collateralized debt obligation FairTax Economy of India Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Unemployment Variable universal life insurance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Craps Central bank Financial analyst Capital accumulation Salary cap Baseball Education in the United States Derivative (finance) Enron Corporation Personal finance Financial markets United Artists Toronto-Dominion Bank Security (finance) Deflation (economics) Arbitrage The Amazing Race Economy of Pakistan Blackjack United Kingdom corporation tax Poker jargon United States Postal Service Commodity markets Investment bank Yield curve Blackburn Rovers F.C.
