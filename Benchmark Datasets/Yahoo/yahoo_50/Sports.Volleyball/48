should i work on spiking i am about ' '' and have volleyball tryouts coming up in about weeks this is the first time that i'm trying out for a volleyball team so i'm wondering whether or not i should practice spiking the ball even though i'm pretty short thanks umm yess you definitely need to practice especially if this is your first time trying out i played jv the last two years and one of the main things they focus on is spiking they also focus on your agressivness agility and serving behind the line http volleyball about com od hitting ss spiking htm check that site out for learning how to spike http www wikihow com spike a volleyball this site is also very helpful one thing you should be doing these upcoming weeks is lifting weights to strengthen your arm muscles and do squats to strengthen your leg muscles since percent of the time you are down low and ready for the ball also start jogging running if you don't already do this tryouts are killer and usually consist of a lot of running and such to show your stamina another thing you might want to consider is practicing jumping jump onto a certain object so many times a day and gradually increase the height of the object to allow your body to jump higher and higher one more thing if you mess up a play don't get down on yourself everyone messes up and coaches don't like to see players get angry with themselves they like to see players move on and play twice as hard to make up for their mistake or whatnot our team had a story last year that we liked to remind eachother of on the court when one of us was down on ourselves a donkey was walking down a dirt road and fell into a hole in order to successfully get out of this hole he realized he had to brush off the dirt and step up out of the hole leading to our phrase brush it off and step it up so when you mess up or you don't think you're doing too well just brush it off and step up your game i really hope this helps you and good luck at your tryouts Aerial (dance move) Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige Four square Equine conformation 1957 World Series Baseball Poker jargon Weight training Snooker Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Diving Piccolo Junior Saga Water polo Badminton Glossary of American football Softball New York Giants Professional wrestling holds Fast bowling Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Babe Ruth American football strategy Professional wrestling throws Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Beach volleyball Baseball Stars Bubble Bobble Social rule Table tennis Rugby union positions 2000 Australian Grand Prix Baroque chess Dog agility Paintball Major League Baseball television contracts Naruto jutsu Tenshinhan Ty Cobb Brian Close Cricket Tai shogi Cincinnati Bengals Paragliding Horse Glossary of climbing terms Ice hockey Escape from New York Tris Speaker Team Fortress Classic Professional wrestling slang Billiards Ron Weasley National Football League Professional wrestling attacks Rugby league American football RuneScape skills Memorial Stadium, Clemson Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Time Out of Mind Super Mario Kart Knife The Contender (television series) 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Football (soccer) positions GunZ The Duel Norway national football team Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ravi Shastri World Series Yao Ming Maka dai dai shogi Sport Dai shogi Detroit Tigers Blackjack Hal Trosky Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pyramid (game show) Chinese martial arts Urinary incontinence Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Super Bowl XXVII The Ashlee Simpson Show
