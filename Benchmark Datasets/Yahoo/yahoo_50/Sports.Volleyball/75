can someone give me volleyball drills can someone please tell me drills to improve my volleyball serve i am trying out for the team next year and my serves arent the best does anyone know any serving drills for starters way to go on choosing volleyball go you for conditioning do say fifteen pushups for a week then the next week move it up to and so on and just keep it up it will get your muscles much more reliable every night i come home and do tosses with my left hand and try to make each toss like i was about to serve it this works on my timing and really helps me know how high or low i need to throw it before i hit it you don't neccicarily have to tosses but the more you do the more consistant you become when it's actually time to serve if you have an empty wall at home i e in the garage or basement try serving against it start feet away then drill that sucker into the wall ten times and after doing so take two steps back and do more keep going back two steps until you cannot go any further away without running into a wall if you have a court availible i know people don't tend to keep such things in their back pocket but if you do it might work better start at the spiking line and serve it over the net if you can convince someone to wait on the other side of the net to catch it it saves alot of running then do the same thing you would do inside take a few steps back and then do serves more when your'e up close by the spiking line you don't have to burn it into the opposite wall starting close is so that you can concentrate on your stance toss and tecnique more than your power and as you step further and further back you can start hitting it harder and harder i hope this helps and good luck getting on the team Volleyball Glossary of American football Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Badminton Fast bowling Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Drill bit Craps Parade (military) Aerial (dance move) Coin flipping 1957 World Series Four square New York Giants Tennis Equine conformation Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Poker jargon Professional wrestling holds History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Tag Pittsburgh Steelers New York Jets Super Bowl IX Baseball Glossary of climbing terms Super Bowl XXVII Laws of cricket Marching band Beer Pong Escape from New York International League 2005 World Series New England Patriots Energy development Rugby union positions Rugby union 2001 World Series Skateboarding trick Ty Cobb Andr__s Galarraga Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXXVI Sandy Koufax Paintball Tenshinhan American football strategy Super Bowl XVII Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Eskrima Jet engine The Ashes The Contender (television series) Operation Market Garden Blood (computer game) Baseball Stars Boxing Mills Mess American football Fielding (cricket) Wrigley Field Beach volleyball Softball Test cricket Ultimate (sport) Swingout Cheerleading Hard disk Glossary of partner dance terms Knife Pok__mon Abilities Jackass: The Movie Super Bowl XIX Toss (cricket) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mixed martial arts Tris Speaker Ravi Shastri Cleveland Browns Racquetball Billboard Hot 100 Fischer Random Chess Floppy disk Serve (tennis) Columbine High School massacre 2004 World Series Pete Sampras West Indian cricket team Water polo Super Bowl XV 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup Squash tennis
