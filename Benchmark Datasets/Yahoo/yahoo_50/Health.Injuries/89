if a person breaks a bone and doesn't have medical insurance does the er dr still fix it i was out at the er the other day with a friend and they had broken their foot they don't have medical insurance the er took x rays and told them it was broken and to go see another dr now as fas as i know when you go to a dr old or new they want cash up front or for you to pay some down and make payments my friend asked me since i have no cash up front to pay or insurance will they still fix my foot then bill me and i pay them a month until paid off what should i tell him i am sorry i didn't make the question clear we know that the er has to see you regardless of your income they question was pointed towards a bone dr in their office that is not in with the hospital will they still see you and fix his foot if he has no cash up front i work in an er the law is that they have to treat you no matter what however this means putting it back in place if needed pain control and splinting they do not cast in er's the reason being that most breaks swell a lot in the first hours and then go down if they put one on immediatly then it would be too big in a few days i would suggest since she doesn't have insurance to go to er that has orthopedic doctors on call that come to to er that way they can do all of the above every doctors office is different on payment rules she might be able to get away with it just being in the splint after the er visit Bond Life insurance Equine conformation Medical malpractice Theory of conduct Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Publicly funded medicine Unemployment benefit Contract Jessica Lynch Ben Johnson (athlete) Chiropractic Health care in the United States EastEnders Medicare (Canada) Carpal tunnel syndrome Compensation of employees Betting (poker) Keynesian economics National Kidney Foundation Singapore Stomach cancer Annuity Childbirth Pharmaceutical company First aid Microeconomics Little Britain Ponzi scheme Tax Medicine Terri Schiavo Variable universal life insurance Mental Health Act 1983 Ocean's Twelve Child support Wal-Mart Plame affair Unemployment Big Brother (USA TV series) Traumatic brain injury Extreme Programming Sydney Riot of 1879 401(k) Prostate cancer Mortgage Rent (musical) The Amazing Race Universal life insurance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an FairTax Productive and unproductive labour Craps Triage Gambling Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Medicare (United States) American Medical Association Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Hip fracture Medicare (Australia) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pope John Paul I National Insurance Supply and demand Leonard McCoy Trust (Law) USA Mensal__o scandal Paget's disease of bone Health savings account Estoppel Podiatrist Hillary Rodham Clinton Tax protester Canadian and American health care systems compared The Lovely Bones Social rule United States House of Representatives Bone fracture James Hanratty Emergency Medical Services Security (finance) Wheel of Fortune Schabir Shaik Trial Babe Ruth Article One of the United States Constitution Lottery Taxation in the United States The Caves of Androzani Credit score Days of our Lives Pension United Kingdom corporation tax
