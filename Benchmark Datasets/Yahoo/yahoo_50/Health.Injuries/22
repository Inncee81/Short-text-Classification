how does ultra sound help in healing a broken bone i am currently in physical therapy after breaking my foot in two areas earlier this summer now able to walk on it again i have only lost of the use of my foot following the break fortunately but i am wondering how the ultra sound helps in the healing of the broken bones there is limited evidence to support that ultrasound helps broken bones heal the evidence that has been presented is weak at best but theoretically it stimulates angiogenesis or formation of new blood vessles which help infiltrate the bone to stimulate the deposition of new bone in fact the use of ultrasound at all have very little evidence to support it's use i think it does have potential benefits just that the experiments that have been done so far are poor furthermore i do not think that the mechanisms of how it works are fully understood Prostate cancer Cancer Medical ultrasonography Wound healing phases Ultrasound Angiogenesis Growth hormone treatment Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Atherosclerosis Puberty Chiropractic Massage Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Equine conformation Traditional Chinese medicine Traumatic brain injury Reflexology Multiple sclerosis Electroconvulsive therapy Cryptorchidism Medicine Homeopathy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stem cell Growth factor Clinical depression Breast cancer Orgasm Gravis Ultrasound Metastasis Radiology Crucifixion IgA nephropathy Magnet therapy Stroke Flood geology Chronic fatigue syndrome Bone Reparative therapy Osteoarthritis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tobacco smoking Myocardial infarction Bone fracture Hip fracture Growth hormone deficiency Xenomorph Chemotherapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tyrannosaurus rex Supernatural Long-term potentiation Obstetrics Alternative medicine Brain-computer interface Radiation therapy Bone marrow transplant Orthopedic surgery Growth hormone Vitamin C Evolution Turner syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome Weight training Dinosaur Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Childbirth Pain Multiple myeloma Hypnosis Supersymmetry Testosterone Dyslexia Neuro-linguistic programming Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Hydrochloric acid Rush (band) Coeliac disease Ventricular fibrillation Anabolic steroid Decompression sickness Mastocytosis Human adaptation to space Evidence of evolution Pterosaur Francis Crick General relativity Asthma Minimum wage Hypertension Narcolepsy Quantum mechanics Cirrhosis Leukemia Wood
