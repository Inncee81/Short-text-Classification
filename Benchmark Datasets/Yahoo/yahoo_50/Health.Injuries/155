bycycle injury i think help i rided my bycycle for the first time today for an entire hour i am not used to the bycycle neither to cardio physycal exercises when i unmounted my bike i suddenly felt a huge pain right in the muscles lower to my buttocks will this pain pass by itself or is it a more serious thing it depends on what you actually did to it it sounds like you may have tweaked one of your hamstring muscles below your butt top back of your leg if you can walk on it with only limited discomfort than you will be fine the best thing to do is to ice it compress it with an ace bandage and elevate the injury elevate it so the injury is above the height of your heart for future reference take a quick jog first and stretch out all your muscles before riding this will help prevent these kind of strains Weight training Equine conformation Running Myocardial infarction First aid Recumbent bicycle Fecal incontinence Repetitive strain injury Heart Bruise Deadlift Carpal tunnel syndrome Exercise Bicycle Traumatic brain injury Aerial (dance move) Breech birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Pain Sciatica Swimming Stopping power Atherosclerosis Chair Strap-on dildo Muscle Aikido Stretching Childbirth Fast bowling Back injury Brassiere Diving Milton H.
