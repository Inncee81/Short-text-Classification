does this sound like whiplash or sprain strain or something else okay i was in a car accident and the car i was in hit another car in front of us i was in the front passenger seat kinda turned toward the driver reaching toward the stereo leaning forward i think our car is totalled btw anyhow a few minutes after it happened my right shoulder felt bruised sore from the shoulder strap there is a bit of a bruise there today then i started getting worse and for a while it hurt to twist my spine at all like even turning my head my right arm felt a little numb kinda like it was asleep and my middle back along my spine kinda burned felt pinchy i also got a bit of a headache if there was a line drawn from my left hip to my right shoulder the upper right triangle my right shoulder down made between that my spine is very sore kinda burns today it was the part that was pinchy also last night but it's not like that today and the lower left triangle my lower back on the left is reallly sore feeling like i strained it okay so basically it hurt pretty bad a few hours after it happened and my mobilitiy was decreased but today i'm just a bit stiff sore like i worked out too hard or something a tad worse but you know what i mean and it's not pinchy along my spine anymore what do you think it might be just a sprain or strain or something worse something worse like what please i'm really worried i'm also pregnant but there's no indication that the baby's been effected at all i had the lap belt on properly didn't even feel it except on my upper thighs no bruising there at all or even soreness thanks gatorade i will go you are right i do have insurance but it's so crappy i'm so broke right now i don't have a car now so it's going to be difficult to get there i was hoping it was nothing of course but better safe than sorry right yes go to a doctor the fact that you were in an accident and that you are pregnant should be enough to convince you to go to a doctor you and your baby do not need to be going through this stress worrying about it causes stress whiplash usually does not hurt initially but starts to get worse after some time there is also a chance you have a slight concusion and or internal injury i hope you have insurance Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Diving Crash test dummy Car safety Seat belt Aerial (dance move) Spanking 24 Hours of Le Mans Weight training Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Motorcycle Mattress Breech birth Chair Jam (TV series) Swingout Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Piledriver (professional wrestling) Repetitive strain injury One Tree Hill (TV series) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Knots Landing Hip fracture Neckbreaker Boxing Breaststroke Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Whiplash Carpal tunnel syndrome Indianapolis 500 Vertebral column Massage Internal ballistics Scapula Stomach cancer Bruise Puberty Prostate cancer Swimming Days of our Lives Professional wrestling attacks Terminal ballistics Jacky Ickx Kodocha John F.
