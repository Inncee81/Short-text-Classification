has anyone tried public school after homeschooling i homeschooled my son last year k and now his dad wants him to try a public school we has tried to other public schools before homeschooling and had negative results once i started homeschooling my son did better i was proud and saw how proud he was of himself i'm having issues with the idea of public school i was wondering if anyone tried public schooling after a good experience with homeschooling i have four boys and my oldest will be entering first grade soon i know i can't give him the time to be homeschooled with my other three sons and my husband going to school and work full time i'm scared to try the unschooling method because he might get behind i tried homeschooling due to my children not getting enough education in public school however our situation changed and i had to send them back to public school reluctantly they did fine socially because in homeschool we allowed for more socialization than they did in public school but academically they were light years ahead of students their age especially in reading and grew bored also one of them used to hate math i found a new way that helped her learn it and it became her favorite subject when she went back to public school she hated it again needless to say we are now going back to homeschool again they couldn't be more thrilled back to friends fun and lots of learning i say that whatever works for each child's individual instructional needs is the best route to go these links might help you why homeschooling is a valid choice http www associatedcontent com article why homeschooling is a valid choice html keeping babies and toddlers busy while homeschooling the older kids http www associatedcontent com article busy and enriching activities for babies html also if you need to know anything else about homeschool or public schools i'm available just mail me through yahoo i'm currently earning a degree in early childhood education and am a writer with multiple books coming out soon i mainly write about education and parenting those are my articles at the links above Waldorf Education Education in the United States GED Education A.
