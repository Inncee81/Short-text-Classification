why do home education naysayers always try to muddy the waters by substituting socialisation for socialising socialisation has nothing to do with kids getting to 'hang out' and socialise with other kids their age so why do homeschooling naysayers continue to rely on it as their sole argument in support of schools socialisation by definition is 'the process whereby the individual learns to conform to the moral standards codes of conduct role expectations and role performances in a specific society ' and what better way for kids to learn that than by living working learning and playing in the midst of their society and not segregated and shut away in school for years of their childhood in fact anyone who stops and thinks about it for just a moment must see that in childhood at least socialising with others their own age is the antithesis of socialisation unless they're really expecting their six or sixteen year old to learn how to conform to the standards expectations and conduct required by their wider society from other six sixteen year olds hannah oh dear we're back to those age old paradigms again evidenced by what spelling the fact that i spell words like 'socialising' and 'socialisation' with an 's' and not a 'z' i'm not from the usa ergo i don't use your 'american style' spelling i spell words as they are spelt in my country and that means using the letter 's' and not 'z' not missing out the letter 'u' and spelling words like 'gaol' as 'gaol' and not 'jail' as someone from the usa might spell it to spell words like socialisation and socialising as 'socialization' and 'socializing' may be 'correct' for you but would definitely be wrong and misspelled if i was to write them thus tyler and mckenna's mom would you please post a full reference for the article you cite or alternatively for the journal in which you found it i tried searching on general search engines such as 'google' and the more academic ones like 'science direct' but was unable to find any trace of the journal you cited thanks hannah first tyler can i get a link to your journal article i tried to google it and it's not showing up on google anywhere there's an international journal for teaching and learning but that's about it and they don't have any articles on homeschooling the number you've provided directly contradicts the studies done by ray in ' shows that in indep testing homeschoolers beat out public schoolers by to points in all standardized testing regardless of race or income there are several other studies but this is primary as for socialization and the original question i think it's easy for people to confuse the two since the theory that children are incapable has been pushed for so long nearly one hundred years although even sixty years ago the idea of the 'teenager' boundless free time and no responsibility was unheard of it is in the best interest of many special interest groups to market children in a certain way from disney to department of education it's better to have children who are limited in resources are believed to be incapable of coping with an 'adult' world and that children should be kept with other children although for centuries millenia children have been learning through interaction with family and mentors who have taught taught them the necessary skills for survival and growth the idea of public schools were good at first when facing the idea that many adults were kept illiterate by lack of finances and opportunity namely by the church and upper classes but in our society children do not face those same deficits it is definitely time to reevaluate the roles of public education in this light Education Education in the United States GED Education in the People's Republic of China Economics
