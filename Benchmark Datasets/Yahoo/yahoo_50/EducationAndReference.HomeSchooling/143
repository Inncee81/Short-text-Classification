is it possible to do homeschooling and public schooling both at once i'm and i feel that some of my teachers do a shtty job teaching but some teachers are real good was wondering if i can do homeschooling for some subjects like math perhaps i really can't stand these teachers i was seriously thinking about starting a riot with all the kids in the school against dumba teachers websites would be cool thanks well i think supplemental work in the language arts area would enhance your ability to express yourself tremendously but in most states you cannot opt to take say half your core classes at the highschool an the other half at home and expect all of the credits to appear on your public school transcript and yet as i stated with my first sentence there is absolutely nothing wrong with enhancing your studies with additional work at home say for example you find your world geography teacher is really nothing more than a babysitter really doing nothing more than engaging the class in meaningless busy work you could do a homeschool geography class at home and actually learn something you home class will not be a credit on your transcript but the a you will get for that class definitely will some states not all but some will allow you to take online classes instead of traditional sit in a classroom classes you will just have to check the rules for your school bottom line even though i seriously don't agree with your use of curse words as a means of self expression i admire your tenacity in exploring options to maximize your education Homeschooling Education in the United States Waldorf Education Education in Romania GED No Child Left Behind Act Education in Malaysia A Course In Miracles Drama Graduate school High school SAT Tai Chi Chuan Boston Public Hogwarts subjects Greek language Secondary education in France Reiki Education A.
