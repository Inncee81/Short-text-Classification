what's your opinion of homeschooling i was homeschooled all my life and kind of got burned by a few people im a sr in highschool now and ive been homeschooled my whole life however i did take an elective class at a local highschool web design and it was a huge dose of the real world and i hated the surroundings highschool was so cliche and this was in a tiny country highschool i could never wake up every morning and deal with that everyday im not dissing the public schoolers out there but from a kid like me whos been homeschooled their whole life its anything but enjoyable i only took one class homeschooling has advantages and disadvantages you do have alot more time and i have more friends than of my public school friends so we are not all social outcasts it clearly depends on the parent since they basically do control your entire life even more in homeschooling they choose how much time you spend with friends sports and other activities i'm involved in so many things and most people dont believe im homeschooled but i guess you could say ive broken that sterotyped highwater jeans wearings nerdy unsocialized super genious homeschooler you simple have to be careful on how you homeschool and how strict you are about it my mom is loose about it and me and my sister are students you are more sheltered but its a good kind of shelter when you get to middle school highschool age you do a slight dose of whats going on around you though the good and the bad i'm planning on homeschooling my kids to highschool then give them a choice of homeschooling or highschool i didnt really have a choice but my choice still would be to homeschool still because yes i still do see my friends at least once every other day so its not a big deal Homeschooling Education in Romania GED Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Waldorf Education Recess (TV series) Doug Pitaten Bill Gothard The Fairly OddParents Funny Farm (comic) Secondary education High school Secondary education in France Springfield Elementary School French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Government of France Teen Girl Squad Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy High school subcultures Great Teacher Onizuka Recurring South Park characters Republic Kodocha Tiny Toon Adventures School Culture of the United States Alignment (role-playing games) Beavis and Butt-head Rocko's Modern Life Hopkins School Microeconomics Kim Possible Japanese tea ceremony Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Brave New World Plurality electoral system King City, Ontario A.
