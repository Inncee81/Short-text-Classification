full time work and home school i'm home schooling my middle child and i give a lot of time and effort into educating and teaching him my values and beliefs i don't mean for anyone to get offended but how can you home school successfully if you work full time if you work full time how you can home school your child without having that child feel abandon by you sure they learn to be independent and self teach themselves but what about the fact of dealing with their emotions some home schooling moms that i know worked full time and some of their children suffered from it some of them had behavioral problems and felt left out by their parents being so busy and tired all the time where would you find the time to be there for your child if your busy working your job as a home schooling mom i ask myself that question i shift between not working working at home and working part or full time sometimes for a few weeks or months to build up our bank account for a bit when i work full time it's not that hard to continue homeschooling i'm home days per week my husband is home a different days per week and my mother helps the other days when they go to my moms house i send them with their books and worksheets and projects and they do most of their independant or skills practice when they're with her we do more direct work the other days we're home they continue to go to their co op classes and their extra curricular activities and classes we just work out a schedule of who is taking them where i also have a yr old who is pretty much self sufficient with her college courses and she'll sit down and work with the younger kids too it's sort of a family affair it isn't too difficult for us we never were highly structured to begin with so usually it's just about shifting schedules around to fit everyone's needs Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Hikikomori Education in Germany Education reform Infantilism GED Extreme Programming Scientology beliefs and practices Education Alexander Technique Dog training Pitaten Breastfeeding Malcolm in the Middle A.
