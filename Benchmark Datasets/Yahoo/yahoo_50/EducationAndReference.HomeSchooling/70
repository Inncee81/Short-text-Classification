m yhusband was dead set against homeschooling and had something to counteract every point i tried to make now all of a sudden he's changed his mind he told me last night honey you've convinced me i think you should homeschool him what's up some part of me thinks he's not sincere even though he says he is my husband rarely changes his mind on something especially if he has strong feelings about it i asked him if he's just trying to see if i fail so he can say i told you so but he says no he'll help me any way we can and he's even talking about scheduling a science field trip am i wrong to be so suspicious what do you think he has up his sleeve you know your husband better than any of us on here but what i think honestly is that you are doubting yourself at homeschooling it is hard to teach your child at home and even with asking simple homeschooling questions on here there are tons of people out here willing to put us down and judge us your husband might be sincere with his change of heart but since we are ridiculed so much you might just be preparing yourself for the downfall which may never come just keep doing what your doing for your son as long as your son is happy and safe that's all that matters Homeschooling Theory of conduct GED Waldorf Education Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Mojave people EastEnders Sydney Riot of 1879 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Education in the United States Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fiddler on the Roof The nature of God in Western theology Coming of Age (TNG episode) John Kerr Past teachings of Prem Rawat A.
