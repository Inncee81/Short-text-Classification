school bus im going to start school in four days and im worried about the bus dropping me off its my first year in public school what if the buss drops me off far and i have to walk alone and get abducted but really the problem is i have to catch the bus at in the morning and they thinkg of dropping me off near a highway can you gve me some tips and im worried the people will think im rich and they wont like me can you give me some feedback when i started public school i also had to ride the school bus if you live in the suburbs the only reason you would get dropped off away from your house is if it's a bus stop and the a lot of other kids will get off with you so you won't be alone if you live in the country like me then the bus driver really should know what he's doing and will drop you off in the right place one time my bus driver drove passed a girls house because she hardly ever rides the bus and she went up told him she was on and he simply turned around and went back to her house i never saw the bus not drop someone off at their house where i live the bus driver would get in a lot of trouble if they did something like that to a little kid for example so they generally are fairly careful about people liking you just be yourself just be careful not to be too shy because then poeple think you are stuck up sometimes that's what happened to me you could try introducing yourself to people you'd like to meet and just be friendly good luck starting school was scary and fun at the same time for me Hitchhiking Social rule Chris Amon Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete 2000 Australian Grand Prix About a Boy School bus Aerial (dance move) Oh My Goddess!
