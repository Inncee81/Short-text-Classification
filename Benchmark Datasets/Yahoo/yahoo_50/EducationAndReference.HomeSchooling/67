do any of you homeschool your children does anyone homeschool why do you do it what method curriculum do you use i homeschool my two oldest children aged and hi samantha i too homeschool my son who is years old he did go to school in the uk until july sometimes many people forget that sometimes you feel that you are the only people home eductaing especially if you do not have a huge network of family anfd friends people do home school for so many reasons ours was the education in school was not meeting our sons specific needs my son had a speech and language disorder which is better now also dyspraxia dyslexia and specific learning problems what seemed to make it more complicated was that he was aslo identified as being gifted in maths but the lea could not get their heads around the fact that he still had all these other problems especially with his recording of the information he was taking for ever to finish work as he found it so tiring as he struggled with fine motor skills he could manage verbally no problem or if someone could scribe for him couldn't get a scribe for him in class this was such a huge problem for the education authority he is also displaying various aspegers syndrome traits which we are waiting to see a professional for loads of these issues came up an all of our letters to the lea and also to the head of the education depeartment but these where not even looked at i still feel very angry and hurt as your child is just another name and number in the school system if your difficulty does not fit into a neat little box it's tough luck as you do not get listened to since home educating my son he is so much better more relaxed less stressed and much less highly strung all these things which many teachers had noticed how ironic they did nothing to help him or listen to what i was saying in letters to them the school and the education authority we work together to meet his specific needs and with getting one to one help from me his mum he has improved we do not follow a strict curriculum but often pick up things which i know are on the national curriculum because he is interested in the subject we do not sit down am to pm everyday is different and is usually lead by my sons interests using things he is interested in we incorporate the maths literacy science life skills and so much more my knowledge has increased so much since home teaching him and love everyday with him we do a lot of work using the computer and all the resources you can get from it using local and major towns libraries we do lots of museums parks and lots of crafts and cooking he make small cakes weighing and measuring through to putting them into their tins while i stand back and supervise he loves cooking and thinks he wants to be a chef this week don't know what he'll be next week i also know people who do the formal side of home schooling and if that fits you your lifestyle and most importantly your child then you do that way that suites you all as a family i do not think there is a right or wrong way to home educate i personally am so happy to have this choice we where not given choices to help our son in the school setting so this has worked out wondrefully for us hope you are enjoying home schooling it is hard work sometimes but well worth the effort happy home schooling from one family to another home schooling family Dyslexia GED Education in the United States Education Education in the People's Republic of China No Child Left Behind Act Asperger syndrome Waldorf Education Mathematics Social rule SAT Pitaten Education in Japan Literacy Education in Romania Stuttering Education in England Scientology beliefs and practices Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Intelligence quotient Alexander Technique Dyspraxia Hearing impairment About a Boy Bah__'__ Faith and Education Second language acquisition A.
