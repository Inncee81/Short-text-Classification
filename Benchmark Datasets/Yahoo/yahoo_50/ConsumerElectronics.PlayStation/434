ps compatible keyboard wireless i bought a wireless bluetooth keyboard mouse combo a while back because i knew the ps supported bluetooth when i went to install it i found a bluetooth usb plug that came with it which i didn't think i needed but i used anyways so when i clicked register bluetooth device there was no register keyboard mouse i believe the keyboard might have come with software too anyways with recent firmware updates i have noticed that there is now a register bluetooth keyboard feature can i now buy any bluetooth keyboard and it will work or am i going to risk another similar problem if not is there anything to look for in a keyboard that i will tell me its going to work with the ps or is there just a good keyboard under bucks that anyone knows is compatible wow i wrote enough for a simple question lol i think any blu tooth and up device works with the ps but i'm not entirely sure look for logitech though they make official playstation products Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus IMac Apple Macintosh Windows XP BlackBerry USB flash drive IPod Mac mini PlayStation Portable IPAQ Tungsten Handheld ZigBee Verizon Wireless Wi-Fi Xbox Nintendo DS N-Gage Nintendo Revolution Secure Digital card IBook PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 Atari ST Copy protection Windows 2000 PowerBook Atari 8-bit family BIOS Game controller Microsoft Windows AmigaOS Apple Desktop Bus IBM PC compatible Apple Computer Personal computer Amstrad CPC Symbian OS X Window System Hard disk Desktop computer Sega Dreamcast Sharp Zaurus Danger Hiptop Pocket PC Security token AlphaSmart Floppy disk Gmail Object Desktop European Installation Bus Linux Cheating in Counter-Strike Computer surveillance Laptop Windows Mobile IEEE 802.11 Television Software testing AirPort Handspring Mobile phone Mozilla Firefox Linux kernel GP32 ReactOS Home cinema Hearing aid WordPerfect Creative Zen RS-232 Handheld game console Dongle Blu-ray Disc Quotation mark DirectX PIC microcontroller History of Microsoft Windows Treo 650 Commodore 128 Opera (web browser) Common Unix Printing System ThinkPad ZX Spectrum Unicode Port (computing) Personal area network Power Macintosh G3 Microsoft Modchip Mac OS X Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis FireWire Universal Plug and Play
