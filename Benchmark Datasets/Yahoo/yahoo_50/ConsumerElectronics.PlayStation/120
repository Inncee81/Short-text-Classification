harry potter order of the phoenix for ps hello i am a huge fan of the harry potter books and movies i don't usually buy movie based video games but i have an itch to buy order of the phoenix i want to know if it is worth picking up what is it like graphics fun etc etc keep in mind i am a real big fan of the series so i'm likely to not be as critical as someone who is looking at it as just a game thanks i found it fun to play but it does get frustrating because this time there is just so much to do and hogwarts is just massive also there is mini games i found so far theres wizard's chess exploding snap and gob stones kinda like marbles Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Ron Weasley J.
