will there ever be a vibrating controler for the ps i heard that iit is comming out with the new gig ps that's what someone on here said but sony never said it was coming out on the gb version because the gb is already out and there's no mention of the vibration function eventually the sixaxis will have vibration function supposedly immersion already gave a blueprint to sony about how to put the rumble in the sixaxis it's taking so long because sony might have to reconfigure their manufacturing plants because of the rumble or sony knew what it was talking about when sony said that the rumble was going to interfere with the sixaxis the blueprint that immersion gave isn't working so immersion is still working on it DualShock Sony Resident Evil 2 PlayStation 2 Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Game controller Floppy disk Rodney Anoai Nintendo Revolution Sega Dreamcast Good Vibrations Resident Evil (video game) Rez Baptism Subwoofer Strap-on dildo Kurt Angle Sony Corp. of America v.
