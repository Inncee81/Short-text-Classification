ps or xbox please please give me answers on this because i need to choose by tomorrow well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives around christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword killzone metal gear solid etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series get the ps its better in the long run Halo 2 Xbox Live Halo: Combat Evolved Computer and video games Halo (video game series) Wipeout (game) Video game music Nintendo Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube First-person shooter Sega Dreamcast PlayStation Portable IBM PC compatible Machinima Counter-Strike ATI Technologies Final Fantasy XI Console wars Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Ninja Gaiden History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gradius Microsoft History of computer and video games TurboGrafx 16 Microsoft Windows Modchip Timeline of computing 1990-forward Killzone Atari 8-bit family DVD The Sims Console game Lightsaber MMORPG Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Apple Macintosh Marathon (computer game) Phantasy Star Online Pump It Up Nintendo 64 Computer and video game genres Metal Gear Game Boy Advance Mouse (computing) Radeon Computer role-playing game Universal Serial Bus IPod Need for Speed Super Robot Wars Bungie Studios Windows 2000 Bicycle lighting Intellivision Final Fantasy Metal Gear Solid Nintendo Entertainment System Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Sega 32X Nintendo Power Grand Theft Auto III Star Wars: Galaxies FIFA Series Voice over IP Blue screen of death Shen Gong Wu Laserdisc NVIDIA Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield MAME GunBound MechAssault History of Microsoft Windows Resident Evil Sonic the Hedgehog Yu Suzuki Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Star Wars: Battlefront Airsoft Ninja Game programming Game Boy
