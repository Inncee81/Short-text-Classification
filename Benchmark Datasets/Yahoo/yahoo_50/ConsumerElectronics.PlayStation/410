ps due to the war over blu ray and hd dvd if blu ray loses what will sony do about its blu ray drive will they just keep making bluray games for the ps or update the console since blockbuster went to blu ray the war is pretty much won for sony this is not to say that hddvd is history or that the outcome is determined however with the biggest distributor of all the movies on the planet taking sides you will be in no danger of blu ray going the way of betamax it will be a long time before the graphics capabilities of the cell processor in the ps will be topped you can rest assured that sony and all of the best game makers will be making more and more high def games for a long time i bought my ps strictly for gaming but i'm glad that it has blu ray capabilities since the br disc has several times the capacity on each disc compared to hd if my guess is correct they will find more and more ways to enhance the features and the quality of movies Blu-ray Disc Computer and video games DVD PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable PlayStation 3 Nintendo Revolution Betamax Amstrad CPC Nintendo GameCube VHS GamePark Nintendo 64 Nintendo Sega Handheld game console Console wars Compact disc Super Nintendo Entertainment System Video game music Cell (microprocessor) Sega Dreamcast Sega Saturn Gran Turismo (game) Blu Cantrell Videocassette recorder MiniDisc High-definition television DualDisc Resident Evil (video game) Laserdisc RISC Xbox 360 Sony The Sims 2 Copy protection Sony Computer Entertainment Wheel of Fortune Walkman Resident Evil Pornography Game programming Movie projector Sega 32X GP32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward IBM PC compatible Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Apple Macintosh History of computer and video games Video game console History of video games (Sixth generation era) Atari Regional lockout Sony Corp. of America v.
