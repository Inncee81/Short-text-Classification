how is my k help me in retirement if i'm losing money in it since opening it it grows every month about which is what i put into it but looses about every month and if it grows say for years to k and in the last year before retirement it loses its value what good is the k program for if it goes up and down in years i'll have equal chances of making money losing money or just getting the same money i put in how safe is that over years your money should grow if you recently put the money into your k you were unfortunate to run into a market correction however if you have invested for quite some time you need to look at your stocks mutual funds and start discarding the losers if you're young you can afford to take some risks on stocks but you should diversify your portfolio so that you can weather the ups and downs of each market fluctuation however yes there is some risk when you invest that you may lose everything especially if you pick small companies you can gain big or lose everything if you pick mainly the s p stocks you will grow your money at a slow rate making your k grow requires you to look every couple of months and fine tune where you invest you can't just put it into the market and wait years before checking on it for the most part you should be able to make money you just may not be able to make a lot if you are unlucky remember you are only losing gaining potential money it is not final until you actually sell your stocks mutual funds plus with mutual funds and some stocks you get dividends that you can reinvest to increase your shares which compounded over years can also add up you are also decreasing your current income now with your k that can place your income in a lower tax bracket plus the growth of your k is tax free until you start collecting your money at retirement so in short you can safely grow your money but without risk you won't gain much with your k but overall you gain when you consider the tax implications Bond Annuity PE ratio Capital accumulation Income trust Warren Buffett 401(k) Life insurance Short selling Social Security debate (United States) Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Russia Dividend Hedge fund Flat tax Taxation in the United States Surplus value Cost of capital Progressive tax Insurance Money supply Stock FairTax Tax Supply-side economics Bank Modern portfolio theory Bretton Woods system Corporation Economy of Pakistan Privatization Economy of India Capitalism Security (finance) Keynesian economics Arbitrage Publicly funded medicine Investment bank Financial markets Individual Savings Account Divorce Ra (board game) Poker jargon Variable universal life insurance Finance Venture capital Derivative (finance) Stock market Citigroup Interest Monopoly (game) Financial services Internet fraud Economy of Chile Inflation Debt Mergers and acquisitions Ponzi scheme Institutional fund management Property tax Capital asset pricing model Gross domestic product Asian financial crisis Leverage (finance) Betting (poker) NASDAQ Tax cut Anarchism and capitalism Credit card Sears Holdings Corporation Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Free trade Federal Reserve Microcredit Collateralized debt obligation Primerica Financial Services Mad Money Gold as an investment Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Eugene Fama Yield curve Capital gains tax Rational pricing Gold standard Risk Economy of Sri Lanka Insider trading Nuclear power Economy of Iceland Foreign exchange market Social Security (United States)
