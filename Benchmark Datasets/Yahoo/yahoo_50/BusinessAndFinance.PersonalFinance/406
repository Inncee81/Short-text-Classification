are there any investment plans i can do that will not allow me to take my money out for years i don't want to have the option to take the money out just to switch the money around in to different funds basically something like how some investment plans take if you withdraw early i would like it to take if i withdraw early i would imagine there's a higher rate of return on something like this too i don't want the option to take this money until my gets out of college any info would be great thanks i'm assuming that you don't trust yourself a better way to do this is to set up a trust for your funds that requires a signature from a trusted person that manages money better than you this will prevent you from withdrawing the funds before consulting the other person on the trust you should see an estate planner or financial advisor about this it's well worth the small fee for them to show you exactly what to do Mutual fund Life insurance Hedge fund 401(k) Insurance Annuity Social Security debate (United States) Personal finance Income trust Mortgage Student loan Variable universal life insurance Bretton Woods system Taxation in the United States Bank fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Bank Individual Retirement Account Derivative (finance) Primerica Financial Services Ponzi scheme Social Security (United States) Warren Buffett Education in the People's Republic of China Corporate finance Stock broker Pound sterling Capital accumulation Microeconomics Finance Tax Trust (Law) non-USA Keynesian economics Graduate school Construction Islamic banking Stock Personal rapid transit Option Institutional fund management 2003 California recall Investment Publicly funded medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Interest Collateralized debt obligation Individual Savings Account Pension Monetarism Education in the United States Security (finance) Corporation Bechtel Corporation FairTax Temasek Holdings Toll road Trusts and estates Toronto-Dominion Bank Inflation Economy of Russia National Health Service Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Risk Venture capital Bond Microcredit Financial services Advance fee fraud Michael Milken Money supply Flat tax Arturo Frondizi Citigroup Small business Goldman Sachs Eugene Fama No Child Left Behind Act Modern portfolio theory Education in England Donald Trump Deflation (economics) Closed-end fund PE ratio Monetary policy Rational pricing Hyperinflation Estoppel Gold as an investment Present value Federal Reserve Leverage (finance) 529 plan Coalition Provisional Authority Debt Wealth Certificate of deposit Health insurance Morgan Stanley
