can he escape federal student loans i just found out that my cousin's cousin third cousin has moved back to germany with student loan debt mostly federal he earned a b s in physics from a private university but could not find a job in the u s near family so he moved back to germany with his mom without plans to pay back his school loans he has a u s green card he has always been very responsible and even seemed frugal for the past years i've known him but claims per my cousin that he can't afford these payments on his salary and that it won't affect him in germany can he get away with this can the lenders have his wages garnished or affect his credit if he's working and living overseas i don't know if his new employer is a german or american company i would think the lenders would have some recourse i thought his school would put a hold on his degree once he starts missing payments he graduated in june i'm not sure that this will happen because he doesn't actually owe money to his university only to the goverment loans and a private lender that would be interesting if they could hold his degree for non payment it's true that a school can refuse to release your degree or paperwork if you have fees due them that you haven't paid but federal student loans shouldn't fall into this category presumably he took out the loan to pay for school if he actually paid the school then they would have no reason to hold his degree federally insured student loans means that the federal government will make good in the event that he doesn't pay sounds like he's not going to pay so at some point the government will pay the balance for him however it's hard to escape student loans in the normal sense because they can't be bankrupted the fact that it's a federally subsidized loan means that they don't even have to sue him and get a judgment as with most loans if he moves back to the us he'll likely be subject to garnishment the bigger issue is that it is ethically wrong to take out a loan with no intention of paying it back it sounds like he's using the i can't find a job in my field excuse to avoid his commitments personally i have a bs in physics and there are more than enough jobs out there remember you're a taxpayer he's leaving you to pay the bill Bond Mortgage Bank Government debt Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Education in the United States Debt Unemployment benefit Corporation Taxation in the United States Graduate school Education in Germany Capitalism Inflation Predatory lending Microeconomics Donald Trump Economy of Russia Tax Deflation (economics) Health insurance Economy of the United States Money Child support Wal-Mart Weimar Republic 401(k) Bretton Woods system Usury FairTax Debt consolidation Schabir Shaik Trial History of the United States (1918-1945) Finance Subsidy United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Reparations for slavery Citigroup Unemployment Annuity Capital accumulation Publicly funded medicine Gold standard Anarchism and capitalism Minimum wage Short selling Government National Mortgage Association Economy of India Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Plame affair United States Postal Service Security (finance) U.S. public debt Internet fraud Social Security debate (United States) Money supply Financial markets Appeal Bank fraud History of post-Soviet Russia Tax resistance Goodness and value theory Medicare (Canada) Professor Barbara Boxer Social Credit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Affirmative action Compensation of employees Divorce Mutual fund Payroll Epistemology Developing countries' debt Economy of Pakistan Rick Santorum Theodicy Federal National Mortgage Association Arthur Laffer Tertiary education fees in Australia Temasek Holdings Tuition Personal finance Mensal__o scandal Article One of the United States Constitution
