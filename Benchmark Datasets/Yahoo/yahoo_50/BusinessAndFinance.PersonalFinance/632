wage garnishment release question i had a judgement against me for a past debt i missed a payment and my employer received an order to garnish my wages i paid the debt before the garnishment was to start and the collections firm is faxing me a release of the garnishment as well as filing it with the court i work in missouri my question is what should my employer do i share an office with our payroll person and she is not sure adp does our actual payroll everything i've read says that the employer should pretty much be off the hook once the release is filed but since the garnishment never started i'm just not sure i don't want my employer to get in trouble over my financial problems i would really like if someone in this field i e paralegal at a collections firm a payroll person who has done garnishments would answer my question my employer has not started the garnishment do they still need to start it do they need to file anything with the circuit court i work for a very small company we don't often have this kind of situation your employer does not have to start that garnishment there is no trouble they will get into if they don't i mean at the most what are talking about here a couple of weeks before the garnishment release gets to them advising them to stop anyway remember when the collections firm sends the release to the court the court will then send a release to your employer what the firm is faxing to you is a copy of the release for this precise reason so you can prove you paid it to your employer the only way an employer would ever have any consequences of not obeying an order for garnishment is if there was a serious delay in starting it such as several months or if the employer refused to do it as many employers do in that case there would be non compliance papers filed with the court by the collections firm and your employer could be fined nominally however the only reason your employer would ever end up dealing with such consequences is if the collections firm pursued it the court could not care less if the debt is paid their job is merely to provide the tools to legally collect it believe me the court is not following up on your case or any other case for that matter the garnishment could sit dormant for two years with no funds being paid at all and the court would never even notice it would only be when the court was notified by the collections firm that the employer wasn't cooperating that anything would ever result from a garnishment not being done so if the collections firm has been paid by you already obviously they're not interested in pursuing that garnishment so you can tell your payroll person all of this and if she still needs something on paper to prove she is safe to not begin garnishing you just give her a copy of the release they are faxing to you if for some reason she felt compelled to still comply with the garnishment until she got the mailed release you would be refunded anything extra you paid laws vary from state to state but i'm pretty sure that mo law is not that different from ours here in oh Child support Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Tax Microeconomics Tax protester Appeal Paralegal Public domain Divorce FairTax Minimum wage Credit card Lawyer Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Trade union Article One of the United States Constitution Corporate governance Enron Corporation Annuity Payroll United Kingdom corporation tax Copyright Contract Same-sex marriage in Canada Unemployment Schabir Shaik Trial Economy of Russia Government of Maryland Legal aspects of transsexualism GNU General Public License Law firm 401(k) Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Password Bank fraud Advance fee fraud W.
