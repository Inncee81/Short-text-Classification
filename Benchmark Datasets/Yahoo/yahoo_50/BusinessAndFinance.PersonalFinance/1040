my hubby lost money in stocks and he intend to declare bankruptcy what shall i do i am in a lost i am an idiot in stocks i only knew that he is buying on contra and the shares are dropping and he have to pay abt k i am an idiot in stocks i juz knew that he is doing contra and that the shares dropping tremendously and it is time he sell and lost will be abt k your husband can declare bankruptcy without you being included however you need to be aware that if he declares bankruptcy and those debts are jointly owned you will be responsible for them bankruptcy standards are very stringent now so he really should think this through especially if you own your own home i suggest that you check with your states bankruptcy court website to see how this affects you as a spouse you can go to www uscourts gov and find the bankruptcy court in your state because they should have plenty of information for you since i use to work as a clerk for a bankruptcy court i advise that you speak with an attorney and as required by the new bankruptcy law a credit counselor fyi it's pointless to call the bankruptcy court because they cannot discuss the law with you or how it will affect you i hope this is helpful Bankruptcy Enron Corporation Bond Taxation in the United States Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Divorce Marriage Stock Deflation (economics) SCO-Linux controversies Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Social Security (United States) Karl Rove Debt Poker jargon Appeal Sears Holdings Corporation Video game crash of 1983 Bankruptcy in the United States Royal Assent Dot-com Short selling Concurrent estate Annuity Lawyer Economy of Russia Fiat money Asian financial crisis Social Security debate (United States) United Airlines Timeline of the Enron scandal George W.
