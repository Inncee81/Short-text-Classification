what can a k used for well obviously it is for retirement if you are asking if it can be used for borrowing money the answer is yes extremely bad idea but it can be done the problem with borrowing against a k is that when you are no longer part of the k the loan is due in full within some short period of time or days i think if the loan is not repaid in that time frame then it is considered a premature withdrawal and the irs will charge you the penalty and you will have to pay taxes on the outstanding debt and there are many reasons for dropping out of the k plan if you get fired you are no longer part of the plan and when you are looking for a new job that is about the worst time to have a loan come due if you die you are no longer part of the plan at this point it doesn't make any difference to you but it's not a good idea to have a loan come due when your survivors are trying to straighten out your estate and the kicker is that if the company you work for gets bought goes out of business etc the plan is normally closed which means you are no longer part of the plan and the loan is due sometimes but not always the plan rolls over in that situation bad bad idea to borrow against a k Mortgage Life insurance Student loan Annuity Deflation (economics) 401(k) Debt Islamic banking Short selling Microcredit Hyperinflation Money Primerica Financial Services Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Stock Insurance Government debt Bank fraud Usury Bretton Woods system Great Depression Babylonian law Social Security (United States) Finance Credit card Bank Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Personal finance Inflation Poker jargon Interest Economy of the United States Keynesian economics Health insurance Subsidy Capitalism Marshall Plan Tertiary education fees in Australia Variable universal life insurance Annual percentage rate FairTax School of Salamanca History of the United States (1918-1945) Social Credit Municipal bond Savings and loan association Margin (finance) Unemployment benefit Schabir Shaik Trial Security (finance) Financial markets Islamic economics Mergers and acquisitions Microeconomics Donald Trump Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt bondage Asian financial crisis Social Security debate (United States) Warren Buffett Corporation Mortgage-backed security Deficit spending Debt levels and flows George W.
