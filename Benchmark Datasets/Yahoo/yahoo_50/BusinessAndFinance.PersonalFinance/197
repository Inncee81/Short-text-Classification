paying off debt help i financed furniture from a furniture store it was financed with interest until jan i have paid the original balance down to about i owe about on my car i have a credit card with a a balance i pay on of around here is the temptation i was offered and accepted it a line of credit for from bank of america i am tempted to pay these things off to raise my credit score and consolidate the balance to one account but the interest rate is flippin now the interest on the furniture in january will be higher than that should i continue making payments on the furniture until jan at percent and then pay the balance with some of this money it seems clear to me that if i pay it now while at i will be screwing myself into before it is really necessary should i just blow the off because of this interest rate any other suggestion that sounds like a good idea only use the line of credit for the more expensive debt when the deal runs out then try to pay off all of your debts according to the most expensive interest rates first then you will be paying the lowest possible interest on all debts Credit card Bank Debt Student loan Government debt Mortgage Microeconomics Interest Gold standard Bond Inflation Great Depression Derivative (finance) Personal finance Deflation (economics) Insurance Money Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Security (finance) Financial services Corporate finance Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Federal Reserve History of the United States (1918-1945) FairTax Arbitrage Internet fraud Monetary policy Mutual fund Arthur Laffer Bank fraud Social Security (United States) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Fiat money Capital accumulation U.S. public debt Islamic banking Investment bank Economy of Pakistan Tax Primerica Financial Services Tariff Keynesian economics Economy of Argentina Schabir Shaik Trial Economy of Chile Estoppel Annuity Asian financial crisis Debt consolidation Cost of capital Social Security debate (United States) Temasek Holdings 401(k) Predatory lending Baccarat Argentine Currency Board Mergers and acquisitions Supply and demand United Kingdom corporation tax Reaganomics Charles Ponzi Refinancing Savings and loan association Citigroup Economy of India Gross domestic product Social Credit Cheque Small business Municipal bond Law of value High-yield debt Euro Money supply Islamic economics Debt levels and flows Hong Kong Monetary Authority Anarchism and capitalism Marshall Plan Federal National Mortgage Association Pound sterling Microcredit Economic relations of Japan Privatization Economy of Romania Life insurance Pension Campaign finance reform Deficit spending Ponzi scheme
