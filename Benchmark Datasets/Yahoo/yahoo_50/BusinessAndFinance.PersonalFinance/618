if you are a lawyer or someone who knows about patents if i have all the schematics and details to build the product in my head but don't have it materialized can i still go to a patent attorney and explain it to him her or draw it up for him her please answer only if you know thank you this is not part of the patent attorney's job they are responsible for performing a prior art patent search for writing the application and submitting the application to the uspto us patent and trademark office although not experts in schematics drawings etc i am sure that you could find a patent attorney who would be willing to do those things at their usual hourly rate you would be much better off working with a mechanical engineer to get your idea down on paper make sure that this person has signed a non disclosure agreement so they won't steal your idea your first step should be a patent search to make sure that someone else hasn't already patented the idea you can do these free online it will be a very expensive and drawn out process good luck Patent application Patent attorney Trademark United States Patent and Trademark Office Plame affair Person having ordinary skill in the art Intellectual property Software patent Copyright Public domain Prior art Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions SCO-Linux controversies File Allocation Table Legal research Solar cell Software patents under the European Patent Convention Expert system William Murdoch Claim (patent) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Karl Rove European Patent Organisation Engineering Software patents under TRIPs Agreement Royal Assent New product development Quantum computer Incandescent light bulb Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Copyleft Notary public Wardenclyffe Tower Chester Carlson Perpetual motion European Patent Convention H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Scientific method Discovery (law) Polymerase chain reaction Software engineering Free trade Construction Fundamentals of Engineering exam Xerox Star MP3 Algorithm Patentable subject matter OpenDocument Copyright law of the United Kingdom Patentability Mozilla Firefox Carburetor A Course In Miracles Photography Business method patent GED Read-copy-update Charles Goodyear Attorney General Plastic Science Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Photocopying Google Common criticisms of Microsoft Law firm Pharmaceutical company Cold fusion Ethics Welding Trade secret Fountain pen Inventive step and non-obviousness Theory of conduct United States trademark law Monopoly (game) Search engine optimization Dennis Rader Synthesizer Intelligent design Salary United States patent law XML Lawyer Electronic Frontier Foundation First Amendment to the United States Constitution Insurance Open access Amazon.com Ownership Drill bit GNU General Public License Microwave auditory effect FireWire Heuristic Microeconomics Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities
