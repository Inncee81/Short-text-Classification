as a young person in your 's is it better to start saving for retirement or pay off debt my debt consists of student loans and a mortgage i contribute to a retirement plan with my job but i work for the government so there is no matching for my contributions should i severly reduce the retirement contribution or end it and focus on the debt i think you need a good balanced approach you need to pay off debt as well as increase investments not all debt is bad your mortgage should be the least of your concerns it is good debt as it is backed by an asset that theoretically will increase in value the student loan isn't even that bad because it's probably at a low interest rate you should establish a reasonable goal and time frame for paying it off now that being said i would not put all of my resources into paying off debt it sounds like the right thing to do but in reality saving for retirement is as much about how long you save as it it how much you save being in the market longer allows you more time to generate interest and compound your wealth if you put all of your resources into paying off debt you do lower your liabilities but you lose the opportunity to accumulate wealth as you do it in my opinion it is best to do it balanced if you were deep into credit card debt i may think otherwise but if all you have out there are mortgages and student loans you are really ahead of the game in your 's Mortgage Debt Personal finance Interest Primerica Financial Services Bond Capital accumulation Credit card Economy of Russia Insurance Capitalism Corporate finance 401(k) Student loan Security (finance) Annuity Inflation Collateralized debt obligation Monetary policy FairTax Keynesian economics Mutual fund Microcredit History of the United States (1918-1945) Bank Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Government debt Money supply Savings and loan association Mortgage-backed security Finance Social Security (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Surplus value Unemployment Social Security debate (United States) Economy of India Debt consolidation Great Depression Federal National Mortgage Association Citigroup Debt levels and flows Hyperinflation Economy of the United States Life insurance Microeconomics Deficit spending Economy of Africa Derivative (finance) Gold standard Financial services Political economy Pension Economy of Pakistan Privatization Refinancing Economy of Chile Economy of El Salvador Intellectual property Donald Trump Taxation in the United States Unemployment benefit Federal Reserve Corporation Liability Subsidy Gross domestic product Tax Reaganomics Mergers and acquisitions Marshall Plan Say's law Education in the People's Republic of China Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Government National Mortgage Association Anarchism and capitalism Economics Income trust Islamic banking Money creation Usury Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Predatory lending Wealth condensation Flat tax Progressive tax Tax cut Wealth Real estate bubble Tertiary education fees in Australia
