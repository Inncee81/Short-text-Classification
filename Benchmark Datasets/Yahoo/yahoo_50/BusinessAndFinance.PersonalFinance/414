money issues i am currently out of work and my husband is the only one working when he gets paid i call what he earns his money he says that what is mone is your and what is yours is mine but i feel that if i am out of work and havent gotten my disability yet his money isnt mine to spend people tend to disagree with me do you think i am in the right for believeing this he earned it he spends it he is right but i still feel the same as you i still agree with you i know exactly what you mean it's not my money until it is in my hands and if i have to ask for it i'm asking because it is his not mine my ex husband and i had the same discussion over and over again in my case though when i asked for money he would give it to me but then he'd ask what for even if it was to buy something for the house or necessary toilet paper etc i would feel angered and hurt 'does he think i'm gonna blow it on shoes and ice cream ' mostly i felt that he didn't trust me though i knew it was just a simple question it made me feel more miniscule and childlike to have to give explanations still above having to ask for money from him personally it made me feel less and had a giant effect on my self esteem strage how something so insignificant and knowingly wrong could do that i knew it was our money our bills our everything but i couldn't shake that feeling of being looked down on no matter how comfortable he tried to make me i think if it was given to me without expectations or questions like an allowance a gift i would have been better maybe now with my current bf we both work after bills are paid and the necessary has been covered if i have 'spending money' left over i'll just hand him what i want to give him if it is the end of the pay period and he's got left i'll give him another if i have it to spare without a word or hide it in his wallet to give him a good day surprise when he finds it he may ask what's this for to make sure it's not allotted for something i'll say whatever you need and he does the same for me Plame affair EastEnders Money Theory of conduct Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socrates Inflation FairTax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Contract Keynesian economics Toilet Social rule Schabir Shaik Trial StarCraft: Uprising Sin City One Tree Hill (TV series) Economic inequality 1957 World Series Milton H.
