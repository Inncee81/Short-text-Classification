should i consolidate my student loans what are the risks and benefits pros and cons i just graduated with k in student loans and i'm wondering if it's worth it to consolidate or if i should leave my loans as they are my rate is a bit over and my payments which start in december will be about a month i have a friend who is married to a guy in a wheelchair that has always said that she would never consolidate her student loans because if you do your loans aren't forgiven in case of complete disability as her husband's were on the other hand a lower interest rate would be nice what factors should i consider when deciding whether to consolidate if consolidating would be a good choice are there any particular lenders that you would recommend if your student loans have different interest rates then you may want to consider consolidating them once the interest rate has fallen below your lowest interest rate if you owe student loans to more than lender you may want to consider consolidating your loans for the convienience of making monthly payment and saving all the interest you'd pay with multiple loans if you are able bodied your student loans would not be forgiven under any circumstances consolidated or not in any case my husband declared bankruptcy a couple of years before we got married and his student loans were the only debts not forgiven during that process as with any loan if you are considering consolidation do your research carefully there are several student loan companies that do consolidations check with your state's higher education authority there may be a couple of state authorized corporations that deal exclusively with student loans and consolidations these corporations would give you the best interest rates and the best financial terms for repayment in the state of kentucky that corporation is the kentucky higher education student loan corporation they handled the financing of all of my student loans in college and i was able to consolidate at a great rate once i graduated this is leaving me with more money as i am not paying out interest payments on the multiple loans i took out for college every month Student loan Bond Debt Mortgage Bank Interest Credit card Deflation (economics) Insurance Debt consolidation Monetary policy Finance Subsidy United Kingdom corporation tax Predatory lending Annuity Microeconomics Financial markets Credit score Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard Money 401(k) Life insurance Bankruptcy Divorce Economy of the United States Privatization Tuition History of the United States (1918-1945) Corporation U.S. public debt Donald Trump Municipal bond Savings and loan association Islamic banking Personal finance Federal National Mortgage Association Social Security debate (United States) Hyperinflation Primerica Financial Services Derivative (finance) Bank fraud Taxation in the United States Graduate school Social Security (United States) Tax FairTax Federal Reserve Usury Microcredit Capital accumulation Education in the People's Republic of China Estoppel Unemployment Asian financial crisis Capitalism Lender of last resort Economy of Pakistan Collateralized debt obligation Rational pricing Mergers and acquisitions Health care in the United States Corporate finance Savings and Loan crisis EastEnders Inflation Credit history Deficit spending Great Depression Yield curve Bretton Woods system Tennessee State Constitution Marriage Financial services Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Enron Corporation College admissions Temasek Holdings Education in New Zealand Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Payday loan Mutual fund School of Salamanca Price discrimination Lend-Lease
