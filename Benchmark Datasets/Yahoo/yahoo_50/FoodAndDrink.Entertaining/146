how to throw a cookout ok so i'm planning this huge cookout i need a list of things to get do buy prepare etc like find a location get a dj rent tables and chairs so on and so on i don't want to forget anything basically i need the steps to planning a huge cookout thanks my family and i do this all the time at least times per summer we have this down and can do it on a great budget without it looking like it first of all find a location depending on where you live you should check out some state parks i live in ny and most of the state parks are nice clean and have plenty of activities swimming boating volleyball sports diamond etc and you can rent a pavillion for less than if you are willing to take the chance you could just show up really early in the morning and hope for the best we went to one weeks ago and had a huge pavillion in saratoga state park with picnic tables a double sided grill a volley ball court and garbage it was really nice and the kids had a blast when i say kids i am including husband uncles father in law etc they actually were more amusing than the children for a dj i would do some thinking into this djs can be quite expensive and depending on your venue they might require permits insurance etc also it's a huge expense and you have to think of all those that are saved generally what i do is ask everyone i know if they have a boom box stereo or i pod with speakers i tell everyone to bring them then you can have music in each area of your event for example where my mother in law is sitting with the elders of our family we do old school music she gets offended by the blasphemy of modern music where the guys are grilling i do old school rap they love it and feel young again i put one near the volley ball court with a decent radio station and then one near the spades table with a good mix cd for the food i highly suggest that you try to delegate your side dishes out to others for example my mother in law makes a great potato salad my father in law makes great fried rice my aunt makes a great taco salad when i ask them to make and bring it i make sure to say that he she makes the best so they almost feel flattered to bring a dish also don't be afraid to use some store bought items there are two dishes that i am asked to bring to every event one is a spinach dip the recipe is on the back of the knorr's vegetable soup mix box the second is baked beans i always bring a tray of baked beans it's an odd thing but everyone loves them especially the kids i just dress them up with a little sauteed onion ketchup mustard and brown sugar i actually like to add bacon to the top but considering all the non pork eaters i have finally stopped doing this cook them in the oven for hour before you are about to leave and then just warm them up before the meal is served just let people bring what they make well another good cheap option is corn on the cob buy a ton of it everyone loves it especially the kids and it's really cheap for meat i tend to go pretty cheap it can get very expensive first things first while planning i buy whatever i find on sale i don't think that i need to provide piece for each individual for example the last bbq we had a weeks ago i only had one rack of ribs and we cooked them up first come first serve there were only about of us at this one so it wasn't a big deal but keep things in perspective also buy frozen meat i always buy bags of frozen chicken legs and thighs for bbqs generally you can get about pieces for i just season them with seasoning salt the night before and put them in the fridge the night before i also buy boxes of burgers and franks the main thing is to make sure you have enough buns to match the amount of burgers and hot dogs you have for something special you may want to add some more special food i hate them but many people do but i always buy two bushles of clams just put them on the grill when they are done toss them in an foil pan with butter you have melted on the grill you can do the same with a few pounds of shrimp before hand just mix some salt pepper and fresh garlic with some butter then mix some peeled deviened shrimp then just pop on the grill don't forget all the condiments bbq sauce ketchup mustard relish butter hot sauce salt pepper etc whatever your family likes and lots of snacks chips fruit snacks crackers and cheese veggies and dip etc we generally skip any type of dessert other than watermelon sometimes my mother will bring a pineapple upside down cake but i think that fruit is good for a bbq as for paper products buy at least four for each person if you are having people make sure you have at least plates cups forks napkins etc at least for example you can get a pack of paper plates but people generally take more than one at a time keep that in mind also depending on there you are you may want table cloths citronella candles for bugs clorox clean up wipes baby wipes bug spray sunscreen etc i almost forgot the most important thing plenty of aluminum pans to transfer your grilled food onto as for chairs and tables everyone you know should bring their own lawn chairs on their own but you might want to remind them actually remind everyone so that the word gets around also many people have folding card tables ask them to bring them the same with coolers you will need a ton of them for drinks alone a few things that i also don't forget are a few decks of cards baseball and bat volley ball badmitton stuff water balloons board games etc lots of things to do if things are really big i will also throw a few extra pair of old sneakers t shirts and socks in the car you know there is always someone who gets wet dirty or comes in heels i think i have included all that i plan but this is just the basics often people bring their own stuff extras never hurt just sale shop from the minute you find your venue Volleyball Australian words Coffee Kosher foods Vegetarianism Meal Russian cuisine Dairy Burger Food
