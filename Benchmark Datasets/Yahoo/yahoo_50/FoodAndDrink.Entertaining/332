my year old daughter wants to have a high school musical themed b day party any suggestions for food activites decor would be greatly appreciated we like to go all out for bday parties so the more elaborate the better but any all ideas would be a big help thx like everyones been saying supplies are everywhere since high school musical is really popular right now have posters on the wall like flyers around a high school saying go wildcats or audition for musical and go east high have games like musical chairs have the kids put their gifts under their chair and play the soundtrack for the music when you stop wherever the birthday girl is she opens that present this way no one gets out so theres no upset kids or tears bonus also play freeze dance too kids love that color scheme with red and white put up basket ball nets and have them play horse with a nerf ball since they are the kids will probably be whiped out around the end leave about hours at the end of the party and put the movie in put out pillows and blankets to just in case the kids fall asleep have fun Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Shaggy dog story Our Gang The Brady Bunch Pinball Eric Cartman Comanche Lucille Ball Wedding Crashers Goa trance music About a Boy Scooby-Doo Into the West (miniseries) The Price Is Right The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Morning Musume AFI 100 Years series Saved by the Bell C__line Dion SpongeBob SquarePants MTV2 Kodocha Swingout Marching band One Tree Hill (TV series) Western (genre) Limp Bizkit The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Professional wrestling match types Billiards Peter Gabriel Little Shop of Horrors THX 1138 Spidey Super Stories Volleyball Tag Care Bears Birthday Cardcaptor Sakura Charmed Milton H.
