idea i was thinking i would make it a monster dance do you think that is ok for that age and do you have any other ideas to add i know its a bit early to think about halloween but i have to start now by the way the whole class is invited and they are allowed to bring friends and family so it is really big thank you i am putting this question in many different catagories so i can get more answers and from lots of different people thankyou pica thank you very much also thanks to my other answer too party ideas monster footprints with a magic marker draw a footprint in a big sponge cut out the footprint pour washable paint in an inch aluminum pan press the sponge in the paint and sponge footsteps up your sidewalk to your front door for trick or treaters to follow or around the side of your dark spooky house flip the sponge upside down to stamp the other foot green pumpkins great idea carve green peppers as jack o lanterns you can have a whole row of them and there are yellow and red peppers to try as well have a whole army of scary faces to greet goblins at your door they will never recover from the fright ghosties crumple up a piece of tissue paper into a ball place it into the center of a flat piece of tissue paper pick up the corners of the flat tissue and twist it around the ball tie a twist tie or a piece of string around the ghosts's neck draw a face with a felt pen you can hang them up all over the house you can also glue on yarn and make a black hat and cape from colored paper to make a witch wicked wicked witch cut the top off of a cardboard milk carton and discard cover the carton with black construction paper and tape at the back cut a strip of white paper inches wide and tape around the top over the black paper draw a scary witch's face on the white paper glue on some yarn for the hair make a cone shaped witch's hat with black paper and glue to the top cut out arms and hands from white paper cut out feet from black paper tape them to the witch glue a popsickle stick to one of the witch's hands cut out two small pieces of yellow paper and cut a fringe on the bottom glue one on each side of the end of the popsickle stick for the broom you can give these to your friends if you are having a halloween party bobbing ghosts start with a piece of cheesecloth yards long and yard wide place a helium filled balloon white is best in the middle of the fabric and gather loosely around balloon draw a horrid mask on the cloth with a felt pen you can put some ghosts in a box and when people open the box the ghosts will float up and scare everyone or you can place them on string in front of an open window or a fan and watch them gently move in the breeze icky cobwebs cut some string into foot lengths and tape them to the ceiling you should have a very dim room for this just before the victim arrives you can hold a bowl of water up to the string and get it wet when people walk in the wet slimy string will brush across their foreheads and scare them body parts this is a good decoration for a dimly lit room at party time have several bowls of body parts displayed to horrify your friends cut up a bunch of hot dogs lenghwise for severed fingers cook some spaghetti noodles and add some red and blue food coloring for veins a bunch of cocktail onions rolling around in a bowl looks like eyeballs fill a red balloon with warm water and spread it with strawberry jam invite your guests to touch your brain crunching bones underfoot spread some dried bread and pretzels under a rug when your guests walk across the rug it will sound like crunching bones underfoot sound effects you can record several scary sounds and play it back during the festivities a very large sheet of poster board or sheet metal makes great thunder uncooked rice poured onto a cookie sheet sounds like rain crinkle a handful of cellophane for a roaring fire to get a good scream you can well scream snap carrots in half for the sound of breaking bones flap a plastic bag in front of the microphone for the sound of bats slowly blow bubbles with a straw into a bowl for that bog sound hunt around your house and the garden to find a squeaky hinge somewhere and tape it before someone gets to it with a can of oil lighting when you have everything so dimly lit it's a good idea to have some reflective tape over the exits a black light bulb is always a good effect especially if you are dressed as a skeleton http www familymanagement com holidays halloween party ideas html here is a site with lots of ideas http familyfun go com parties holiday
