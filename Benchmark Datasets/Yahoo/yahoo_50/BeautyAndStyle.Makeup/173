why my eyes is red on pictures the light of the flash occurs too fast for the iris of the eye to close the pupil light is focused onto the blood rich retina at the back of the eye and the image of the illuminated retina is transmitted to the camera resulting in the red appearance of the eye on the photo this principle is used in fundoscopy an eye examination used to examine the retina by using an opthalmoscope wherein a positve ror or red reflex is a normal finding the effect is generally more pronounced in people with grey or blue eyes and in children this is because pale irises have less melanin in them and so allow more light to pass through to the retina children despite superficial appearances do not have larger pupils but their pupils are more reactive to light and are able to open to the fullest extent in low light conditions in many species the tapetum lucidum a light reflecting layer behind the retina which improves night vision intensifies this effect this leads to variations in the colour of the reflected light from species to species cats for example display blue yellow pink or green eyes in flash photographs both sites below have info about preventing red eye Iris (anatomy) Color Eye color Night vision Pupil Color blindness Cat Stereoscopy Albinism RGB color model Eye examination Diabetic retinopathy Light-emitting diode Sun Macular degeneration Visual system Traffic light Color vision Uvea Melanin Ultraviolet Autostereogram Gamut Digital photography Human skin color Retinal detachment Single-lens reflex camera Bicycle lighting Sensation Glaucoma Technicolor Tuatara Parallax Digital camera Chlorpromazine Fluorescein angiography Cheetah Philosophy of perception Eyepiece Heterochromia Explosive material Welding Glasses Speed of light Eye contact Rainbow Color constancy Aurora (astronomy) Cat coat genetics Light pollution Floater Depth of field Hypertension Leopard Hair color Perspective projection distortion Walleye Hypoglycemia Color theory Persistence of vision Eyeglass prescription Road-rule enforcement camera Evidence of evolution Lightning Pixel Myopia Staining (biology) Iridology Binoculars Cytomegalovirus Diamond Cornea Primary color Photographic lens Action potential Criticality accident X-ray Contact lens Tocopherol Shark Konica Minolta Extraterrestrial skies Red eye (medicine) Wood Image intensifier Photography Ozone depletion
