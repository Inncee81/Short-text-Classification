i'm now running my own makeup business any advice on where i can find sales people to help me sell my product do you have school age children if so try joining the pta where you'll have lots of exposure to housewives who might appreciate making some extra money or you could ask all the moms of your child's class if they would like to come to your house for coffee and bagels one morning after the kids are at class either way let them know ahead that you'll be giving your spiel but under no obligation to sign up your invitation could read something clever like come and relax for bagels and coffee or tea and please listen to a minute spiel from me i promise no pressure and no obligation but the extra income could mean that dream vacation so come with an open mind i won't take forever at the very least it'll be fun to get together another audience to target would be women in your neighborhood you could use the same poem above but instead of a traditional invitation perhaps you could make up a flyer to put in their mailboxes and finally one last way to advertise your search for sales people might be to put a small ad under the employment section in either your local paper or a pennysaver type ad that circulates in your community just briefly say outside sales positions available for locally managed cosmetic company send resume' salary requirements etc either mail or fax so that we might contact you for an interview it's tough getting started but a good committed sales force can make the difference just remember to keep them motivated with positive methods and not with any form of punishment good luck Advertising Social rule Wal-Mart Coffeehouse Insurance Mail Illegal drug trade Microeconomics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Leeds United F.C.
