makeup tips please answer ok i have blondebrown hair greenblue eyes and fair skin i have freckles incase that helps and i am still in middle school what shades of mascara eyeliner lipgloss and eyeshadow would look best on me if you have any tricks or tips to applying these please tell me i find it difficult to apply mascara on the bottom lash line still hair always brush it there was a girl in my grade who never brushed her hair and it was awful take time with it i can't tell you which styles will look best because i know nothing about your appearance makeup you're only in th grade don't overdo it maybe a little concealer if needed eyeliner not too dark if you have a pale complexion brown eyeliner works better than black but if you have darker skin black is better don't overdo it here's a tip for putting on eyeliner when putting it on pull the skin below your eyes down and put the liner on the inside of the lid not the skin below the lid also if you want to put some on the top just put a teensy bit right on the line or right where the lash meets skin and when putting liner on top or bottom lids start at the outside lid and only go about halfway in it makes your eyes look bigger and it looks better than if you put it all the way across mascara one coat is enough and only put it on the top lashes then lightly blink and some will get on the bottom lashes always have a eyelash comb handy to get the clumps out blush most people in middle school don't even use blush but some do if you do make sure it's a color that suits your skin tone don't get too dark of a color or too red or pink that will make you look like a china doll also just apply at little but lightly blow on the brush before you apply the blush to your cheeks follow your cheek bone smile when applying makes it easier don't put too much on eyeshadow using more than one color looks better than one color all the way through but it's not a must also don't always pick a color to match your shirt pick a color that looks nice with your skin tone say your going to wear brown eyeshadow put a darker brown right along your lashline then a medium brown up to the middle crease then a light brown swept almost up to your eyebrow but slant the line so it's not like a straight line that will look weird lips don't wear lipstick wear lipgloss clear lipgloss no one in middle school wears color on their lips just clear lipgloss to make them shiny everyone loves shiny lip Physical attractiveness Dragon Booster Tattoo Death rock fashion Drawing Cat coat genetics Cheetah Pottery My Little Pony Physical characteristics of the Buddha Hair RuneScape quests Fast bowling Knife Eye contact Paul Is Dead Comanche Professional wrestling match types Black (people) Drill bit Aerial (dance move) Melanin Blue Shaggy dog story Barbie Snooker Horse Black Avril Lavigne Billiards Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Men in Black Harmonica Color Joker (comics) Red hair Skin Gothic Lolita Social rule White (people) Depilation Lipstick Color theory Sinfest Diamond enhancement Mario St. Louis Cardinals Sunglasses Violin AFI 100 Years series Race of Jesus Sea-Monkey Princess Zelda Pubic hair Boxing World Series Dog 613 mitzvot Cleveland Browns Wassily Kandinsky Pachypodium baronii Great Teacher Onizuka Blond Combine (Half-Life 2) Chopsticks Rose Siberian Husky Haircut Eye color Netsuke Professional wrestling throws Textile manufacturing Elephant Sushi
