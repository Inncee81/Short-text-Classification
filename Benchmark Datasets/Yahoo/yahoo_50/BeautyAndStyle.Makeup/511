make eyes pop alright so i have a few questions but first i'll give you some details i don't use alot of make up mostly eyeliner and clear lip gloss and i'm out i have big round almond ish shaped eyes and dark brown redish hair don't know if it helps i really love colour so what colour of eye liner will make my eyes stand out i love colour but darker ones not really bright i use black eyeliner and they really pop but i would like another colour to change sometimes what eye liners do you recomend something that lasts i saw one that's really thick the part you use isn't really like a pencil more like a long oval is it good if you know what i mean if seen some people talk about a roll on eyeliner what brand is it from and is it good remember i don't have time to reaplly it so it has to last thanks sorry i forgot my eyes are green to make your pop i think that it is more of the way u draw on the eyeliner u can try drawing on the upper inner lashline to make your eye lashes to thicker and bottom outer eye lash area but not all the way try drawing only area of the eye leaving the eye tip empty try using a white eyeliner for that area draw on the inner area to make your eyes brighter and wider also to make your eyeliner last try powdering your lids or apply concealer or primer this will help your eyeliner to stay put i recommend urban decay eye primer u can use white and brown or black for more fun use dark blue dark green turquoise if you are fairer hmm i think u meant the sponge part right it's meant for u to smudge your eyeliner when u want sort of a smokey eye look if u want something that really lasts try using liquid eyeliner which also gives u more dramatic look too but for pencil i recommend estee lauder i havent heard of roll on eyeliner but only roll on eyeshadow Cosmetics Dragon Booster Cat coat genetics Cheetah R.E.M.
