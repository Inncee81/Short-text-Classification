will my mascara get dry and flaky okay i bought this mascara a week ago and i haven opened it yet i was hoping to open it later like say in september because thats when i will need it so my question is if i don't open the tube till september will it by all dry and gross by the time i do open it or will it matter if i open it say today or will it end up dry and gross by september im pretty confused but the only reason i wanna keep it closed till september is coz i know it will only last me six months so if i open it now i'll need a new one sooner help i get what ur saying i heard of some ppl opene up a tube of mascara from the back and it was dry and flaky so yeah its a good idea to not open it until september when u will use it i dont think it will really make a diff if it ever get dry just put a drop of water into the tube dont ever use your own spit that can infect your eye eventualy and thats really gross Mascara The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Textile manufacturing Flax She Loves You Dialysis Hay Hip hop collaborations Hall & Oates Urinary incontinence Charles Goodyear Blonde on Blonde Terri Schiavo Spice Girls Social rule Gottfried Leibniz Gregorian calendar I Want to Hold Your Hand Professional wrestling match types Time Out of Mind Green Line "D" Branch Garlic USS Trigger (SS-237) Hemp I Don't Wanna Cry Ocean's Twelve Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Happy Tree Friends Protein-energy malnutrition Mooncake Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Cliff Richard Gross domestic product Spina bifida About a Boy Atomic Kitten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ron and Fez Judith Miller (journalist) Paint Billboard Hot 100 Tobacco Port Authority Trans-Hudson Flute Avenue Q USS Seadragon (SS-194) Kate Moss Noel Gallagher John Dalton Poker jargon Punt (boat) Theory of conduct Paul W.
