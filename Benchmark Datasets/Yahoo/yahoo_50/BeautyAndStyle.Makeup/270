m a c makeup can anyone tell me about it how much does is cost is it good is it the best brand i can buy i just need to know as much as i can about it thank you i've been a mac collector for the past years and love it cost depends on what you want to but lipsticks and gloses average foundations run you about eyeshadows are as far as it being the best brand well every brand of makeup has something to offer to the world of cosmetics for example mac offers great eyeshadows in a variety of colors but urban decay has the best base for eyeshadow primer potion and clinique has the best skin care line in my opinion your everyday mac fanatic will tell you it is the best and granted in my opinion mac has a lot going for it but there are other great lines out there with things to offer a good site you might want to check out and become a member of for free is www specktra net there's lots of mac addicts on there as the site is originally dedicated to mac lovers but they also talk about and review the other makeup lines from high end to drug store brands and gve reccomendations most people will argue that mac is pricey but it's no more pricey than any other high end makeup brand in my opinion for the amount of color you get it's worth the price i have eyeshadows that i purchased almost years ago because the color payback is so great there are some great drug store brands that offer great colors but i have yet to find one that allows me to put on a small amount to get a lot of color like mac does to me buying mac is like buying in bulk sure you don't need rolls of toilet paper in a house of two people but it saves you money in the end cause you won't have to go out and buy as much of it as often hope this helps btw someone up further said that the eyeshadows cost they do if you get the eyeshadows that come in the just the pan but if you do this then you need to get the palette to hold the shadows as well this sounds confusing but if you have a mac store store not counter near you they can explain what i'm talking about Mac OS X Cosmetics Apple Computer IPod Tattoo Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation United States dollar FairTax Hyperinflation Wal-Mart Illegal drug trade CPU cache Monopoly (game) Publicly funded medicine Bulk vending PNG ITunes Music Store Handloading National Kidney Foundation Singapore Digital photography Dither Cigarette Hydrogen economy Capital accumulation Mortgage Fleetwood Mac Filling station Credit card Neopets Intellectual property MMORPG Supply and demand Slot machine Theory of conduct RuneScape economy Drug addiction Apple Macintosh The Washington Times Mutual fund Solar cell Diablo II Berkshire Hathaway Spaceward, Ho!
