high school help plz well im gonna be a freshman in highschool in about a week or so and my school decided to have picture day on the first day of school i think that soooo retarted well i dunno if thats how all high schools do it but i was just used to having it a lot later in the year but anyways but the point is i dont think im gonna have a lot of time to make sure i look ok for picture day because of stressing over if i everything being on time etc etc etc so any quick makeup hair tips will be awesome its uniforms so clothes dont matter lol thanks p s i have naturaly wavy light brown hair with side bangs and prefer a kind of natural makeup look no heavy foundation well to answer the impression question i just wanna leave a good impression and look cute not like some person who tried to hard or look to heavily made up my eyes are hazel and a little shimmer is good oh and as far as foundation wise i only use powder mwah thx the tips every well it might help to plan everything out ahead of time see if you're more organized in the morning things will be smoother i know that picture day is stressful enough and first day of school even more stress so try this if you want your first day to be easier on yourself try writing down a list of things that you need to do in the morning of that day brush teeth makeup breakfast whatever you do in the morning write it down after you've figured out everything you'll be doing try figuring out how long it takes to do every thing brush teeth two minutes makeup fifteen minutes breakfast five minutes etc add up the time and see what you get let's say everything will take you two hours this means you might want to tack on say half an hour for any imperfections in your schedule or maybe a little oversleeping with me so far after you've got down everything you'll be doing and how long try to plan out a schedule make sure you know what time you'll be leaving your house or what time a bus gets there so if it'll take you two and a half hours as explained above you'll want to figure out the right time to wake up based on those two factors so now you should have a schedule starting from the time your alarm goes off to when you're leaving perfect almost you have to make sure your schedule will work sometime soon before school actually starts try out your schedule and make sure it works pretend like it's your first day and go through your schedule exactly like you planned once you've tested it make some corrections so now it comes down to that first day your schedule should be complete by now but here's tips to save time getting ready makeup a very subtle look is good especially since you like it more it looks a lot better in your picture with a more natural makeup you don't want to put a whole lot on especially since it will take up time some soft eyeshadow should work but dramatize your eyes with more mascara very soft blush if absolutely needed and skip the foundation concealer etc unless you can't live without it i don't wear either and it saves me a lot of time but you must wear coverup pictures bring out your flaws as far as your face is concerned so not covering up blemishes will make things even worse hair well what do you normally do would be my question i have to brush it then put two kinds of creames in before anything else then i have to straighten it with a flat iron add some texture cream and chunk up my hair then comb it out a little then add more cream yeah so you're in luck taking a shower the night before might be a good idea instead of taking it in the morning if you normally do so it makes flyaways easier to tame plus it's a huge time saver shower lot of time especially if you have to blowdry your hair and all that jazz just do whatever you normally do to your hair but don't put it up wearing your hair up in a picture will make your hairstyle look strange since they are shot from an angle take it from my personal experience and don't put it up unless you're absolutely running lately though i'd make hair a priority so i hope all this helps in a basic review plan out a schedule and test it wear little makeup but wear enough take a shower the night before if possible and do not put your hair up in the morning style your hair as normal if not a little jazzier i'm a starting freshman to tell you the truth freshmen unite Cosmetics Extreme Programming 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters in the Smurfs The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada RuneScape quests Theodicy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Slow Train Coming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drill bit Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Taxi Driver Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct The Apprentice 2 Roswell UFO incident The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kurt Angle The Lovely Bones EastEnders Education in Romania Textile manufacturing Oh My Goddess!
