my lawn is totally covered in dandelion weeds how do i get rid of them so when we bought this new house the lawn was in pretty rough shape but we've been too busy to fix it well now its making me crazy our lawn is completely covered with dandelion weeds more weeds than lawn we have tried killing them with weed killer some weeds died we've tried reseeding overseeding tearing it up in sections its all been such a pain any ideas on how to effectively kill all the weeds and revitalize our lawn so that it is green and thick we live in nw oregon pretty mild climate although we've been known to have some warm summers we're not super rich so we'd like it to be relatively affordable if at all possible thanks so much for any suggestions okay here's what i would do get fertilome weed free zone i am not kidding this is the best weed killer there is spray it on a very hot afternoon not a windy day though because it can drift and damage plants you don't want to kill in the fall plant a cool season grass and put down an organic lawn amendment i like nature's guard soil activator or revive you have too keep the ground really moist to get grass seed to germinate the key to seeding a lawn is soil preparation if you are having a hard time seeding your lawn you may need to till in some compost or something i don't think this is usually a problem in oregon though in the very early spring put down a pre emergent there are good organic ones made from corn glutten that provide nitrogen too and soil activator or revive again also in early spring aerate your lawn make sure you do this before it starts to get really hot never ever mow your lawn any shorter than and make sure you always have a sharp mower blade it is a good idea to sharpen it every spring apply the pre emergent every spring and soil activator every fall and you should establish a healthy lawn it often takes a season or even two or three so be patient also most of these products are not incredibly expensive they are pretty comparable to any other fertilizer hope this helps Weed control Weed Compost Lawn mower Herbicide Organic farming Lawn Sewage treatment Biodynamic agriculture Agriculture Creeping Charlie Vermicompost Mulch Yosemite National Park Sorghum Tillage Comfrey Tobacco Barley Vegetation Carnivorous plant Houseplant Organic food Illegal drug trade Cannabis cultivation Coffee Oat Cannabis (drug) Organic gardening Combine harvester Apple Garden Strawberry Leaf Ecology Peanut Earthworm The Adventures of Pete & Pete Cereal Knife Masanobu Fukuoka Sugar beet Orchidaceae Dandelion Drill bit Humus Rice Brewery Autonomous building Alfalfa Norman Borlaug Global warming and agriculture Gypsy moth Wheat Ozone depletion Crop circle Maize Tea Famine Seed Organic horticulture Soils retrogression and degradation Flowering plant Solar power Soil Stratification (botany) Fruit tree propagation Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Casting Weather lore Ozone hole Pesticide Thermoregulation Rapeseed Biology of the Sierra Nevada Drooping Brome Eutrophication Potato Black pepper Glacier Carbon dioxide sink Digitaria Prostate cancer Bonsai Giant Sequoia 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Elis Prefecture Flax Climate of the United Kingdom Olive
