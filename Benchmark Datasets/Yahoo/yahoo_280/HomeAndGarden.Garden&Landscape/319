has anyone ever noticed on room to grow their gardens are crap i was watching room to grow most of the days of last week and they suck at making an actual flowerbed they just have a nice patio with some shrubs and mulch it looks bare all the time most of the time they don't have any flowers other than boring green shrubs they suck at making those gardens what do you guys think yeah i agree especially when you compare their work to the unbelievable landscaping projects they do on groundbreakers and landscape challenge but i think it all has to do with money because they spend big on groundbreakers and landscape challenge ever notice too when they do makeovers that they use little gallon plants which look dwarfed in rather large garden spaces Garden Gardening Landscape architecture Ocean's Twelve Roxette The Young Ones (TV series) Broom (shrub) Shrub Dogwood Pansy Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne King Khalid International Airport Permaculture Make money fast Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Mulch Banksia Plant References to Star Trek Craps Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Francis Bacon (painter) Pachypodium ambongense Grafting Pachypodium bicolor Flowering plant Chatsworth House Rose Kyle Broflovski Le Corbusier Fruit tree propagation Infidels Lawn The Catcher in the Rye Sears Holdings Corporation Viva La Bam Flower Cannabis cultivation Pachypodium Honey fungus Irrigation Xeriscaping Buildings of Iowa State University Elderberry Hedge (gardening) Eric Bischoff Philipp Franz von Siebold Olive Carlton Gardens, Melbourne Autonomous building Forsythia Forest gardening Cotoneaster Hamster Hamilton, Ontario Little Britain John Claudius Loudon Extreme Championship Wrestling Organic horticulture Comfrey Pachypodium baronii Mount Auburn Cemetery 2004 Republican National Convention Sage Sento Michelia History of gardening Hellebore Japanese garden Tree Weed control Boston College Little Shop of Horrors Morphology of Pachypodium Erica Lawn mower RISC Undergrads Sea-Monkey Rosemary Billboard Hot 100 Zoning Bart Sells His Soul Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) McMansion Eucalyptus The Ashlee Simpson Show Maize The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Can't Hardly Wait Christmas tree Grace Cossington Smith Ragweed 21st Century Fox RuneScape quests Bonsai Alder The Time Machine Hibiscus
