when should i plant gallon ash trees i live west of phoenix az i am planning to plant four gallon shamel ash trees in my backyard i do not want them to die from the heat but i want them to have a chance to get roots before the winter freeze the average temperature right now anywhere from degrees with random humidity we are having a somewhat rainy season so the temp and humidity vary by day it can get as hot as degrees in august is there a certain temperature range i should look for before planting my trees to prevent them dying from sunburn or heat i do not have the trees yet i am planning to purchase them so they are still living happily at the nursery not in pots in the yard lol i am wondering the best time to buy them the nursery will plant them professionally for free having them in the ground would keep the roots cooler than in a pot it is probably best to go ahead and plant them just be sure to keep the roots cool and moist i'm having to water a couple or times a week here in socal you're getting more monsoon rain that i am here be sure to put a good layer of mulch over the root zone a couple of inches of bark or compost water deeply if your soil is clayey you will have to put down lots to get the soil moisture deep enough i put down an inch or two at a time in a basin out to the dripline use some of the soil from planting you will ammend the soil i hope and make a little damn or inches tall just fill that twice and the trees should get enough you could also get some floating row cover to wrap the top with it can hold in humidity and will keep the sun from scorching the leaves it looks odd but works i've done it with a few trees gal size and had better survival Desert Houseplant Pachypodium K__ppen climate classification Water Climate of the United Kingdom Quang Ninh Province Weed control Bonsai Brewery Carnivorous plant Leaf Mulch Irrigation Garden Strawberry Coffee Vermicompost Opportunity rover Severe weather terminology (United States) Gypsy moth Temperature Atlanta metropolitan area Campfire Compost Fog Hemp European Beech Rainforest Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Climate of India Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Monsoon Geography of India Arizona Climate of Salt Lake City Phoenix, Arizona Prosopis cineraria Thermoregulation Weather lore Water (molecule) Tree Wood Death Valley National Park Grand Teton National Park Sorghum Geography of Bolivia Geography of Japan Comfrey Dead Sea Earthworm Soil Geography of China Geography of Spain Geography of Africa Peach Ocean thermal energy conversion Fossil fuel power plant Drainage Christmas tree Lake Palmdale, California Biology of the Sierra Nevada Avalanche Air conditioning Geography of Pakistan Desertification Hyperthermia Glossary of wildland fire terms Casting National Weather Service Thermal power station Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Fire fighting Elis Prefecture Volcano Refrigerator Thar Desert Caatinga Geyser Cookware and bakeware Apple Tea Humidity Sauna Permafrost Geography of Albania Lava Beds National Monument Tulkarm Great Lakes Fruit tree propagation
