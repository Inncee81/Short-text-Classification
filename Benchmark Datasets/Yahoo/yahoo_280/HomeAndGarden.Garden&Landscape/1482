what is better hydroseed or sod we built a home in indiana where we deal with rain and snow cold and hot weather what will look great for years to come neither actually the best way to go is direct seeding sometimes called slit seeding this is where topsoil is tilled into the area to be seeded and the seed is placed directly into the soil where nature intended it to germinate the result where done correctly is a higher faster germination rate than hydroseed and a heartier healthier lawn than sod the process is usually a bit more complex than the other two methods but gives stronger results the initial cost is usually higher than either hydroseed or sod but the long term savings can often equal the full cost of the planting this is because you'll have a very strong root system that will withstand both the hot and cold seasons you don't have to have sprinklers going days a week you don't have to have continual feeding weed control either Weed control Weed Sod Manitoba Hydro Bread Hydroponics Sorghum Plough Sugar beet Organic farming Climate of the United Kingdom Mulch Textile manufacturing Vegetation Illegal drug trade Energy development Digital circuit Norman Borlaug San Pedro cactus Soil Flax Flowering plant Rice Welding Fruit tree propagation Sewage treatment Hemp Compost Hydropower Acorn Soil pH Masanobu Fukuoka Herbicide Tobacco Pea Stratification (botany) Lawn Vermicompost Seed Lightning Kudzu Fusion power Yosemite National Park Internal ballistics Renewable energy Desert Pebble bed reactor Space Shuttle program Solar power 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Carbon dioxide sink Sustainable agriculture Dust Bowl Patterson's Curse Playoff Siphon Drooping Brome Tea Cereal Coconut Economy of the United States CPU cache Orchidaceae Severe weather terminology (United States) Agriculture Alfalfa Genetic engineering Analog-to-digital converter Erosion Plant Central processing unit Hydroelectricity Genetically modified food Shifting cultivation Cannabis (drug) Breastfeeding K__ppen climate classification Diesel engine Deforestation Green Revolution Future energy development Germination Rail tracks Brewery Radar Brewing Neolithic Revolution Soil science Fish farming Giant Sequoia Comfrey Jute Vanilla Peanut Botany Troms__ I.L.
