am i wrong to feel guilty not when my city friends ask if they can pick up horse manure for their gardens the guilt comes in when they almost always insist on paying for the manure especialy if they have seen my roses i usually tell them to make a donation to the rescue mission for the homeless what should i do if they feel guilty have them muck out the stalls to get the real fresh stuff course they'll never come back after getting a good whiff of it coming directly from the horses mouth however i found that the best garden year i ever had was with horse manure where they used sawdust and wood bits in the stall had a banner crop that year but your idea of having them donate something is great i just hope they do it Compost Manure Guilt Sin City Mid-levels Organic food Green manure Socrates Local food Knots Landing Horse tack Biff Tannen Sin Sampling (music) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Garth Brooks Poker jargon James Hanratty EastEnders Sharon Tate Miscarriage of justice Shaggy dog story Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Schabir Shaik Trial Earthworm Stop and Smell the Roses The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Livestock Phil Hendrie Pitaten Theory of conduct The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Fertilizer Gooseberry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Advertising Weed control Richard Rahl RuneScape quests Operation Market Garden Permaculture The Inside Charles Peace The Contender (television series) Marshall Plan Days of our Lives Toilet humour Organic gardening O.
