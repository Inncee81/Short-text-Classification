i have a pink rose of sharon what is the best way to ensure a new plant of the same color i have other colors in my yard and when i take the small new plants and transplant i never get a pink one the seeds make plants that depend on what color plant they were on combined with what other color plant's pollen happen to fertilize that seed between the winds and the bees you never get the exact shade you want try taking cuttings from the big pink flower plant and rooting them to start a new pink plant ignore the seedlings because they are sure to be mixed if you have too much time on your hands you could try hand pollinating a pink flower with pollen from an adjacent pink flower and then covering the flower to keep other pollen away Flower Pollination Orchidaceae Apple Pinophyta Carnivorous plant Bee Pollen source Honey Fruit tree propagation Date Palm Pollinator Vanilla Alfalfa Weed control Fruit Conifer cones Watermelon Monarda Pollinator decline Rambutan Plant sexuality Fruit tree pollination Pollination management Monocotyledon Sunflower Agriculture Cucumber Kiwifruit Banksia Tobacco Pachypodium brevicaule Cannabis cultivation Blackberry Garden Strawberry Malus Grafting Bamboo Pine Hemp Comfrey Potato Ecology Illegal drug trade Ginkgo Honeybee Sexual reproduction Color Wheat Flax Textile manufacturing Juniper Pyrola Rapeseed Deforestation Agricultural machinery Rose Morning glory Embryophyte Ragweed Alder Insect Buckwheat Pachypodium baronii Iris (plant) Desertification Wisteria Feijoa Seed Fertilisation Arabidopsis thaliana Bumblebee Absinth Wormwood New Zealand flax Hashish Pansy Black pepper Yucca Darwin from Orchids to Variation Percy Schmeiser Ophrys Asteraceae Pumpkin Species Bee learning and communication Pysanka Pawpaw Beekeeping Kudzu Perfume Diseases of the honeybee Cannabis (drug) Daylily Worker bee Beehive (beekeeping)
