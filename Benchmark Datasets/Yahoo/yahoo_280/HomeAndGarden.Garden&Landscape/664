can i use breeze blocks to build a wall between mine and my neighbours house and not render it we wanted to use breeze blocks as they are lighter and cheaper we also wanted to do it quickly so if we made the wall this year we could perhaps render it next year will it be strong enough at about some areas four feet high and some areas about seven feet high wat about in strong wind will the wall stay up thank you for your help xxx vici certainly not something professional but i assume you can do this i would have concern with the ' portion otherwise invest in some cheap re bar to run down the center and into the ground you may also want to make sure the ground is level to some extent i don't know where you live but i would caution the building codes this is the type of project town inspectors focus on if you live on a large property and the block really won't be seen then i doubt anyone will care or notice if you don't get along with the neighbor and he can see the block don't do it you will be asking for trouble Wall Street Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Wood Wrigley Field Radio masts and towers Volleyball Severe weather terminology (United States) Donald Trump Antioch, Pisidia Chaco Culture National Historical Park Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sail-plan Citigroup Center Stairway Wind Craps Wind power Sport utility vehicle Nuclear power Mixed martial arts American football Suburbs of Johannesburg Doom engine Solar power satellite Basement North American Numbering Plan TGV Bicycle frame Blood (computer game) Angkor Wat Future energy development Mozilla Application Suite Dundas Square Perl Freedom Tower Berkeley Software Distribution System/36 Decompression sickness Computer Free trade Narrow gauge Rail tracks House History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Hydrogen economy Scuba set Air-raid shelter Geodesic dome Tulkarm ZIP Code Glossary of American football Combine (Half-Life 2) Passenger car Chess strategy and tactics Spaceward, Ho!
