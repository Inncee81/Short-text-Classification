how can i kill some very aggressive oleander bushes the oleander plants are very tall and thick they have been cut back many times hoping they would stay short for a while but they grow like weeds which i think they are and they need to be permanently stunted or killed thanks for your help the oleander needs to be dug out remove the crown of roots and that should prevent it from coming back if this is a irrigated area you may still may see some sprouts form time to time but you can just chop those out if the stumps have some fresh juicy new growth you can easily kill them with a shot of glyphosphate herbicide i e round up if the growth on the stumps is old and mature leaves then soak the stumps deeply and wait another week or two until you have some lush fresh growth the herbicide does not work well on old leaves only on fresh new leaves add tablespoon of liquid dish soap plus tablespoons of a fine granular plant fertilizer to each gallon of glyphosphate solution the soap will help the herbicide to stick better on the leaves rather than running off onto the ground where it will do no good the fertilizer will stimulate the leaves and stems to take up more of the herbicide you may need to hit it twice first time then wait until those stems brown and die be aware that all parts of the oleander are highly poisonous do not burn the debris from a dug up oleander as the smoke from burning the limbs will make you sick may even be fatal make sure you wear gloves when handling any part of this plant Weed control Herbicide Comfrey Weed Coffee Wood Kudzu Carbon dioxide Gypsy moth Auxin Sugar beet Bamboo Hop (plant) Tobacco Alfalfa Molotov cocktail Ginkgo Cricket Hemp Sorghum Leaf Hamster Cigarette Giant Hogweed Ragweed Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sequoia Olive Organic farming Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Green Revolution Soap bubble Textile manufacturing Tofu Glossary of wildland fire terms Irrigation Cannabis (drug) Cannabis cultivation Illegal drug trade Carnivorous plant Pruning fruit trees Casting Coriander Moss Honey fungus Fruit tree propagation Tea Houseplant Fire fighting Oleander Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pansy Laws of cricket Knife Flowering plant Plant Fast bowling The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Orchidaceae Jute Apple Potato Ethylene Maize Hydroponics Pachypodium bicolor Eucalyptus Aloe Sewage treatment Vinegar Pachypodium brevicaule Flax Foodborne illness Peach Poker jargon Dandelion Rice Bonsai Alcohol fuel Tattoo Plant stem Polygonum Volleyball Tree Haggis Sulfuric acid Poison-ivy Soil pH Coca eradication RuneScape skills Logging Peanut Glossary of climbing terms
