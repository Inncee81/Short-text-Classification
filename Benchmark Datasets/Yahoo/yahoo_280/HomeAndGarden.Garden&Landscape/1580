sure fire method for long stemmed roses my fiance' just sent a dozen exotic long stemmed roses for my birthday they arrived last night at pm they are already starting to open how do i stop that process but keep them fresh longer i did trim them back today changed water adding a little sugar a drop of bleach however i don't think anything will stop the process of them opening fully now thank you all for your helpful hints and advice unfortunately when they start to open there is no way to stop them it's nature taking their course i had the same problem when i sent my girlfriend long stemmed roses next time hopefully there will be a whole lot more times you get long stemmed roses put them in cold water with a little bit of plant food in a vase and try to keep the water around degrees you can do this by adding a little bit of cold water every few hours the warmer they get and less deprived of water and food the sooner they open good luck and congratulations Social rule Tea Leaf Water (molecule) Carbon dioxide Coffee Hamster The Contender (television series) W.I.T.C.H.
