why have my confiers gone brown we move into our house months ago and have two large conifers in our back garden about a month ago we noticed one of them turning brown now one is completely brown and the other brown what is wrong and can they be saved cheers jono the most likely reason is that the conifers have become waterlogged due to the increased wet weather this year and so are dying all plants release water through a process called transpiration and coniferous trees do this at a sustained rate if the water table rises and the roots receive excess moisture through the soil then conifers cannot release enough water and the leaves brown and die personally i would fell both trees as they are dying and to be honest conifers do little except drain nutrients from the soil so to me their value is limited Soil pH Soil Wood Plant Pinophyta Deforestation Acorn Desert Physiological plant disorders Hydroponics Eucalyptus Irrigation Earthworm Root Drainage Global warming and agriculture Leaf Ecohydrology Rice Eutrophication Gypsy moth Bonsai Pachypodium Soil salination Tree Soil life Pine Ecology Sorghum Compost Nutrient Capercaillie Forest Aquifer Climate of the Alps Glacier National Park (US) Archaeopteris Agriculture Bog Carbon dioxide sink Alfalfa Peat Wetland Old growth forest Humus Europe Photosynthesis Climate of the United Kingdom Shifting cultivation River Effects of global warming Conifer cones Yosemite National Park Carbon dioxide Desertification Banksia Amazon River Biodiversity Coast Douglas-fir Grand Teton National Park Rainforest New Forest Mount Pinatubo Water Olive Hamster Erosion Twelve leverage points Mediterranean Basin Tree-line Stoma Red Alder Atlanta metropolitan area European Beech Sea level rise Phytophthora cinnamomi Flowering plant Permian-Triassic extinction event Coffee Global warming Hemp Weed control Araucaria araucana Hippeastrum Campfire Taiga El Ni__o Chamaecyparis lawsoniana Green Revolution Thermal power station Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Wildfire Cannabis cultivation
