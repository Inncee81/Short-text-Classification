what is best fencing for privacy fence i just did a bunch of research on fencing because i need it for my backyard my opinion is that the best material currently for a privacy fence is vinyl it is virtually maintenance free and lasts forever but it is expensive and if you need a tall fence it doesn't provide much in the way of sizing for that another low maintenance choice might be chain link with a fast growing plant barrier like thuja italian cyprus or juniper trees planted fairly close together however they would not block sound if that's part of your privacy concerns nothing really compares to steel reinforced cinder block walls for privacy and sound blockage about the same cost as vinyl in most areas and typically requires professional installation to do it right Radio masts and towers Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Masonry Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Agricultural fencing Hydrogen economy Fusion power Nuclear power plant Nuclear reactor TGV Corrosion Divorce Gramophone record Computer Energy development Spam (electronic) Drill bit Wind turbine Table saw Israeli West Bank barrier Solar power Thermal power station Fence Autonomous building Crime prevention through environmental design Equine conformation Thuja Perl Swimming pool Kazaa Audiophile Elevator Thuja plicata Music radio Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Upholstery Inertial confinement fusion Movie theater Volleyball Casting Passenger car Nuclear power phase-out Seismic retrofit Lighting Steel Wood Rail tracks Microeconomics Irrigation Air-raid shelter Roof CPU cache Sukkot Surveillance Polyvinyl chloride RFID Rick Santorum Piano 1896 Summer Olympics Virtual memory Carnegie Mellon University Mattress Baseball Future energy development Digital photography Supersonic transport Terminal ballistics Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Drug test Siegfried Line Wrigley Field Cinder block Linux Pretty Good Privacy Tree Separation barrier Bicycle frame Nuclear reprocessing Reflexology Cell (biology) Safety engineering Perfume Urban sprawl Barbed wire Universal Century Technology Pebble bed reactor Fencing Welding Privacy Solar panel Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Public domain Veganism RuneScape weapons The Brady Bunch Trombone
