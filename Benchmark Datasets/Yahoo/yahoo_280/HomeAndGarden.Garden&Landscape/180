my grass is brown is there any way to bring it back yes there is grass has an ability to go dormit during hot dry drought seasons it will appear dead but it is actually just dormit until conditions change to get the grass to come back apply fertilizer and water when watering water only in early morning am am and water twice per week with a few days in between each watering applying half inch of water each time early morning is the optimum time to water because wind speeds and rate of evaporation are at the minimum and shutting the water off in the morning and waiting a few days in between each watering will allow the grass to dry out and fungus wont grow overwatering or watering in the late afternoon evening and or at night can lead to thatch problems and will cause fungus and once you have fungus it requires alot of work to get rid of it also you need to make sure you are not mowing your yard too short the grass should be mowed no lower then inches for the entire mowing season the grass should only be mowed lower during the last few mowings right before the end of the mowing season winter don't worry about the grass being brown a little fertilzer and water and the grass will green up Lawn Sorghum Hay Lawn mower 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Climate of the United Kingdom Renewable energy Wood 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Carnivorous plant New York Giants Cricket pitch Cleveland Browns California Tobacco Xeriscaping Cincinnati Bengals Weather lore Dead Sea 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Tennis Desert Steam engine Rice Climate of Salt Lake City Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina National Weather Service Thermal power station Wildfire Thermoregulation Irrigation Bird migration USS Tunny (SS-282) Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Super Bowl XXXVI Wheat Diseases of the honeybee Airport Casting Elis Prefecture Capercaillie Banana USS Augusta (CA-31) Atlanta metropolitan area K__ppen climate classification Dundas Square Liturgical year Peanut USS Waters (DD-115) Lichen USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Miami Dolphins Emu Operation Market Garden Severe weather terminology (United States) Pachypodium ambongense Deforestation Effects of global warming Shaggy dog story First day on the Somme Car handling Dorama Guinea pig WNNX (FM) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jet engine Tennis court Daylight saving time Sugar beet Shifting cultivation USS Texas (BB-35) Pok__mon Abilities Agrostis Crop circle Geography of Spain STS-59 Tea Soil pH National Football League Hamster Geography and climate of Singapore Climate of India Battle of Tarawa USS Yorktown (CV-10) Nile USS Yorktown (CV-5) Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Carbon dioxide Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Drag racing USS Woodbury (DD-309) Air conditioning Lake USS S-32 (SS-137)
