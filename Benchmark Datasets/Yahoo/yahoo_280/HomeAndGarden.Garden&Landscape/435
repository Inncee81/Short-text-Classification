how do i start a flower garden i've just moved into a house with a backyard and want to grow some nice flowers are they're any tips before i start i'm not sure what flowers i'd like either i guess ones that are going to be more forgiving to start with and then maybe move onto more interesting types hi here are some tips choose a good location a place that gets a lot of sun not under a tree or on the north side of the house also preferably without roots and an area that doesn't flood when it rains don't start with too big a spot or you can get overrun with weeds and discouraged clear out what is there either with a spray like roundup digging out the existing vegitation by hand or by puttling a plastic tarp down for a few weeks until everything is dead then prepare the soil if you have a tiller you can till the whole area to make it nice and loose if not you can use a pitchfork or just leave it it will be easier to weed if you turn the ground over though choose plants some options a perrenial vs annual annuals grow for one season and die perrenials come back every year b buy plants from a nursery or start from seed nursery plants give you instant gratification but cost more seeds take longer but cost less space the plants correctly read the seed packet or instrucations when small people tend to plant the flowers close together but when they mature they then grow all into each other pick a nice variety of flowers a different sizes big in back smaller up front b different colors c different blooming dates some that bloom in spring early summer late summer and fall so you always have something that looks good maintaing the flowers weed periodically if you are lazy and are growing perennials you can add mulch so you don't have to weed i would start with some catalogues www burpee com great quality and selection of seeds www burgess com very inexpensive but poor quality and see what looks good to you good luck Weed control Herbicide Weed Cannabis cultivation Irrigation Apple Textile manufacturing Hemp Kudzu Biodynamic agriculture Tillage Flower Rose Christmas tree Plant Comfrey Fruit tree propagation Agriculture Mulch Animal Crossing Sunflower Bamboo Carnivorous plant Hamster Flowering plant Ragweed Alfalfa Hydroponics Volleyball Maize Hay Leaf Black pepper Bonsai Apricot Peanut Illegal drug trade Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Japanese tea ceremony Logging Houseplant Gypsy moth Orchidaceae Peach Sugar beet $ale of the Century Drill bit Tea Genetically modified food Grafting Gooseberry Flax Bulk vending Potato Tobacco Sage Fast bowling Pollination Skateboarding trick Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Floppy disk On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Xeriscaping Global warming and agriculture Anchor Perennial plant Morphology of Pachypodium Tree Laserdisc Giant Hogweed Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Welding Cannabis (drug) Chinese tallow Lechaina Johnny Appleseed Customs and etiquette of Japan Upholstery GunBound Biological pest control Compost Yosemite National Park Loganberry Barbecue Theory of conduct Coffea arabica Climate of the United Kingdom
