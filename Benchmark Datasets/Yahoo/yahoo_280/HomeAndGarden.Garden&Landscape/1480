problem with turf yesterday i had turf put down on my front garden i dont know much about how it should look but i feel that it is not right there is three shades of green going on the turf is not together i mean spaces in between i phoned and complained and i was told this is how it should look anyone out there up on turf your different shades of turf may be caused by the difference in soil fertility at the turf farm or by the length of time it has been palletized after it has been cut not receiving sunlight it will match up as soon as the roots begin to take hold and grow and sunlight is available as far as the spacing between the sod strips there shouldn't be any gaps visible if it was put down correctly a shoddy job may be allowed to have a gap but that is even unacceptable in my book especially if it is an established company that did the work the seams should match up tightly and any gapping should be very minimal if you are not happy i would re contact the owner or the big boss of the company that did the job and have him come out and take a look at the job his workers performed you apparently paid a premium price for this installation and should be a happy customer when it is finished hope this answers your question additional info make sure to water a little extra on the edges of the turf edges exposed and butted up to concrete or flower beds this edge will dry out alot faster and will turn brown and dieback if not kept damp due to being exposed to warm surfaces and air flow also make sure you water the lawn in the early morning hours regardless of what anyone else has told you am is best watering at night or early evening will cause disease to thrive in your new turf the grass should be dry when nightfall arrives good luck billy ray Lawn Irrigation Autonomous building Tobacco Fast bowling Solar power Mattress Xeriscaping Leaf 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Houseplant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Drainage Textile manufacturing Dundas Square Carnivorous plant Flax Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Elis Prefecture Hydroponics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cannabis cultivation Cricket Social rule Environmental concerns with electricity generation Upholstery Peat Garden Strawberry Drag racing The Time Machine Sundial Solar cell Turf maze Dairy Lechaina Deforestation Coffee Christmas tree Organic food Airport Desert Herbicide Fish farming Sears Holdings Corporation Seismic retrofit Gypsy moth The Amazing Race Ashton-Tate STS-114 Hippeastrum Hamster Motorcycle Sorghum Geography of Ireland Cloud Solar panel Car handling Renewable energy Avenue Q The Fens Carburetor Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Lake Poker jargon Color Garden Geology of the Grand Canyon area Hemp Labor theory of value Drill bit Wal-Mart Lawn mower Professional wrestling slang Heinkel He 100 Hard disk Diving suit Wind power Midlothian, Virginia Sunlight Warren Buffett Thermal power station 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Weed control Landing at Anzac Cove Comfrey Singlish Brewery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mars Sun Opportunity rover Tenshinhan
