how do you hide the cord and where do you plug it in for outdoor water fountains i wanted an outdoor little water fountain the ones i see have pumps and plugs that come from the base of the fountain where do you plug them in the outside plug what if the fountain is further away can i use an extension cord are there tricks to hiding the cord is it best to unplug them when they aren't in use whomever installed your new addition should have had both the knowledge and ability to perform the functions you are requesting i will state that i apologize if you alone bought and installed the unit in order to have any power inside the house you need to dedicate a gfc or outlet box from the circuit box to the exterior of the home this box can be two to four outlets and is a watersealed box generally mid house front you can use this unit to power lighting for seasons such as christmas and outdoor parties from the unit an electrician can place a secure outlet box in both the front and rear of the box making the ability for power for any usage you need please hire an electrician to install both box units the pond fountain pumps need little elec or amps they should be able to run a weather proof pvc r coaxial line directly from the front box unit to the power unit of the pond or fountain you wish to have have them also place a dual switch on both the front and rear boxes this will allow you to run the pump when needed turn it off and allow you to flip another switch to turn on outside lights i personally rewired with the help of an electrician such a set up for the extra monies i bought a gfi fuse for the circuit box make sure you buy high end exterior outlet boxes twenty years later it has never caused a problem and is an asset if you wish to go with plug in and run to the fountain i strongly suggest that you purchase a true heavy duty extension cord inch pvc pipe and connections and a gfi outlet drill an unapparent hole thru the facing of the house and run the cord along the house and into the garden dig a trench from the site of the exposure from the home to the pump dig this roughly six inches from the edge of any garden to the connection point think of an irrigation system what you are doing is the same except you are providing power and not water bury the supply protect it and make sure you have the proper electrical back up via the gfi good luck with this frankly i would suggest you use the electrician and have them trench to the fountain with coaxial exterior outlets are a great asset before backfilling you can always encapuslate the coax with the pvc cheap this puts the responsibility on the supplier not you good luck i am at gjgjobs yahoo com Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Thermal power station Irrigation Universal Serial Bus Solar power Strap-on dildo Hydraulic machinery Electrical wiring (UK) Spark plug Three-phase electric power Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Carburetor Transformer Ethernet Loudspeaker Heinkel He 100 Tire Thermostat Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Domestic water system Mouse (computing) IPod Operational amplifier Glossary of firefighting equipment Drill bit Oscilloscope Electrician Floppy disk Circuit breaker Programmable logic controller Energy development Central processing unit Dairy Rail terminology Dundas Square Autonomous building Siphon Coaxial cable Power strip Protoss Chevrolet Corvair engine Television E85 Private branch exchange National Electrical Code (US) Knife Wind turbine Headlight Drainage Marching band Gas metal arc welding Ground and neutral Ring circuit Distribution board Windows XP Extension Cord Laptop Plame affair Tank Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Locomotive X10 (industry standard) Mattress SCART Eldfell Cruising (maritime) Voice over IP Water supply Motor oil Fountain Computer Apollo Command/Service Module Pok__mon Abilities Diesel engine Jack plug Manitoba Hydro Combine (Half-Life 2) Enigma machine Earthing system Equine conformation Cable television Kitchen Transistor Telephone exchange Ammunition Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lighting Windsurfing
