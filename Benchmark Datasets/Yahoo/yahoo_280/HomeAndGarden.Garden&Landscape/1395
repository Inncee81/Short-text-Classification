where is the garden of eden africa some nuclear dna sequences including y chromosome data and mtdna indicate that modern humans originated and migrated relatively recently from a subset of the african population putting africa as the home of modern humanity a study of human y chromosome variation in a worldwide sample of over men determined that africans and non african males shared a common ancestor years ago and that the non african branch of humanity left africa about years ago such time estimates are based on the molecular clock hypothesis y chromosome studies tend to misinterpret demographic events related to the origin and spread of populations underestimating the age of those events mike hammer at the university of arizona sequenced bases in the same y chromosome region from ethnically diverse humans and four chimpanzees and dated the common ancestral human y chromosome at years with a percent confidence interval from to years other data shows that africans and non africans split about years ago underhill et al ingman within africa the oldest modern human fossil is just less than years old and represented by homo sapiens idaltu Race Human Mitochondrial Eve Human evolution Multiregional hypothesis Genealogical DNA test Indo-Aryan migration Single-origin hypothesis Y-chromosomal Aaron Allan Wilson Human genome Evolution Homo (genus) Species Ape Y chromosome Biology Chimpanzee Genome Project Genetics Chimpanzee Evidence of evolution Human skin color Gene Molecular systematics Genetic genealogy Cradle of Humanity DNA Negrito International HapMap Project Genome Chromosome Olduwan South Africa Homo erectus Cro-Magnon man Neanderthal Human migration Fermi paradox Berber Mungo Man Homo floresiensis Bioinformatics Neolithic Europe Afrocentrism Primate Indigenous peoples Biology and sexual orientation Mitochondrial DNA Homology (biology) Junk DNA Cancer Hominidae Molecular evolution Common Chimpanzee Africa Domestication of the horse Mutation Doomsday argument Australopithecine Global warming Origin of language Y-chromosomal Adam Sex OPV AIDS hypothesis X chromosome Archaeology Stone Age Cell growth Celt Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Mitochondrial genetics Hispanic Plant breeding Ashkenazi Jews HIV Diagnosis Demographics of Argentina Culture of Africa Silverpit crater Francis Crick Melanin Bigfoot Cell (biology) Polymerase chain reaction African languages Sequence alignment African American Cladistics Validity of human races Creation science Human extinction Solar variation RNA Geologic time scale
