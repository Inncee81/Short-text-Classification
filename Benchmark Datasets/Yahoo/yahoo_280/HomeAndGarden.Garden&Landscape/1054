grasshopper abudence how to prepare for next year we moved into our first home in june and now we're dealing with thousands upon thousands of crickets and grasshoppers other than the obvious eating of flowers they are constantly getting into our pool when we leave the cover off making it uncomfortable to be outside next year we are planning to landscape the yard and i want to know what plants are better are fighting off grasshoppers what can we do to ward off the annoying creatures we aren't necessarily looking at the cheapest we can go we just want it to work it's hard to enjoy the outdoors with so many grasshoppers we live in suburban kansas city so it's not like we live out in the middle of no where lots of information at this site http www ext colostate edu pubs insect html managing breeding sites grasshoppers are most easily controlled with insecticides when they are still immature nymphs and their location is restricted to breeding areas after all the grasshopper eggs have hatched mid june to early july make a neighborhood survey to identify areas of developing grasshopper populations where high populations of grasshopper nymphs are detected generally more than per square yard treat promptly to prevent later problems in adjacent yards options for grasshopper control in these breeding areas include insecticides formulated as either sprays or baits a variety of effective sprays for this purpose are readily available in garden shops hardware stores and similar retail outlets these include acephate orthene carbaryl sevin and permethrin these can be broadcast but may also be effective if applied in bands covering percent of the area the mobile grasshoppers will usually move to treated areas and be controlled because of its longer residual activity and ability to move systemically within a plant orthene usually provides the best grasshopper control orthene used according to directions can be applied to pastures roadsides and various trees and shrubs orthene cannot be applied legally to garden crop foods on vegetables and fruit use other insecticides strictly according to label instructions grasshopper baits generally contain bran or a similar carrier mixed with the insecticide carbaryl sevin baits are easy to apply usually effective and have little effect on beneficial insects disadvantages include slightly higher cost and less availability scatter baits early in the morning before grasshoppers start to feed in recent years there has been considerable interest in a biological control disease organism the protozoan nosema locustae for grasshopper control in situations where grasshopper problems are imminent colorado state university entomologists do not recommend applications of n locustae alone these applications do not provide rapid control of grasshoppers this protozoan is not effective against all grasshopper species and is much more effective against young grasshoppers n locustae applications may cause some reduction in grasshopper numbers in a few days or weeks but in general it is a slow acting and debilitating disease of grasshoppers that takes at least a year to affect grasshopper populations combinations of insecticides for rapid knockdown and nosema for long term control may be useful n locustae may be one of several methods useful for long term management in suburban areas but this has not been evaluated n locustae is available at many garden shops and nurseries in colorado sold under such trade names as nolo bair semaspore and grasshopper spore some protection of a yard is possible by watering the grasshopper breeding areas to promote plant growth abundant green plants in these areas can greatly delay and diminish grasshopper movements into yards a lesser effort may involve watering a barrier strip of grass and weeds around a yard where yards are adjacent to hay fields it may be useful to leave an uncut strip to concentrate grasshopper populations treat these barrier strips with insecticide for greater control grasshopper control in a yard once grasshoppers have moved into yards control options decrease and primarily involve repeated insecticide applications carefully read the labels of insecticides to prevent plant injury or excessive residues on food crops plant more susceptible crops in the most protected areas of the yard away from the source of invading grasshoppers susceptible plants also may be protected with screening or cheese cloth poultry including turkeys guinea hens and chickens may be used to supplement grasshopper control in some
