large pond is architecturally flawed need some cash conscious ways of repairing the most prominent issues mom bought a house with a huge pond about x ' this thing has loads of problems it sits in a swampy area with a high water table it's a rectangular ditch with a circular tree island in the middle of it it's fed by a natural stream that dries out in dry months and drains from a single overflow pipe that can't handle heavy rains and overflows the land bridge draining into another creek the sides are eroding and it's relatively shallow due to the erosion and presumably the stuff washed down by the stream the mud within the pond acts like quicksand it's about ' deep a slip or fall could end with a person drowning there are serious issues with algae blooms and in the winter it freezes solid while there are loads of animals in here and almost appears to be self sufficient i want to know what i can do to fix the above problems filling it in is not an option as it's natural swamp land and in the path of connecting creeks i want a sustainable koi pond thanks ok i read your question the other day and have since been thinking about it my dads pond it basically the same kind of situation because it sits in a natural swampy area it's going to be hard to control erosion of the pond walls the swamp is naturally peat based which is soft my only suggestion would to be to have it dredged which of course is not in your cost effective plan most dredging companies will pay you for the peat if you could have it dredged you can layer the sides and bottom w gravel sand mix but eventually it will settle down into the peat if you could replace the overflow w a much bigger one that would help alot although i would recommend that it be screened to prevent loss of fish the algae blooms are caused by the shallowness of the pond it gets too warm and no water movement you would have to add in a large pump to airate the water if it's so shallow it freezes solid it's not nearly deep enough for koi you might be better off making this a natural wildlife pond attracting deer ducks geese and cranes koi ponds are wonderful and they are hardy fish but best if kept in a pond that you can adjust water flow treat for diseases and keeping your fish safe from predators Dam Lake Koi Dredge Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dairy Shrimp farm Carbon dioxide Stream Water purification Geology of the Grand Canyon area Autonomous building Drainage Erosion Fish farming Lake Burley Griffin Desert Erie Canal Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Peat Colorado Plateau Hamster Ecology of Hong Kong Zuiderzee Works Water (molecule) Yosemite National Park Great Salt Lake Eldfell Glacier Effects of global warming Tire Renewable energy Drowning Death Valley National Park The Fens Eutrophication Bryce Canyon National Park Irrigation Transformer Ecology Geography of Ireland Solar power Carburetor Urinary incontinence Geography of Bolivia Geology of the British Isles Geography of Albania Chlorophyta Sento Anchor Beaver Geography of Africa Water Deluge (prehistoric) Capitol Reef National Park Canal lock Elis Prefecture Fountain A151 road Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Glossary of firefighting equipment The Wash Dundas Square Mount Pinatubo Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Basement Dead Sea Whitewater Windows XP Lighting Jet engine Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Flood geology Houseplant Carnivorous plant E85 Brewery Oak Ridges Moraine Desertification Nuclear power Aquifer Rebreather 2005 Maharashtra floods Intermontane Plateaus
