where do i get great flowers in los angeles i don't want to have to go into someone's backyard i'm rather looking for a cool flower shop this time around in the san fernando valley of los angeles the last place i went to had flowers that were already really old i would suggest that you google farmers markets in your area all farmers markets have fresh cut flowers to sell buy them as early in the morning as you can also most costco stores are a good place to buy since they have a lot of turnover so flowers are fresh prices are good in both places flower shops buy flowers in advance of orders so you never know how fresh they are good luck Costco 99 Ranch Market Wal-Mart Floristry Retailer San Gabriel Valley Shopping San Fernando Valley East Los Angeles (region) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Dairy Chinatown, Las Vegas Beverly Hills, California White flight Brentwood, Los Angeles, California Simi Valley, California Greater Los Angeles Area California Water Wars Manila San Fernando City, Pampanga Reseda, Los Angeles, California West Los Angeles (region) Organic food Palmdale, California Potato Apple Danville, California Downtown Los Angeles Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Urban sprawl Los Angeles County, California Local food Tesco Southern California Los Angeles Clippers Ramen San Fernando, California Eaton's California Proposition 13 (1978) Los Angeles Times San Joaquin Valley Tofu Oakland Raiders Westwood, Los Angeles, California Great Depression Sylmar, Los Angeles, California Hay Los Angeles, California Butter Farmers' Alliance Urbanization Flowering plant Pacific Electric Railway Inland Empire (California) San Francisco Bay Area Los Angeles Dodgers Supermarket Department store Mong Kok Pasadena, California The Westfield Group Marshall Field's Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Burbank, Los Angeles County, California Farmers' market Market Santa Catalina Island, California Tesco Ireland Chinatown Christmas tree Stock car (rail) Dodger Stadium Nordstrom Electronic commerce Temecula, California UK Singles Chart Mutual fund Free trade W H Smith Cooperative RKO Pictures KCAL-TV MapleStory Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California Air New Zealand Vanilla Animal Crossing Marketing San Andreas (state) Fernando Valenzuela San Gabriel, California Best Buy Pacoima, Los Angeles, California Super Bowl XXVII Customs and etiquette of Japan Little Saigon Refrigerator car Bulk vending Chinatowns in North America Community-supported agriculture
