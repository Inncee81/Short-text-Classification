watermelon is now growing on the lawn can i raise it now suggestions we decided to try growing watermelon this year the vine has strectched onto the lawn and i noticed one tiny watermelon on the dirt side and another on the lawn side at this point can i just let it grow on the lawn do i need to raise it and if so how is it too late to put in some mesh fence to have it climb somewhat truth be told it's too late to believe that the watermelon will be ripe before it gets too cold here in maryland but it's still fun to see it grow thanks for any tips or suggestions ok i think someone already said it but if you can move it gently over to the dirt go for it they are a little more durable than people realize after i moved to the city i started growing mine on a watermelon trellis if anyone wants to know more about that send me an email at japhiel yahoo com with watermelon trellis in the subject line and it has been working great you could also remove that one watermelon too if you wanted to try and pump all the plants energy into one melon to be done before the season is over if the frost do head your way there are a couple of things that you can do right now i would mulch the area under the melons and mulch it well trap that heat and water in while you can straw hay will work find for this now if the frost comes unexpectedly have a misting bottle of cold water ready when you get up in the morning spray the plants with the water you might want to do it a few times often this can save your plants and at the very least the fruit the real problem with frost damage is often the rapid thaw in the morning from the sun and the misting helps make the process more gradual if they aren't going to be quite ready before the frost try covering them with straw and then putting a heavy blanket over them in the late afternoon evening when the temps start to drop once the temps reach a decent level the next day you can at least remove the blanket see how the water levels and plant are doing water at a cooler temp to not shock the roots or plant and then recover again for the night now this should work but of the best laid plans what else oh and as far as running out of time for the melons to finish up start them indoors it will make a huge difference i have included a link to a question that i answered earlier about starting plants http answers yahoo com question index ylt aueyxvhhcgob d pbkf wkzty ix qid aapyj c show profile info evlqzk naa hope i helped thanks Mulch 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Operation Market Garden Watermelon Cannabis cultivation 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Elis Prefecture Lawn mower Battle of the Bulge Garden Strawberry Temperature Textile manufacturing Autonomous building Frost Solar power Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Basement Weed control Water (molecule) Global warming M16 (rifle) Thermoregulation Thermal power station Mattress Hydroponics Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Jet engine Climate of the United Kingdom I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue USS Yorktown (CV-5) Apple Gatorade Hemp Desertification Carburetor Brewery Full Metal Panic?
