how do you plant rasberries do you use a seed or what i love wild rassberrys i was thinking of planting them because they taste sooooo good hi you grow raspberries from canes you plant a root and that will send up canes which get leaves and berries once a cane produces berries you can cut it because it won't produce any more the plant will also spread underground so you only need to plant a few starters and in no time you will have a huge patch growing i would buy the rasberries from a mail order catalog www starkbros com www henryfields com www gurneys com www burpee com are all good and most come with a year guarantee there are lots of things to consider when selecting a variety color how many crops do you get etc also make sure that the variety you get will grow in your area zone here is my experieces with specific varieties i've grown jewel latham fall gold and brandywine fall gold are by far my favorite they are the sweetest i've ever tasted a different yellow color you get two crops in pa july and sept not too thorny not as bothered as other varieties by japanese beetles the canes support themselves well and don't fall over and they grow spread quickly so in a year or two you will have a nice patch from a single plant brandywine have a nice taste and are a beautiful deep purple color but the plants fall over too easily making a big mess so i usually have to trim them and i never get a second crop good luck Loganberry Agriculture Potato Sugarcane Raspberry Beet Tobacco Coffea arabica Wheat Banana Bamboo Tomato Fruit tree propagation Rose Sugar Beetle Black pepper Pansy Weed control Peanut Green tea Hemp Coffea Illegal drug trade Garden Strawberry Peach Flowering plant Pysanka Comfrey The Beach Boys Berry Vanilla Renewable energy GunBound RuneScape skills Smilax Genetic engineering Watermelon Plant Carnivorous plant Kiwifruit Characters in the Smurfs Alfalfa Dewberry Alcohol fuel Rum Barley New York Giants Common bean Apple Gooseberry Neolithic Revolution Common Agricultural Policy Herbal tea Luther Burbank Avocado Fruit Flower Herbicide Make money fast Turnip (brassica rapa) Vanessa Lynn Williams Domain Name System Coriander Bubble Bobble Mushroom hunting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Orchidaceae Pisco Guinea pig Reed (music) Shaggy dog story Kryptonite Cigar Tea Kudzu Flax Discus (fish) Pollination RuneScape quests Jennifer Lopez Pinophyta Orange (fruit) Cereal Bread Yu-Gi-Oh!
