are manual mowers any good i'm getting really sick of my flymo mower it takes ages sorting out the cables it keeps breaking and i'm concerned about how much energy it uses so i'm thinking about getting a manual mower which i can just get out and push but i've never used one before is it hard work pushing them and do they do a good job the main problem with my electric mower is it's useless when the grass gets too long how are the manual ones at cutting long grass one last thing just out of interest which do you think kills the most insects and bugs in the grass the electric or manual manual ones are ok for small areas hard work on a big lawn they're much more eco friendly and good exercise though i love the sound of a good old fashioned mower it's so nostalgic i haven't heard one for ages though as they're slower the bugs have a much better chance of getting out of the way of the blades with a manual any mower will struggle with very long grass cut little and often to keep lawn in good shape Lawn mower Mower Tractor Lawn Steam engine String trimmer The Lawnmower Man Equine conformation Transmission (mechanics) Time Out of Mind Wind turbine Carburetor Internal ballistics Ownership Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mouse (computing) Professional wrestling slang Carpal tunnel syndrome W.
