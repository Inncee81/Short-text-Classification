i want to build a pond water feature should i use a liner or one of those pre fabbed plastic pool thingys the ground in my back yard is mostly clay and very rocky i've used both and i have dg rock hard soil you have more options for rock placement and design when you use the plastic liner because the shape isn't so limiting like the pre fab hard plastic the plastic thingy has one drawback and that is that it can crack we had a week of hard freeze and the expansion and contraction of the water freezing and the pressure from the ground around it causes cracking i find the liner more attractive from a design perspective and easier to work with if you are in an area that gets freezes i probably would recommend using the liner to avoid the cracking problem Glacier Seismic retrofit Irrigation Plastic Knife Weathering Anchor Welding Mouse (computing) Concrete Drill bit Swimming pool Reinforced concrete Geodesic dome Sedimentary rock Atari 8-bit family Water (molecule) Erosion Casting Windows XP Flood geology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Skateboard Structure of the Earth Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March M16 (rifle) Chair Breastfeeding Equine conformation Portland cement Tag Fire fighting Foundation (architecture) Bong Waste management Floppy disk Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Gramophone record Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Golf Handloading Hamster Glossary of climbing terms Water Pile Motorcycle Violin Diamond Coffee Cremation Beretta 92F/FS Boat building Donovan Dam Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Carbon dioxide Repouss__ and chasing Masonry Ice core Desert Strap-on dildo Glossary of firefighting equipment Chimney Climbing Gradius Dishwasher IMac Pottery Grade (climbing) Soap Bladderwort Whitewater Semiconductor device Thermal power station Fish farming Deformation Bass guitar Naval mine Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Hydroponics Game controller Natural building Soil Motorcycle helmet Aerial firefighting Houseplant Bulk vending Yosemite National Park Drowning Jute Sweetheart of the Rodeo Four square Land mine ZX Spectrum Autonomous building Heinkel He 112 Naruto jutsu Vermicompost
