how often do lilies flower last yr i bought a small white trumpet lily this summer it is absolutely huge it's just opened all its flowers and is absolutely beautiful my questionis how many yrs can i keep it going i've been told they only flower for yrs then they die if this is correct then this is the nd yr and i may as well cut the flowers and enjoy theminside the house if i can keep it going what would be the best way to keep it healthy and ensure beautiful blooms next summer thanx in advance x lilies are bulbous so as long as you keep watering and feeding feed now for next year it will keep flowering and producing baby bulbs to give you more lilies may depend on the type of lily i have types in my garden they flower every year i regularly dig up bulbs to give to friends Flower Hippeastrum Tulip Japanese tea ceremony Carnivorous plant Allium Onion Houseplant Garlic Lighting Biological pest control Floristry Iris (plant) Rose Christmas tree Strap-on dildo Light-emitting diode Animal Crossing Monofloral honey Comfrey Canna lily Leaf Cannabis cultivation Titan arum Sleeping Murder Crocus Bong Alfalfa Garden Stage lighting Hamster Fluorescent lamp Honey Peach Perfume Tofu Liliaceae Flower album The Amber Spyglass Trichome Kudzu James and Lily Potter Lilies of the Field Disneyland Toilet humour History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Pollen Theory of conduct Sarraceniaceae Ludlow massacre Customs and etiquette of Japan Tillandsia Spider Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Empress Dowager Cixi Weed control Tournament of Roses Parade Chatsworth House Wisteria Root vegetable Dendrobium Breastfeeding Beetle Agriculture in Hong Kong Kaliyan Pansy Sea-Monkey Bladderwort Dursley family Araceae Dairy Anemone Watermelon Harry Potter (character) Infantilism National emblem Mango Darlingtonia (Sarraceniaceae) Daylily Chiang Mai Biodynamic agriculture Begonia Lawn Pasadena, California Nymphaea Xeriscaping Rambutan Wood Flowering plant Georgia O'Keeffe Pollinator decline Switch Apple Fruit Brooklyn Botanic Garden Taj Mahal The Wiggles Convallaria Soil pH
