is it bad to pull dead blooms off of my hydrangeas mophead does it ruin the opportunity to bloom again this season will it bloom next season good question with a lot of variables so hold on the ride might get a bit 'bumpy' there are major species of hydrangea we use in landscaping in my area in warmer usda hardiness zones there are even more i'm in usda hardiness zone most hydrangeas here only bloom once per season there are a few hydrangea macrophylla cultivars that bloom more often but at this time they are the exception rather than the rule i guess that may be a little less true in very mild climates cut the dead flower off just above a leaf on the stem cut down to where the stem is at least the thickness of a pencil a flimsy stem with produce flimsy small flowers if you cut a little further down any subsequent flowers will be larger and better supported by the plant most popular hydrangeas won't go to seed the flower of a hydrangea isn't really a flower not by itself anyway the part we call the flower is just a group of petals without reproductive parts a sterile flower mopheads are made up of that kind of flower the reproductive flower is a tuft without petals the center of lacecap style flowers are the reproductive ones you don't have to worry about seed production you should still remove the spent flowers once they look tattered and old hydrangeas generally like alot of moisture and a good fertilization program taking good care of your hydrangea has more to do with blooming next year than what you do with the flowers this year i hope that this helps good luck Hydrangea Flower Orchidaceae Flowering plant Cultivar Pachypodium brevicaule Hemp Peanut Plant Fruit Sunflower Olive Pachypodium baronii Alfalfa Wisteria Perennial plant Bamboo Pachypodium ambongense Pansy Species Pachypodium bicolor Daylily Wood Nelumbo nucifera Pollination Cannabis sativa Sugar beet Carnivorous plant Plant sexuality Carpel Tulip Pinophyta Weed control Reproduction Bladderwort Anemone Tree Fruit tree propagation Sexual reproduction Vicia faba Bonsai Houseplant Globe artichoke Leaf Jute Soil pH Atlanta metropolitan area Wheat Loganberry Cyclamen Pachypodium Nepeta Asteraceae Iris (plant) Hippeastrum Hop (plant) Malus Aloe Rice Banana Monarda Maize Watermelon Spinach Sweet potato Goldenrod Agriculture Fig Celery Pollen Vegetative reproduction Caryophyllaceae Sorghum Fuchsia Textile manufacturing Brugmansia Camellia Fireweed Eucalyptus Oxalis Snowdrop Flax Seed PH Kudzu Hamster Coffea arabica Broom (shrub) Strawberry
