will deer eat sunflowers i grew this sunflower it's about ft tall and it's inside of a pot on my deck i changed the pots several times because it kept outgrowing them and i know it's supposed to be in the ground problem is we live in the poconos where there are a lot of deer and they eat any plants we put outside will they eat sunflowers too or will they just ignore them dang guess i'll have to buy a huge pot and i can't really grow more then one or two at a time since they take up so much room yes we planted loads of them in a small meadow on the property just as they were about to bloom the deers came one night and ate all the leaves and buds the neighbours laughed at the sight of the stalks my daughter surmised that the 'deers have to eat too maman' since then i hadn't grown any but missed them so this year i picked out some 'kong' seeds and tried it last night the deers were on the property but i guess this one is too tall yes it has a huge bud at the top and i can't wait for it to flower they also don't like the marsh mallow plants growing in the back deerproofing is starting to be fun http forums gardenweb com forums load canwtrsow msg html Sunflower Cannabis cultivation Carnivorous plant Peanut Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
