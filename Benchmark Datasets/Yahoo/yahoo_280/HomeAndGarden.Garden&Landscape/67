racoons create nuisance by entering my backyard hi i live near the woods and wild racoons enter my backyard after climbing the fence i got a much higher frence built but they have managed to climb that too they loiter in my backyard all night long and many times in the day too they even climb the roof of the house and tamper with dish network wiring and i keep losing my tv signal because of that they even climb the windows we cannot open the window too because we are afraid they might enter furthermore they have injured my year old male cat too shockingly they are not afraid of humans at all and if i go towards them they would try to attack me what am i to do in this situation i can't move out because this is a newly built house do i have to buy a gun and shoot them now don't go near the raccoons raccoons are one of the top carriers of rabies and they aren't scared of you i've given you the links to several good sites that will help you you can hunt the raccoons in season if you have a license but if you just want to be rid of them call animal control and they will set up traps and catch them and move them to another area where they will no longer bother you i personally think your best bet would be to set up traps and catch them so you can put them in a different area you can get special permission to hunt them even out of season but it would probably be a lot easier to just catch them hope you don't have any more problems with them Poker jargon Trapping Fox hunting Wrigley Field TGV Ferret Gray Wolf The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Brady Bunch GunZ The Duel Craps Resident Evil: Apocalypse Air-raid shelter Oscilloscope Burglary St. Louis Cardinals Hamster Dog Easement Barbed wire Crime prevention through environmental design Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Betting (poker) Volleyball Cable television Bear Pretty Good Privacy Burglar alarm Feral cat Paragliding Elevator Roof and tunnel hacking OV-10 Bronco Viva La Bam Raccoon City Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fancy rat Resident Evil Outbreak Ethernet Social rule The Time Machine Sin City Hunting Garfield MapleStory B-47 Stratojet Tank Brown Bear Professional wrestling slang Bart chalkboard gags Saturday Night Live Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Raccoon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Saga (band) Columbine High School massacre Glossary of climbing terms Piccolo Junior Saga Telephone tapping 2005 World Series Windows XP Vampire Pet skunk Shotgun Aye-aye Game show Wi-Fi Day of the Daleks Solar power International League Timon and Pumbaa Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Fast bowling Animal Crossing Pok__mon Abilities Star Trek: First Contact American Black Bear Equine conformation The Marriage of Figaro Creatures in Bionicle Pittsburgh Steelers Major League Baseball television contracts Spider Cleveland Browns Tag The Invisibles Quake III Arena New York Giants Lion The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Surveillance Traffic light WNEP-TV San Francisco Giants Passenger car Cheating in Counter-Strike Bat
