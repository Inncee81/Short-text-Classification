how can i kill a fruitless mulberry tree that is growing between my patio and the fence i have cut it down numerous times and it just keeps coming back i would like to get rid of it in a way that is as environmentally friendly as possible you need to get rid of the roots the most environmentally friendly way is to dig it out it may be difficult to get all the roots without removing part of the fence or patio if any roots are left they will put up shoots which will need to be cut down or dug out the second best method is to girdle the tree cut a inch wide strip of bark from the entire circumference of the tree as close to the ground as possible this will allow the tree to send water and nutrients up to the leaves but stop the leaves from sending food back to the roots eventually the roots run out of food and die which kills the tree will take a year or two the tree may put out root suckers for a while cut these off as soon as you see them the next best method is to cut the tree and paint the cut surface with round up root shoots will be sent up and their leaves should also be painted with round up may have to repeat Bamboo Sequoia Leaf Eucalyptus Golf Kudzu The Amber Spyglass Fruit tree propagation Deforestation Trail blazing Coast Douglas-fir Comfrey Tag Glossary of graph theory European Beech Drainage Pine Battles of Lexington and Concord Tree of heaven Flowering plant Willow Hydroponics Bonsai Drill bit Black pepper Diamond cut Ivy Plant Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir Christmas tree Root Rainforest Campfire Prosopis cineraria Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Volleyball Plough Strangler Fig Hop (plant) Casting Pruning fruit trees Elephant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fencing View camera Mixed martial arts Carnivorous plant Grafting Burke and Wills expedition Textile manufacturing Aspen Comanche Olive Coppicing Potato Equine conformation Glossary of wildland fire terms Thuja plicata Organic farming D'ni timeline Drag racing Opportunity rover Table tennis Logging Oak Pikmin Honey fungus Coffee Desert Cannabis cultivation Pachypodium Collision detection Indianapolis 500 Rice paper Age of Mythology Banksia Ginkgo Giant Sequoia Mango Binary search tree Naruto jutsu Autonomous building Longleaf Pine Dundas Square Food preservation Woodworking RuneScape quests Peach Dairy Vegetative reproduction Carbon dioxide sink Chatsworth House Tetrapod
