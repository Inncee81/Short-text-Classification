how many heads on a sun flower plant can be produced depends on the variety standard sunflowers produce one or at the most two flower heads and then they die but there are hundreds of hybrids that have been developed to produce multiple flower heads and last longer most seed catalogs will have a wide variety many nurseries will have seed stands with ample sunflower varieties avoid buying sunflower plants they are expensive and don't transplant very well if you find a sunflower variety that you really like plant it this year and let the flowers go completely to seed allow the flower heads to dry out in the sun keep protected from birds then cut the head off and keep the seeds for next season they may not look exactly like the variety you had the year before but who cares the seed is free Sunflower Flower Hemp Flowering plant Watermelon Pollination Apple Plant Fruit Seed Agriculture Cultivar Orchidaceae Vanilla Bamboo Comfrey Sorghum Green Revolution Alfalfa Banksia Grafting Tofu Coffea arabica Rose Garden Strawberry Plant sexuality Flax Textile manufacturing Black pepper New Zealand flax Peanut Species Jute Luther Burbank Pysanka Safflower Perfume Pinophyta Asteraceae Gorse Carnivorous plant Cannabis sativa Biodiesel Hamster Kiwifruit Wheat Pachypodium ambongense Coriander Organic farming Biological pest control Pachypodium bicolor Illegal drug trade Durian Tobacco Celery Cotton thistle Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Broom (shrub) Hop (plant) Potato Sage Germination Upholstery Fruit tree propagation Pansy Brewery Sugarcane Sugar beet Biology of the Sierra Nevada Quinoa Mixed martial arts Camellia sinensis Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Loganberry Fancy rat Banana Cannabis cultivation Pumpkin Sexual reproduction Organic food Giant Sequoia Health insurance Apricot Maize Monarda Pachypodium Pikmin Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis (drug) Cereal Weed control Hay Tomato Cucumber RuneScape skills Gaucho (insecticide) Johnny Appleseed Ethylene Bread
