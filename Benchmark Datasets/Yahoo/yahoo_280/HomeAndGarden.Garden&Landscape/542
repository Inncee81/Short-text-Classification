some leaves on my chinese pistache are yellowing i live in south east louisiana and planted the tree in april it's been doing very well with a full canopy and healthy appearing leaves a few days ago i noticed a few leaves were yellow and thought little of it this am though i noticed more now it's only about dozen that have turned yellow but it's a small tree and this seems progressive the month of july started off wet and stayed that way until the past week this july seems to have been a bit cooler than usual likley because of frequent cloud cover and a cool front that actually made it down here any ideas of what may be going on fall color if we get any really doesn't happen until thanksgiving around here the pistashe is young and developing so give it time to get established these trees don't really like to have wet roots and so if you have had a considerable amount of rain which i think you have had this year there will be some leaf loss you can if possible drill some breather holes around the base of the tree if the ground seems a bit soggy otherwise let the ground dry out and definitely don't water it you can also remove some of the dirt around the base to expose more of the root ball pistache trees are highly drought and heat tolerable but wont do well in wet soil it is too late to fertilize the tree now young trees get fertilized from march to early june Desert Climate of the United Kingdom Bonsai Leaf Tobacco Atlanta metropolitan area Deforestation Rainforest Hippeastrum Irrigation Hemp Pine Casting Erosion Carnivorous plant Prosopis cineraria Campfire Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Wildfire Flowering plant Capercaillie Sorghum Nuclear fallout Caatinga Pachypodium Coffee Oat Global warming and agriculture Houseplant Cloud Climate of Salt Lake City Severe weather terminology (United States) Peach Mount Pinatubo Hamster Gypsy moth Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Opportunity rover Soil Geography of India Fruit tree propagation 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Tire Soil pH Precipitation (meteorology) Garden Strawberry 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Pinophyta Alfalfa Sulfur Snooker Old growth forest Kigo Diving suit September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Zion National Park Tea Yellow Weather lore K__ppen climate classification Glossary of wildland fire terms Climate of India Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Creosote bush Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir 1997 Pacific hurricane season Olive Deluge (mythology) Bamboo Bong Green tea Broom (shrub) The Ashlee Simpson Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sulfuric acid Acorn Golf Autumn Eucalyptus Drainage Seismic retrofit Elis Prefecture Internal ballistics RuneScape quests Piccolo Junior Saga Sauna Geography of Brazil Tillandsia Pysanka Logging
