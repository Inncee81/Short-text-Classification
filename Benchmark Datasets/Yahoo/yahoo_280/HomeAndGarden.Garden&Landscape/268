my neighbors dogs are peeing through the chain link fence consequently the grass is dead on my side of the fence i spoke with him years ago and he put up a few plastic slats but has not finished is there anything i can put along the fence that will deter the dogs from peeing on the fence this is not only a dog urine problem but a neighbor problem of course you can't always watch the dog where it pees but when in their yard they see the burnt patches on your lawn they're not that stupid they're letting the dog do it cause it has for a long time i am a dog person but you have to be responsible and train your pet to respect others although yes the urine could be considered fertilizer you may not want the smell that could go along with it a chain link is perfect for a small charge don't hurt the dog just help it not want to urinate on your side anymore and possibly no other chain link fence complete the connection positive to negative on that section of the fence with a small battery nothing that's gonna burn the dog once again it's more of a neighbor problem a minor jolt should only stop the dog from coming to that part of the fence Urine Dog agility Sin City Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Dog Housebreaking Poker jargon Obedience training Toilet humour Tick Israeli West Bank barrier Elis Prefecture Baseball Lawn mower Urinary incontinence Joke Hamster AFI 100 Years series Dog training Moe Szyslak Drug test Action potential Guinea pig Garfield Montgomery Burns Toilet Urination Peter Griffin Cat Eventing Philosophy of language Hillsborough disaster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Richard Chase RuneScape quests USS Tennessee (BB-43) Burning Man Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Prostate cancer Sinfest Fencing Third rail Fancy rat Island Fox Street Stop and Smell the Roses Sulfur Humphrey Bogart Barbed wire Dingo Autonomous building Nuclear fusion Traumatic incident reduction Electrophysiology Marathon (sport) Fox hunting Rabbit Iditarod 21 July 2005 London bombings Finnish grammar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chess terminology Russian joke Windows XP The Lovely Bones Ben Johnson (athlete) Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
