i planted a lantana facing the west it has developed mold and root rot can it be saved the directions that came with the plant says do not let this plant dry out did i get carried away thank you this was planted in a small planter it depends on the extent of the root rot and mold lantana is a pretty stubborn plant so it stands a better than even chance of making it if you cut back on the water also unless it's covered in mold i'd cut away the moldy areas if you have enough plant you may consider even digging up part of it and transplanting it nearby this increases the odds of getting some of it to recover btw i have lantana and i have it growing in sun and shaded areas only difference is the sunny location needs a bit more water however don't over do the watering it really doesn't have to remain moist just make sure it doesn't get dry and dusty good luck good luck Carnivorous plant Wood Wheat Tobacco Garden Strawberry Comfrey Hippeastrum Campfire Solar power Flax Hamster Irrigation Hemp Jute Bamboo Bonsai Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Sugarcane Orchidaceae Dinghy Sugar Desertification Acorn Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cheese Drainage Sugar beet Leaf Equine conformation Weather lore Dune Alfalfa Houseplant Deforestation Gooseberry Vanilla Wetland Vermicompost Phytophthora cinnamomi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Climate of the United Kingdom Grand Teton National Park Decomposition Physiological plant disorders Black pepper Environmental concerns with electricity generation Begonia Canoe Basil Europe Volleyball Sand casting Strap-on dildo Coconut crab Theory of conduct Pachypodium Hydroponics Flowering plant Root Autonomous building Upholstery Amazon River Drill bit Wood fuel Weed control Geodesic dome Soil pH Lawn Papyrus Hair Passive solar Caatinga Rice Carbon dioxide Knife Leather Solar panel Sunlight Sunflower Plant Peach Florida Keys Weed Atmospheric circulation Evidence of evolution Vegetation The Midnight Sun Prosopis cineraria Hay Cannabis cultivation Hop (plant) Water Vulcanization Gorse Energy development Monarda
