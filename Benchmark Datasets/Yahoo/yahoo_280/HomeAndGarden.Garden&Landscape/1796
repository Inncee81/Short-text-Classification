how long till flowers regrow night blooming jasmine i have a night blooming jasmine it is healthy but in shipping all but flowers fell off and the four still on it are still open blooming i want to know how long will it take for new flowers to grow or will i have to wait a year for them to return also are the flowers that are open all the time okay or is it a sign of something wrong i don't know what state growing zone you are in but most gardens are about to go to sleep for the fall and winter unless you live in a very warm state such as southern calif or florida i'm sure your wonderful jasmine will soon loose it's flowers and close down for the winter if it is growing in a pot you can keep it going through the winter by bringing it in the house and setting it in a south facing window don't forget to water it ever so often it will need water stick your finger down into the soil about two inches and see if it feels dry you can do this now too while it is outside Houseplant Hippeastrum Aladdin (1992 film) Flax Jasmine Pansy Begonia The Amber Spyglass Textile manufacturing Comfrey Pachypodium ambongense Apple Miami, Florida Weather lore Poker jargon Climate of the United Kingdom Garden Strawberry Perennial plant Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Hamster Cordelia Chase Jute Weed control The Time Machine USS Missouri (BB-63) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Japanese tea ceremony Customs and etiquette of Japan Sunflower Pachypodium baronii Comanche Carnivorous plant Jon Secada Orlando, Florida Flower Apricot The Shining (film) Cannabis cultivation Zion National Park Skinny Puppy Iris (plant) Liriodendron Tulip Geography of Russia Rose Manchuria Ragweed Time Out of Mind Butchart Gardens Orchidaceae Anemone Tillandsia The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fantasmic!
