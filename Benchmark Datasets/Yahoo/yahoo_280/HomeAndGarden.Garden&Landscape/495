colorado blue spruce terminal branches turning brown and dying i have a foot tall colorado blue spruce planted in my lawn this summer i noticed about foot of the terminal branch was brown and dead i removed that branch now about months later still summerj time about other short branches have turned brown and appear dead does anyone know what the problem may be and if there is any remedy or treatment dry winters can cause subsequent tip browning the following summer especially if the summer is also dry top down die back is also associated with pine weevil which is known to attack spruces as well or it might also be spruce bud worm but you would probably see webbing if you look close both overwatering and underwatering can cause root problems which can show up as die back from the top down as well also to address the comment of a previous answer balled and burlapped trees should not be unwrapped prior to planting the burlap should be peeled back from the trunk after the tree is planted though so that none of it shows above the soil burlap visible above ground will act as a wick and pull moisture from the soil up into the air but the burlap around the rootball will keep the roots and soil in good contact allowing less possibility of air pockets when planting air pockets in the soil when planting can kill roots and increase shock burlap degrades even the treated burlap on our b b trees in the nursery where i work often need to be re wrapped in as little as a year as it decays even when treated to slow the decay and roots are completely capable of growing through it even before there is much decay i see rootlets coming through even before the tree is planted if it's been around for a few months any tree whose roots can not make it through burlap have something else seriously wrong with them and the problem is not the burlap Gypsy moth Wood Pine Bonsai Pachypodium Carnivorous plant Logging Apple Blue Spruce Acorn Capercaillie Sitka Spruce Spruce Root Leaf Campfire Deforestation Christmas tree Volleyball Giant Sequoia Tobacco Soil life Lightning Yosemite National Park Eucalyptus Grand Teton National Park Comfrey Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Flax European Beech Cannabis cultivation Desert Billiards Fruit tree propagation Gooseberry Lumber Vermicompost Irrigation Pinophyta Dutch elm disease Banksia Snooker Norway Spruce Soil pH Chernobyl accident Plantation Desertification Sugar beet Hydroponics Old growth forest Honey fungus Hemp Wildfire Glossary of wildland fire terms Aerial (dance move) Sewage treatment Flowering plant Tenshinhan Orchidaceae Aloe Psoriasis White Spruce Fancy rat Beetle Geology of the Grand Canyon area Burial Poker jargon Coconut Morphology of Pachypodium 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Piccolo Junior Saga Stratification (botany) Black Spruce Fertilizer Olive Hippeastrum Comanche Bamboo Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Earthworm Soil salination Pachypodium baronii Mummy Sequoia Lichen Tillage Funeral Kudzu
