how do you tell a queen bumble bee from a worker if there's no worker around to compare size here's my problem i think a queen bumble bee is digging a hole in my backyard for her nest i watched her for about five minutes and she kept coming up and going down into the hole but i can't tell if she's a queen or if it's a worker i also have cats and i'm wondering if this is a nest what the heck i should do i don't want to kill it queen or worker let be or kill of the forty five species of bumble bees in the u s only about four are occasionally aggressive by nature in contrast to social bees almost all of our native bees live on their own solitary nesting and thus have no hive to defend it is the hive bees defending the home that will swarm out stinging all and sundry in defense bumble bees are in colonies only seasonally and the only native bee that is social queens look for abandoned rodent holes or other suitable openings if they can only newly mated queens live over the winter and only pregnant queens make nests my cats learned very quickly to recognize bees after they got a fat paw bumble bee's habits do not include reusing a nest so if you can wait out till winter the present lot will all die and the next generation should move to another site you may want to read theses sites about checking out and preventing future bee sites http www pestproducts com bumble bees htm Bee Honeybee Africanized bee Bumblebee Diseases of the honeybee Beehive (beekeeping) Queen bee Hamster Worker bee Ant Beekeeping Honeybee life cycle Hornet Red imported fire ant Langstroth hive Cat Top-bar hive Pheromone (honey bee) Bee learning and communication Kakapo Drone (bee) Western honeybee Animal communication Apple Brood (honeybee) Xenomorph Termite Alberta Pollinator decline Pesticide toxicity to bees Honey Dinosaur Paper wasp Seabird StarCraft Episode VI Zerg Futurama (TV series - season 5) Spider Tarantula Apocrita Nerpa Chess strategy and tactics Chess terminology Aliens vs. Predator 2 Piping queen Natural Selection (computer game) Conker's Bad Fur Day Gray Wolf Nosema apis Beekeeping leading practices Tyranid Parthenogenesis Ecology American Alligator Ferret Feral cat Timon and Pumbaa Red Squirrel Emu Borg Poker jargon Elephant Family Guy Phoebe Halliwell German Wasp Platypus Megachilidae Peregrine Falcon Bill Oddie SimAnt American Black Bear The Dukes of Hazzard Atlanta Braves Homer Simpson Napoleon Dynamite Code: Lyoko Sexual dimorphism Fancy rat W.
