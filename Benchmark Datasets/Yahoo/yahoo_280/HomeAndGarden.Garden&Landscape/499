is there anyway that i can still plant these biennials so that they bloom next year i would like to plant the biennials bluebells campanula canterbury bellsfoxglove and hollyhocks but i want them to bloom next year is this possible do i plant them now i live in zone ontario canada how can i get these biennials to bloom next year and tips should i sow them inside in march next year thanks in advace these are all very beautiful flowers and some of my most favorites but if i understand you correctly it sounds like you want to take a biennial flower a flower that takes two full growing seasons to bloom and somehow magically force them to bloom in one season ie next year do i understand you correctly here if you plant them from starter plants you'll probably be okay if you're talking about starting them from seed like it sounds like you are no way they really do require two years once in a while especially w foxgloves i've had the experience where they've set out a few small uninspired blooms that first year but it really takes until the second year for them to bloom luxuriantly and then i've had flower spikes three four feet tall there roots need the time to establish themselves and the plant and to store enough food to power the blooming so the answer is yes i would plant them now the sooner you get them into the ground the sooner they will grow and establish themselves and bloom for you btw bluebells and campanula are the same thing where i live Flowering plant Plant Flower Campanula Alfalfa Digitalis Perennial plant Weed control Flax Pansy Bamboo Hemp Apple Japanese tea ceremony Orchidaceae Cannabis cultivation Dandelion Sunflower Flower class corvette Pachypodium brevicaule Land mine Leaf Rose Sage Sugar beet Pollination RuneScape skills Pachypodium ambongense Hippeastrum Banksia Fruit Pollen Loganberry Burdock The Time Machine Winx Club Pruning fruit trees Germination Wisteria Kudzu Liriodendron Tree Bladderwort Bloom County Potato Garden Strawberry Pollinator decline Biology of the Sierra Nevada Root Brassica oleracea Seed Guinea pig Comfrey Wild carrot Peanut Hay Pinophyta Date Palm Wheat Eutrophication Carnivorous plant Celery Clover Cryptic crossword Ragweed Mignonette Black pepper Pachypodium baronii Coconut Simone Weil Volleyball Amaranth Current teachings of Prem Rawat Titan arum Turnip (brassica rapa) RuneScape economy Vanilla Tamarix Jute Ginger Textile manufacturing Begonia Cotton thistle Dipsacus Ivysaur Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Apricot Bloom filter Tomato Joshua tree Rambutan Cereal Dame's Rocket Pachypodium bicolor Iris (plant) Morning glory Carbon dioxide sink Century plant
