trumpet vine can it be contained in a big pot instead of planting i bought some trumpet vine seeds but have read in a gardening forum of how agressive and invading they are this makes me not want to plant them on the ground and have it to become a pest for me or my neighbors so i was wondering if anyone knows if i plant them in a big pot with a trellis will that be okay i bought them for my butterfly and hummingbird garden thanks you know it's not the roots that are the problem the trailing vines scoot across the ground and root as they go the problem is in that they like to sneak under siding and take things over it's definitely worth a try to plant one in a pot but you will need a very big pot like the size of a half barrel you will also need to keep an eye on the trailing runners and either prune them off or train them onto a structure or fence i personally don't like trumpet vines because they are messy looking but i have two volunteers in my yard and the humming birds absolutely love them so i let them stay good luck and i hope it works out for you oh trumpet vines thrive on neglect so you don't have to fuss over them at all just make sure you water it weekly and use minimal fertilizer or your vine will probably get out of control granted my vines are in the ground but i do nothing for them i don't give them water or anything and they flourish even during drought i think these things are next to impossible to kill once they've rooted Bonsai Fruit tree propagation Poker jargon Hydroponics Pea Weed control Houseplant Kudzu Weed Wisteria Bamboo Garden Strawberry Sorghum Betting (poker) Carnivorous plant Gardening Cannabis cultivation Frankie Laine Pruning fruit trees Agriculture Social rule Yosemite National Park Biological pest control Equine conformation Organic farming Irrigation Hummingbird Tomato Great Depression Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an King Khalid International Airport Aerial (dance move) Draw poker Vine RuneScape quests Hippeastrum Hamster Aphid Tobacco Apple Textile manufacturing Gypsy moth Ayahuasca Plant Beverly Hills, California RuneScape skills Tag Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Creeping Charlie Anarchism and society Biodynamic agriculture Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Green Revolution Baseball Collision detection Red imported fire ant Bowling for Columbine Root Coffee Kiwifruit Syphon Filter German grammar Tea Loganberry Morning glory Piccolo Junior Saga Cuscuta Simone Weil Herbicide Billboard Hot 100 Carburetor Fire fighting Insect Apricot Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Fertilizer American Old West Cloaking device Cookware and bakeware Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Neem Shrub Samuel Goldwyn Coconut Mid-levels Potato Palmdale, California Elis Prefecture Introduced species Shotgun Pumpkin Desertification Kimi Finster Kevin and Kell Goodness and value theory Peanut Rigging RuneScape economy Justification (theology) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue
