schefflera question is there any way to encourage new shoots on a schefflera plant i transplanted it quite a while back because it was in bad condition i lost a lot of the plant but now it is growing well and is for the most part healthy but it is tall and very spindly with the first leaves being about inches from the soil surface i think i will have to resort to cutting it back is it possible to root the stalks i will be cutting off i actually put together a fact sheet about my dwarf schef some of the info may be useful to you dwarf umbrella tree s arboricola dwarf schefflera s arboricola prefer day temperatures between and f nighttime temperatures should remain above f keep plants away from heat vents radiators open windows and air conditioners hot or cold drafts will damage plants the leaves of this species are divided into seven to short glossy green leaflets up to inches long a few cultivars have golden or variegated foliage young plants will have smaller leaves with fewer leaflets the leaves are thicker than those of s actinophylla green gold has gold splashed leaves and pittmans pride is a dwarf compact form soil water water scheffleras thoroughly then let the soil dry to inch deep before watering again never let a plant sit with water in its saucer a general purpose potting soil works just fine light scheffleras prefer medium to bright light fertilizing fertilize scheffleras regularly either with a water soluble or a time release houseplant fertilizer feed according to label directions plants growing in reduced light will need less frequent fertilization than plants growing in bright light blooming doesn t dormancy repot overcrowded plants at any season and to keep plants small prune just above a leaf there is no need to worry about a dormancy period propagation propagation is by seed cuttings and air layering i actually failed at the air layering although it was my first attempt ever but managed to get two new babies from cuttings over the winter toxicity not to mildly toxic i have seen this plant listed as both however i have never know of a cat or dog or other pet interested in using this as a chew toy even the dwarf varieties are quite large and at least softwood to semi hardwood so they don t try to eat it however stranger things have happened so use your own discretion you know your animals and kids and their behaviors problems in the home plant diseases are very rarely a problem too much or too little water plus insects and mites are the main problems mealybugs scale insects and mites are common pests of scheffleras root rot usually results from a soil mix that does not drain quickly or overly frequent watering dead areas form on leaves several days after exposure to excessive cold maintain temperatures above f do not place plants near air conditioning vents low light can cause leaf yellowing with spindly weak stems leaf drop can be caused by excessive watering by low humidity or by chilling now if you are any good at this and i myself failed the one and only time i have tried to do it at home but i don't think i waited long enough i would air layer it to get rid of all that gangly stem here is an excellent site with full color pics to help you out this is a point of reference that i used but like i said i don't think i waited long enough also i hate to admit this but inspite of my love for plants my diligence in keeping the moss damp was less than desirable here is the site http aggie horticulture tamu edu extension ornamentals airlayer airlayer html i hope that this was helpful update i have managed to take cuttings and root them successfully before make sure that when you cut with a clean and sterile knife parts of you use either a whole leaf section with the bulbous bottom attached and i like the strip away the outside layer so there is more tissue surface area and then i recommend dipping it in some rooting hormone i would then put it in a mix that is half perlite and half peat and make sure that it stays moist and out of direct light also to help sterilize like i mentioned above you probably want to use a bleach solution that would be part
