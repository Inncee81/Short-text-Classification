how do i care for my moonflower plant i have what the nursery called a true moonflower plant it is not a vining plant all the info i can find on moonflower plants are regarding the vining variety the first two blooms unfolded last night does this plant require deadheading of blooms how long should i expect blooming to continue through the summer i noticed the first two blooms did not re open tonight but a third bloom has opened it's huge can i collect seeds for propogation next year if so how this plant seems to require watering every day and does not like direct sun for very long any advice would help me out thank you thank you all for your great input today i noticed all the newest buds on my moonflower plant have all fallen off so far i've only had the three blooms open over the past two evenings and now all that is left are three which appear to be ready to open this evening why did all the bloom buds fall off it's been close to degrees here the past few days and humid but being a tropical plant i'm thinking those would be ideal conditions i'm so disappointed just when this beautiful plant begins to bloom and shine all the bloom buds fall off such a beautiful plant too i originally bought it simply because of it's name moonflower i love the moon and moonlight and starshine and gazing and all such thank you dances with unicorns love that name and gary very helpful all of you i researched datura a few years ago is datura toxic to touch i can't recall now thanks again e from your description of the plant it sounds like a datura the twining moonflower is an ipomoea alba which grows on a ft vine and looks like a huge white morning glory on steroids datura also called moonflower devil's trumpet or jimson weed is a soft stemmed shrubby plant that will send up short okra like pods when the top of the pod splits open a tightly wound columnar flower pushes it way upwards and as evening falls unwinds into large trumpet shaped bloom the blooms usually only last one evening and then drop off so you shouldn't have to deadhead them the next phase of the moon flower is seed production the spent flower pod will turn downwards and in a few weeks a large spiny seed pod will replace it as the seed pod matures and begins to dry the spines will become quite sharp and the whole thing will eventually split and expode scattering seed everywhere as you noticed they are not very drought tolerant i've grown datura in areas that only receive part sun and they seem to do fine as long as they have consistent moisture my plants were started from seed collected from a friends' woodland lot he said that the seed needs to freeze for a week to break dormancy but i got equal results from seed that i hadn't frozen at all one warning keep the datura plants away from small children and from teens looking for a cheap high ingesting the seeds and other parts of the plant can cause heart failure death also if you like the devil's trumpets you might like its sister plant the angel's trumpet brugmansia are closely related to datura but are generally larger plants where the flowers all hang downwards Brugmansia Datura Carnivorous plant Hemp Jute Leaf Textile manufacturing Bladderwort Rose Pachypodium brevicaule Pachypodium bicolor Sunflower Wisteria Cannabis cultivation Kudzu Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Flax Morning glory Tobacco Solar power Solanaceae Zion National Park Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Apple Flower Flowering plant Pachypodium Sweet potato Sorghum Okra Peanut Bonsai Illegal drug trade Maize Pansy Species Eucalyptus Hippeastrum USS Tunny (SS-282) Conifer cones Pachypodium ambongense Datura stramonium Houseplant Explosive material Common bean Wood Weed control Trumpet 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Phil Collins Rambutan Hamster Capercaillie Vine Tournament of Roses Parade Tea Auxin Comfrey Puncture Vine Pollination Pine Stratification (botany) Desert Climate of the United Kingdom Rice Aloe Cannabis (drug) Date Palm Loganberry Renewable energy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Naruto jutsu Black pepper Puberty Miss Saigon Global warming and agriculture Brewery Fruit tree propagation The Amber Spyglass Severe weather terminology (United States) Carbon dioxide Phalaenopsis Banksia Pachypodium habitats Equine conformation Sabbath Green Revolution Perfume Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Morphology of Pachypodium
