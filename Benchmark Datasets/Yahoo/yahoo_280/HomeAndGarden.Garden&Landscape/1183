how do i deal with the shallow roots from a neighbor's tree invading my yard i think it's a type of birch tree about ft tall with a canopy of ft maybe just guessing and it's right against the fenceline of our yard it's a beautiful tree but the shallow roots take up the entire space of yard on one side of our house the distance from the fence to house is about ft it's getting very difficult to walk on them and we'd like to dig the roots up and put in some paving stones will this kill the tree if it doesn't kill the tree will the roots just grow back and damage the walkway any suggestions before you chop up the roots be aware that if you kill the tree you could be in serious legal trouble even if removing the roots did not kill the tree chances are great that they will return there are other things you can do although you may not like it you can built up the area with extra soil to cover the roots another thing is that you can talk to your neighbor about having it removed offer to pay for the removal and they may agree or offer to pay half we had a tree hanging over our house that was dying but it was not ours so we talked to the owners and they agreed to split the cost of having the tree removed of course you are looking at somewhere between depending on the size of the tree just depends on how badly you want to get rid of it Lechaina Gypsy moth Poker jargon Glossary of graph theory Bonsai View camera Animal Crossing Elis Prefecture Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey McMansion Drainage Yosemite National Park Japanese tea ceremony Honey fungus Weed control Wood Betting (poker) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Blackjack Glossary of American football Textile manufacturing Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insurance Theory of conduct GunBound Bringing It All Back Home Capital punishment 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Old growth forest Dairy Collision detection Palace of Westminster RuneScape quests Stomach cancer Binary search tree Fruit tree propagation In-N-Out Burger The Amber Spyglass Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve The Inside Eucalyptus Life insurance Bristol Grammar School Conker's Bad Fur Day Bamboo Comfrey Satchel Paige Opportunity rover Seismic retrofit Hangi Naval mine Social rule Vegetation Tag Archery Chatsworth House Piccolo Junior Saga Tree Light pollution Species The Death Gate Cycle Prostate cancer Floppy disk Irrigation Garfield Hydroponics Acorn The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Divorce Erie Canal Rainforest Natural Selection (computer game) Beaver Baseball Coronation of the British monarch Totem pole Deforestation Pruning fruit trees Slide Mountain (New York) Trench warfare Giant Sequoia Sequoia Age of Mythology Simone Weil Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Table tennis Sheikh Abdullah RuneScape locations Great Pyramid of Giza Drill bit Zhao Yun Emperor Guangwu of Han Pachypodium habitats Construction
