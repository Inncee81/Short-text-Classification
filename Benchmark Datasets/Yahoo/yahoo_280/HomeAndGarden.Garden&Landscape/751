help thistles are everywhere how to get rid of them hi all my new house has thistles mixed in with plants and shrubs around my house they penetrated the mulch and i am starting to see some patches in my front lawn i have pulled them they grow again i pulled and shot round up in the hole they grown back a little yellow but still growing any suggestions i have thought about taking all the mulch off and laying down black tarp but i dont want to destroy the good plants any suggestions greatly appreciated pulling out thistles is futile as you have discovered even a tiny bit of root left behind will resprout you want to prevent thistle seeds from spreading so cut off the flowers and seed heads of the thistles but leave the stems and leaves standing round up works on green growing leaves not the soil it is absorbed through the leaves and travels to the roots to kill the plant and it will get all the roots so round up is a very good herbicide to use for thistles spray the round up on the leaves of the thistles if they are too close to other plants use a small paint brush to paint the leaves of just the thistles round up takes about weeks to work and thistles are hard to kill after applying round up wait weeks and reapply to any thistles that are still green you may have to repeat this or times learn to recognize thistle seedlings and spray them with round up too it will work better on small plants Weed control Weed Flowering plant Comfrey Leaf Kudzu Herbicide Plant Irrigation Banksia Carnivorous plant Black pepper Orchidaceae Mulch Cirsium Tobacco Alfalfa Hemp Christmas tree Wood Cotton thistle Ragweed Gypsy moth Tree Hop (plant) Pinophyta Earthworm Apple Cuscuta Textile manufacturing Gooseberry Broom (shrub) Sugar beet Hamster Bladderwort Flax Drill bit Tree of heaven Sunflower Pachypodium ambongense Cheese Potato Pachypodium Houseplant Rapeseed Pachypodium bicolor Gorse Cannabis (drug) Seed Fast bowling Coast Douglas-fir Eucalyptus Shotgun Green Revolution Sonchus Coconut Cannabis cultivation Piccolo Junior Saga Pine Tick Hydroponics Illegal drug trade M16 (rifle) Sorghum Globe artichoke Terminal ballistics Japanese tea ceremony Tamarix Soil pH Tillandsia Professional wrestling holds Wildfire Dandelion Crop circle Ginkgo Fruit tree propagation Rose The Amber Spyglass Fireweed Auxin Vermicompost Milk thistle Tiberium Wood carving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prosopis cineraria Fertilizer Vegeta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Biological pest control
