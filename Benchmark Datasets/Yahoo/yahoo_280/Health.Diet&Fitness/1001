i've never met a healthy looking vegan do they actually exist i don't mean vegetarians i've seen vegetarians of all shapes and sizes some of them are really fit and healthy others are sallow and boney and others are even obese but vegans on the other hand i've only met ones that were really skinny pale and sickly looking despite their appearance they would insist that their diet was super healthy and superior to other diets it just seems extreme to me and if the vegan diet is so great why do vegans have to use so many supplements in order to get just basic nutrition unfortunately for human beings our bodies evolved to be healthily supported off of a balance of meat and produce we re built to exist on a safe balance of both so it is no wonder both vegetarians and vegans run the risk of malnutrition a vegan diet can be beneficial to the participants if it is properly structured but most vegans don t choose their lifestyle because they think it s truly healthy religious beliefs environmental concerns and animal rights are the leading reasons for choosing the vegan lifestyle and those who truly do understand what the lifestyle includes take supplements i m sure you took a multivitamin as a child so what s the difference vitamin b calcium and protein deficient in vegan diets are all available in pill form my sister has been a vegan for three years and looks like your average college student there is a way to stay healthy as a vegan Dieting Vegetarian nutrition Nutrition Animal rights Coronary heart disease Cyanocobalamin Food Protein Folic acid Egg (food) Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Kashrut Omega-3 fatty acid Milk Vitamin C Breastfeeding Factory farming Tocopherol Peter Singer Low-carbohydrate diet Cancer Dog Anorexia nervosa People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Organic food Gelatin Tofu Human height Guinea pig Zinc Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Healthy eating Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Dietary fiber Environmental vegetarianism Alzheimer's disease Multiple sclerosis Obesity Traditional Chinese medicine Coeliac disease Vitamin Human skin color Fruitarianism Malnutrition Bodybuilding Punk ideology Genetically modified food Natural health Human Vegetarianism and religion Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Person Oily fish Paleolithic diet Domestic rabbit Golden rice Weight training Anemia Cheese Straight edge Asceticism Organic farming Super Size Me Cirrhosis Soy milk Growth hormone treatment Vitamin K Growth hormone Animal Liberation Front Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Buddhist cuisine Protein-energy malnutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Atherosclerosis Colorectal cancer Simone Weil Hindu Ulcerative colitis Buddhism Controversies in autism Tom Regan Puberty
