starting low carb and the cravings are killing me hi apparently i'm a carb addict so after kicking the can for years i finally committed to a low carb diet the other day it's been pretty easy since i bought all the stuff i like but i cannt go another hour without something like after every meal it seems like i ate sugar i had dessert after e v e r y t h i n g every meal and didn't realize how dessert had become a part of my life now it's day and i am actually losing my mind like if i don't eat a piece of candy or half a brownie i will go mad i thought the first few days you should feel satisfied and not hungry but i find myself eating almost constantly and dying for candy i know how pathetic but please give me tips on how to deal with this i really don't know if i'll make it through the day let alone until tomorrow help i sympathize with you so much i too am a carbo addict i never die for candy i dream about bread and rolls i was on the atkins diet for a while you know all proteins i want etc etc but it never helped me lose wt i find that a good balanced diabetic diet helps me lose slowly but i should be able to keep it off now my downfall is fats i do eat pasta breads but i like butter and olive oil i can't win dieting stinks and diet foods stink cravings will always be there i stopped smoking too so i play on the computer keep my hands busy by knitting and crocheting and read a lot i also go out for walks when i gave up carbs it took about weeks before i lost those carb cravings but cooking carbs for a family got me to go back if it was only out of site i might have been able to stay on the low carb why not take a piece of diet hard candy and suck on ot till about quarter is gone then wrap it up again till the urge becomes overwhelming suck another quarter of it good luck Atkins Nutritional Approach South Beach diet Low-carbohydrate diet Food Dieting Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Bread Jewish cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamburger Textile manufacturing Japanese cuisine Bong German cuisine Chocolate Little Britain Kit Kat Cuisine of the Philippines Breakfast Hamster Coronary heart disease Cuisine of the Southern United States Nutrition MRE Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian cuisine Tofu Coeliac disease Pasta Flour Hypoglycemia In-N-Out Burger Fasting Cuisine of Argentina The Apprentice 2 Binge eating disorder Domesticated turkey Barbecue Bulk vending Breastfeeding French cuisine Pizza Bengali cuisine Obesity Soul food Garfield Insulin Ron and Fez Cocaine Aerial (dance move) Healthy eating Grandview, U.S.A.
