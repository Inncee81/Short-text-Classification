i need someone to plan a balanced diet for me i am not allergic to anything so everything is fine i am so can someone do this for me this is the wrong place to ask for this kind of information there are too many quacks out there you need a professional nutritionist or a plan like weight watchers or jenny craig it will cost you some amount of money but you get what you pay for asking here is asking for trouble plans like jenny craig and weight watchers are in business to do the right thing mostly to lose weight but there is no reason why you can not make use of their service to maintain your existing weight in the process learn from them look at their menu items and after a while you can make up your own menu and get off the plan and stop paying them a plan like jenny craig or weight watchers is the quick fix you start eating well balanced meals immediately with no other research or effort on your part it takes self control and willpower to stick with the schedule and skip the snacks and junk food once you are on a supervised plan start doing your own research into why they choose the menu they do hit up the library and ask for help doing research into nutrition at the help desk likewise you can research through web sites but there is no accreditation of the information you find on the web no authority certifies the data as valid at the library you will not find bogus information as you do all over the web i'll bet it will only take a couple of months or so for you to learn enough to plan your own daily menus and think of the side benefit you'll also learn how to be a good cook watch minute meals with rachel ray on the food channel and get ideas she does a lot of simple wholesome meals start to finish all in the minute run time of the show she is not a professional chef and you don't have to be either personally i record her program several times a week and then as i play the tape i write things down so i can recreate the dish myself later on the show is paced too fast to write it down as you watch in real time i've collected quite a card file of quick and easy things from her show not only do i eat very well but i've managed to lose a lot of weight and now am easily keeping my weight under control at only pounds over what my doctor says is ideal for my bones and body type if i can do it believe me when i tell you you can do it too but you need a professional to advise and monitor whatever you decide to do Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight Watchers Computer Breastfeeding Windows 2000 Stomach cancer Weight training Nutrition Food Surveillance Extreme Programming Breakfast Restaurant Obesity CPU cache Hell's Kitchen (television) System/36 Poker jargon Ramen Hypoglycemia Medical prescription Folic acid Craps Scientology beliefs and practices Inflation Librarian EastEnders The Inside Mach kernel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Healthy eating Slot machine Insulin Mutual fund Prostate cancer In-N-Out Burger Kashrut Adjustable gastric band Spam (electronic) Coeliac disease Microeconomics Open access Information Services Procurement Library Gambling Enterprise content management Anorexia nervosa Veganism Fast bowling Betting (poker) BZFlag Omega-3 fatty acid Terri Schiavo Raw food diet Little Britain Marathon (sport) Urinary incontinence Binge eating disorder Equine conformation Windows XP Information Technology Infrastructure Library Game programming Iron Chef Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Web crawler Linked list Vegetarianism McDonald's Guinea pig CPU design Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Tofu Debugging Organic food Risk management Meal Hamburger Expert system Dietitian BASIC programming language Bengali cuisine Wal-Mart Low-carbohydrate diet Korean cuisine Gold standard Visual Basic Medicine Redundant array of independent disks Acorn National Weather Service Education in the People's Republic of China
