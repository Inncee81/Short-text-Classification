does this happen normally hello recently i've been doing stomach excersice thigh excersice and arm excersice when i feel my thighs i don't feel that much fat but i do feel muscle i looked in the mirror and my thighs look a bit bigger than they did before i dont exersice why is that thanks the exersice i do is swimming and running usually when you first work out the muscles get a little larger but you still haven't burned the fat off yet so your muscles are growing underneath the layer of fat it makes it look like they're getting bigger because they're essentially pushing the fat layer out a bit more over time you should be able to lose the fat if you're exercising well and eating well and then your legs won't look so big stick with it you'll see good results Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Swimming Aerial (dance move) Weight training Triathlon Puberty Breaststroke Professional wrestling holds Biped Exercise Diving Strap-on dildo Obesity Dieting Body image Tyrannosaurus rex Anorexia nervosa Fecal incontinence Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mr. Olympia Bodybuilding Anatomical terms of location Stomach Insulin Urinary incontinence Atkins Nutritional Approach Abdomen Physical attractiveness American lobster Marathon (sport) DDT (professional wrestling) Cheese Shark Mario series enemies Duchenne muscular dystrophy Breastfeeding The Legend of Zelda series enemies Speedo (suit style) Brown Bear Cuisine of Denmark Skin graft Vegeta Hamster Brain Undergarment Prostate cancer Iliotibial band syndrome Coronary heart disease Jennifer Lopez 2000 Australian Grand Prix Human anatomy Black widow spider Milton H.
