any ways to work transverse abs withouting isolation exercises for some reason transverse ab exercises feel weird to me i don't really have to patience to pull in and hold my abs but this seems to be the main way suggested to tone strengthen the transverse abs anyone know of other ways to work them maybe while doing an activity or other form of exercise like biking thanks you can work your tansverse abs with the plank hover or hip flexion if you don't want to do hip flexion as an isolated exercise do it with kness bent these are targeted exercises and each require you to pull in and hold abs while exercising the main function of the abs is isometric contraction this is how your torso is kept upright any exercise will help you to strengthen these core muscles and improve core stability but you do have to remember to pull in the muscles and hold as you mention if you do not engage them they will not benefit running biking skipping rowing abs will benefit if engaged during exercise they will also benefit if engaged during any kind of strength training but some good ones are things like single leg squats Weight training Equine conformation Swimming Urinary incontinence Iliotibial band syndrome Aikido Diving Bicycle Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) Tai Chi Chuan Elbow-joint Anti-lock braking system Anatomical terms of location Muscle Childbirth Chinese martial arts Infantilism Aerobic exercise Professional wrestling holds CPU cache Menstrual cup Exercise Motorcycle Deadlift Strap-on dildo Tetrapod Hip hop culture Breech birth Stretching Japanese toilet Human height Massage Professional wrestling throws R-Type Osteoporosis Running Biped Internal oblique Negation Prostate cancer Abdomen Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Recumbent bicycle Trumpet Testosterone Electroconvulsive therapy Swingout Fast bowling Clinker (boat building) Repetitive strain injury Bicycle frame Ulna Dog Clarinet Harmonica Asthma Creatine Optical fiber Scientology beliefs and practices Hip (anatomy) Gaussian elimination Horse Breaststroke Glossary of ballet terms Bates Method Skeletal muscle Humerus Sport rowing Myocardial infarction Boxing Sampling (music) Terminal ballistics Marching band Breastfeeding Bruce Lee ALGOL 68 Back pain Muay Thai Soleus muscle Obi-Wan Kenobi Human position Embouchure Boat building Professional wrestling attacks Stuttering Figure skating Theodicy Osteoarthritis Motility Clinical depression USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Chronic fatigue syndrome Double bass
