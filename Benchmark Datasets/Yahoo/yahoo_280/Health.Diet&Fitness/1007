one hour at the gym everyday does anyone know how much calories i'm burning well i stay on the bike for minutes i put lbs on the abdominal machine lol i don't know its name i do about moves then i go to the machines that is for back then shoulders then thighs then another one for thighs don't worry the trainer is supervising i just don't know the names of the machines i put about lbs and do about moves on each one of those machines i stay an hour at the gym how many calories do you think i'm burning i do about minutes of cardio at home i was just asking how many calories i burn at the gym probably nowhere near as many you think if your objective is burning calories and weight loss you'd be better off putting less time on the machines and more time on the bike and treadmill any doubts try your session wearing a heart rate monitor and see what the average is after your done then compare it to the average from an hour on the bike the bike number will be significantly higher why would we care about heart rate for weight loss because burning calories or fuel requires oxygen your cardiovascular system is what delivers oxygen to the muscles higher heart rate more oxygen more calories burned Weight training Myocardial infarction Dieting Diabetes mellitus Drowning Explosive material Obesity Carburetor Swimming Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Motorcycle Professional wrestling holds Decompression sickness Anorexia nervosa Space Shuttle program Pound Atkins Nutritional Approach Dialysis Suicide methods Triathlon Equine conformation Treadmill Heart Circulatory system Energy Fuel injection Aerobic exercise Bodybuilding Diesel engine M60 machine gun Cocaine Medicine Sleep apnea Recumbent bicycle Saturn V Milk Cardiac stress test Professional wrestling throws Obstetrics Single-stage to orbit Porsche 911 Puberty Breaststroke Calorie restriction Growth hormone treatment Breech birth Breastfeeding Rebreather Internal ballistics Childbirth Muay Thai Exercise Bicycle Dietary fiber Shock Apollo 8 Scuba set Gemini 7 Solar power Hydrogen economy Space disaster Orders of magnitude (energy) Atherosclerosis Asthma Blood pressure Pok__mon Chronicles Future energy development Fire fighting Jet engine Bicycle lighting Power (physics) Stroke Nuclear fusion Ton Coronary heart disease Gemini 9A Forge WCW Power Plant Automatic number plate recognition Bicycle helmet Car safety Aerial (dance move) Iliotibial band syndrome Low-carbohydrate diet Dance Dance Revolution Tour de France Gemini 10 STS-62 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Human position Mercury (planet) Angina Energy development B-47 Stratojet Renewable energy Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Emergency Medical Services Radiation therapy
