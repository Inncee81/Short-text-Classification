i can't seem to lose any weight i've been ' '' and lbs for about years now i've been running roughly miles everyday and eating healthier for about months now and i haven't lost a pound is there something wrong with me or is there something more i should be doing well first thing is if you've been doing the same workout for years your body has fully adapted to it so it has no reason to make any changes now on top of the fact that your body has adapted to it long duration low intensity cardio is a very inefficient way to lose body fat there is much research that bears this out but most gym goers don't read research and still believe you need to do endurance training to lose fat well you are the perfect example of how that doesn't work high intensity shorter duration cardio intervals are much more effective a cardio interval routine would be something like this minute warmup using bike treadmill elliptical whatever seconds at near max intensity on a scale of seconds at moderate intensity on a scale of repeat this interval times do a minute cooldown don't worry about how many calories you burn during your workout what is light years more important is how many calories you burn the other hours of the day don't you think with you low intensity cardio within minutes of hopping off the treadmill your metabolism is back where it was before your workout with high intensity intervals research shows you can keep your metabolism elevated for an additional hours that is much more important than worrying what the display on the machine says also you do need to do resistance training if you gain muscle that is great muscle is where your body actually burns fat for energy the more muscle you have the higher your metabolism is the more calories and fat you burn all day your current routine probably has caused you to lose muscle mass as far as nutrition goes your best bet to put your body in a position to burn fat is to eat frequently throughout the day at least times with smaller portions you obviously need to make good choices and drink plenty of water there are several good programs out there you could check out including turbulence training by craig ballantyne and burn the fat feed the muscle by tom venuto you can check them out at http www bestfitnesstools com also you could check out the week body transformation course at http www bodytransformationcourse com hope that helps dave s owner perfect fit personal training studio http www thetruthaboutdiets com Bodybuilding Exercise Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Triathlon Anorexia nervosa Marathon (sport) Nutrition Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Swimming Equine conformation Tocopherol Childbirth Super Size Me Prostate cancer Milk Low-carbohydrate diet Puberty Shark Veganism Healthy eating Glucocorticoid Nuclear weapon design Protein-energy malnutrition Heart rate Poker jargon Tide Traumatic brain injury Omega-3 fatty acid Milton H.
