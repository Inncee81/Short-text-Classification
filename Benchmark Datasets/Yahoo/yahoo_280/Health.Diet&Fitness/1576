can i eat flax seed whole or do i have to grind them i enjoy flax seeds in my cereal should i grind them up or can i just eat them whole i disagree with the former poster flax seeds need to be ground in order to get the benefit of the flax the seed is a protective shell and needs to be crushed ground if you use whole flax seeds rather than say the oil you need to grind them because the seed will only pass through your system undigested and you will not get the benefits from the flax seed Flax New Zealand flax Peanut Omega-3 fatty acid Common Agricultural Policy Textile manufacturing Flowering plant Vegetarian nutrition Linen Jute Oily fish Linseed oil Vegetarianism Agriculture Weaving Cereal Nut (fruit) RuneScape skills Veganism Vegetable oil Hemp Combine harvester Gamma-linolenic acid Maize Coriander Genetically modified food Industrial hemp Acorn Barley Buckwheat Salsola Idli Seed Pinophyta Coast Douglas-fir Coronary heart disease Culinary mustard 613 mitzvot Fancy rat Curry Chocolate Discordianism Baltic Sea Diarmaid mac Cearbhaill Porridge Plant Cloud seeding Rose Minor Harry Potter Beasts Breakfast Plant breeders' rights Black pepper Cannabis (drug) Northern Ireland Assembly Nutmeg Garlic Kira Yamato Famine Green Revolution Antioxidant Durian Crop circle Agriculture of the Soviet Union Egg (food) Sunflower seed Masanobu Fukuoka Pine Gulf War Muesli Tofu Mango Bread Pomegranate Watermelon Pine nut Horowhenua District Organic food Apple Stratification (botany) Mustard oil Olive Pikmin Frugivore Archer Daniels Midland Hamster Natufian culture Potato Dim sum Cashew Sweetcorn Quandong European Beech Giant Sequoia Pea Alfalfa Nostratic languages Date Palm English longbow Kenny McCormick
