a real diet question not one that asks how to lose weight fast well i stopped drinking soda awhile back yay me i drink alot of water and iced tea no juices just water and iced tea i walk at least an hour and a half a day with my son at variable speeds i have only one weakness sugar i wake up in the day and decide i am going to stop but then i see it and walk away then i cant stop thinking about it then i just give in because the cravings keep gettin intense i dont want to give it up slowly i just want to stop is there any possible way to do this yes you can do it but it takes willpower and self control trust me i've been there i went from being a carb and sugar junkie to going on atkins a few months not that i recommend that diet but this is to tell the story where i had to quit it all carbs a day allows no sugar i hated every minute of it okay not every minute but a whole lot of them but i did it you can leave the sugar behind if you want to badly enough right now you just don't want to badly enough it's not like heroin you're not going to get sick if you don't have it have a piece of fruit instead of that sugary item or a bottle of crystal light which tastes sweet it's all a matter of making up your mind that losing weight is more important than your immediate desire for sweet item it's not easy i know and i do eat sweets now but i keep them to a minimum and try to make my treats sugar free or carb free or less unhealthy than i used to hang in there it's so worth it and when you hit your goal allow yourself the occasional sweet treat it's amazing how much better they taste when you have them once in a while instead of a regular part of your diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Tooth Bong Breakfast Sugar Soft drink Japanese tea ceremony Tea Diet soda Low-carbohydrate diet South Beach diet Fanta Coffee Wine Cocaine Rum Dieting Cuisine of the Philippines Chocolate Food Alcoholic beverage Sugar beet The Coca-Cola Company Binge eating disorder In-N-Out Burger Social rule Hamster Breastfeeding Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark RuneScape quests Little Britain Japanese cuisine Mountain Dew Ice cream Domestic rabbit Milk Super Size Me Champagne (beverage) Shaggy dog story Diabetes mellitus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Apprentice 2 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bread The Amazing Race Fecal incontinence Russian cuisine Cider Kit Kat Peruvian cuisine New Coke Drug addiction Hypoglycemia Fancy rat Theory of conduct Vinegar Cuisine of Singapore Fasting Shen Gong Wu Snapple Cha chaan teng Tea (meal) Cuisine of Argentina Matt Hardy Folic acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sherbet Yerba mate German cuisine Time Out of Mind Tofu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Addiction Lemon Jewish cuisine Bodybuilding Hong Kong-style milk tea Decompression sickness Stomach cancer Mid-levels Alcoholics Anonymous Vegeta Guinea pig 7 Up Cannabis (drug) About a Boy Blonde on Blonde Confectionery Drink Sucralose Toyota Prius
