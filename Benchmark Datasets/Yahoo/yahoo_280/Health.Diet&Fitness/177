expired vitamins i have a bottle of vitamin b that is best by june is there any danger in taking them the date that is listed as best used by is just that if you take these vitamins before the date you will get the full potency however the longer the date passes the less potency it has that's why it's always best to start using them as soon as they are purchased and when buying them look for the latest date with b vitamins it's not a big deal to use the vitamins just a few months after the date but with several others it's not recommended if your not doing so already try to keep your vitamins out of the light and away from the heat a good place is in the refrigerator just remember to close the bottle tightly otherwise the moisture can make them stick together Milk Psoriasis Tocopherol Sea-Monkey Vitamin D Vitamin Vitamin C Shelf life Ammonia Molotov cocktail Breastfeeding Homeopathy The Flintstones Folic acid Houseplant Sunscreen Marathon (sport) Vitamin poisoning Hamster Ultraviolet Alcoholic beverage Acne Herpes simplex virus Nutrition Mattress Copyright law of the United Kingdom Linus Pauling Upholstery Garlic Coca-Cola Coffee Counter-Strike Rickets Riboflavin Plastic Illegal drug trade Air conditioning Trademark Refrigerator Food preservation Anorexia nervosa Scurvy Wine making Final Fantasy XI Pasteurization Cooking oil Prohibition Infant formula Fecal incontinence Domestic rabbit Organic food Yoghurt Isotretinoin Kitchen Cephalexin Controversies in autism Service economy Heinkel He 100 Fish oil The Suffering (game) Ekadasi Food Guinea pig The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items GunBound German car number plates Bong LSD Autonomous building Cannabis (drug) Dietary fiber Hay Water Urinary incontinence Antioxidant Skin Indianapolis 500 Computus Enlargement of the European Union Ramen Propane Egg (food) Food storage Refrigerator car Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Tlingit MetroCard Campfire Brewery ITunes Scientology beliefs and practices Chlorpromazine Tofu Antiretroviral drug Solar cell Scar Rum Royal jelly Ketamine
