is this too thin to be and lbs that isn't how much i weigh now but it's my goal weight i'm about lbs away everyone says i'm anorexic and such for wanting to be that thin is it really too thin i would think from my own experience and what others are saying you are probably a little unrealistic about your goal when i was at feet inches tall i got down to pds i was a living skeleton but still thought i was fat what do you think i was allways sick chronic bronchitis anemic and having hallucinations from the weight loss i was also severly dehydrated and was hospitalized even at my low weight i still had size inch hips and despite being in very small clothes i could not change the shape of my hips bones are a good indicator of what you should look like it sounds like you are probably closer to a healthier weight right now about pds and that is still thin it is only models who are going to weigh the goal you have and they have to starve themselves to get to that if you are unhappy about your shape try exercising more and lifting weights is an excellent way to tone and firm the body as well as to body sculpt certain areas not even two people of the same height are allways going to be the same weight a big part of it is genetics you can only do so much with what you were born with the rest is a blueprint of sorts ask a third party someone you don't know dont ask a female ask a male a man will give you a more honest answer than a female women are allways on diets and lets face it we are allways in competition with each other and females can be very catty to each other when it comes to looks what do your parents think if you still aren't sure ask your dr they can do a bmi and that will give you a measurement that will tell you if you are underweight average or overweight there are many sites on the internet and you can check for yourself good luck Anorexia nervosa Obesity Weight training Atkins Nutritional Approach Body mass index Equine conformation Physical attractiveness Puberty Dieting Sexual attraction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Human height Birth weight Human penis size Binge eating disorder Low-carbohydrate diet Anemia Bodybuilding Largest organism Dog Bass guitar Childbirth Mattress Weight Cancer Chair Super Size Me Physical examination Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Paragliding Osteoporosis Breastfeeding Milk Diabetes mellitus Sperm Whale Curling Wood Liger Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Brassiere Hamster Handloading Knife Garfield Breast Dinosaur Insulin Human skin color Cat Scale model Mixed-breed dog Sin City Ship model Weight loss SuperCroc Growth hormone treatment Osteoarthritis Humphrey Bogart Chronic fatigue syndrome High-heeled shoe Boxing Intersex surgery Glycogen storage disease type I Little Britain Terri Schiavo Horse Sexual dimorphism M16 (rifle) Exercise Glossary of partner dance terms Indian English Raw food diet Airsoft Autopsy Shaggy dog story Skin Golf club (equipment) Social rule Tai Chi Chuan Saturn V Clinical depression Sexual differentiation Weighing scale Cystic fibrosis Figure skating Domestic rabbit Hearing impairment Theory of conduct Hip (anatomy) Fetal development Tightlacing Corset Quake III Arena
