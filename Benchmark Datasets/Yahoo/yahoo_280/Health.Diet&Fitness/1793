i am a women and have been over weight just about all my life i hate me for not taking care of my self in the all my hair fell out and need grew back i am single and hated only dated once for about month in years never been happy i need so much to loose at least pounds please help i really just don t know where to start hello oh sweety my heart goes out to you the first thing that you always want to rember before you start any kind of diet is to consult a doctor to make sure you do not have any medical problems that could be effected by dieting such as thyroid hyper or hypo why because if you do and you take something with speed or over amount's of caffeen it could be fatal i know this because i take thyroid replacement and i cannot just take over the counter drugs to loose weight or congestive heart failure which having to many fluids can be dangerous seeing that heart failure causes you to retain fluid anyway here are a feww things that i can suggest that will help you loose weight that has worked for me in the passed when eating chilly add some lettus in with it and this will cause you to become fuller sooner without eating to much eat smaller amounts at a time but more offten take a box of jello and pour the contents in a cup of hot water and drink it before you eat and this will also make you fill full so you won't eat to much learn to dissaplaine yourself where you won't allow yourself to eat when you know you can't possiably be hungry again think about it it's just a craving a feeling you don't have to let this feeling controll you you controll your feelings do not let yourself continue to be a servant or slave to your feeling's the bible says that to whom you yeild your members to obey thats whose servant you are what is more important you or your feeling's or what your body wants verses living a happy successful life you choose who you will serve look if you really didn't want or belive that you could do this you wouldn't have posted the question right that's right so get started i belive in you and so does the god of heaven and earth who made you the beautiful person that you are he sees you as a completed finished whole person so don't look at yourself any different ok i sure hope that i have helped you god bless you richly bye now Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atkins Nutritional Approach Stomach cancer Anorexia nervosa Book of Isaiah Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fasting Coeliac disease Dieting Ten Commandments Sola fide Prostate cancer Christian eschatology Paradise Lost Fecal incontinence Genesis Marilyn Monroe Breastfeeding Piccolo Junior Saga Tocopherol Rei Ayanami Adjustable gastric band Milk Diabetes mellitus Alcoholic beverage Folic acid Pitaten Original sin Phaedo Red Hot Chili Peppers Poker jargon Obesity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Current teachings of Prem Rawat Terri Schiavo Weight training Characters of The Sandman Time Out of Mind Binge eating disorder Immortality Alcoholics Anonymous Matthew 5 Hyperthermia Hypertension Chocolate Dialysis Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Ramen YuYu Hakusho Hypoglycemia God Abortion debate Muslim ibn Aqeel Domestic rabbit Diarrhea Drug addiction The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Nine Inch Nails One Tree Hill (TV series) Fertility awareness Word of Wisdom Shen Gong Wu Romulus and Remus The Amber Spyglass The Contender (television series) IBM PC compatible Priesthood (Mormonism) Little Britain Sub-Zero Anxiety Aztec The Death Gate Cycle The Pilgrim's Progress John Howard Yoder W.I.T.C.H.
