am i fat how to help it i'm foot and pounds i work out but i always over eat my legs are in good shape but my stomach is bit chubby and my arms look really big and out of proportion to my body am i overweight do you think i could help this with just lots of running or are there other things to do i can only run about a half a mile at a time because i don't have much endurance if i go run about a half a mile a few times a day so it adds up to or miles is it just as good of a workout if i were to run it all at once i've gotta start somewhere right i'm not sure if you're overweight maybe just a few pounds but definitely not enough to be unhealthy so no need to be worried from that standpoint but i hear you on the arms and stomach me too anyway if you're looking to lose a few pounds be warned that when you run more you get hungrier i run miles per week and still gain weight if i don't keep track of what i eat because the more i run the hungrier i am hang around with a marathoner and you'll be amazed how much food they can put down running will help if you're also careful about what you eat i'd recommend starting by doing a run walk program maybe run mile walk mile and then repeat for miles gradually building up distance and then gradually shortening your walk breaks it will be easier than motivating yourself to go out times a day and more rewarding as you start to be able to run farther and farther but in addition to running you'll have to count calories too or you'll eat more without realizing it and not lose a pound at your weight run walking miles per day you'll need to stay around cals day to lose weight at about to pound a week the loss will taper off after a while because you'll burn fewer calories as you get thinner but then you will still need to stay around or exercise more to maintain a weight of not healthy to go under cals and it's very hard and not very healthy for someone who's only slightly overweight if at all to lose more than a pound a week best of luck Obesity Super Size Me Dieting Weight training Anorexia nervosa Binge eating disorder Bodybuilding Adjustable gastric band Equine conformation Weight loss Breastfeeding Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aerial (dance move) Triathlon Hamster Babe Ruth Garfield Piccolo Junior Saga Gastric bypass surgery Low-carbohydrate diet Calorie Exercise Internal ballistics Stomach cancer Healthy eating Seabiscuit Swingout Weight Watchers Baseball Comanche Horse gait Fancy rat The Amazing Race Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Swimming Cheese Brown Bear Hamburger Clinical depression Little Britain Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 South Beach diet Paragliding Mercury Atlas 6 Body type (exercise) Puberty Fecal incontinence Kodocha Knife B-52 Stratofortress Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Diving Fasting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Explosive material Boxing Omega-3 fatty acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Trans fat Margarine Professional wrestling throws Chair B-47 Stratojet 613 mitzvot Fast food M4 Sherman Battle of Kursk Tocopherol Year of the Spider Domestic rabbit High-heeled shoe Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fast bowling Terri Schiavo Skateboarding trick Veganism Treehouse of Horror V Horse Pound Iditarod Gray Wolf Physical attractiveness Egg (food) Pig (zodiac) Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 1957 World Series Blood (computer game) The Emancipation of Mimi
