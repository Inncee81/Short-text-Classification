trying to take off the inches i am trying to take some inches off my waist i walk days a week for to minutes roughly two and a half to five miles a day depending on my mood with a backpack weighing lbs which i have been doing for weeks i have been told that plastic wrap around the waist would help aid in taking off inches what i want to know is this true has anyone ever tried it if so what were your results also is it safe real answers please the plastic wrap myth has been around for decades the plastic wrap will cause the area to sweat and lose water content so it appears to be thinner when you take a pate measures to it however over night when you body replenishes your cells with the necessary moisture the skin will plump up again and go back to it's original size thats how slimming creams work it not healthy to remove the moisture from your cells and can be harmful it you continually do it so skip the wrap all wraps the only true way that you will take those inches off of your waist is through a health diet cardio which you are already doing and some targeted exercises although targeted exercises won't help you lose fat around the waist you can firm and flatten with exercise one of the best for your ab area is the bicycle followed by push aways very similar to the bicycle and reverse crunches forget about standard crunches and sit ups you have to do way too many Weight training Tightlacing Tofu Undergarment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Obesity Menstrual cup Wood Dieting Physical attractiveness Hyperthermia Hamster Atkins Nutritional Approach Floppy disk Exercise Hiking AIDS Skin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Psoriasis Aerial (dance move) Prostate cancer Cheese Professional wrestling throws Puberty Breastfeeding Explosive material Powerbomb Super Size Me Urinary incontinence Suplex Hypoglycemia Mattress Thermoregulation Dairy Water Nutrition Eczema Insulin Swingout Vitamin C Bodybuilding Corset Screw Scar Curling Radiation therapy Terminal ballistics Tocopherol Drill bit Guinea pig Diabetes mellitus Kimberly-Clark Corporation STS-59 Dog Clinical depression Canoe Sniper Brassiere M16 (rifle) Scale model Spider Ocean's Twelve Textile manufacturing Dog agility Garfield Captain Thunderbolt Glycerin Growth hormone treatment Acne Traumatic brain injury Stem cell Fetal development Fancy rat NASCAR Menstrual cycle Swimming Timpani Strap-on dildo Massage Diving suit Aquatic ape hypothesis First aid Wound healing phases Bicycle helmet Penis enlargement Bacon Sewage treatment STS-62 Gray Wolf Tour de France Rugby union Soap
