calories a day if i burn more calories than what i ate everyday can i lose pounds in weeks i have high metabolism as well quick answer without doing the math yes more drawn out answer technically i don't see it possible how you will be burning cal more than what you ate i can understand someone with a high metabolism being able to burn about cal in a day but they have to eat too ok so lets look at how calories effect wieght loss and gain every individual basically has their normal running rate for burning calories that means that every day your body will burn x number of calories based solely on the size of your body and how fit you are this is where the high metabolism comes in for the most part women have a basal metabolic rate thats the base rate of about cal day you can calculate this for yourself really easily for a woman years old the basal metabolic rate is equal to x your weight in kilos plus or minus calories depending on your level of fitness this is a very simple version of the bmr equation but it can give you a good idea ex if you weighed kilos about lbs then you would have a bmr of about cal day ok so what about exercising when you exercise you are basically going above and beyond the bmr and are consuming more calories someone who excerises moderatley about times a week will consume about times their bmr so if i use the old example about calories day this number can vary up or or down depending on the amount you excercise obviously so how does weight loss work weight loss when talking about calorie reduction diets basically occurs when a calorie deficit is created daily so say you excerise times a week and burn calories a day if you were to ingest calories every day from your diet then you would see weight loss the body requires that extra calories and will take it from old carbohydrate and fat stores which leads to weight loss so what does this mean it means that in order to do what you propose which is burn calories more than you eat you would have to jack your metabolism up super high then eat very little possible perhaps would you pass out and end up in the hospital most likely to get your metabolism up to you would have to both have a bmr of about and a do an extreme of amount of excercise to get your metabolic rate up to x your bmr just a note the way to get a bmr of you would have to weigh kilos lbs of moslty muscle and low body fat or have high body fat and weigh kilos lbs and at that weight i doubt vigorous exercise will be a reality oh and that whole thing of then burning the whole every day would go with the stipend that you don't eat at all only water which is stupid your body needs the nutrients if not for the calories then for the other processes in the body that keep your systems running like your nervous system so back to the root of the question lbs in weeks that is possible i'm not going to pretend to be a dietician and say exactly what you need to do but i would try this cut refined sugars from your diet soda candy etc basically anything sweet that isnt fruit reduce the amount of fat you eat lean meats no fast food eat smaller portions no seconds calculate your bmr like i showed you how to do above then multiply by about remember this means excercising times a week then take the number you get and substract for the next two weeks count the calories you consume its not too hard to do just read the labels on the back of the packages be honest with yourself if that salad dressing is cal per tablespoons and you used tablespoons worth you had cal not if you are diligent and keep the calories down by about a day and are not eating sugars and extra fats you should see the weight come off its not extreme it doesnt have to be the problem most people have with dieting and losing weight is they assume they have to starve themselves eating calories a day is not starving if you eat healthy foods not full of sugar this is quite easy good luck i hope this helped you ps it may also help to count how many calories you normally eat in day and compare that to what you should be eating Calorie Anorexia nervosa Milk Diabetes mellitus Insulin Hormone
