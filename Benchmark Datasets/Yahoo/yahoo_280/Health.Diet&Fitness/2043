need some thoughts on home work out tools specifically the total gym im a martial artist and i need to focus on strengthening specific body parts that i dont work out enough in my normal training mainly the hamstring and some of the upper body i dont like typical home gyms as they feel kinda clunky the seats get uncomfortable when lifting heavy weights and they are annoying to switch weights now i have seen allot about the total gym and it looks pretty good for what i want however i would like some opinions on it and maybe other alternative home gyms actually that is one of my issues i have a little fat mixed in with my muscle im looking to loose will dumbbells help with this as well well the total gym is ok but free weights are much better for you i know they are clunky but they work out many parts at one time where as total gym only specifies on one particular area then you have to fold it another way and focus on another area its much easier just to get a set of dunbells lie down on a chest or bed or anything and do some of your workouts like that also i know alot of martial artists are extremely strong for their size and most are not very heavy at all what im getting at is that the total gym works off of your body weight thus if you are very strong and only weigh lbs you arent getting too much of a workout however with dunbells you can get the weight that is perfect for you just my opinion hope this helps Mixed martial arts Bodybuilding Equine conformation Chair Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling holds Breastfeeding Weight Anchor Exercise Dieting Weightlifting Knife Anorexia nervosa Mattress Chinese martial arts Dance Dance Revolution Professional wrestling throws Puberty Prostate cancer Casualty lifting Dumbbell Urinary incontinence Terminal ballistics Brassiere Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Aikido Martial art Social rule Tocopherol Fighting Spirit Stretching Pumping Iron Sport rowing Kim Possible TGV Body mass index Autism Bicycle Squat (exercise) Judo Anxiety Paper size Son Goku (Dragon Ball) HTML element Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Bench press Atkins Nutritional Approach Deadlift Childbirth Sleep apnea Chucky Pancamo Theory of conduct Casting Sento Wood Canadian federal election, 1993 Muay Thai U.S. Electoral College Falconry Gay slang Internet troll Tetrapod Out-of-body experience Bruce Lee David L.
