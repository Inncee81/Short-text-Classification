how can i shrink my butt how can i minimize my thighs and butt mostly butt does anyone know any excercises i already run alot not helping thanks any kind of cardio that you do that causes you to break a sweat will help also lower your calorie intake to lose fat you must lose weight the best range to lose weight in is to lbs a week this will allow your body to accustom itself to the loss and the skin to regain its prestretched stage losing weight too quickly will cause the skin of abdomen chest and inner thighs to sag possibly dramatically i don t personally believe in any of the fad diets that keep showing up i think that they put your body into an unhealthy famine mode which will cause you to gain the fat right back if you start to eat normally again the best idea is to eliminate all junk food you can do a cheat day if you need to but don t go overboard eat balanced meals of reasonable size overeating will cause your stomach to be too large and you will still feel hungry when you re not also have lots of healthy snacks during the day ideally you ll want to eat or small meals throughout the day carry food with you so you aren t tempted to eat unhealthily when you re out of the house and don t buy unhealthy foods get foods that are low in bad fats we do need fat to survive but not saturated fat minimize the processed flours and sugars no white bread no sugar choose leaner meats and protein sources don t expect to eat pizza and burritos all the time and lose weight and eat tons of vegetables eat salads steamed vegetables and raw vegetables too you can t eat so much celery that you ll get fat don t eat too much fruit or things containing high fructose corn syrup the reason is that fructose is hard on the liver because it can only be metabolized there you can eat fruit during or after a workout don t eat late at night because your body will turn it into fat eat a smaller amount of calories than needed to maintain your weight you have burn more than you intake always exercise cardio especially but weights are good too don t give up you ll be glad you chose to lose the weight Low-carbohydrate diet Bodybuilding Food Nutrition Weight training Veganism Hamster Milk Hypoglycemia Vegetarianism Super Size Me Tocopherol Fasting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Folic acid Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Sugar Stomach cancer Jewish cuisine Vitamin C Binge eating disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Equine conformation Tofu Egg (food) Bread German cuisine Insulin Fecal incontinence Adjustable gastric band Food preservation Hamburger Prostate cancer 613 mitzvot Guinea pig Coronary heart disease Tooth Cheese Dietary fiber Colorectal cancer Cuisine of the Southern United States Trans fat Japanese cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food guide pyramid Acorn Fancy rat Fat French cuisine Junk food Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Aspartame Calorie restriction Protein Protein-energy malnutrition Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Brazil Sugar substitute Puberty Korean cuisine Diabetes mellitus Raw food diet Cuisine of Malaysia Aerial (dance move) Weight loss Fugu Enzyme Calorie Soul food Glycemic index Chinese cuisine MRE Cholesterol Thermoregulation Alcoholic beverage Fructose Foodborne illness Crohn's disease Jet engine Meal Organic food Soy protein Chicken Hyperglycemia
