i want to gain lbs im almost im ' and ppl think im aneroxic should i work out and take proteins i revised my question from the one posted earlier i need help in gaining a good lbs i've been just as slim as i am since i can remember going back not that im not healthy im usually phsically active i play sports and etc but i eat twice a day once usually around the evening and once late at night right before i go to sleep i don't know if that's healthy or not but i do it cuz that's usually the hour when i get hungry for instance im on my summer vacation and for about two weeks now i go to sleep around in the morning and wake up at in the evening i don't work out and am planning on starting should i take proteins along i mean i have no body mass so even if i was to start working out it wouldn't look as good but i need some real good advice please i was a lanky super skinny teenager and so can relate you are at the peak of your growth and guys generally shoot up before they fill out i am sorry people think you are anorexic when you are just getting tall you can't compare yourself to people ten years older in just a couple years your bulkier calssmates who look fine now will be fighting jelly bellies but you'll be in great shape you are a work in progress it's great to be a guy who is ' ' or even taller you'll probably get a little bit taller still it's hard but be kind to yourself and have a little patience and pride in your height and that you have the courage and smarts to reach out for answers working out sounds great to build mass protein bars shakes drinks are all good but an even better place to start is eating more often two meals a day for almost is not enough slows down your metabolism and that won't help with working out when you want stamina and energy do not work out on an empty stomach you'll burn your fat and that won't help you gain weight build muscle eat some carbohydrate rich food hour to one hour before working out not a huge meal but something protein bars peanut butter sandwich yogurt bananas are all easy try not to let more than hours pass without eating something but preparing food is sometimes a lot of trouble and if it isn't easy we don't do it the trick is to have foods on hand that you like either ones that require little or no preparation or that you can make in advance and have ready that way you could snack a bit throughout the day do you cook or does someone else in your house do the cooking and shopping are you planning to go to a gym to work out because the trainers there will be happy to talk to you about specific protein drinks and such to best build muscle and add healthy mass i'm a little concerned about your sleeping through the day till pm hours of sleep per day sounds like a little more than is optimum how are you feeling physically and emotionally energetic or get tired easily interested in things or bored sad or happy how easy is it for you to get to see friends and be with others sounds like you are alone alot and that concerns me too Dieting Weight training Bodybuilding Breakfast Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Peanut Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Food Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Anorexia nervosa Protein Obesity Puberty Bread Fasting Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Peanut butter Sleep Insomnia Meal Cuisine of the Philippines Urinary incontinence Human height Adjustable gastric band Milk Nutrition The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chocolate Vegetarianism Friends Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story Growth hormone Super Size Me Tofu Garfield The Contender (television series) Nicomachean Ethics French cuisine Kitchen Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jewish cuisine Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Fancy rat Biochemistry Camp Lazlo Little Britain Avenue Q Yoghurt Raw food diet Cuisine of Denmark Knots Landing Healthy eating Hamster Ferret Sandwich Mnemonic Dog Internal ballistics Jon Secada Internet phenomenon Coffee Britpop Barbecue Dragon Booster The Ashlee Simpson Show Sukkot Exercise Alexander Technique Ramen The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mid-levels Cat Bong Rule of St Benedict Sin City The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fugu Traumatic incident reduction Blonde on Blonde British cuisine
