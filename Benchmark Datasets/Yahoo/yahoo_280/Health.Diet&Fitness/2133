protein intake i've been working out since last november and i have seen gains but one thing ive come to realize the hard way is that your body really needs that protein its one essential key as most of you know a protein shake tub usually has about grams of protein in each scoop i know to intake protein naturally from foods too but just considering the powder is it smart to take a scoop before you work out how many scoops after i also know the body can only intake a certain amount of protein g at a time so its pointless in taking like scoops at once this protein powder is also pretty high in cholesterol like most other ones i've also heard a scoop before sleep helps because your body wont turn to your muscles for nutrients when it needs one during the hour fasting take grams of whey protein minutes before you work out right after you work out you have to take in simple sugars you have to the simple sugar create an insulin spike which rushes nutriants to your muscles drink a can of soda or any other fast carb this would be the best time to take your vitamins creatine aminos or whatever else your taking minutes after that take another whey protein shake around grams will do right before you go to sleep take a casein protein shake casein is a slow releasing protein mix your casein grams with tablespoons of flxseed oil this will keep your muscles fueld while you sleep you can also take grams of glutamine grams of arginine and grams of bcaa's minutes before your workout ive been doing this and i can workout twice as long now right after your workout with your simple carbs take another grams of glutamine and grams of bcaa's Bodybuilding Milk Dieting Protein Hypoglycemia Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Veganism Weight training Tocopherol Cheese Low-carbohydrate diet Biochemistry Dietary fiber Cocaine Insulin Dairy Slim Fast Creatine Diabetes mellitus Amino acid Vitamin Nutrient Soy milk Fat Signal transduction Soybean Soy protein Caffeine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vegetarianism Coronary heart disease Herpes simplex virus Vitamin C Soft drink Fasting Enzyme Vitamin D Food Eye Dairy product Omega-3 fatty acid Cholesterol Vegetarian nutrition Tooth Guinea pig Breastfeeding Bong Hormone Glycogen storage disease type I Chocolate Zinc Ice cream Folic acid Insulin resistance Vitamin K Cannabis (drug) Aspartame Glucokinase Iron Huntington's disease Urinary incontinence Milkshake Fermentation Growth hormone Egg (food) Explosive material Alzheimer's disease Sleep Rice Sugar beet In-N-Out Burger Biomolecule Carbon dioxide Diarrhea Red blood cell Post Polio syndrome Biotin Trans fat Jet engine Growth hormone deficiency Calorie restriction Long-term potentiation Magnesium Carburetor Marathon (sport) Healthy eating Niacin Obesity Cuisine of the Philippines Cell (biology)
