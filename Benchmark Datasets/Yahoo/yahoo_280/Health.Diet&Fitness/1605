strength training i am planning to start weight training soon to improve strength and muscle tone but was wondering if anyone knows other accessories apart from weights to supplement this stuff to help with toning the abs and core strength thanks first of all you need to make sure that your body fat percentage is low enough to be able to see the definition i was doing crunches and sit ups for a long time and didn't see any improvement then found that my body fat percentage was too high it also depends on what extent you wish the definition to be bodybuilders have low percentages like but if you have around percent then you should be able to see them if it is too high you'll need to perform lots of cardio aerobic exercises and eat healthily as to bring it down when it's at around percent weights are probably the best for arm muscle definition then lots of crunches and other anaerobic exercise to define the abs one of the best pieces of equipment for abs are fitness balls as they allow the crunches to be much more effective using a combination of the treadmill with weights is fantastic for strengthening both arms and legs and is also thought to be the best form of cardio exercise so i would reccomend after lowering your bf sit ups and crunches for the abs and the treadmill combined with weights for everything else good luck Weight training Bodybuilding Swimming Exercise Muscle Equine conformation Creatine Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Atherosclerosis Protein Clarinet Piccolo Junior Saga Insulin Mr. Olympia Growth hormone treatment Vegeta M16 (rifle) Aikido Horizontal bar Inflation Bass guitar Puberty Explosive material Pilates Running Hypertension Absolute magnitude Chocolate Flatulence Physical attractiveness Calisthenics Stuttering Unemployment Human height Terminal ballistics Professional wrestling holds Multiple sclerosis Car handling Wood Fecal incontinence Glossary of climbing terms Aerial (dance move) Milk Diabetes mellitus Jet engine Chinese martial arts Female bodybuilding Boxing training Heart rate Tocopherol Bicycle Infantilism Press up Extreme Programming Diving Repetitive strain injury Chair Avalanche Anabolic steroid Thermoregulation Triathlon Social rule Growth hormone Swingout Chronic fatigue syndrome Tank Stopping power Internal ballistics Appeal Low-carbohydrate diet Compiler optimization Tai Chi Chuan Clinical depression Professional wrestling throws Overtraining Striker Pack Recumbent bicycle Body type (exercise) Gliding Decibel Lance Armstrong Brewery Les Mills Hemoglobin Eugen Sandow Stress fracture Bates Method Osteoarthritis Muay Thai Weight loss Steel
