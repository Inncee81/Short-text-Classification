switching from low carb to low fat i have been watching my carbs for ish weeks i lost five pounds really fast but then i have stayed the same for the past week so i have decided that low carb is not healthy and since i exercise so much my body needs carbs here is my question i ate carbs a day with grams of fiber my new diet plan will cut out all fatty foods except the healthy fats and all cheese i will not eat any flour but i will add in two servings of fruit a day i am also planning on decreasing my calories so the question will a lower calorie low fat diet allow me to lose weight or will i gain weight from the fruit i really want to stop counting carbs low calorie low fat is the most pratical and you will lose weight probably a little bit slower than low carb but you are much more likely to maintain the lower calorie diet low carb is so hard to maintain for very long and plus you are right when you are exercising it can be very detrimental to your health with not having any carbs in your diet higher carb fruits will by no means make you gain weight though they should not be your only source of carbs incoporate some whole wheat into it as well it gives you a great energy boost Dieting South Beach diet Obesity Omega-3 fatty acid Super Size Me Bodybuilding Milk Dietary fiber Anorexia nervosa Healthy eating Breastfeeding Food Weight loss Nutrition Tocopherol Cheese Vegetarianism Weight training Adjustable gastric band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bread Folic acid Kit Kat Hamburger Calorie restriction Calorie Coronary heart disease Hypoglycemia Vitamin C Fat Prostate cancer Trans fat Weight Watchers Tofu Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Carburetor Bong Alcoholic beverage Olive oil Ramen Exercise Zone diet Slim Fast Fast food Hamster Fatty acid Guinea pig Egg (food) Internal ballistics Protein-energy malnutrition Domestic rabbit Binge eating disorder Cereal Raw food diet Glycemic index Junk food Chocolate Hyperglycemia Vegetarian nutrition Swimming McDonald's Body type (exercise) Insulin MyPyramid Stomach cancer Oily fish Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Flour Fancy rat In-N-Out Burger Ton Soul food Breakfast Standard enthalpy change of fusion Cholesterol Domesticated turkey Food preservation Jewish cuisine Tariff Energy Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension Gastric bypass surgery Explosive material Toyota Prius Macular degeneration
