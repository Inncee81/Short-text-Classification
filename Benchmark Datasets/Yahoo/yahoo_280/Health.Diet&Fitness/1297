so far i have been dieting and have a few questions on what im doing okay so every morning befor i eat i go take my son on a walk about a half hour then when i do eat i dont eat bread or anything like that usually just a fruit or something then i wont eat again till about where i eat a pretzel then i go on a mile walk with my son and next ill eat dinner small portion not alot of meat no potatoes no bread a vegetable and i do not drink soda or juice i drink only water or unsweetened ice tea i will not eat after p m and when i get my son to sleep i do crunches and pushups it doesnt seem to be working i have only lost pounds the last weeks am i doing something wrong yes you are in order to lose weight you must eat more that that your metabolism is what regulates you weight and the higher it is the more you burn off the weight you have to maintain proper diet along with the exercise it will help alot if you get the workout in first thing to get it going and and eat high in protein meats like chicken and fish stay away from the red meats too fatty potatoes are good carbs and they wont hurt you if taken in moderation ever seen or heard of denise austin she is a fitness expert on tv and i have used her methods for years and weigh lbs even after three kids pretzels have salt which holds water in you and bloat you out not a good idea in order to lose weight you must get the heart rate up for at least minutes straight and break a sweat no breads is only a temporary fix and won't do any good for you when you decide to eat them again you gain it back so just moderate it too i do not eating slows the metabolism and you won't burn anything your body will start freaking out and you will go the opposite way be careful check out denise austin she has books and videos out Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypoglycemia Bread Veganism Food Breakfast South Beach diet Cuisine of the Southern United States Low-carbohydrate diet German cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Malaysia Fecal incontinence Nutrition Guinea pig Obesity Kosher foods Jewish cuisine Healthy eating Adjustable gastric band Vegetarian nutrition Atomic Kitten Barbecue Tooth Insulin Word of Wisdom French cuisine Vegetarianism Raw food diet Chili con carne Hamburger Russian cuisine Chicken Japanese cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Soul food Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cuisine of Singapore Kashrut Caffeine Fancy rat Food preservation Coronary heart disease Anorexia nervosa Irish cuisine Poker jargon Glycemic index Diabetes mellitus First aid Potassium Bengali cuisine McDonald's Organic food Ramen Cuisine of Brazil Dim sum Chocolate Colorectal cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Korban Hypertension Marathon (sport) Dietary fiber Soup Terri Schiavo Coffee Fugu Korean cuisine In-N-Out Burger Potato Clinical depression Garfield Escherichia coli O157:H7 Exercise Carbon dioxide Meat Loaf Wine Super Size Me Tea Hippopotamus Coeliac disease Cheese
