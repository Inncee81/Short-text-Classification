can you exlain how anorexic's lose weight okay so i know the basics i know that anorexic's starve themselves and they'll lose weight fast at first then slowly but their metabolism slows down so will they not gain weight at all or just lose slowly and if they start eating normally again will their metabolism go back and if they are starving themselves and they do eat something do their bodies store it as fat and eat the muscle even if they work off the food how fast does the body go into starvation mode answers to any of theses questions would be appreciated anorexics will never be satisfied with any weight loss until it kills them the body will use up any fat then start on muscles and internal organs cause of death is usually heart failure because the amount of heart muscle destroyed makes it unable to sustain the rest of the body surviving anorexics commonly develop some minor heart problems notably mitral valve prolapse a type of heart murmur anorexics are also never cured they are only recovering just like alcoholics if they go back to eating sanely their metabolisms will recover to an extent but will never be totally normal again Dieting Weight training Diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mitral valve prolapse Mitral regurgitation Heart sounds Obesity Tocopherol Bodybuilding Cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Muscle Nutrition Traumatic brain injury Poison Fecal incontinence Thermoregulation Exercise Swimming Binge eating disorder Diabetic ketoacidosis Starvation Protein Atrial septal defect Low-carbohydrate diet Myocardial infarction Caffeine Cirrhosis Prostate cancer Ketosis Cardiac arrhythmia Warm-blooded Hypertension Equine conformation Great Famine of 1315-1317 Famine Growth hormone treatment Liver Decompression sickness Insulin resistance Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer First aid Nutrient Aortic dissection Mitral stenosis Folic acid Weight loss Fat Heart valve Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Aspartame Heart Hyperglycemia Alcoholic beverage Vitamin Glycogen storage disease type I Breastfeeding Puberty Milk Aortic insufficiency Atrial fibrillation Endocarditis Sugar substitute Adjustable gastric band Paget's disease of bone Cephalic disorder Becker's muscular dystrophy Glucocorticoid Super Size Me Natural Hygiene Alcoholism Cold-blooded DDT Aphasia Cardiac cycle Action potential Fatty acid Stroke Gray Wolf Vegetarianism Diseases of the honeybee Guinea pig Skeletal muscle Anemia Parkinson's disease Drag racing Biochemistry
