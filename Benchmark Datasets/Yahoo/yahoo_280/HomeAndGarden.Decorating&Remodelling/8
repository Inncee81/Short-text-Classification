why did the grout harden on top and stayed powdery underneath my floors were tiled and grouted some air pockets were visible installer realized grout was hard on top but powdery underneath grout manufacturers took responsibility paid installer to regrout it he regrouted it early this week and the same thing has happened again this time grout manufacturer is coming to my house to see it it seems insane that the same thing could happen the installer has been working for flooring company for many years he said he never saw this happen before grout is a polyblend sanded type it is sold at places such as home depot we have talked to other installers and they said they've used this type of grout many times without having a problem the st time the grout was installed the water went through a water conditioner well water the nd time it came straight from the water pump i can scrape the top of the grout with a plastic knife and after times it becomes powdery it looks like the grout before water is added what do i do the grout sold at lowe's and home depot is of poor quality i tell people time and time again buy whatever you want at the depot but do not get flooring counter tops especially granite and cabinets done by them their guys aren't the best and their products aren't the best they'll fix things for you don't get me wrong sometimes it takes them months to get it right so get your money back or forget the money and go get a good grout at a flooring store it will save you headaches also do not clean the grout off the floor for one week leave it as the installer left it after one week clean with water and a little vinegar Kitchen Solar power Knife Drill bit Aerial (dance move) Bus models used in New York City Transit Hard disk Hamster Humphrey Bogart Mattress Poker jargon Basement Windows XP Gross domestic product Japanese toilet Thermal power station Social rule Wal-Mart Pitaten Radon Tesco Energy development Dialysis Shaggy dog story Tofu Volleyball Hydrogen peroxide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cruising (maritime) Procrastination Capitalism The Apprentice 3 Warren Buffett Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Dundas Square Dam Concrete Diving Inventory Casting Sundial RuneScape quests Surveillance Brewery The Emancipation of Mimi Berkshire Hathaway Vacuum cleaner Heinkel He 100 Textile manufacturing Portland cement Refrigerator Mosaic Vinegar Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks The Apprentice 2 Fiddler on the Roof Leather Paragliding Dairy Epoxy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Francis Bacon (painter) Air-raid shelter Explosive material Sweatshop Mortgage IBM PC compatible I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Table saw Glacier Dishwasher Life insurance Avenue Q Air conditioning Customs and etiquette of Japan Floppy disk Professional wrestling holds Roman calendar Stairway Internet fraud Dance Dance Revolution Public policy Sewage treatment Railroad Tycoon Amway Microeconomics Plastic FairTax NeXT Sento Battle of the Bulge Pinball Animal Crossing Ra (board game) Conker's Bad Fur Day
