do illegals pay their fair share of taxes pro illegals keep making the comment that illegal immigrants pay taxes as if they are making an equal contribution i just don't understand how they can continue to confidently make this comment considering the majority of illegals are getting paid under the table sure maybe they pay sales tax but they seem to act as if paying sales tax is making an equal contribution in comparison people who pay sales and income tax obviously they're not equal real americans pay both plus a large percentage of their income is being spent in mexico and not the u s so there goes a large portion of the sales tax some do and some don't the ones who work under the table don't of course but there are plenty of legals who do that as well but many have phony ss cards and get jobs that have taxes withheld of course the government is well aware of these as the names and numbers don't match up properly but knowing that they will never file a tax return and get the refunds and credits that they would otherwise be entitled to the government quietly keeps the money this is the dirty little secret between the ssa and irs if they turned that information over to uscis rounding up a significant portion of the illegals would be child's play but they won't do this for reasons first that extra money stream would dry up and second since they work for much lower wages business would have to pay more to legal workers and that would not be business friendly never let it be said that the current administration isn't business friendly why else would bush push for guest workers and amnesty to keep business flush with cheap labor of course i've had my ssn hijacked twice so far once in the late 's and once again in the early 's talk about a pain sorting that out Taxation in the United States FairTax Social Security (United States) Tax Progressive tax Minimum wage Flat tax H-1B visa Wal-Mart 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Microeconomics U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of the United States Gross domestic product Plame affair Economy of Russia Tax protester Capital accumulation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Publicly funded medicine Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Reaganomics Tax cut Deflation (economics) George W.
