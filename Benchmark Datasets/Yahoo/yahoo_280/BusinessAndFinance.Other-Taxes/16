is there anyone out there who needs a tax deduction and can finance or help finance my college tuition grants are hard to come by for a beguiner my age or could it be tax deductable if it was considered a charity donation i hate to tell you this but if someone financed your tuition they probably couldn't get any tax benefit from it since they couldn't claim it unless you were their dependent for tax purposes one of the criteria for that would be that you lived with them all year another would be that you made under gross for the year if you are asking strangers to provide tuition money i would certainly hope that you have a job and are earning some of what you need yourself maybe you need to look at less expensive schools community colleges can be real good choices for the first couple of years smaller classes and a lot less expensive just be sure the credits will transfer it's also possible to go to school part time and work part or full time good luck Student loan Tax Taxation in the United States Education in the United States Social Security (United States) Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics School choice Insurance Gross domestic product Tuition Graduate school Credit card Community college Personal finance 401(k) Productive and unproductive labour Food Stamp Program Mutual fund Wal-Mart Tax deduction Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Insurance Depreciation Annuity Education in the People's Republic of China Scholarship Charitable trust Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Capital accumulation Inheritance tax FairTax Affirmative action Surplus value Education in Germany Compensation of employees Public education Leasing Non-profit organization Education in England Warren Buffett Reaganomics Health insurance Price discrimination Employee stock option Political subdivisions of New York State Subsidy Measures of national income and output Kwantlen University College Income Payroll Public policy Hybrid vehicle Brown University Inflation Sport utility vehicle Education in Finland Income statement California Polytechnic State University Individual Savings Account Publicly funded medicine Franklin W.
