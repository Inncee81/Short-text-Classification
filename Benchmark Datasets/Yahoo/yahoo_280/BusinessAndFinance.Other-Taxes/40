irs problems my friend has issues with irs ive posted them before thing is he slacking with doing anything with it he has a deadline he needs to get certain papers to them or start paying them some of his return back about he is asking is the irs will arrest him or garnish his paycheck yes that was my question before but they thing is he didnt falsely claim his neices he just needs to proof more info which he cant his brother is his half that info is ok im thinking no one else claimed the girls but also want proof he was living there last year that he cant proof other than the borthers family and him their mom and the brothers gf mom lived there so most things are in the brothers gf moms name confusing yes lol thanxs judy yea i doubt he can find anything most important things were at a certain address th st and thats where irs info goes and lisence says which that is not the address they lived at all year they moved about times last year times being with the same landlord different home so finding two things that match is very hard if your friend lets the deadline go by without responding he is basically agreeing with whatever has been said by the irs and will most likely lose his chance to contest anything if what they said is correct anyway though that won't matter they will not likely arrest him although if fraud is suspected anything can happen but if he's supposed to be making payments and doesn't they will almost certainly garnish his wages and possibly put a lien on his assets i tried to go back and look at your earlier questions but you have your questions marked private so i couldn't ok now i see your additional info the brother being a half brother wouldn't matter that part is ok but if he can't prove that he lived there then he's out of luck he can't just claim them because nobody else does this year the irs has really cracked down on that sort of cheating does he have paystubs that show that as his address those would be in his name not the brother's gf's mom's any magazines he got delivered there any personal bills at all what did his drivers license say if he didn't really live there and was just trying to scam the system then he got caught and might as well just pay back the money and if he can't prove in any way that he lived there except by claims from relatives the irs probably won't just accept that then he's out of luck anyway Tax protester Internet fraud Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Advance fee fraud Poker jargon Schabir Shaik Trial Killian documents Confidence trick Kent Hovind Identity theft Knots Landing Kasparov versus The World Mail fraud GED G__del's incompleteness theorem Domestic violence Transformation problem Bush v.
