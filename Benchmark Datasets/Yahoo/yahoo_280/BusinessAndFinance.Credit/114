credit cards i dont really no anything about credit cards but i need pounds i have a few questions how mnay credit cards can you have when do you pay back the money how much money can you get from a credit card is it essentially like getting a loan i dont really understand where the money is from i mean does it go into your bank acoount so can you go take out the money in cash from your bank account so then if i need couldnt i just get credit cards and get pounds from each of them out how much would i be paying back to each a month do you have to get the cards from different banks i know sounds confusing but im only doing this becuase its to hard trying to find a loan and i really need the money in response to your questions posed on the credit cards i have outlined some thoughts below you can have as many credit cards as you wish however you may find that the more credit cards you hold retaining a balance upon them the less likely it is to obtain further credit cards as the company issuing the credit card may believe that you pose too great a risk in terms of not making your payment credit cards work on the principal that you make a payment each month relating directly to the amount of your borrowings usually however some card issuers are changing of late some have increased the level of repayment whilst some have decreased it for example if you have a balance of on a credit card you will most likely need to make a payment of of that which equals the cause of so many problems with credit cards is that the minimum payment does not really repay the amount outstanding as interest is added this can mean that the balance of will not be after a payment is made but may have only reduced to the amount of money available on a credit card is determined by the card issuer they will make a judgement based on your credit history your salary and overall financial position as to what level of debt you will find sustainable some card issuers allow much greater amounts of credit than others for the same person it is exactly like getting a loan you are borrowing money from the card issuer and in return for promising to repay at least the minimum payment each month the difference is that a loan has a pre determined amount and subsequently a pre determined payment period a credit card does not as it is open ended in terms of the time you take to repay the balance the longer you take to repay the loan the more interest you will pay the money does not go to your bank account normally you could be allocated a card with a credit limit of say this credit limit is the amount of money available to you to borrow you normally use a credit card to make purchases however you can often use the credit card to withdraw cash from a cash machine there are higher costs to accessing cash both in terms of charges for withdrawals and higher interest rates it is not advisable to use a credit card to withdraw cash particularly if you need access to you ought to take specific advice before contemplating borrowings of that amount Interest Municipal bond Insurance Gold standard Hyperinflation Bank fraud Mutual fund Islamic banking Finance Predatory lending Corporate finance Money supply Economy of India Personal finance Mortgage-backed security 401(k) Economy of Russia Microeconomics Inflation Microcredit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Yield curve Schabir Shaik Trial Octopus card Citigroup Economy of Pakistan Tax Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Variable universal life insurance Financial services Automatic teller machine Stock Great Depression Debit card Capitalism Article One of the United States Constitution Tertiary education fees in Australia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Taxation in the United States Savings and loan association Collateralized debt obligation Fractional-reserve banking Capital accumulation History of the United States (1918-1945) Credit history Euro Credit score Derivative (finance) Credit derivative Primerica Financial Services Slot machine Social Security debate (United States) Islamic economics Certificate of deposit U.S. public debt Minimum wage Futures contract Pound sterling Economy of the United States Federal National Mortgage Association Gross domestic product FairTax Reserve Bank of New Zealand Debt levels and flows Dividend Fiat money Internet fraud Electronic money Credit card fraud Password Free trade Estoppel Keynesian economics Universal life insurance Cheque Law of value
