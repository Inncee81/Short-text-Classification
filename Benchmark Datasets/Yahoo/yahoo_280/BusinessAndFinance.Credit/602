can i use a check provided by my credit card company to pay off my car loan the rate from the credit card is fixed for year the auto loan still has more years on it however i get these checks all the time you can do it but i would be cautious there might be a fee of or more to use the check on top of the financing you might not have enough credit on your card to cover the amount of your car if you do the cash advance then if you had been paying the card in full each month to avoid interest you will be charged interest from the first day it shows on your account you loose the grace period for new purchases on that card as long as there is a balance even it if is only from the cashed check after year the rate on the credit card will go up probably much higher than unless you pay off the card within the year you will end up paying a much higher interest charge just because you're getting lots of offeres today for checks does not mean that you will definately get lots of offers months from now for checks you might be stuck with the standard rate on your credit card for cash advances probably closer to if you want to take a chance and there's no check fees or cash advance fees for using the check you can go for it but with all that could go wrong i wouldn't recommend it good luck i hope this helps Credit card Bank Insurance Predatory lending Mutual fund Poker jargon Interest Deflation (economics) Citigroup Debit card Annuity Betting (poker) Islamic banking Filling station Monetary policy Short selling Octopus card Bond Virgin Mobile Payday loan Cheque Money supply Auto insurance Arbitrage Gold standard Credit score Microeconomics Bank fraud Variable universal life insurance PE ratio Yield curve Automatic teller machine SmartRider Certificate of deposit Debt Finance Stock Inflation Debt consolidation Futures contract EFTPOS United States Postal Service FairTax Slot machine Schabir Shaik Trial Advance fee fraud Financial services $ale of the Century Economy of Chile Hyperinflation Financial audit Federal National Mortgage Association Bretton Woods system The Amazing Race Credit derivative Tax Double-entry book-keeping Universal life insurance E-ZPass Individual Savings Account Collateralized debt obligation Oyster card Neopets Great Depression Education in the United States Top-up fees Pension Wal-Mart Economy of Russia Toll road Wachovia Value added tax Skype Tertiary education fees in Australia Economy of the Philippines Let's Make a Deal Taxation in the United States Micropayment Derivative (finance) Credit card fraud Tuition Food Stamp Program London Congestion Charge Euro
