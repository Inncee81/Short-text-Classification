how do i ask credit card company to reduce interest rate on all my cards i want to reduce and get rid of some of my card and i have very high rate but i pay all billls on time rate as high as you must have a good payment history for them to reduce your interest rate most of the time when interest rates go up that much it signifies a missed or late payment i've heard that if you have at least months of payments made on time then you have a good chance of getting your interest rate reduced if the company still says no then tell them the reason you are asking is b c you received an offer for a reduced rate from another card company also say that you have an established business relationship with your current company that you do not want to terminate however you will be forced to do so if your company refused to at least match the rate of the competitor credit card companies don't want to lose business so they will most likely do anything to keep you Credit card Insurance Life insurance Bond Bank Deflation (economics) Gold standard Dividend United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card fraud Credit score Debt Interest Unemployment Credit history Donald Trump Student loan Annuity Primerica Financial Services Refinancing Health insurance FairTax Legal tender Electronic commerce Citigroup PE ratio Minimum wage Wachovia American Express World Wrestling Entertainment Income trust Social Security (United States) Poker jargon Municipal bond Surveillance Mortgage Financial services Apple Computer Bretton Woods system Mainframe computer Betting (poker) Corporate finance Islamic banking Personal finance Western Union Collateralized debt obligation Micropayment Debt consolidation Money VISA (credit card) EFTPOS Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Phone sex Monetary policy Taxation in the Republic of Ireland 401(k) Octopus card Leasehold estate Keynesian economics Sears Holdings Corporation Baccarat Finance High-yield debt National Insurance London Congestion Charge Mutual fund Internet fraud Schabir Shaik Trial Capitalism Economy of Russia Mortgage-backed security ATI Technologies The Amazing Race Minitel Blackjack Ponzi scheme Electronic money Natural monopoly Topps Euro Tertiary education fees in Australia Hyperinflation Airline Treasury security Arbitrage Government National Mortgage Association High-definition television Altair 8800 Privatization Microeconomics Certificate of deposit Lehman Brothers Surplus value Deficit spending History of the United States (1918-1945) Fox Broadcasting Company Wal-Mart Centrelink
