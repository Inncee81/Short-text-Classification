can i be sued for credit card debt if i am making settlement payments i was told by a collection agency law firm that even if i am making payments on an agreed settlement that they will still seek a judgement on me and that i don't have to even show up to court or anything can they do this if i am making payments can they sue you yes will they sue you probably not if you have an agreement that they have approved and are paying as agreed they won't mainly because if it went to court the judge would throw it out now if you fail to make the payments as agreed they then will turn around and sue you if you have a law firm calling you you need to immediately send them a cease and desist letter in the letter state that you already have a settlement agreement with the company and are making payments as agreed include that they are to not contact you again in reference to the debt send this by certified mail with a return receipt if they do contact you again you can then take them to court for violations of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa if for some reason they did sue you it would be to put it bluntly stupid of you to not show up in court if you don't show up they can pretty much say anything they want and you are not there to defend yourself they will then get a judgment in default Article One of the United States Constitution GNU General Public License Fair Game (Scientology) Appeal Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Child support Credit card SCO-Linux controversies Estoppel Divorce Fair use Debt Lawsuit Legal tender Timeline of the Enron scandal United States Postal Service United Kingdom corporation tax International Criminal Court Mail Copyright Due process Public domain Apple Computer Islamic banking Tax protester Royal Assent First-sale doctrine Credit score Judicial functions of the House of Lords International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Social Security (United States) Declaratory judgment Public-key cryptography Internet fraud Tom DeLay Bush v.
