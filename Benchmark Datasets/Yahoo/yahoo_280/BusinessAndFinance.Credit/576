no credit history i just applied for a credit card but i got rejected first would i be rejected because i don't have a credit history i've never had a credit card or would i only be rejected if someone stole my identity and got me a bad credit rating at this point i'm going to college full time and i wanted the credit card just so that i can get a good credit rating i'm not making any income from a job but my mom does make some deposits to my checking account for things that i will need like money to buy college textbooks i was planning to use the credit card to buy textbooks and a few minor things at wal mart that i'll need and use my checking account funds to pay the credit card bill the only reason i want the credit card i repeat is to get a good credit rating did the lack of income from a job kill me if i don't have a credit history how do i go about getting it if i cannot have a credit card do i get a joint credit card with my mother or is that worthless only the bank knows why you were rejected it's more likely that you were rejected for not having a credit history or because you have no income good for you for getting a credit card young and wanting to build a good credit rating it will help you alot down the road a wise man once told me always apply for credit when you don't need it as banks will rarely give you credit when you do need it go figure if your mom is agreeable the easiest way to get a credit card is with her as a co signer i did the same thing as you when i turned my dad co signed but i never needed him to make a payment twelve years later i have the highest credit rating you can get i could have never done it without his signature down the road a good credit rating will help your get lons mortgages at a great rate if your mom is uneasy about co signing tell her you will get a low credit limit maybe if that still doesn't work check out your bank's website to see if they offer a visa debit card it's linked to your chequing account but allows you to do credit card type things like buy stuff online reserve hotel rooms etc one last piece of advice always pay the full balance by the due date if you do you will never pay a dime in interest and if you can handle having credit available some people can't they spend money without being able to afford it get a credit card that gets you airmiles or bonus points these usually have a higher interest rate but what do you care you're not paying interest remember if you pay your balance in full each month then these bonuses are exactly that bonuses we put everything on our credit card pay the balance in full each month then use the 'free' points to get free travel gas movie coupons whatever Internet fraud Bond Money Debit card Bank fraud Mortgage Cheque Student loan Life insurance EFTPOS Octopus card Electronic money Debt FairTax Surveillance Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Mutual fund Monetary policy Identity theft Credit score Money supply Wal-Mart Primerica Financial Services Citigroup Monopoly (game) Loyalty program Interest Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Gold standard Public transport Credit card fraud Betting (poker) Economy of Russia Financial services Euro Blackjack Driver's license Great Depression Taxation in the United States Flat tax Certificate of deposit Legal tender Economy of the United States Derivative (finance) Craps Salary cap Minimum wage Keynesian economics Gross domestic product Marshall Plan British national identity card Mail fraud Annuity Bretton Woods system Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Inflation Identity document Satchel Paige Supply-side economics Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax America Online History of the United States (1918-1945) Capitalism Security (finance) Best Buy Star Trek Customizable Card Game James Hanratty National Kidney Foundation Singapore Social Credit Grand Theft Auto (game) Say's law Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Finance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Economics Wheel of Fortune Education in the People's Republic of China Knots Landing Arthur Laffer Health insurance Education in Germany Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Donald Trump Federal National Mortgage Association
