cards all with below limits and one car loan i am never late and if i use the credit card i pay it off when the bill arrives but still the past haunts me help the credit score as mysterious as a gypsy palm reading kind of yea sometimes i m surprised that some credit scores are better than it appears they should be and others are worse why i have no idea this system is not perfect and nobody knows exactly how it works strange but true i have a lot of information on this topic for you so i m going to split it up into two articles the first will address how credit scores are derived what affects them and the range of scores from good to bad the second article will cover steps to take to improve a poor credit score there are some key factors that are used in determining your basic score your payment histories recent late payments hurt a lot the older a late payment is the less impact on your score number of accounts that have balances if you have a dozen charge cards with balances consolidate them down to or there is no reason to have macy s nordstrom gap sears kohl s mervyns etc and owe to each of them use your visa card they all take it proportion of balances to credit limit this means don t max out your credit cards when your credit cards are at there limit it is a big red flag it s best to never use more than half of the available balance on a charge card length of time accounts have been opened old accounts with long payment histories are really great for a credit score this is the reason why you should not close charge accounts that you are not using just shred the card and stop using it this way the account remains active and continues to have a positive impact on your score credit inquiries an inquiry shows up when someone checks your credit report lot s of inquiries indicate you may be trying to open a lot of new credit which is a red flag if you get a new credit card every six months to get the low intro rate your credit score will suffer because of constant inquiries and the number of accounts which have been opened in the recent past collection accounts and public records if you owe a creditor and you re not paying they will send the account to a collection agency this shows up on your credit report bad when you get a bill from the doctor s office that your insurance did not cover do yourself a favor and pay it then you can try to get the insurance to reimburse you if they were wrong otherwise the doctor s office will waste no time going to collection medical collection accounts are so common it s ridiculous public records include judgments tax liens bankruptcy s etc all bad and should be avoided at all costs to keep your credit score in the positive range what is the positive range well credit scores run from worst to best
