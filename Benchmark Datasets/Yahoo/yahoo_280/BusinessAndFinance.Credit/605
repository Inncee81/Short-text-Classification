how do you dispute judgements on your credit report i have judgements on my credit report that aren't true i am trying to clean up my credit without paying someone please help if you know anything about getting inquiries and other old accounts and accounts that doesn't belong to me in accordance to the fair reporting act you need to dispute the charges to the major credit bureaus experian transunion and equifax they are required to notify any entity that has placed a disputed claim this is a little bit of a joke as the entity only has to respond that they have documentation proving sum is owed but the credit reporting company will provide you with the information needed to rectify the problem working with the courts is going to be difficult but not impossible to speed up the process you can hire an attorney but it may cost more than the judgments themselves hope this helps TransUnion Experian Credit score Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Schabir Shaik Trial Public domain Corporate governance Credit card Science Identity theft Medical malpractice Appeal Mortgage Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Slander and libel Israeli settlement Credit rating agency Credit repair Contract Taxation in the United States Child support Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Probation officer Wal-Mart Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Debt consolidation Branch Davidian Outsourcing Unlawful combatant Fair Game (Scientology) Raytheon Goodness and value theory Sarbanes-Oxley Act U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Capitalism Copyright Lawyer HIPAA Social Security (United States) Tom DeLay Accountancy SCO-Linux controversies XML The resolution of the Dreyfus Affair Food and Drug Administration United Nations Fathers' rights Scientific method Mediation Fair Isaac Corporation 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Derivative (finance) Bank George Galloway Board of directors Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Divorce National Kidney Foundation Singapore Killian documents Judgment Enron Corporation Atheism W.
