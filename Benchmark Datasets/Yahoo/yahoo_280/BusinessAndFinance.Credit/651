auto repossession question my friend let's call him ben had gotten a title loan couple of years back on his toyota he made several payment but could not keep up with the payments the loan company sent out repo people several times to his house but it was at times when he wasn't there about a month after the repo guys started dropping by ben had to move to new place because his lease has expired ben of course did not inform title loan company it has been little over years since that time and ben still has the car however he has not been able to register it because the title loan company has their names on the title as co owners and they would need to sign off on the form as well now he recently moved from ca to another state job related here is what ben would like to know what would happen if he surrended the vehicle now did ben need to tell the loan company where the vehicle was when he realized the repo guys were coming around since it's been over years is there any legal remifications he needs to worry about is there any way that he can register the vehicle without the loan title company signing off on it what happens if repo never finds ben and ben never lets them know where he is he has never intentionally avoided them but he neither let them know where he was either nothing regarding this vehicle amount owed or the repo has appeared on his credit report do the repo guys have to physically repo the vehicle before anything appears on this credit report any help is appreciated if he returns it they would sell the vehicle for far less than what he owes on it he would be liable for the deficiency any repo fees any interest that has accrued in the past years even if he takes it to them in person there would still be repo fees the cost of of the previous repo attempts the paperwork the cost of conditioning the car for resale at auction the cost of transporting it to the auction site etc etc etc it's doubtful ben would face any legl ramifications the loan company and repo people have many ways of tracing people it sounds like they just dropped the ball on completing the repo if he had received a court order demanding the car be turned over and ignored it then he probably does have legal ramifications no he will not be able to register it without the loan company signing off there could be many different things that may happen they could continue to forget about it they could easily find where he lives and continue to try to repo it they could get a court order demanding he turn it over he is fortunate that it is not reporting he should check with the courts in every town county he has lived in since he defaulted to see if there is a judgment filed against him it would be in his best interests if he managed to get a loan with a different loan company to cover the cost of the vehicle and pay the existing loan company off if he did that he would be able to title the car and quit having to look over his shoulder i seriously doubt the existing loan compny will ever even consider dealing with him in taking payments on the car until he takes care of the loan he will never legally be able to sell trade the car it is not his to sell if he sells it he could be charged with a felony Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Bond Life insurance Mortgage Student loan Corporation Islamic banking Ford Motor Company Short selling Annuity SCO-Linux controversies Leasing Health insurance Auto insurance Copyright London Congestion Charge Internet fraud Security (finance) Taxation in the United States Citigroup Gold standard Derivative (finance) Intellectual property Steve Jobs Public domain Trademark Bank Predatory lending Appeal Bank fraud Interest Economy of Russia Mutual fund Estoppel Infantilism Unemployment Arbitrage Neopets Contract CPU cache Concurrent estate 401(k) Great Depression Advance fee fraud Toyota Prius Debt Stock New England Patriots Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act American Motors Money Article One of the United States Constitution Knots Landing Economy of the United States Oakland Athletics Hybrid vehicle Credit score Islamic economics First-sale doctrine Deflation (economics) Primerica Financial Services The Amazing Race Vehicle registration plate Plame affair Capitalism Battery electric vehicle Allodial title George W.
