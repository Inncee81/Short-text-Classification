i have two student loans that are in default on my credit report if i start paying them will score go up i know that if you have collection accounts on your credit usually paying them really doesn't help your score because even though paid the collection stays on your account for seven years but does this apply for defaulted school loans second answer no your score will not go up as you were late and that cannot be changed however paying the debt could prevent your score from going even lower paying the debt now rather than waiting eliminates the debt from your record late payment generally affects your score for two years while a complete default on the loan can remain significantly longer Student loan Credit score Credit card Mortgage Government debt Debt Credit default swap United Kingdom corporation tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money 401(k) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Annuity Deflation (economics) Debt consolidation Graduate school Interest Islamic banking Economy of Russia Monetary policy Derivative (finance) Collateralized debt obligation Mortgage-backed security Economy of Pakistan Credit derivative History of the United States (1918-1945) Developing countries' debt FairTax Microeconomics Credit risk Debt levels and flows Economy of Argentina Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Education in the United States Tertiary education fees in Australia Insurance Government National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Tennessee State Constitution Life insurance Predatory lending High-yield debt Students' union Bank Estoppel Subsidy Savings and loan association Gold standard Credit history Social Credit Donald Trump Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Divorce Bretton Woods system Password Evan Montvel Cohen Fractional-reserve banking Ra (board game) Refinancing Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Economy of the United States Usury Bank fraud Assignment (law) Primerica Financial Services Article One of the United States Constitution Social Security debate (United States) GED Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Personal finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic economics SAT National Certificate of Educational Achievement Finance Manchester United F.C.
