will cancelling my amex hurt my credit score i currently have credit cards after a bankrupcy two years ago in jan amex is one of them it has an unlimited line being that part of our score is based on debt to credit limit ratio would cancelling this card with its unlimited credit line hurt my score and if so by how much closing a credit card won't necessarily hurt your score but it generally does hurt most folks scores and it will never help if it's an amex charge card like a green one that you must pay in full each month those are supposed to get coded as a charge card and won't get figured into your credit card utilization however that's not always the case if yours is reporting as a credit card rather than a charge card i'd give amex customer service and politely ask to talk to someone about your card and the way it's being reported to the credit bureaus but when you call appear lost and ask for help hi umm ah i'm not really sure who to talk to about this umm can you help me people have an inherent desire to wanna help it empowers them they tend to let down their guard and be more receptive to any request simply because you were nice and you asked if it's an amex green or gold rewards then you're probably getting zinged you with an annual fee cards that are costing you money are worth getting rid of however amex tends to be very generous issuing card holders more cards and they can be very generous with credit line increases Credit card Annuity Money Mutual fund Microeconomics Student loan Credit score Mortgage Credit card fraud Hearts (game) Insurance H-1B visa Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Blackjack Bank Inflation Octopus card Tax Futures contract Public domain Interest Bond Auto insurance Plame affair Micropayment Virgin Mobile Consensus decision-making Taxation in the United States Copyleft Monopoly (game) Wal-Mart United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Driver's license Personal finance Betting (poker) Surveillance Debit card Poker jargon British national identity card GNU General Public License Pittsburgh Steelers Short selling Citigroup United States Postal Service Immigration to the United States FairTax Ra (board game) MMORPG Athenian democracy Intellectual property Capitalism America Online Animal Crossing Luas Extreme Programming Oyster card Social Security (United States) American Express Ice hockey United States House of Representatives Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Mahjong Property (ownership right) Mainframe computer Public good Predatory lending Identity document Cable television Trademark Primerica Financial Services MTV Legal tender Overclocking Financial services Corporate finance MetroCard Sports betting Verizon Wireless Baseball Gross domestic product Medicare (Canada) Wheel of Fortune SCO-Linux controversies $ale of the Century Financial audit Identity theft Contract bridge U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Economy of Russia Broadband Internet access Babylonian law
