civil lawsuit from capitol one credit card i owe capital one a debt i will pay them off when i get the money but at this moment i do not have it i will not be able to show up in court because i am in another city i already know they will freeze my bank account would it be better just to close out my bank account before they get to it i do not have anything else in my name can i negotiate a payment plan with them before the court date or is it too late if it is what will happen after the default judgement is passed against me can they go into or even freeze my husbands account if it is not a joint account and last but not least can they garnish his wages please only serious answers and not smart alec's thank you sunnyside is wrong you are not given free legal counsel for civil suits only for criminal actions the rest of here answer is not great either you have lots of questions i'll try to cover them all but you didn't ask one important question can you postpone the court hearing you really want to attend it and not get a default judgment you can ask the judge in many states to set up a payment plan that you can afford and avoid garnishment or liens contact the court and request a new court date they usually will push it back days if this debt is in your name only and you do not live in a community state see below then they can not garnish your spouse's wages or bank account take the money from you bank account before they can freeze it contact the creditor and offer a settlement and or payment plan do this in writing if they refuse to work with you then use that info on the judge it may help your case in getting him to order a payment plan if you don't show up and they grant a default judgment they can do just about anything to recover the debt you will have very little defense against it that's why you need to show up in court note that the collection agency can ask for just about anything and if you are not there they will get it i've seen them tack on hundreds of dollars in illegal collection fees note that if this debt is old you may have a legal defense as it's over the statute of limitation but if you are not in court to state this you lose Credit card Child support Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal Lawsuit Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Mortgage Supreme Court of the United States Plame affair Corporation Student loan Credit repair Tom DeLay Legal tender Schabir Shaik Trial SCO-Linux controversies Economy of Russia Concurrent estate 2005 trial of Michael Jackson GNU General Public License Taxation in the United States Bretton Woods system Annuity Government of Maryland Bond Tax protester Insurance Bank Enron Corporation Government debt Money Developing countries' debt Estoppel Derivative (finance) Minimum wage Probation officer United States Constitution Same-sex marriage in the United States Economy of the United States Israel Government of France Athenian democracy Same-sex marriage in Canada Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Israeli West Bank barrier Monetary policy Jury trial Scots law Due process Apple Computer Security (finance) Beltway sniper attacks Octopus card Unlawful combatant Judicial review Fair use International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Common law Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Euro Social Security (United States) Cheque Barrister History of the United States (1918-1945) Gold standard United Kingdom corporation tax Branch Davidian Allodial title Government of India Privilege of Peerage Trade union Life insurance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Dred Scott v.
