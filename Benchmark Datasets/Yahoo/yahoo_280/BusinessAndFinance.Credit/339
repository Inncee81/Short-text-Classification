should i consolidate my student loans what are the risks and benefits pros and cons i just graduated with k in student loans and i'm wondering if it's worth it to consolidate or if i should leave my loans as they are my rate is a bit over and my payments which start in december will be about a month i have a friend who is married to a guy in a wheelchair that has always said that she would never consolidate her student loans because if you do your loans aren't forgiven in case of complete disability as her husband's were on the other hand a lower interest rate would be nice what factors should i consider when deciding whether to consolidate if consolidating would be a good choice are there any particular lenders that you would recommend i think you can go for student loan consolidation go to organisations who are good they can reduce the payment amount by and also lowers the rate by so i think it can be done more over you can refinance your student loan debts there are other options also so when you can reduce the rate and there by lower the amount then why not consult them i cannot recommend any lender as it is beyond the terms and conditions here to know more you can visit http www easystudentloanconsolidation blogspot com Student loan Mortgage Debt Insurance Bond Debt consolidation Government debt Monetary policy Interest Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Credit card Bank Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Life insurance Financial markets Hyperinflation Annuity Credit history Primerica Financial Services Predatory lending Economy of Russia Gold standard Interest rate Capital accumulation Annual percentage rate Money Unemployment benefit Federal National Mortgage Association Refinancing Tax Tertiary education fees in Australia 401(k) Donald Trump Security (finance) Health insurance Islamic banking Mortgage-backed security Federal Reserve Inflation Economy of the United States Privatization Education in the United States Deficit spending Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Argentina Credit score Bretton Woods system Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Usury Short selling History of the United States (1918-1945) Divorce International Monetary Fund Yield curve School of Salamanca Corporate finance Islamic economics Gross domestic product Tennessee State Constitution Consumer finance Unconscionability Microcredit Arbitrage Derivative (finance) Lend-Lease Economy of India Capitalism Brady Bonds Developing countries' debt Folic acid Publicly funded medicine College admissions Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Central bank Password Free trade Social Security (United States) GED Speed limit Title insurance Estoppel Payday loan FairTax U.S. public debt Economy of El Salvador EastEnders Galactic Civilizations Education in the People's Republic of China Futures contract Lender of last resort Intellectual property
