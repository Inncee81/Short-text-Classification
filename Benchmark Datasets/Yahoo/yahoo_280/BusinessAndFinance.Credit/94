subprime mrrtgages what are subprime mortgages which have been in the news recently first of all a subprime mortgage is by definition any mortgage home loan given to someone with a less than prime credit rating borrowers' credit worthiness is graded just like tests in school are graded and there are several levels from excellent to awful technically then anything below the highest level is considered sub prime the worse your grade the higher the interest rate the lender will charge to lend you money they charge the higher interest rate both to compensate and to protect themselves for accepting you as a higher risk if for instance they can collect higher interest from you up front and later you default on your loan they have made more potential profit up front if the lenders consider you to be a good risk someone who will stick around for as long as it takes and always make your payments or will pay off the loan in full if you sell and move they are willing to accept a lower interest rate because you are going to be paying them for a long long time and they like that option too for purposes of what is going on right now in the marketplace and the media two definitions are most important first there are a lot of variable rate mortgages out there and the interest rate does just that it changes usually it goes up it can go down but it rarely does when the cost of living goes up or interest rates as set by the federal reserve bank go up or when any one of a number of different benchmark indexes change their rates these can change as often as the loan dictates the second definition then is subprime in the context of the grades mentioned above usually people with the worst credit have the highest interest rate loans even in the best of times those are truly the subprime loans that are in question right now for the most part as an example during one of the more recent good stretches someone with prime credit could get a home loan with a rate while a sub prime loan might have been as high as so if you combine the high starting rate with a variable loan and then send the interest rate up chances are good that the people with bad credit aren't going to be able to pay so they default on the loan and lose the house which then becomes property of the lender if too many people default on their loans the bank that issued them goes out of business because it doesn't have enough cash coming in to do its own business also if enough of these foreclosures happen in an area or the interest rates to get a mortgage become too burdensome for the population in that area the prices of homes there drop this causes further problems for the lenders because once again they often lent this money to people that weren't required to pay any meaningful downpayment old fashioned standards used to pretty much require you to pay for of the house up front and borrow that standard went out the window due to competition between lenders so the original price of the house may be equal to the amount the bank lent to buy it and now they are stuck with a house that when sold still won't recover enough money for them to get back what they lent the bank is now upside down because they have a property which isn't worth what they paid for it and if the homeowner is trying to sell it before a foreclosure they are also considered upside down because they aren't going to be able to pay off the loan for the amount the market will bear so then thanks to what the media is now just calling the subprime loan crisis the homeowner loses because they lose a place to live the lender loses because they may well go out of business other potential homeowners lose because everyone who is considering lending money sees more potential risk so they raise their interest rates now fewer people can buy homes so builders have to build less causing people to lose their jobs and so on Microeconomics Finance Citigroup Derivative (finance) Real estate
