debt consolidation ok i am about thousand dollars in debt they were originally hospital bills but have been forwarded to the collection agency they are about a year old now and as much as i don't want to pay them i figure it's better to get it over with now and not let it remain on my credit i was looking to consolidate my debts the hospital bills are sent to different agencies so i want to consolidate it and perhaps lower it i've heard things about that but i don't know how it works i was curious about the process trusted companies i have a max of dollars available p month come on people give me some answers i wish there was something i could do because i was on medicare until i was now and somehow in debt if someone knows some alternatives to actually paying then feel free but right now i'm looking to reduce and simplify my debts first of all a hospital should not have sent your bills to a collection agency unless you haven't attempted to pay any of the bills for a very long time a year is probably pushing the limit but it's not or years contact the hospital and see if you can work with them on a payment plan let them know you can afford to pay mo and see if they will work with you they should especially if they know they'll get payment if not contact the collection agencies and see if they will work with you as well some if not most agencies will not only work with you but may also cut a deal so you won't have to pay the full amount if neither of these options work look into getting a consolidation loan from your bank i would not suggest using a credit counseling agency not only do most require a fee which obviously you can't afford but from someone with contacts in collections i've heard many of them do not follow through properly and actually end up hurting your credit worse and you'll still be getting those harassing letters and calls from the collection agencies if none of that works my last suggestion would be to call back the hospital administrators and give them an ultimatum either they work with you directly on your terms no collection agencies or they won't get anything at all if the st options aren't available then they're not going to get their money anyway right your credit has already been damaged Student loan Credit card Bond Mortgage Deflation (economics) Publicly funded medicine Taxation in the United States Insurance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Government debt Life insurance Economy of the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Money Marshall Plan Annuity Economy of Russia Primerica Financial Services Medicare (Canada) Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Federal Reserve Derivative (finance) Personal finance Trust (Law) USA United States Postal Service Microeconomics Social Security debate (United States) U.S. public debt Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Child support Bretton Woods system Medicare (United States) Bank Health care in the United States Internet fraud Article One of the United States Constitution Legal tender History of the United States (1918-1945) Surveillance Corporate finance Estoppel Credit score Hyperinflation Tennessee State Constitution The Amazing Race Arthur Laffer Pharmaceutical company Great Depression Schabir Shaik Trial Barrister Mutual fund Debt consolidation National Kidney Foundation Singapore Flat tax Open access Collateralized debt obligation Mensal__o scandal Money supply Plame affair Copyleft Capital accumulation SCO-Linux controversies Hillary Rodham Clinton Fiat money Public transport Financial services Food and Drug Administration Predatory lending Islamic banking Broadband Internet access Campaign finance reform Yield curve Betting (poker) Social Credit Reaganomics Keynesian economics Unemployment benefit Unemployment Canadian and American health care systems compared Appeal 401(k) Economy of El Salvador Euro Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
