what possible suggestion could be used to answer the question of national debt this is the us national dept http www brillig com debt clock use this graph http www brillig com debt clock faq html and tell me what you think would be a great way to try to reduce our national debt the best way to do this would be to eliminate the federal reserve and go back to the gold standard back before when the federal reserve was created people used gold and silver certificates which looked like regular dollars but could actually be traded for gold and silver at the bank this way the money always had gold and silver to back it and the economy was booming still today we have dollars that say 'federal reserve note' which means no longer can we go to the bank and get gold and silver but it's just really a piece of paper with no value also before nickels quarters and dimes were made of silver now they are not again i will say that the way to go would be to pay our massive debt back to the federal reserve and shut it down permanently once that's done we could either go back to the gold standard or create a new system i personally have an idea that if everyone in the united states dedicated themselves to donate dollar each every week to our national debt that we could have the debt paid off by the end of the year think about it million people in the united states thats million paid to the national debt each week but then everyone would have to have a knowledge of our debt to do so i hope this was helpful United States dollar Gold standard Money Fiat money U.S. ten-dollar bill Legal tender Philippine peso Silver Certificate U.S. one hundred-dollar bill Pound sterling Monetary policy U.S. public debt Canadian dollar Economy of the United States Federal Reserve U.S. fifty-dollar bill Money supply Government debt Euro United States Mint Economic history of the United States Deflation (economics) Australian dollar Bretton Woods system Currency Fractional-reserve banking In God We Trust U.S. two-dollar bill Canadian federal election, 1993 Marshall Plan Gold as an investment Bond Reaganomics Banknote Economy of the Philippines Wal-Mart United States coinage Nickel (U.S. coin) United States dollar coin Credit card U.S. twenty-dollar bill Monetarism Unemployment Supply-side economics Tax protester Economy of Colombia Gold Economy of Guyana Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Great Depression Mexican peso Romania Silver standard Capital accumulation Economy of Africa Debt British coinage Temasek Holdings Romanian leu Economy of Pakistan International Monetary Fund Social Credit Economy of Sri Lanka Bank Hong Kong dollar World Wide Web Economy of Brazil Argentine Currency Board Donald Trump Great Depression in Canada Minimum wage Asian financial crisis New Orleans Mint FairTax History of the United States (1918-1945) Social Security (United States) Dime (U.S. coin) Great Depression in the United Kingdom Bankruptcy Arthur Laffer Economy of Australia Kyoto Protocol Economy of Zimbabwe Bank of England Phishing Corporation Economy of El Salvador Argentine debt restructuring United States Army Great Depression in Australia Charles Ponzi
