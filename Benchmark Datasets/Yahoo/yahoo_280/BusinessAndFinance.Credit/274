fix credit i have a couple things on my credit report that are about bucks each people have told me to get in touch with the collection people and ask them to send me a letter that will say that they will either remove it from my report or they will mark it as paid after talking with all the people they won't do that they say we promise we will do that i know that you can't trust them and i'm worried that even though we have settled on a lower payment but without putting it on paper i know that they will leave it on my report and demand the rest before removing it what is the best way remedy this any suggestions i'm not looking for a service to do this for me so please no advertisements oh and i haven't sent in the payments yet waiting on something from them to prove they won't ask for more and will update my credit report that is what i'm asking for suggestions but my question is that without them sending me something that says they will settle for less then how will i be able to prove to the credit bureau that we settled for something what would keep the creditor from taking my payment and then saying where is the rest we aren't taking it off till you pay everything are the debts more than seven years old i mean the original debt let's say you owed sears bucks in and they sent it to a collection agency and that collection agency sent it to another one etc a debt can no longer be reported after seven years from the original date of default not date of referral to the collection agency so if the debt is old enough you might be able to have it removed another issue is the statute of limitations on collection of the debt if the debt is out of statute you have some leverage over the collection agency because technically they cant sue you for the amount outstanding and you are doing them a favor by paying them anything finally the process for getting a committment from them is somewhat easy tell them to fax you a letter that says we agree to settle the outstanding debt get account number etc for upon receipt we will remove all negative credit reporting with respect to this debt from all three major credit reporting agency reports or something to that effect some creditors will not give you that statement because technically it violates their agreement with the credit bureaus but at the very least you can get them to say the debt is paid in full or settled they have to report that no question Bond Debt Credit card Mortgage Contract Article One of the United States Constitution Plame affair Estoppel Annuity Debt levels and flows Schabir Shaik Trial Tom DeLay Student loan Appeal United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Corporation Child support FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taxation in the United States Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit repair Government debt Derivative (finance) Credit score Timeline of the Enron scandal Interest Security (finance) Economy of Russia Mail Gold standard Monetary policy Divorce Legal tender Surveillance Mensal__o scandal Killian documents History of the Jews in England Mergers and acquisitions Bretton Woods system Financial audit Credit default swap Third party beneficiary Bush v.
