should i close my orchard bank credit cards sadly i have an orchard bank visa and an orchard bank mastercard i've had one of them for about years and the other for about instead of giving credit limit increases they give you another card presumably in the hope that you will get more confused and miss payments and pay their fees they both have limits haha sad the good news is i guess i've been doing something right because i have recently been approved for a cc with a much lower apr and a limit yay my question is should i close the ob ccs they both have annual fees of and they don't really contribute much to my available credit the only reason i would want to keep them open is because they contribute to my history my payment history has been spotless how much would it really hurt my score to close these cards should i just keep them open indefinitely and pay the annual fees grips lol i wonder if that guy in india actually felt he was doing you a favor by increasing your limit by bucks good grief those cards aren't going to help your credit score as much as your new card with the limit why should you pay per year for those other cards that you probably aren't going to use anyway those cards should stay on your credit history for some time anyway even if they are no longer active Credit card Debit card Credit card fraud Poker jargon Octopus card H-1B visa Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Surveillance MasterCard Identity theft HSBC Mutual fund Immigration to the United States EFTPOS Mortgage Legal tender Bond Taxation in the United States Advance fee fraud Credit score Citigroup Social Security (United States) Auto insurance Minimum wage Deflation (economics) Credit history Money Donald Trump Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Annuity Personal finance Visa (document) Education in the United States Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Internet fraud Health insurance Phishing Taxation in the Republic of Ireland National Insurance Economy of Africa Kyoto Protocol Have I Got News For You Corporation 401(k) Interest Micropayment Copyleft Monetary policy Toronto-Dominion Bank The Cure Bank of America American Express Game show Mercantilism Bank of China (Hong Kong) Baccarat $ale of the Century The Amazing Race Primerica Financial Services Password Hiberno-English Major League Baseball television contracts E-ZPass Gold standard Chip and PIN Electronic money Public good Social rule Free trade Scrip Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment benefit Social Credit Euro Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 United Kingdom corporation tax Betting (poker) Cleveland Browns Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Arthur Laffer Refinancing Whose Line Is It Anyway?
