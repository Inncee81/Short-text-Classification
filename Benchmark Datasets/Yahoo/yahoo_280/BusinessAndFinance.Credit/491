does anyone know how i can remove capital one from my credit report i had a capital one card in it is now charge off the card was initially for i have all sorts of fees over the year that added up to i have been dispting this because it's not correct but it seams like everytime i dispute it it comes back remains i want to work with them but since it has been on my report for almost five years i was told to leave it alone i really need help i need a higher credit score so that i can get a home can i get some help from someone please it would have been cheaper to pay ther card on time a month is better than having all this mess you have created once it is on your credit report as a charge off you are not going to get it off legitimately you can get it off but you have to be willing to dispute the thing with lies until someone makes a mistake and it comes off i have done this and here is how it works the credit bureaus have days in which to verify a disputed item this means contacting the creditor to ascertain that the item is correct if for some reason they do not get a response back from the creditor within the required time then they have to remove the item from your credit report you may have to do this with experian trans union and equifax if capital one reports to all three equifax is the hardest what you do is this send a handwritten dispute to the credit bureau stating that the negative item is not yours that you never had a capital one credit card that it has to belong to someone else with the same name and that you have never been late with any payments even though none of this is true you have to say it and if the credit bureau cannot verify the accuracy of the item then it must come off it might take a couple of years to do this but it can be done if you keep at it i know this works because i have done it you will have to send the same disputes over and over again about once every days until someone slips up it's easier and cheaper though just to pay your bills on time the negative item will remain on your credit report for years after it is paid years is incorrect bankruptcy stay for years and some federal tax liens stay on forever if not paid Credit score Credit repair TransUnion Credit card Mortgage Insurance Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Plame affair Student loan Article One of the United States Constitution Surveillance Deflation (economics) Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt consolidation Minimum wage Phishing Legal tender Probation officer Estoppel Tom DeLay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Octopus card Annuity Airline Bank Enron Corporation Economy of Russia 401(k) Money Credit card fraud Flat tax Wal-Mart Concurrent estate Life insurance Experian Killian documents Advance fee fraud FairTax Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bankruptcy Government debt Health insurance Microeconomics Data retention Child support London Congestion Charge Mutual fund Islamic banking Fractional-reserve banking British national identity card Topps Automatic teller machine Bankruptcy in the United States Debt Voluntary Student Unionism Euro Evan Mecham Appeal The Amazing Race Government of India Act 1935 Inflation Dog training Bank fraud Commodity markets Corporation Blackjack Timeline of the Enron scandal RFID Bretton Woods system Algorithm Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Allodial title Solar cell Mao (game) Fast bowling GSM services Snooker Something Awful Financial audit Electricity meter SAT Punch card Credit history Food and Drug Administration IP (complexity) Florida Central Voter File Donald Trump Public-key cryptography Predatory lending Washington gubernatorial election, 2004
