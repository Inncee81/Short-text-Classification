iraquaw indian tribe or something like it my family is desended from a tribe formed by two other tribes my grandmother called them ira quaw or something of that nature i am wondering if anyone has info about this small tribe or knows where i could get the info as all the people in my family who would have been old enough to ask have all passed away i belive it was a band of iriqous and cherokee or choctaw i am not sure i know my grandmother was from arkansas and her grandmother was full blooded indian and married a white man which she was kicked out of the tribe for thats all the info i can remember i do not even have a name although there is no such tribe as the iraquaw that doesn't mean you don't descend from native ancestry you need to do the genealogy part of the equation to find out where and when your ancestors may have tied in with a native tribe or nation it does sound like a mix of iroquois and choctaw but the information given about the iroquois being part of the civilized tribe is wrong they were not the information about being from a mixture of two tribes may be correct some joined larger tribes as a means of protection either from other tribes or the whites other were merged when one tribe overtook the other the iroquois formed a confederacy made up of tribes all from the northeast part of the u s the cherokee had other tribes that joined with them also mostly from the central eastern states the tribes that make up the civilized tribes that ended up in oklahoma are the cherokee creek choctaw chickasaw and seminole if you want some help from some very good people that do this kind of research visit my wifes group she specializes in native genealogy http groups yahoo com group native american genealogy Cherokee Indian Removal Shawnee Native Americans in the United States Choctaw Oklahoma Indian Wars Native American music Tennessee Unassigned Lands Tecumseh Iroquois Trail of Tears Stand Watie Creek people Mississippian culture State of Sequoyah Ward Churchill Lenape Arkansas Ojibwa Family Creek War Little Dixie (Oklahoma) Louisiana John Ross (Cherokee chief) Lumbee Tulsa, Oklahoma Mississippi Choctaw language First Nations Coosa River Genealogical DNA test History of the Southern United States Native American mythology Treaty of Fort Jackson Afro-Latin American Pontiac's Rebellion Alabama Indian Territory Indigenous peoples of the Americas Lamanite Iroquoian languages Vermont Northwest Indian War Lakota War of 1812 Seneca tribe Mohawk nation Miami tribe Genealogy Same-sex marriage in the United States Wyandot Southern United States History of Alabama William McIntosh Genealogies of Genesis Cheyenne North Carolina Languages in the United States Texas Africa New York Colorado Gold Rush Sequoyah Political correctness Southeastern tribes Mingo Colorado War Douglas H.
