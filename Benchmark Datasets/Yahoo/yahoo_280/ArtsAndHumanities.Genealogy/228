anyone dealt with becoming a member of the cherokee nation i've been at it for over a year now at first they appeared to be extremely helpful my natural father's grandmother appeared on the dawes rolls i got them all of my ancestry background and thought everything was okay then we got to some issues my parents were divorced and i was adopted by my stepfather at and he changed my name my parents and stepfather have all passed away my father's sister is alive and could give me a certified letter about my parentage i actually have a certified copy of my original birth certificate showing my natural father also have my birth certificate showing my stepfather as my father i live in illinois where all records of adoptions are considered closed ie impossible to get a record of any of this i can't believe the cherokee nation hasn't dealt with this type of thing before anyone able to give me any insight can you appeal their decisions or lack of a decision to anyone i feel your pain i can't prove my great grandmother's birth and my great grandfather refused to let her register so the cherokee nation won't recognize me at all if you have submitted all of your documentation with a clear explanation then it is up to the tribal council to make a decision don't look for a good one they really don't like to let outsiders in they are very very picky you can petition the court to have your adoption open and if you tell the judge why he may then you can get what you need if not then you might try ordering a copy of the transcript of the hearing you may or may not get it you will have to pay for it if they do release it to you you already have the main documents that you need both birth certificates so i don't know what else you want from the court it takes them a long time to give you an answer as they get hundreds of applications they have to go thru all those documents and check them out and make the decision so be patient if you don't hear anything within months then contact them do you have a local tribal office where you are if you do take your documentation to them and ask for their assistance they may help you out good luck Appeal Cherokee Same-sex marriage in the United States Judicial functions of the House of Lords Divorce Notary public SCO-Linux controversies Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Legal aspects of transsexualism Transsexuality Terri Schiavo Abortion debate British nationality law Contract Legal research Moss v.
