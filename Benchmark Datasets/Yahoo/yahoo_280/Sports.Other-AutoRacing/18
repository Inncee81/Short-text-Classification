supercharger or turbo i have a ' mx and i m thinkin' of goin' with either a jacksonracing supercharger or a greddy turbo i've tried to do a little research online and everywhere i look it says that either one will double my horsepower does anyone have any dyno tests for these on a ' ' mx i can look at to get exact 's there is a nice price difference between them and i d love to get the supercharger but if the turbo will be exactly the same then i might as well save some money right also i know it s probably a good thing to upgrade my fuel system and ignition system at the same time but it is necessary dodgeman where you at you do know that they're not exactly the same a supercharger is mechanically driven usually by a belt off the crank pulley superchargers put more of a strain on parts but take up less space in the engine compartment and when you step on the gas the extra power comes in immediately usually you can adjust your 'blower' to give more or less boost by swapping around different pulleys a turbo really short for 'turbosupercharger' is driven by exhaust pressure the necessary plumbing takes up a lot of room and there can be a slight delay in acceleration the dreaded 'turbo lag' that's why mechanically driven superchargers not turbos are favored in drag racing turbos also tend to run hot either can raise havoc with a computer controlled car a new chip or other components may be called for as well as a higher flow fuel system and hotter ignition if the companies you mention make kits specifically intended for your car though they ought to tell you what you'll need of course once you get the engine figured out you may start breaking clutches transmissions driveshafts etc etc hot rodding a car is a process not an event good luck for more specific information i suggest you ask at miata net Dodge Neon Jet engine Motorcycle Drag racing Porsche 911 Diesel engine Fuel injection Internal combustion engine Spacecraft propulsion Transmission (mechanics) Automobile 24 Hours of Le Mans Automatic transmission Ford Thunderbird E85 Two-stroke cycle Chevrolet Corvair engine Mazda Miata Formula One regulations Turbojet Hybrid vehicle Mazda RX-7 Wankel engine Auto racing Steam engine Toyota Prius Ford Mustang Indianapolis 500 Chevrolet Corvair Engine Volkswagen Golf Engine Control Unit Nitrous Chevrolet Corvette Radio controlled car Rocket fuel Continuously variable transmission Mitsubishi 3000GT Engine tuning Honda CX series Space shuttle main engine Internal ballistics Chevrolet Camaro Toyota MR2 Rolls-Royce Merlin Tractor Motor oil Rear wheel drive Messerschmitt Bf 109 SR-71 Blackbird Dodge Charger Saab 900 Stirling engine Redundant array of independent disks Rail terminology Volkswagen Passat Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster 2000 Australian Grand Prix PlayStation 3 History of Formula One Tier One Mitsubishi Starion Allison V-1710 Scramjet Mazda RX-8 Renault 25 Aircraft engine BMW 801 Space Shuttle program Novelty (locomotive) Locomotive Porsche 993 Manifold vacuum Aircraft flight control systems Naturally-aspirated engine Ignition system McLaren F1 Turbine Atari 8-bit family Car handling P-47 Thunderbolt Inflation Manual transmission Explosive material Air conditioning Ford Crown Victoria
