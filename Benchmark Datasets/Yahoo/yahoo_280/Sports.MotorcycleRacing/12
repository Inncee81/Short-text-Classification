do i need new reeds for my dirt bike i got a kx stroke so it has reeds in the intake when my bke is wide open either in gear pinned or wide open on a turn in nd when i let go of throttle it hear like a suction noise and some times while i don t even move throttle i was told maybe my problem replacing the reeds will always help the performance of any stroke machine espesially if you have never replaced them before take off your exhaust pipe and inspect the piston and the rings you will be able to see the piston and the rings with a flashlight the take off the intake where the reeds go and inspect the piston that way as well you may need a new top end as far as the sucking noise goes it may be jetting a partially blow ring or bad reeds spend the money and get it all done at once but do not buy stock reeds from a dealership instead ask for boyesen racing reeds the last longer and are half the price Two-stroke cycle Carburetor Motorcycle Four-stroke cycle Jet engine Gnome Monosoupape Chevrolet Corvair engine Internal combustion engine Variable valve timing Reading spark plugs for racing Diesel engine Helicopter Ford FE engine Spark plug Wankel engine Gnome et Rh__ne Fuel injection Steam engine Manifold (automotive engineering) Dodge Neon Connecting rod Turbofan Rail terminology Sleeve valve 2-stroke power valve system Motocross Toyota S engine Harley-Davidson Gas turbine Fountain pen Expansion chamber Drag racing Radio controlled car Harmonica Tank Vacuum cleaner VTEC Turbojet Ford Windsor engine Transmission (mechanics) Camshaft BMW 801 2005 NBA Finals Poppet valve Supercharger Opposed piston engine Junkers Jumo 205 Bong B-47 Stratojet Siphon Convair B-36 Engine balance Organ (music) The Velvet Underground Displacement on Demand Elevator GM 3800 engine Supersonic transport AMC V8 engine Professional wrestling slang Reciprocating engine Thermal power station New York Knicks Newcomen steam engine Axial compressor Hybrid Synergy Drive Novelty (locomotive) Glossary of firefighting equipment Engine tuning Anchor M60 machine gun E85 Ford Mustang Internal ballistics Diesel cycle Armoured warfare F-104 Starfighter Mazda Miata M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Acura Integra (North America) Honda B engine Valve gear Chevrolet Corvair P-47 Thunderbolt V8 Motor oil Timeline of steam power P-38 Lightning Disc brake Turbine Mazda Wankel engine Diving regulator GM Vortec engine Airport (film) Aircraft engine controls
