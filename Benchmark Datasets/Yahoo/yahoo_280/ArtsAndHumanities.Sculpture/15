how do you make concrete furniture how would i make a concrete couch for my back yard or any kind of mold for that matter what do artist use to make things like that then put tile on them as mosaics i guess you would just built the form out of stuff i am hoping to figure this out thanks for the help hi you could probably use hypertufa there are numerous recipes for it and it can be made to simulate old mossy stone the main component of it is portland cement and then an organic component like sifted peat moss or sawdust a strengthening component like loose fiberglass or plastic and perlite vermiculite or sand items made with this can withstand temperatures down to f and you can shape it pretty easily and carve into it for a few hours while it's curing you can do a search for this term on yahoo and find a lot of links with recipes for making it if you do want to make a real concrete item with mosaic elements you might check out the wetcanvas sculpture channel there are many threads and articles with photos and steps that would help you with this process there are also items here that have been made with hypertufa in a nutshell a form is made with some material and chicken wire is formed over that and a concrete mixture is added over the top and mosiac elements are added in either during the process or afterward and grouted in hope this helps and i hope your project goes well wetcanvas is a wonderful artist community website and basic membership is completely free there are currently more than worldwide members and many artistic channels for just about any type of artwork you can think of Plastic Concrete Houseplant Pottery Plaster Portland cement Seismic retrofit Explosive material Boat building Building material Pavement (material) Drill bit Textile manufacturing Fiberglass Steel Legal research Vermicompost Masonry Stucco Opportunity rover Polymer clay Hydroponics Knife Sampling (music) Algorithm Geodesic dome Panama Canal Locks Reinforced concrete Printed circuit board Ceramics Bread The Apprentice 2 Guitar Information Services Procurement Library Carbon fiber Hamster Silicon Asbestos Brewery Natural building Transistor Roof Sewage treatment Architecture of the California missions Aggregate (composite) Metallurgy Recipe Polystyrene Glossary of sculpting terms Radio controlled airplane Rococo Japanese tea ceremony Sculpture The Star Wars Holiday Special Dam Loudspeaker BBC Dice Mortar (masonry) Futari wa Pretty Cure Iron Basement Sand casting Visual Basic XML Strap-on dildo Die (manufacturing) Cerebellum Woodworking PHP Fuselage Photography Product Lifecycle Management Culture of Korea Java programming language Spark plug Open Directory Project Repouss__ and chasing Cuisine of Denmark Rigging Ice cream Homebuilt aircraft Poker jargon Microeconomics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Knitting Mid-levels Injection moulding Titanium Fancy rat Tokusatsu Gas metal arc welding Lightning
