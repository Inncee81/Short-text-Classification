at age would you allow your kid to ride bikes up and down the road all the neighborhood kids who are around the same age are allowed to ride up and down the road to different houses as they please i am extremely uncomfortable with this even though i am his step mom our street is not very busy but there are cars who go quite quickly sometimes plus i don't know the neighbors here well enough to feel safe i hate to tell him no because then he can't hang out with his friends but i do tell him no because i'm just not comfortable my husband's mom tells me that i need to just let go because that's what you do so i feel pressure from her to go against my instincts am i over reacting or is he just too young at i had the same worries when our youngest was and we moved to a new town i compromised a bit allowing my son to ride his bike on our road from this house to this house i later extended his space a few houses further and now he's allowed to ride the whole block he's as i met the neighbours i found out that most of them had similar boundaries our road is not busy but we live in the country so the cars that do drive past sometimes drive too fast and the road is gravel with really deep ditches on each side i worried a lot but i talked to my kids a lot about safety and paying attention to what's going on around them and taught them to stop their bike and wait for a car to drive past them i watched closely until i started to feel more confident so go with your instincts because only you know how busy the road is how real the danger is and how responsible your stepson is you could just tell him he can only ride if you're outside watching him at least until you feel more comfortable and if you find a neighbour whose judgement you trust talk to her about your worries and see what rules she has good luck Bike lane debate Motorcycle Milton H.
