how can i help two underprivlidged children in my neighborhood i've become acquainted with two children in my neighborhood who live down the street in the subsidized housing complex their mother is on welfare and disability so i know they don't have much all summer long they pretty much walked the streets and would talk with me while i worked in my gardens i'd like to help these kids out somehow but i think i'm doing it wrong i started giving them food because i knew they didn't eat well but now they are coming and knocking on my door at all hours asking for food and are bringing other children in the neighborhood it's starting to get crazy and i simply cannot afford to feed all these kids can you please give me some ideas on what i can do to tame this situation i'd still like to help the kids i see how bright they are but i can't continue on the path we're going on now thanks for your help these kids need guidance and you can help them a lot by discussing appropriate behavior tell them you're sorry but you must set limits they can come for dinner nights per week but they are absolutely not allowed to knock on the door after dark or with friends to ask for handouts in addition if they could help you at all perhaps growing their own tomato plants or washing windows etc they could start understanding the concept of work and reward RuneScape quests Tomato Breath of Fire III The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milton H.
