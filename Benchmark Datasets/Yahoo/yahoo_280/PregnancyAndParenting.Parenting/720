how to best help a seventeen year old my niece has asked to come live with us her family life is less than ideal her mother is a bully her father is oblivious to what going on around her her mother goes out of the way to make sure family members know that my niece has mental problems and is a bad student and generally bad mouths her do i believe the seventeen year old i only believe her to a certain point as i have seen her mother in action point when asked to pick her daughter up from spending the night knowing she was in the area she said hell no i don't want to spend time with her i am on my way to see my sister i don't want to see her the mother is suspected of using perscription drugs abusively and selling them to others though there is no proof i have three younger children myself what my niece has asked is huge but not unexpected how should i approach the mother when i know almost certainly she will react in a huge bad yelling way in my state seventeen year olds have to be emancipated from the family or have paretnal approval before they move out so i have to confront the mother the seventeen year old has asked to see a therapist admitted to depression and has been cutting herself in hopes that someone in the home would notice and get her help i noticed with in fifteen minutes of serious talking with her and listening to her words not looking at her for marks i just strait out said omg you're cutting i can not get her the help she needs without the parents help as she will need their insurance to see a therapist i have had an experience like yours my son had a friend that his mother was somewhat abusive verbally and a step father that was really abusive he wanted to come live with us and his mother actually asked if he could live with us at first i was not going to do this but i thought i might be able to help him he and my son where exactly the same age be sure you know what you are getting into you will be responsible for all of her care and expenses if she gets in trouble you will be the one to deal with the problem also although the mother may seem the villain the daughter might be the instigator watch them in acton for a while before deciding also be sure you make rules write them down and have the mother and daughter both sign a contract before agreeing EastEnders Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Social rule Milton H.
