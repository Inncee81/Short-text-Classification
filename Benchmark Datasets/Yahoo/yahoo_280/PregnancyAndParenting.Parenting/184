son who is almost yrs old thinks he's on summer vacation still my son will be in a few weeks my godmom who passes away mos ago left her car for me i told my son he could have it if he had a job and could pay for his insurance it is my attempt to move him in a more responsible direction he has a lot of friends some the same age but some of them younger he has not gotten a job or completed his ged he has been hanging out with his friends and he is practically never home he calls me everynight to let me know approximately where he is going to be sleeping i know that he is almost and i have to let him go but it's strange for me he wants his independence and i have been trying to give it to him i have no control in whether he wants to be at home or not i want him to get a job get his car on the road and then move out with his buddies that is the natural progression of things he talks about getting a job getting his car insured and moving out but he has not done a thing but hang out all summer any advice my first question is if he isn't working where is he getting his spending money from you have given him the chance to step up and take responsibility now it is more than fair for you to enforce it stop paying for his cell phone don't give him to go out on the weekends disconnect the internet from his computer stop paying for his video game or movie rental program if you have one for him refuse to drop him off or pick him up from friend's houses or the mall no car privelages as you are cancelling his insurance until he can py for it himself tell him that you appreciate his letting you know where he is each night and that is a good thing so be sure to really emphasize it but that if he is not going to attend school full time he is now responsible for his own laundry and all his exspenses also tell him that he must have a job by a certain date or he will need to find another way to contribute to the house taking over all the chores laundry etc while you work encourage him to get his ged it is probably the only way he can get a job at his age as he is not currently working already you can love him but make it clear that if he wants to be treated as an adult he has to act like one as well Knots Landing GED Social rule Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q Friends The Sims One Tree Hill (TV series) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Contract Insurance Unemployment Grand Theft Auto (game) Extreme Programming Sin City EastEnders The Inside Cindy Sheehan The Catcher in the Rye Garfield Unemployment benefit About a Boy Video game developer James Hanratty Grandview, U.S.A.
