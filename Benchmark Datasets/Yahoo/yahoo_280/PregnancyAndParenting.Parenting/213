my five or six year old cousin wants me to teach her how to swim but i want to make sure i teach her the right way and that she's safe please give me some advice and no i'm not just gonna throw her in the water that would traumatize her thanks ok first of all my cousin is five or six i'm thirteen i was a lifeguard and swim instructor for seven years so i'll help you with the basics more advanced strokes she should go on a swim team or take swim lessons but to teach her how to swim just to save her life you can do if you are a strong swimmer first never take her into deep water the shallowest part of the pool is the best where she can stand second get her comfortable with the water if she's already comfortable the you start with floating you support her head with one hand and the other hand under her back tell her to put her hands out like and airplane and to hold her head back so you can see her eyes and she can see yours this is the correct formation hold her and tell her that you will remove the hand from her back but she must push her tummy to the sky as far as she can work on this until she is level then remove the head support once she is secure after she has back float down front float is a lot easier same principle but have her blow bubbles at first and slowly put her face in finally teach her the motions of swimming by moving her her arms for her through the water both for back stroke and front crawl i usually use analogies like if she has a dog dig in the yard for a bone like the dog digs once she has these motions down support either her tummy for front crawl or her back for back stroke and have her do the arm motions for back stroke make sure the pinky finger goes in the water first and and then she turns her hand and scoops the water forward if you don't feel comfortable with these basics then tell your aunt or uncle that you think your cousin should take swim lessons also and this is a must make sure you are at swimming pool that has a lifeguard on duty and that you do stay in the most shallow part of the pool at all times hope this helps Swimming Breaststroke Backstroke Diving Butterfly stroke Aerial (dance move) Drowning Professional wrestling throws Swimming pool Front crawl Lifeguard Professional wrestling holds Medley swimming Tag Equine conformation History of swimming Canoe Kitesurfing Water polo Swingout Dog training Care Bears Suplex Triathlon Bottlenose Dolphin Diving suit Japanese tea ceremony Anchor Table tennis Shaggy dog story Skateboarding trick Aikido Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Naval mine Glossary of American football Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charleston (dance move) Pikmin Sandy Koufax Contredanse Russian joke The Inside Casualty lifting Johnny Weissmuller Car handling Powerbomb Poker jargon Boxing Golf Naruto jutsu Strap-on dildo Glossary of partner dance terms Breastfeeding West Coast Swing Parachuting Pushing hands Personal flotation device Sailing Big Brother (USA TV series) Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Arjuna Mercury 4 American football Taikyoku shogi Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Parade (military) Anatomical terms of location Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Bong Sport rowing Three Stooges Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Textile manufacturing Little Britain Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling attacks USS Tunny (SS-282) Epistemology USS Trigger (SS-237) Bleeding Dog agility Time Out of Mind Helicopter Heinkel He 112 USS Tang (SS-306) Cleveland Browns
