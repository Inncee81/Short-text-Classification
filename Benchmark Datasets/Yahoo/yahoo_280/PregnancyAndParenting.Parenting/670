does spanking or whipping your child help okay this is for everyone with children please answer each question do you spank or whip your child how old is your child do you consider your child to be well behaved please be honest with each question i really would like to know the views on the matter any other details are welcome personally i was whipped as a child i do believe that my mom was alittle extreme when it came to discipline but i know for a fact that she got that way because of her parents my uncles are the same way although i turned out okay some of my siblings carried that same violent behavior into their lives and now the ones in my family that have children are in my opionion extreme in their discipline as well even though we all hated the way we were treated i do not believe in whipping a child but i do think spanking is okay i believe there is a difference between the two i believe that spanking is a mild form of physical discipline using the hand or something of that nature whipping is what i consider using objects like wood paddles extension cords belts and fist other things that leave bruises and yes there are people who do this as i said i was whipped and my sister and brother and uncles whip there children my kids are too old to spank and but i have spanked them both maybe only times each that's all they needed so i consider it to have been effective for my family they are both well behaved and always have been i believe that there is a right and wrong way to carry out this form of punishment however done the wrong way it can do much more damage than good here are the general guidelines i used not in any particular order try to always match the punishment with the crime reserve spanking only for the worst offenses like blatant disrespect or disobedience that you have no question about never punish a child for something that was an accident don't use your hand the hand is meant to be a loving instrument use a wide flat surface like a paddle you only spank to get their attention not to hurt them you should never leave a mark it should sting but not for long never spank your kids when you are angry you can tell them they are going to get a spanking but wait until you calm down before you actually do it talk with your child before you spank them and tell them exactly why you are doing it make sure they understand and give them time to ask questions this is not a negotiation just their time to make sure they understand why you decided to spank them always punish in private and praise in public it's very important that you allow the child to maintain as much dignity as possible throughout the ordeal talk to your child after you are done make sure you tell them that you love them and that it's your job to teach them right from wrong even though sometimes it hurts you to do it hug them and send them on their way to recover in private give them some space move on like nothing ever happened don't hold a grudge don't be moody and never talk about it again unless they bring it up make sure your next interaction with them is a positive one if possible if done using the above guidelines the spanking does not become associated with violence but rather a duty that the parent carries out because of his her deep and abiding love for the child Theory of conduct Paddle (spanking) Punishment Erotic spanking Human sexual behavior BDSM Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity James Dobson Social rule Alignment (role-playing games) Capital punishment Evil Determinism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Caning Child time-out Infantilism Transactional analysis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Strap John Howard Yoder Domestic violence Sin Ethics Martial art Goodness and value theory Incest Theodicy Religion and sexuality Tai Chi Chuan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Plame affair Torture Flagellation Dog training Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses EastEnders The Human Stain Rocko's Modern Life Ten Commandments Narcissism Child abuse Causality Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Moral Politics John Wycliffe Abortion debate Origin belief Nicomachean Ethics Kodocha Intelligence quotient Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human Aerial (dance move) Polyamory The nature of God in Western theology God Emperor of Dune Merit Futurama (TV series - season 5) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Summa Theologiae Eddie Guerrero Sheikh Abdullah Cindy Sheehan Surveillance Rich Mullins John the Baptist Censorship in Australia Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dogville Political economy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fathers' rights Knots Landing Parenting Biology Sigmund Freud Autism Characters in the Smurfs Sola fide Consensual crime Hikikomori Jon Secada Diving Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
