do you agree with not being able to smack your child no i was brought up in the 's and if i misbehaved i was given a smack across the leg i wasn't beaten or mistreated and i grew up with no hang ups i loved and respected my mum and dad my own two years old children got the same treatment i did and i know they respect me and they frequently tell me they love me too it's all very well saying 'reason with them' or put them on the 'naughty step' but most bad behaviour occurs when you are out in public you can't reason with a screaming child in the frozen food aisle of tesco's or sit them in a quiet corner and leave them in asda's so a smack would then be the best punishment but parents can't even threaten to do it without some do gooder telling them it's 'child abuse' Spanking Corporal punishment Domestic violence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Silent Night, Deadly Night Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 About a Boy Saint Nicholas Fathers' rights Dog training 2005 trial of Michael Jackson EastEnders Parenting Boston Public John the Baptist ASDA Oasis (band) Tesco Stolen Generation The Marshall Mathers LP Mumia Abu-Jamal Rocko's Modern Life Kodocha Punishment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mojave people Social rule Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Comanche Anorexia nervosa The dozens The Shining (film) Swingout My Parents are Aliens James Stockdale The Story of Tracy Beaker Infantilism Guantanamo Bay Little Britain Apostasy in Islam Kyle Broflovski Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Wrigley Field Great Teacher Onizuka Theodicy Fictional crossover Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Ron and Fez Capital punishment Children of God Miss Saigon James Dobson Fred Phelps Divorce Father's Day (Doctor Who) School discipline Incest Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Mr. and Mrs. Turner Supermarkets in the United Kingdom Professional wrestling attacks Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Rais massacre Michelle Tanner Anger management Bat Boy Ranma __ characters Eddie Guerrero Jonestown Welsh mythology Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Treehouse of Horror V Brown v.
