omg he wont listen help me my son is in general a very good kid most everything i tell him to do not do he listens the only problem i have with him is he keeps playing in the bathroom it is attached to his room so unless im supervising every move of the time i dont know if hes in his room or the bathroom i cant lock him out or anything cuz its the bathroom i took all the chemicals out so thats not a concern but thats gross i dont want him playing in there and every time i catch him at least times a day i ask him what are you doing he always responds with playing in the bathroom i know im not supposed to so i know he knows better i have spanked him taken things away done time out and nothing is working its frustrating the hell out of me if he knows hes not supposed to how do i make him stop the more you punish him the more he will probably gonna be in there that is why you have to encourage him to replace his playing spot try to interest him in playing outside or in his room or any other place that is more suitable when he goes to play in the bathroom try to say look how warm and bright it is in your room look how cleaner it is hear and all of your toys are here or another thing if he is still small you can scare him like if you start to play in the bathroom the bathroom monster will come and so and so on this usually scares kids and they do not want to do it again Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bart chalkboard gags The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bathroom The Shining (film) The Inside Japanese toilet Silent Night, Deadly Night The Time Machine Toilet paper Fecal incontinence Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Toilet Milton H.
