where and how do we return the recalled mattel toys i'm angered at the way this mattel recall is being handles or not handled as the case may be we own a few of those recalled mattel toys including the dora talking house and some of the figurines i went to the mattel site as well as the walmart and toys r us sites and none of them have any information on what to do about the recalled toys i saw on the national news that one can return the toys for vouchers but how can one does not know where or how to return the toys this is gross neglect by these companies and i'm sickened especially when it is affecting our children's health so in other words we have to mail in a lb toy this is what i'm talking about they don't make it easy but what's worse is that excessive lead can cause brain damage i thought this kind of stuff stopped happening in the s class action lawsuit is what i smell here if you go to this website address http www service mattel com us recall default asp recall id you can determine if your toy is indeed being recalled and get a voucher through the mattel website i saw one of my son's elmo toys on the list and went here if you purchased the toy after may it is recalled before may it is not recalled mine was not recalled but it still makes me wonder if i can trust them maybe it is safer just to throw it out anyway the website says once you receive your brochure and label please follow the instructions included if your product is affected a voucher for the retail value of the product s will be sent to you within to weeks upon the receipt of your returned product s the voucher can be used at most national retailers and is good toward any fisher price or mattel manufactured product excludes licensed products on this same webpage there is a click here section to process the voucher and have it sent to you of course you aren't going to get your voucher for another couple of months i agree with you the negligence is sickening we need to get on our government officials to regulate this type of thing more closely if we can't trust a huge toy company like mattel how do we know if any of the toys our children play with are safe Video game crash of 1983 Intellivision Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Mattel Microeconomics Privatization Trademark Phishing Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Gmail Data retention Spyware PHP First-sale doctrine Contract Fair use Separation of church and state Opera (web browser) Uniform Resource Locator School choice Apple Computer Plame affair Citigroup Inflation Fisher-Price Food and Drug Administration Economy of Russia M16 (rifle) Common Unix Printing System Measures of national income and output America Online Bank Social Security (United States) Dog training Electronic Arts Website 2003 California recall Organic farming E-mail spam Ethical consumerism Insurance Externality Classified information Value added tax Debt Denial-of-service attack Intellectual property American Flyer Electronic commerce Retailer Copyright Anonymous remailer Scientology beliefs and practices Slander and libel G.I.
