what your view on working vs stay home mothers i have an month old baby and am not currently working so i can care for him i did go back to work part time when he was months old but struggled so badly with childcare i have no family nearby to care for him and couldn't afford the childcare plus hated leaving him with someone else that i gave up months later i love being at home with him but i know i won't be able to do it forever my partner is a low wage earner and we are struggling on just his salary it would be great to work from home but i don't have any skill that would make that feasible and my house is not suitable for me to be a childminder i feel guilty at staying home and not working as it means we struggle for money and can't give him all i'd like to but then i'd feel guilty if i went to work and left him with someone else all day whats your view is it best for a mother to stay home even if it means the family purse strings being tight or work and bring in extra cash missbeans i'm in the uk i have got a degree but it has never helped me get a job like many brits and i've had to work in callcentres alongside loads of other graduates i'm thinking of going back to college to re skill as my degree is not helping me but don't know what course to do obviously we know minimum wage is not going to be liveable for the rest of our lives and my partner wants to retrain but is finding it very hard to find funding because there isn't much in the uk for adult re training bringmesunshine sorry you don't like my views on immigration which i have a right to hold in a free country however that has nothing to do with this question so i'd ask you to keep your childish playground jobs to yourself it is tough now because not many people earn enough to be able to live on one salary alone certainly not in greater london where i live i'm still not sure what i will be doing once my baby is born my maternity leave ends i know that i wont want to leave him with a stranger but i'm not sure that we will cope on just my boyfriends salary i think i will most likely try to work part time but hours that will work around my boyfriends so that i can leave the baby with him there are jobs that you can do this with they wont be the most glamorous or challenging of work but it will bring in some extra money things like cleaning working in a supermarket even if its only a few hours in the evening every little helps jobs with shift work can also be useful to look at too i've yet to see a work from home opportunity that hasn't been a scam so be wary of anything like that as your baby gets older you can maybe look at working days in a week he can go to a nursery spend time around other kids his age you will be able to bring some more money in places like doctors surgeries schools are good to look at as they tend to employ people part time councils are also good as they consider job sharing some even have a creche so your son wouldn't be too far away from you try not to worry too much about it if you look hard enough you will find something that suits you as long as you are able to pay your mortgage or rent bills can afford to buy food you will be ok don't worry about the so called luxuries of holidays etc your baby is too little to be concerned about these things yet good luck Economic inequality Unemployment Knots Landing Kodocha Day care EastEnders Minimum wage Education in the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Division of labour Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Graduate school Humphrey Bogart London mayoral election, 2004 Publicly funded medicine Avenue Q Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jon Secada Days of our Lives Progressive tax Medicare (Canada) Wal-Mart Great Depression Professor Infantilism Anarchism and capitalism One Tree Hill (TV series) Rosa Parks Flat tax Freeters Charles Ponzi Satchel Paige Microeconomics Friends Care Bears Working time Gross domestic product Rent (musical) Education in Germany 1957 World Series Taxation in the United States Capitalism Offshoring Vladimir Peter Tytla Warren Buffett About a Boy Unemployment benefit Kibbutz Health insurance Shaggy dog story $ale of the Century Deflation (economics) Labour economics Labor theory of value Honey and Clover Culture of the United States The Family from One End Street National Kidney Foundation Singapore Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salary Leeds United F.C.
