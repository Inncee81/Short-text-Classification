why is this happening to me im only my older brother just moved out not that long ago and i really miss him although even before he moved out we weren't really that close but we were really close when i was little so now i barely talk to him now i keep having these dreams that he's dead and i cry in my dreams and wake up crying about it and to make it worse sometimes during the day when he is not here i start to think he really is dead and feel empty inside and in shock but then i realize he's alive and just not here please help me why is this happening are you close to your dad tell him what's been going on spending some extra time with him might help if your not close to your dad it possible that your older brother represented a dad like figure so your missing him is even more intense in any case find an adult to confide in and spend a lot of time keeping your body active it will help your mind to relax Shaggy dog story Miss Saigon About a Boy Social rule Scenes from a Memory Out-of-body experience Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Futurama (TV series - season 5) Knots Landing Friends The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.
