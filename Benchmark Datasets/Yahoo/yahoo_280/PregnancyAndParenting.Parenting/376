my son is and he gets very upset if i don't shower with him if i'm in the shower he insists to shower with me and when he is taking a shower he wants me in there with him ever since he was i've been trying to make him more independent with showering by himself but he just won't do it so i give in and just shower with him still and i also help wash him like i used to as a mother i don't think this is the correct thing to do but it keeps him calm he seems to enjoy it and at least he's getting clean i just don't think this should happen when he's maybe even older i don't understand all these shower issues with him help some of the answers on here are unbelievable he's only for goodness' sake why create these unnecessary taboos between parents and children like it's something dirty or perverted the mind truly boggles if your son likes you in the shower with him i don't see a problem unless it bothers you or him don't stop as he gets older he will develop a sense of self consciousness which is natural and he will want to cover up more this is a natural step which will happen eventually there is no need to force the issue or make him feel bad be pleased that he's willing to shower at all many mothers of little boys find it a nightmare to get them to take a bath or shower i'm sure you will find a way to get him to shower alone as he gets older he could have a fear of water or be unsure what to do on his own if it's just the independence factor involved put a shower radio in there so he can listen to music while he showers this might make him more keen to go in there on his own or let him take a toy to shower alongside him honestly though don't fret about it he wont be doing it when he's Social rule Justification (theology) Milton H.
