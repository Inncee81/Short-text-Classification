where did i go wrong as a parent i was talking to my year old daughter earlier and she asked me a very strange question her step dad had gone out for awhile and i wasn't sure when he'd be back her question was isn't that a wife girlfriends job to always know where their husband boyfriend is it may just be me but i found this a very disturbing thought for a young girl i've always tried to teach her that both people are equals in a relationship so why would she think that it is the woman's job to keep track of everything their partner does i've seen some women who call their husbands every hour to know what they're doing and who they're with and that drives me nuts but from my daughters question it sounds like she may end up being one of those women how can i teach her that as an adult people are free to come and go as they please any advice or experience would be greatly appreciated thanks after reading some of the answers i decided tht maybe i was teaching her by example so i asked the one person who could give me a straight answer my ex husband his response was that my non clinginess was the only trait of mine he ever admired and liked so i'm pretty sure she hasn't learned this behaviour from me your doing the right thing just tell her that you trust your husband and if you dont have trust you have nothing my husband works out of town hes gone for weeks at a time we talk about two times a day it would drive me crazy if he constanly kept check on me or me him weve been together yrs there is such a thing a running someone off by smothering them shes still young so she might not understand what relationships are all about take care Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Avenue Q EastEnders Hey Jude Charmed Infantilism About a Boy Milton H.
