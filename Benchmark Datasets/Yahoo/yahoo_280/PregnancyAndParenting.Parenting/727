can you believe this when i was at school some girls had knickers with a little pocket for a hankerchief but the rest of us just tucked them into the leg or top now it seems that every item of clothing has to adapt to the computer age http news bbc co uk hi technology stm should fashion follow technonlogy or should it be the other way round even children's clothing is being affected and my daughter in law gave way to my grandsons who wanted shorts with extra long legs to accomadate an extra pocket and which look awful but that extra pocket on the leg mimics the adult fashion to have a special pocket for a mobile 'phone my boys used to have all sorts in their pockets when they came home sometimes from conkers to beetles in a matchbox one thing that they would never have had was a mobile 'phone certainly not at eight years of age and they wouldn't have had teflon coated shorts for the mother's convenience either regardless of what the latest fashion as regards pockets was http uk answers yahoo com question index ylt apcqvm zmrozupjolgnt the second link was meant to be to an earlier question i asked i shall have to deal with this problem again soon when i go to buy the boys their new school clothes so wish me luck http uk answers yahoo com question index ylt apcqvm zmrozupjolgntwzyhbgx qid aa mofa it's a question renaissance should clothing be practical for normal life or should they be made of potentially dangerous materials for the sake of convenience some new fad sorry crazymental i ran out of space i have added the correct link now well missy that is another issue too but i agree with you completely children girls and boys should wear clothing appropriate to their age and what is practical without having fabrics and coatings which may be harmful and not what the latest technology or fashion dictates i know b sparkles but you can be sure that everyone will want them and then they will bring out a range for children and some parents will give in to pester power so that their children are not left out a mad world indeed well i have more time to think on things now spaismunky and she will and give in to my eldest in particular grandson when it comes to buying their new school clothes when they get back whereas i would have them in what looked best and was not teflon coated or unsightly and no matter what the latest fashion is we are talking about an eight year old adayinjanuary i agree i used to climb trees too and i was allowed to wear my older brothers' old shorts to play in not teflon coated back then but very hard wearing because they'd already given them good use by the time i got to wear them but i was dressed appropriately in skirts frocks dresses and so on for school church visiting and so on i don't know what some parents are thinking of these days yes loulla those are the ones the ones she has them in at weekends look bad enough but for school they look awful and i have seen older teenagers wearing them too and using the pocket for mobile 'phones and showing off their underwear too if she is allowing under tens to copy these fashions at so young an age what hope is there for them as for pockets well my boys crammed theirs full as it was without them having extra ones i too had to turn them out properly before putting them in the wash or more likely made them and it was only then that i discovered something that they had been up to and shouldn't have by what the pocket turn out produced at least it was never cigarettes drugs or condoms so they weren't bad boys compared to some and crazymental they are not slightly longer they are much longer just to accomadate a pocket that they do not need and that means even more teflon in contact with their skin can't you see that fashion for seven and eight year olds shouldn't even come into it unless the mother is obsessed by such that is joan your dil isn't even in the country and you're still having a go leave the poor woman be will you edit well joan it's up to you but you will insist on continuing this headlong ride into never seeing those children again at eight years old children are already under pressure from their peers to wear the right thing it may be wrong but it's the way it is personally i didn't go down the fashion route with my son because i couldn't really afford it but if i'm honest with myself i wish i had because he suffered at school for it you view my replies to you as aggression joan but the only aggression i see is vitriol directed at your daughter in law my responses to you are advice which you openly ask for someone has to stick up for your daughter in law's decisions regarding her own children if she can't rely on a warm and loving family that means you joan Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season
