what are some of the best ways to show your children how very proud you are of them although i have always been very proud of both of my children a year old boy and a year old girl recently due to a family crisis they have both had the opportunity to really step up and help out frankly i don't know what i would have done without them although i have told them both how proud i am i really want to do something that would really show them what has happened for you that really expressed how much pride and love your parents feel for you or how have you expressed this to your own children sometimes words just don't have the impact on people that i would like and actions definitely speak louder than words any suggestions i don't necessarily want to buy them anything i want to show them and i tell them all the time that i'm so proud of them maybe that's why telling them again doesn't have the impact i would like it to they are always great kids but they really knocked my socks off recently hence my appeal for ideas i had a friend that lost her dad that had to step in when her mother had just about lost it it was a trying time but i remember her and her sister and brother all pitched in when it got tough i think a year later or maybe it wasn't quite a year but i remember all of them taking a trip together this was due to her sincere gratitude and love for their genuine character loving nature to help one another and how proud of them she had been they all went to disney world that following christmas and my friend still to this day talks about it it was a healing time and a time for them to bond in a new way we are in our early s late twenties now and that happened when we were in high school for graduation her mom gave her a family heirloom to have and explained to her that she was so impressed with the amount of courage and maturity that she had shown that she knew that she was ready to be the new proud owner of her grandmother s ring it was really a big deal to my friend at the time she talks about that too to this day i think the letter idea is a good one too though just do what comes natural 2004 Republican National Convention Kodocha Friends Doug Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Great Teacher Onizuka Pride and Prejudice Kyle Broflovski Garfield Cliff Richard About a Boy Scrooge McDuck The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.
