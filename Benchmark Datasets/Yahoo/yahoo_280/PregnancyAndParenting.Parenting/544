is it wrong to shoot little kids i love going to playgrounds and capturing the innocence of childhood on film recently i got a new digital camera as well but do you think that's illegal i mean i ask the parents first and give them copies but is it wrong it isn't illegal if you ask the parents first but if anyone ever turned around and said they didn't give permission you would have a hard time proving that they said it was ok i understand about loving to take pictures of children at play but the current way you are doing it may cause many people to think you are creepy or something you could try contacting the heads of playgroups and saying that you are starting a non profit photography business of taking pics of children to capture childhood innocence and you would love to give the parents the gift of free photographs of their children playgroup that way you are being more professional and you are making sure that every child who will be in your shot will have parental permission you should also draw up a little contract stating that the parents give you permission to take the pictures and whether or not you are allowed to copyright them if you decide to show sell them good luck and enjoy Photography Digital photography Warez Pornography Good Times Humphrey Bogart Child pornography MAME Copyright infringement of software Sin City Theory of conduct Cinematography Digital cinema Google Digital camera Our Gang American individualist anarchism Nintendo Lewis Carroll Alfred Hitchcock Transactional analysis Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Film Kidnapping GNU General Public License Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Francis Bacon (painter) Children of God Street photography SCO-Linux controversies Monopoly (game) Neopets Panoramic photography Property (ownership right) Abortion debate Codename: Kids Next Door Motion picture rating system Babylonian law Digital rights management Peter Pan Intellectual property Copy protection Charmed The Critic Fair use Sharon Tate Pitaten Kodocha Kylie Minogue Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Four square Video game controversy About a Boy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Childlove movement Trailer Park Boys Divorce ROM image Contemporary culture of South Korea Japanese copyright law Escape from New York Camera Billy the Kid Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Shaggy dog story Stereoscopy Ten Commandments Photojournalism Great Teacher Onizuka Marriage Insurance Road-rule enforcement camera Marilyn Monroe Photograph Snooker Malcolm in the Middle Stanley Kubrick Controversies in autism Contract bridge Gift economy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Digital single-lens reflex cameras The Inside Prank flash Care Bears Macro photography Modchip Konica Minolta Friends Education Paramount Pictures Sergei Eisenstein Tokusatsu Craps
