parents how would you act if your kids ignored you i have been ignoring my parents ever since summer started since they are getting on my nerves i just wanna go out and hang with my friends since junior year is coming up i know i'll be busy with school work and all so im trying to make this a good memorable summer so whenever i see my mom or dad i just turn the other way or whenever they talk to me i just tune them out but whenever i do that they talk more and more don't they get it that im trying to ignore them and that i don't want anything to do with them how do i get them off my back so that i can have more freedom i think i will go get my permit after this sigh drive out of this place this is why i hate parents it's amazing how a lot of people judge me on here even when they dont know me besides i didnt ask to be born and parents are supposed to take care of you duhh why else would you born them for take responsibility duhh if you're about to have a kid do it right and do it with responsbilities having a roof over my head and a bed to sleep in is one of those conditions after reading the rest of the answers i feel like an as for answering this myself lol i know how you feel my parents are the same way sometimes i feel that they're barging in on my personal life and trying to get into my business the most annoying part is when i'm trying to concentrate on something say school work and my part time business online to help pay for school and they just keep yapping about practically nothing i just reply with single word answers hoping they'll get the hint sometimes they don't does this mean that i don't love them of course not i try to help them out as much as i can they need me to pick up some groceries while i'm there okay sure not a problem they need to borrow a few bucks keep it the point i'm trying to make is deep down you really don't mean it when you say that you don't want anything to do with them it's perfectly natural for a teenager to feel that way in some degree but you'll grow out of it later on in life and you'll wish that you had spent more time with your folks for now just let them know that you need your space and they'll understand Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Fairly OddParents Kurt Cobain About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Polyamory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Ashlee Simpson Show Little Britain Jon Secada Avenue Q George Costanza Garfield The Catcher in the Rye Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kender Springfield Elementary School Transactional analysis Rent (musical) Socrates Jean Grey Milton H.
