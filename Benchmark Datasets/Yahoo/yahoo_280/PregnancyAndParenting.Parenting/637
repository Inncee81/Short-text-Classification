would you take it personally if another mother didn't let their child play at your backyard i don't let my year old play in anyone's yard until i met the parents well i met this neighbor a couple of times briefly she turned out to be my neighbor and so she had my children and i over for an afternoon and supper we had a nice time getting to know each other and the kids played for hours awhile later i invited their daughter to play in the backyard with my daughter and her friend who was over for a sleepover the mother said she was uncomfortable for her daughter to have a sleepover here i explained that i was only inviting her daughter to play in the backyard she said she will wait and come over with her daughter sometime but her daughter wouldn't come alone should i take this personally she has been in my house before briefly i am single so she has met my whole family and she is across the street from me and a few houses down maybe she is just overprotective her daughter is and can't go to the park across the street and is in bed by she is very chistian and i set a guideline for our friendship that she shouldn't try to convert me because i have my own beliefs this was in answer to her questions so i didn't say it rudely i was just answering questions and i dont' think much of the christian beliefs so maybe she is worried for her daughter's soul or something because i dont' share her beliefs maybe i know some christians think like that anyway not all i wouldn't take it personally i don't let my kids out of our yard all the neighborhood kids come to our yard and play with them some of these kids are in nd rd grade and are gone for hours and their parents have no clue who they are with or where i can't imagine we recently had a year old girl raped by a year old boys who lived in the neighborhood and played with each other often i honestly don't trust other parents to watch my children as well as i do as a christian myself i can understand her limiting her daughters time with those that don't share her beliefs when i'm outside with my kids and other kids come around i have to warn them about bad language obscene jokes etc if they do it again after being warned they are out of my yard if i weren't out there with them though my kids would be barraged with it i'm not saying your daughter would be this way at all just perhaps giving you some insight on how she might think if you want a friendship between your daughters you may want to have her and her daughter over for dinner let her get to know you better then perhaps she'll feel more comfortable letting her daughter out of her sight for a little while she has to be comfortable with your parenting before she will trust her child in your care the only way for her to know is to see it so have her over sometime hope it all works out Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Lovely Bones 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story The Jeffersons (South Park) Milton H.
