i am and having my st kid in weeks i am really scared i am so scared i'm about to have a kid i don't even know if i want her i know that is a bad thing to say but i had a really bad experience while pregnant i don't know if i can do this being a single young mother i do not think i was ready for a child the father is not supportive so it hurts even more i think she deserves better then what i can give her i try to be positive about the situation but tears bring my joy down everyday some say i will not be able to party or date that my life is over and i made a big mistake by not getting an abortion i am starting to feel this way to i do not know what to do i know if i give her up for adoption my family and peers will look down on me the father says its my fault and i have to live with the consequences and that i can't date or go out that my life is over and tells me i can't raise this child i need some serious advice i feel like i am losing it i had my daughter at and i was a single mother too i can't relate to how you're feeling because i was thrilled to be pregnant however i think the way you're feeling has a lot to do with the fact that you have so many negative people around you who are doubting you before you have even had the baby also your hormones are all over the place it's natural to be scared when pregnant with your first child and that goes for wether you're or trust me as soon as you hold your daughter in your arms you will love her unconditionally what you need to do is surrond yourself with positive people are your family being supportive stop talking to the child's father if he has nothing useful to say you need to be strong for your daughter i'm not gonna tell you that it will be easy but i can tell you it will be worth it in the end i'm now my daughter is and her and her brother are my reason and my heartbeat i met my son's father when my daughter was it's not unusual for young women to have children these days so don't think you will never meet a man again i have never had a shortage of male interest being a single mother doesn't deter men in this day and age i married my son's father and he adopted my daughter sadly we divorced years ago but he still sees the kids so yeh i'm a single parent again but i wouldn't change my life for the world i have a very successful career which i built for my kids for all the hard times i went through i can think of a million more good times i don't think that i have missed out on anything by having my kids so young they are both well balanced and doing well in school and i am thankful that i'm young enough to be able to be a friend to them aswell as a parent so you can do this and it will make you a stronger person too i think it's very brave of you to admit how you are feeling my advice is to wait until your daughter is born and see how you feel then if you still don't feel like you can cope then you can think about adoption don't think about what you can't give your baby think about what you can give her lots of love is what children need you should start looking at what help you can get financially and emotionally look for groups for young mothers in your area where you can meet other girls in the same situation as you talk to your mother or another close family member about your feelings and see what support they can give you find out what benefits you can get look for college courses with creche's so you can think about building a future for you and your baby take all the help you can get don't be afraid to ask your life doesn't have to stop here it just has to change slightly if you can do all the things i mentioned above you will find a whole new circle of friends who are in the same position as you i wish you all the luck in the world honey you can do this be strong think smart and try to smile you are about to embark on a wonderful journey yes it's scary there will be times you feel like you can't cope and you will shed tears but i promise you there is nothing like the feeling of satisfaction you will get when you prove all those haters wrong and you form a bond with that little helpless person growing inside you who needs you to be strong for her she will bring you more joy than any man or any party ever could EastEnders Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy
