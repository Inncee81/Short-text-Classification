adults only i asked similar question have any parents this done before allow their children to watch them once my kid saw us my husband allowed the kid to watch us having sex he said in this way the kid will learn about sexuality has any parents done this before was my husband wrong or right i'm all for leading by example and being a positive influence to your children but what you and your husband have done is absurd i think you and your husband crossed the line and although at the time you might think you were doing a good deed it was damaging and probably traumatic to your child this is a form of abuse because there is a time an place you clearly were way out of line talking about sex to children should be age appropriate that way they could have a better understanding children have innocence and you just violated that and became pedophiles how does it feel to be sex offenders because that is exactly what you are i am appalled you would even ask if this was morally right knowing damn well you and your husband were wrong and used bad judgment and poor taste besides the shame and guilt you might be feeling you should be counting your blessings you and your husband aren't lead away in handcuffs Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Pedophilia Childlove movement Infantilism Rape About a Boy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child pornography Child sexuality Child sexual abuse Abortion debate Spanking Incest Excommunication Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Marriage Laura Schlessinger Narcissism Sexual abuse Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Age of consent Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage Guilt Sin Children of God A Series of Unfortunate Events Motion picture rating system Boston Public Television rating system Dissociative identity disorder Iago Transactional analysis Education Human sexual behavior Video game controversy North American Man/Boy Love Association Ephebophilia Germaine Greer Humphrey Bogart Homosexuality Ethics Transsexuality Satanic ritual abuse Sin City Lewis Carroll Left-handed Paragraph 175 Domestic violence Religion and sexual orientation Polyamory Rind et al.
