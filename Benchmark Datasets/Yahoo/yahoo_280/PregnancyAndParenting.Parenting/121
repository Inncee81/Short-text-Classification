have people lost their minds my kids were at the park earlier today and another kid got hurt this child's mother came up to my year old and said he had hurt her when my year old daughter tried to explain that it had been another child that had done it the mother said i know the little b stard did it then told my daughter to shut her f cking mouth or she'd shut it for her the scary part is this isn't the first time something like this has happened when did it become ok for adults to threaten children i can understand being upset but to threaten to hurt a child how can i help my daughter not be afraid that she is going to get hurt when she tells the truth today's incident happened while they were at their dads so i wasn't there and the other time i had let them go alone but they haven't went since then i've seen this happen before not only parents yell at their own children rather loudly but other people's children that they dont even know as well i simply tell my kids that if anyone comes up to you and talk yells at you you come find me and i will handle it that mother went way overboard and i would have had a thing or two to say to her i would explain to your daughter that she did nothing wrong by explaining what had happened to that woman but next time something like that happens and you see the person getting rather angry to just simply take her sibling by the hand and tell her that she'll go get her parent if they are alone they should just walk away kids get hurt all the time and i can certainly understand a parent getting upset and coming up to the kid and saying can you apologize to my child for but to do what that mother did there's a big issue there what a wack job best wishes Shaggy dog story About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Marshall Mathers LP The Shining (film) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Fairly OddParents Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist EastEnders Milton H.
