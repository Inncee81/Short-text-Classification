help my almost year old son has started using potty talk i e poopy butt pee pee head every time my son gets mad he calls me some kind of bad word like poopy butt or pee pee head or even worse stupid he learned it from another child whom we are no longer around anymore but he doesn't seem like he is ever going to forget these words when he isn't mad we talk about it and he agrees that we don't say stupid but then the minute he gets mad at me usually for telling him he can't have do something he resorts to name calling i am at my wits end we have tried time outs in his room using a naughty spot like supernanny and even the taboo discipline method spanking i never thought i would spank my child but this child doesn't seem to respond to any form of discipline no matter how vigilant we are by the way whoever decided they were the terrible twos never had a three year old i really agree with ignoring the behavior most kids at this age use this type of language and will grow out of it the more you make it a big deal the more he is going to use it if he start resorting back to using it as part of his everyday language he may be using it as a way to get your attention kids at that age love attention regardless if its positive or negative attention don't use the hot sauce method my mom used to do that to me and my brother and i used to wish she would die so it wouldn't happen anymore Spanking Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct El Chavo del Ocho Milton H.
