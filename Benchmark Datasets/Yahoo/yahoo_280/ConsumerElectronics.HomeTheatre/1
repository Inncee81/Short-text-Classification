computer surround sound help i'm not sure how to go about this so any help would be appreciated i have a computer with onboard surround sound mm outputs what i want to do is somehow output this to my surround sound reciever i was thinking i could use three mm to rca stereo plugs to get this i've seen dvd players that have the six rca outs for surround sounds so would this be similar to them also is there any converters like this out there would it be easier to just buy a new sound card and use the coax optical it has on it using the mm outputs would be pretty much the same as the ones you see on a dvd audio player you would have to get three sets of stereo mm jack rca connector plugs and each of the connectors will be for your front center surround and subwoofer channels make sure you use a program like windvd or powerdvd without those you are stuck with channel sound that will played on all your speakers windvd and powerdvd have decoders for dolby dolby pro logic xll and dts and dts neo i've used this type of connection in the past with a receiver that was only dolby and regular pro logic this gave me the chance to hear the dts sound and the at the time new pro logic decoder without having to upgrade my receiver if you were to get a sound card with either coax or optical out then you would have to rely on whatever decoders your receiver has if your receiver is fairly new and has all the dolby and dts decoders then you would get a better sound using optical or coax since the stereo rca cables are analog Laserdisc Dolby Laboratories Sound Blaster Dolby Digital DVD SCART Digital Theatre System Television Surround sound Home cinema RCA connector High-definition television Movie projector S/PDIF Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Jack plug Dolby Pro Logic DVD player MP3 DVD-Audio Subwoofer Gramophone record MPEG-2 Modem Quadraphonic IPod Atari ST Sound recording Nintendo GameCube Compact disc Mixing console S-Video TRS connector Ethernet Sound card High fidelity Atari 8-bit family Coaxial cable Commodore 64 USB flash drive Receiver (radio) Synthesizer Sony Power Macintosh G3 D-subminiature Multitrack recording Original Amiga chipset Blu-ray Disc 8 mm video format Nintendo Entertainment System FM broadcasting Sega Dreamcast DIN connector Universal Serial Bus Super Audio CD RS-232 PlayStation Portable Digital Visual Interface Communications satellite XLR connector Acorn Electron AES/EBU Telephone exchange Digital audio workstation PC Engine Microphone Computer bus ZX Spectrum RCA Computer Karaoke Apple IIGS Desktop computer Teletext Stereophonic sound Analog-to-digital converter Walkman Radio Copy protection S__CAM Computer hardware Noise reduction Compact audio cassette DualDisc ATI Technologies Cable television Game Boy Headphones Nintendo Revolution CPU design Closed captioning IMac Barcode reader Sega CD
