i know that this is an awkward question but why do guys only care about the length of their penis why not the width no perverts just guys girls who know why i know that length is important because it makes it look bigger but i want to know why guys also don't consider width when they compare themselves i think boys care about both actually you will see on this forum that more often both a length and width is given with the question is that normal that question is significant to the asker when boys go through puberty and a lot of things change one of them penis size and shape a man's height his voice pubic hair chest hair these things are very important changes for boys because it is a sign to them that they are now men it is important to them and therefore it is worthy conversation and an important area of concern for them it is not the same for adult men who have grown acustomed to their adult body unless of course they feel inadequate some men feel inadequate because of hteir height and others might have this feeling by reason that they believe their penis isn't an average size but teenage boys just want re assurance that they are normal Human penis size Pubic hair Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pedophilia Testosterone Strap-on dildo Transsexuality Penis Gender role Intersex surgery Delayed puberty Human height Hair Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Anorexia nervosa Sexual differentiation Kyle Broflovski Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Child sexuality Micropenis Social rule Castration Secondary sex characteristic Ranma __ characters Penis removal Kender Testicle Condom FLCL Penis enlargement Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of intersex surgery Normal distribution Hypertrichosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anime Equine conformation Phoebe Buffay's songs Infantilism Pornographic movie Goatse.cx Sex assignment Child Stairway Turner syndrome Anabolic steroid Second language acquisition Man Human Growth hormone treatment Humphrey Bogart Adrenarche Baldness Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Sealab 2021 Milton H.
