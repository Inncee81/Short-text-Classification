how can i get motivated to take exercise more i want to start loosing a bit of weight in my opinion i look fat but people always say that im not fat im and years old i do have rather large legs and i just would like to get rid of the fat when i was born i had something called hershbrung disease and they take out the bottom part of my bowell from that day of the operation i have had a scar under my stomach which cases my belly to flop over i know i will never gat a perfect body but at least i will be able to feel more cumfortable so any suggestions staying motivated is definitely one of the hardest parts of getting in shape there are a couple of things i've found that work best one is setting short term goals for instance my latest short term goal was to get my weight from to by birthday which was this last saturday i gave myself a couple of months to reach the goal which was plenty of time and when my birthday came i was lbs now that i have accomplished that goal my new one is to get on a regular weight lifting routine while still doing my cardio for more weight loss so while losing the weight i can also start gaining some muscle i plan to have a good routine going by the end of this month and should be weighing about lbs the whole short term goal thing makes it easier and more fun b c getting in shape can be a very slow process if you just set your goal to eventually be in shape then your probably going to get discouraged along the way when you don't see quick results set these goals so that they will be a challenge but be sure they are within reach that way you get a sense of accomplishment when you work your way to your goal and are motivated to continue to a new one ultimately leading to your long term goal another great way to stay motivated is to find something you enjoy doing that requires you be in shape this can be a lot of things it all really depends on your personal preference if you like baseball then join a team if you like hiking then plan a trip each weekend like i said it could be anything just find something that you will like and that will keep challenging you hope this helps good luck Weight training Fecal incontinence Muscle Poker jargon 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anorexia nervosa Dieting Bodybuilding Mixed martial arts Obesity Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct Paragliding Weight Aerial (dance move) Social rule Prostate cancer Norway national football team Stomach cancer Adjustable gastric band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Coeliac disease Scientology beliefs and practices Feeder (fetish) Puberty New York Giants Mattress Strap-on dildo Breastfeeding Clinical depression Anchor Hiking Textile manufacturing Terminal ballistics Motivation Weight loss Batting (cricket) Tocopherol Internal ballistics Fast bowling Glossary of American football Airsoft Breaststroke Vegeta Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sport rowing Ra (board game) New York Jets Osteoarthritis Diving Gliding Tag Birthday Alex Ferguson Swingout Alexander Technique Consensus decision-making Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tai Chi Chuan Goodness and value theory Playoff Characters of Naruto Dance Dance Revolution Lindy Hop Tyrannosaurus rex Piccolo Junior Saga CPU cache Swimming Trapping Sailing File Allocation Table The Amazing Race Parachuting Operation Market Garden Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Happiness Crohn's disease Kodocha Bicycle Colorectal cancer Space Shuttle program Wood Jennifer Lopez Radiation therapy Theodicy Utilitarianism Extreme Programming
