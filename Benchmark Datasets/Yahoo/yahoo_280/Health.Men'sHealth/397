can people tell when you have an erection i know this question sounds a little juvenile but i don't go around looking at other guys crotches so i decided to ask you guys when you or another guy gets an erection does it stick out of your pants or something i've always heard that teenage erections are such a big deal but i've never really had a problem with them i wore breifs before my penis really started to grow so i would always just keep it kind of stuck up against my stomach now i wear boxers and i still don't see how it could just stick straight out i'm not small in the inch range but my jeans won't even stretch enough to let it just stick straight out plus it's terribly uncomfortatble so i usually just keep things constricted under my waist band if i can it's only a problem when i'm wearing slacks or loose pants and i tend to point downward so it looks like i've got a king size sharpie marker in my pocket i swear i'm not being gross i just really have never know this i'm by the way is that a king sized sharpie marker you have in your pocket hahah luke you are still a funny young dude i do what you do tuck it up if it happens and if i am wearing a loose shirt over my pants i can walk around if not i just sit down and try to think of my tax return insert something boring i have used this puberty trick for least years oh except i strategically locate my briefcase when i get a traveller a regular occurance for no known reason when the airplane lands good to see you can take all this growing up in your stride Aerial (dance move) Jackass: The Movie Equine conformation Human penis size Goatse.cx Strap-on dildo Softball Penis Professional wrestling holds Canadian Armed Forces Recurring South Park characters Kyle Broflovski Puberty Poker jargon Undergarment Trousers Humphrey Bogart Internal ballistics Sharpie (marker) 24 Hours of Le Mans Eric Cartman Fast bowling Skinhead Rave party Double bass Clown Trailer Park Boys Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marching band Goaltender Teen Girl Squad Belt (clothing) Billiards Kimberly-Clark Corporation The Amazing Race Boxing Beavis and Butt-head Garfield Jesuit College Preparatory School Hazing Professional wrestling throws Chess strategy and tactics Russian joke Jeans Condom Volleyball Drill bit Bonus Stage Comanche Kilt Shit Japanese tea ceremony Heracles Social rule Microeconomics Escape from New York SpongeBob SquarePants Shen Gong Wu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Diving Betting (poker) Paul Is Dead Euphemism Recess (TV series) Pantyhose Androgen insensitivity syndrome Supply and demand Gramophone record Intersex surgery I Am Furious Yellow Sydney Riot of 1879 Toilet humour Mojave people New Zealand English Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gray Wolf Okashina Okashi The Warriors Motion capture Time Out of Mind Australian words Skateboarding trick Doug Skirt and dress Singlish Suit (clothes) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy New York Giants Shirt Mattress Blonde on Blonde Theory of conduct A Night in Heaven Brassiere Buddy Guy
