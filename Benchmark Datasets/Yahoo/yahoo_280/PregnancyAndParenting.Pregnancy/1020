im pregnant and the inside of my belly button has gotten really dark is this normal i know a dark line develops on the outside of your belly but as my innie belly turned into an outie all of the sudden the inside of the belly button got very dark and its not dirt cause i tried everything to get the color out what could it be has anyone else had this problem for some reason i couldn't find anything about this on the internet and thats scary these changes are caused by hormonal changes during pregnancy which stimulate a temporary increase in your body's production of melanin the natural substance that gives color to hair skin and eyes the areas of increased pigmentation will probably fade within a few months after delivery and your skin should return to its normal shade although in some women the changes never completely disappear skin pigmentation changes usually disappear on their own after delivery but you can do a few things to safely minimize them in the meantime protect yourself from the sun this is crucial because exposure to the sun's ultraviolet uv rays intensifies pigment changes use a broad spectrum sunblock a formula that protects against both uva and uvb rays with spf or higher every day whether it's sunny or not and reapply often during the course of the day if you're outside in fact even if you don't plan to leave the house or spend much time outside make applying sun protection part of your morning routine the american academy of dermatology cautions that your skin is exposed to a significant amount of uv light when you do things like walk down the street ride in a car or even sit inside near a window when you're outside cover up and wear a hat with a brim as well as a shirt with long sleeves if you have pigmentation changes on your arms limit the time you spend in the sun especially between a m and p m and definitely avoid tanning salons use gentle cleansers and facial creams preparations that irritate your skin may make the problem worse apply a concealing makeup don't use skin bleaching products now wait to see if the pigmentation changes go away after you give birth good luck hun Human skin color Sunburn Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Melanin Malignant melanoma Acne Vitamin D Sunlight Albinism Breastfeeding Eczema Tattoo Black Hair Ozone depletion Ionizing radiation Puberty Urinary incontinence Sun Sun tanning Cosmetics Menstrual cycle Color Ozone hole Comanche Poker jargon Melasma Horse Skin Baldness treatments Welding Scar Actinic keratosis Ozone layer Fluorescent lamp Cat coat genetics Upholstery Human Pregnancy Light Radiation therapy Physical attractiveness Cephalic disorder Sento Decompression sickness Cancer Floppy disk Color blindness Tocopherol Solar power Eye color Leather Hearing impairment Leopard Mobile phone radiation and health Multiple sclerosis Combine (Half-Life 2) Toyota Prius Fecal incontinence Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hat Cheetah Characters in the Smurfs Turner syndrome Pigment Hair coloring Michael Jackson Gramophone record Testosterone Sunglasses Condom Transsexuality Titanium Nuclear power Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jon Secada Prostate cancer Clinical depression Inflation Tariff Anthrax Shirt Equine conformation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Growth hormone treatment Medicine Breech birth Dog Laser
