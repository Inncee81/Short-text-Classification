did anybody have really bad postpartum depression and what was it like i did not have a severe case of ppd but it was bad enough that i recognized it and sought help i noticed that i started to not care about anything it was really hard for me to stay on top of things like school meetings appointments etc and you have to understand this is something i am normally anal about people call me when they need information and at that time i didn't even care about it i could barely get out of bed some days b c i was so tired i would dread the days my middle child had school b c i had to get in the car and get him there i hated the weather wanted to stay inside and it seemed like nothing made me happy yet no matter what i did to fix it it just got worse i wasn't eating properly but then again had zero appetite it was just a mess if you feel that you are having some ppd you need to tell your ob or family care doc about it there is nothing to be ashamed about except not getting help i know a lot of women feel a stigma with it that they failed if they have it but all it is is a chemical imbalance in their brain nothing more seek help immediately it makes a world of difference hang in there Clinical depression 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters in the Smurfs EastEnders Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bipolar disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strap-on dildo Shaggy dog story Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Childbirth One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Divorce Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Kodocha Anorexia nervosa Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Knots Landing StarCraft: Uprising Time Out of Mind Babe Ruth Infantilism Adult attention-deficit disorder The Shining (film) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Avenue Q Rigging Ben Johnson (athlete) The Subtle Knife History of As the World Turns (2000-present) The Emancipation of Mimi Spanking Tire Karen Horney Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Anal sex Postnatal Milton H.
