two questions about my newfound pregnancy we found out on july th that i was weeks pregnant i was just wondering when will i notice hardening of my stomach and also should i be worried of a miscarrage this is my first pregnancy and i am doing every thing the doctors are telling me to do what are the chances of a miscarrage could i actually be weeks instead of it has been weeks since my missed period i'm confussed now because my doctor told me to but someone mentioned i was probably if it has been weeks since my missed period you will be able to feel your uterus harden somewhere around weeks your stomach should follow soon after if you are overweight it may take longer you shouldn't worry about miscarriage too much it does happen but if you are healthy take care of your body take your prenatal vitamins and avoid habits that increase your risk drug and alcohol abuse smoking excessive caffeine more than cups of coffee day your risk is relatively low easier said than done i know but try not to stress you're a little over a month away from the end of the your first trimester which will take you to the 'safe zone' congratulations Miscarriage Breastfeeding Obstetrics Caffeine Abortion Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tocopherol Psoriasis Cancer Folic acid Urinary incontinence Hypertension Morning sickness Word of Wisdom Coffee Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coeliac disease Tobacco smoking Common cold Abortion debate Fertility awareness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Childbirth Fecal incontinence Obesity Sleep Anxiety Menstrual cycle Schizophrenia Prenatal diagnosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease Twin Omega-3 fatty acid Adjustable gastric band Birth weight Migraine Breech birth EastEnders Alcoholism Prenatal care Vitamin C Abortion in the United States In vitro fertilisation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Osteoporosis Stroke Social rule Atkins Nutritional Approach Clinical depression Drug addiction Intact dilation and extraction Health insurance Partial-birth abortion Milk Birth control Vomiting Herpes simplex virus Guinea pig Dieting Cancer of the larynx Marilyn Monroe Health issues and the effects of cannabis Roe v.
