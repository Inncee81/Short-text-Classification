why do so many women make uneducated decisions about cesareans why do so many women have unnecessary cesareans of live births are c sections of which are unnecessary why allow this it is literally killing women for no reason cesarean risks infection paralyzed bowel leg blood clots pulmonary embolism repeat surgery to investigate bleeding pneumonia septicemia hemotoma chronic scar tissue adhesion complications maternal death rate x higher than vaginal birth death rate psychological risks postpartum depression postpartum psychosis post traumatic stress disorder risks for later pregnancies infertility ectopic pregnancy interference with placental attachment abruptio placentae placenta previa and placenta accreta scar can give way doctors may not allow vbac even though safer risks to baby are cut poor condition at birth i e problems w breathing responsiveness bonding sucking etc breathing problems need intensive care jaundice i ran out of space but did want to mention that according to research of live births are necessarily delivered by cesarean and for these people it is obviously life saving or at least life changing for the better i also want to point out that i do not solely blame the mothers for this trend i place more blame on doctors and culture in general believing that it is actually a reflection of our culture's distrust for women's bodies i know it's hard to choose not to have a cesarean when a doctor presents it to you so matter of factly it makes me sick to think of women who elect for repeat cesareans and act like nothing is wrong but don't even realize that their early time with baby was negatively influenced by their surgery that even if necessary it detracts from bonding time during the newborn period women are presented with repeat cesarean like it's a given not as what it is major damaging and usually unnecessary surgery it's true research shows it hours of labor and you think you would have died hours and you think you would have died sheesh people don't you realize that an average first time labor is hours minimum that hours is not uncommon or life threatening it's only in hospitals that hours is a problem because in hospitals risk of infection is higher than at home and you're more likely to develop an infection from contact with hospital personel and materials failure to progress is never a good reason for a cesarean read the literature join the cesarean awareness network big baby is also not a good reason for a cesarean unless you have rickets or a poorly healed pelvic break baby spending hours in the birth canal is not usually a problem normal time for pushing is hours arbitrary hospital time limits are horrible reasons to cut women open and tear their babies from them hours is nothing keep hanging around on yahoo answers for story after story about how a doctor saved a baby's life via a c section because mum's labour didn't progress just ask a question about home birth somebody will weigh in with the tale of their life saving section after the pitocin didn't get things going fast enough for the ob etc however women undergoing caesarean section were well informed and took a considerable part in the decision making process http www blackwell synergy com doi abs j tb x i wonder what that means though if that's self reported well informed it's useless there was an answer here the other day about formula that had somebody going on about how they'd done research and their research was a nice regurgitation of what's presented in the junk nestl hands out to mothers she had no idea she'd been lied to she figured she'd done research and nestl 's comfort proteins were just the thing to reduce baby's allergies etc i'm sure there's a similar thing at play when a section happy ob explains why he sections the first ob i saw happily said oh lots of reasons when my husband asked him for what reasons he did c sections i'm sure he would've been happy to tell us little about the reasons beyond it's necessary had we stuck around interesting fear of childbirth during pregnancy may increase the risk of emergency cesarean section http www ncbi nlm nih gov sites entrez
