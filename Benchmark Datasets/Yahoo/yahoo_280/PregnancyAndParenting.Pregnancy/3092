would you believe it my friend just learnt that she is seven and a half months pregnant i m a mother and can hardly believe that she didn t realize until today she went to the doctor s office because she had diarrhea for several days and thought she had a gastroenteritis and that was when the doctor told her that she was months pregnant in all this time she s been drinking smoking etc and nobody realized that she was pregnant since she s been always fat do you really believe that something like this can happened without you being aware of it i remember that when i was months pregnant the baby will constantly kick and move i can t believe it she s been living with her boyfriend for months she says that the first three months she had something similar to the regular period and since she s always been irregular the idea of being pregnant never crossed her mind wow yeah i've heard of these things happening even women going up to their ninth months without knowing if you ask me it must be denial even if you see no changes in your body sooner or later that baby's gonna start moving i think they find an excuse for what they're feeling and seeing like it's just a muscle spasm or gastro or a spastic colon the mind is a powerful thing and can make us believe whatever we want to believe i hope at least that her baby's okay just think only finding out you're pregnant at months no looooong wait like the rest of us lol Friends Pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Social rule Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Milton H.
