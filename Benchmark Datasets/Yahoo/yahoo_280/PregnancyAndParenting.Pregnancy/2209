just found out i'm pregnant i just found out i'm about weeks pregnant with my first child my hubby and i are soo excited i'm just wondering from other mothers what are things i should prepare for during the pregnancy things i should expect also what are some baby items you absolutely couldn't live without would recommend to a first time mommy anything i definitely need to put on my registry sorry this is so long i just have so many questions i'm super excited thanks in advance congratulations you'll be hungry all the time for me it was every hours sheesh that was the hardest part i loathe eating the book what to expect when you're expecting is very helpful each chapter is month by month and tells you how baby's developing what you can expect at ob visits symptoms it's not easy being pregnant though it's been a long months for me i'm at weeks as for registry stay away from clothes in the size if someone's throwing you a baby shower guests will bring month onesies anyway and you'll have too many and not enough past the months size if you have money a co sleeper is a good idea it's at babies r us it attaches to your bed so you can just roll over and tend to baby if you have no money bypass the co sleeper and get a crib 'cause you'll need it anyway oh and do your registry during the nd trimester that's when you'll be most comfortable and have the most energy the first trimester symptoms will be gone and you'll feel pretty normal except for having to eat every freaking hours rd trimester you won't want to do anything 'cause you'll be tired have you started taking a prenatal vitamin my prenatal vitamin doesn't have enough calcium so i take a tums supplement as for eating eat healthy stay away from caffenine even chocolate and raw foods limit your eating of cooked fish especially salmon 'cause of the mercury content everyone i know has a graco stroller you obviously don't have to get that one but if you do the graco quattro style is like an suv sturdy but heavy try the graco metrolite instead both my mom friends complained about how heavy their graco strollers are and recommended that i i'm at weeks get a lighter stroller so i got the metrolite they complained about how hard it was to lift it into their car 'cause the quattro was heavy good luck Pregnancy Breastfeeding Obstetrics Guinea pig Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin C Veganism Folic acid Abortion debate Miscarriage Anorexia nervosa Coeliac disease EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psoriasis Social rule Childbirth Fecal incontinence Milk Melanie Wilkes The Amazing Race Prenatal diagnosis Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nutrition Gastroesophageal reflux disease Prostate cancer Elephant The Apprentice 2 Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
