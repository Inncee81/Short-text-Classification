how do you tell your boyfriend that it wont hurt the baby to have sex while i'm pregnant i told him a few days ago that i was pregnant and ever since he's been treating me like i'm made of glass yesterday he wouldn't even let me carry my glass of water to the living room because he didn't want me to strain myself i've told him several times that i'm ok i can still cook i can still work i can still take a shower without him checking in on me every five minutes to make sure i haven't fallen but he's still too ever protective last night i was in the mood and i really wanted something but he once again told me that he 'didn't want me to strain myself' and i went to sleep disapointed is there anything i can do to clam him down my hubby was like that it was nice at first but then it got to be annoying i mean we are pregnant women we are not sick or dying lol i hubby attended the doctor's appointments and it helped he got to ask questions and i got to ask the ones about things i could and couldn't do this way he heard from the doctor that it was safe for me to carry my dishes to the sink enjoy it though until it drives you crazy the second time around has been a lot less worried congrats and good luck EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Ocean's Twelve Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Little Britain Sharon Tate Charmed The Catcher in the Rye The Contender (television series) The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Eddie Guerrero Haven (TNG episode) The Star Wars Holiday Special Jam (TV series) Friends Social rule Something Positive The Apprentice 2 The Death Gate Cycle Phoebe Halliwell George Costanza Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sin City StarCraft: Uprising Pitaten Theory of conduct Neighbours Make money fast Kodocha The Smoking Room Blood on the Tracks One Piece minor characters Characters of Lost Married... with Children Ben Johnson (athlete) Time Out of Mind Boston Public Futurama (TV series - season 5) Singlish W.I.T.C.H.
