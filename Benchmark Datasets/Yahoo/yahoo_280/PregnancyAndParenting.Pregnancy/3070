do you think some celebrities fake their pregnancies a week ago i was watching that new show on lifetime side order of life on this episode there was a celebrity type person who had faked her pregnancy it was her kid but she had a surrogate carry the baby so she wouldn t have to ruin her figure when the main character opened her closet she saw a bunch of fake bellies for weeks for weeks etc my question is do you guys think women in hollywood do this how would we know if they really did carry the baby or not and isn t it a little strange that some of them have a baby today and tomorrow their bodies are intact like nothing ever happened how many of you would have a surrogate if you could afford it i used to play around when i was younger and say that if i could i would have one so that i wouldn t have to put my body through it but now that i am pregnant i feel that thinking like that is a little selfish what are your opinions i really don't care either way if they fake it or not i am just curious to see what others think i think media and the craze for it is too strong for the paparazzi not to find out about it i know that celebrities will make themselves look farther along than they are to throw media off on their due date this way the media will get bored of following them every day and back off and then the woman can relax her last few days and have the baby Friends EastEnders Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Neighbours The Inside Pregnancy fetishism Survivor (novel) Sex and the City Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Time Out of Mind Charmed Obstetrics Abortion in the United States Sharon Tate Laura Schlessinger Breastfeeding The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sesame Street Kodocha Miscarriage Britney Spears Childbirth Shaggy dog story Stewie Griffin Jeopardy!
