is it normal to feel faintish or very dizzy when pregnant i don't feel sick in the morning at all but i do feel the first signs of fainting in the afternoon i used to faint a lot as a child and i know when im about to faint i never actually end up fainting though just wanted to see if this is normal or if this is the morning sickness that im going through normal but dangerous i had fainting episodes during pregnancy especially in the shower that i learned to avoid by paying attention to my body and sitting directly on my rear when i felt the signs you want a cracked head no well then endure the embarrassment of sitting down very quickly even if there isn't a chair nothing wrong with the floor as long as you're not smacking into it but yeah this is normal and it will probably pass pretty quickly Pregnancy Sento Milton H.
