please help i had my c section weeks and days ago for a few days after i got hom from the hospital i was pretty sore then after that i felt great i wasnt sore at all then a few days ago i started feeling very sore on the left side of my incision i called my doctor the day it started hurting but she could not see me that day because she was going to be in surgery i have an appt for monday and i was wanting to know if anyone else has had the happen to them the doctor said if it was an infection i would have more sytpoms than just some pain it only hurts when i stand up or turn over on my side she told me that it could be from the left side of my incision being tighter than the othe and when i started being more active it could have pulled some she said there is a shot she can give me in my incision to losen it up has anyone ever had this someone please answer it would make me feel so much better if i knew that someone has went trough this before hi i went through it and then some when i had my firstborn via c section i started feeling pains in the left side of my incision and a burning sensation i am overweight and the doctor who opened me up did it below my panis aka fat roll it was burning and feeling painful by the third day post delivery and everyone ignored it it was especially bad because i had all this done in an asian country where there was no ac in the building and the room was very hot so the heat was the main culprit anyhow it was the worst possible infection but we didn't know about it until seven days post partum when i was at home i got up from a chair and felt fluid pour out of my abdomen it was quite scary we called the hospital and i had to be readmitted for two weeks they had to remove the stitches which cut me open again and then restitch more stitches it was a total mess and because i was having to take such stron anti biotics to kill the infection i could not breastfeed properly it was a very dangerous and even life threatening infection but just one of those things that can happen in rare cases in your situation i would think if it was infection you would have known it extremely early on you have already gone through weeks but i suppose it could be possible but your symptoms would most likely be some odd discharge from the wound itself along with fever it could also be that your stitches opened a little bit this can happen if it did then you would definitely know it right away and would feel ill in that case i would head straight to the er and not wait for your surgeon to deal with it i have this feeling that you are just fine and it is normal to experience some discomfort in incison sites it can exist for a few months even i would only be concerned and consider it urgent if there is a discharge severe pain bleeding or feverish ill feelings i don't want to scare you but think it is important for you to understand possibilities and what to do if it gets worse and as i mentioned before what happened to me is extremely rare and any good surgeon would have known to do a vertical incision on a woman with a big tummy to prevent infection you should be fine but do not lift anything heavy and try to rest a little more just to be cautious avoid running or any exercises that put pressure on your abs for a while until you know everything is ok it is so important especially when you have a baby to care for perhaps the incisions have to be adjusted in some way i wouldn't worry and the doctor most likely knows what they are doing since the surgeon is making you wait until monday i think it is fine and nothing that will be too scary i had my second c section months ago and have recovered wonderfully with no infection it was the easiest delivery Prostate cancer Childbirth Stomach cancer First aid Chronic fatigue syndrome Equine conformation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Babe Ruth Traumatic brain injury Ebola Milton H.
