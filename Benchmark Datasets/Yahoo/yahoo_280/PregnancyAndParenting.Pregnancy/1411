i had a miscarriage months ago and i never told the father should i now after time passed i was with a guy and i got pregnant i told him i thought i was and he freaked out he told me that the thought of me being pregnant with his baby made him sick since he wasnt ready at the age of to be a father well i told him i went to the doctor and had blood work done and it came back negative so he wouldnt continue to freak out when in all actually i was almost months pregnant it ended in miscarriage its been months since it happend should i tell him the truth a lot of time has passed and hopefully enough time for you to make your peace with your miscarriage the most important thing for you to remember is that the good news is that you can become pregnant and when you're ready to have a child it'll all work out many women unfortunately have had miscarriages before carrying a child to term now about your question i think you should tell him when you can if for no other reason than to get it off your chest and out into the open you'll feel like a burden has been lifted off your shoulders i assume you're no longer with him well i hope not but he should know that there are consequences and that he was part of something and didn't act like a real man would isn't that young to be a father good people good men rise to the occasion when there's a new situation he wasn't one of them so good riddance i guess also if you don't mind me saying this you protected him from the truth while you were months pregnant that doesn't say much for him in that he can't really deal with teh realities of life at years old please look at your contraception choices so it doesn't happen again ok good luck Pregnancy Theory of conduct Miscarriage Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Humphrey Bogart Pitaten EastEnders Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Friends The Inside Incarnations of Immortality Kodocha Philosophical skepticism Characters of Lost Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Utilitarianism Knots Landing StarCraft: Uprising The Ashlee Simpson Show Abortion in the United States Alois Hitler Piccolo Junior Saga Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion Sharon Tate Jon Secada The Shining (film) The Death Gate Cycle Agnosticism Sex and the City Haven (TNG episode) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Charmed Gender role Reservoir Dogs Wonderland (McFly album) Slow Train Coming Coming of Age (TNG episode) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword About a Boy The Smoking Room Bernard Williams Summa Theologiae Dorothy L.
