pills pregnant gr me and my husband already have two kids but we decided to take a break from having kids for about a year or two the little ones were back to back by the way so i started taking tricyclen lo and i've been on it for about months i really messed up my pills bad and continued having unprotected sex without him pulling out have to say we've never done that and now i am experiencing pregnancy symptoms but at the same time i got some spotting i have read on the internet and mommy websites that when you are on the pill and even if you get pregnant it is normal for you to still have some bleeding am i possibly pregnant and just bleeding or what i'm tired moody and morning sickness is awful right now all the usual symptoms if you get off track with the pill you are likely to have spotting periods throughout the month however since you've also been having unprotected sex there's a very strong chance you are pregnant take a test it's most likely been long enough to get an accurate reading even if you miss pill or are taking it at different times during the day you can absolutely get pregnant it's very common Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Neighbours Obstetrics Psoriasis Miscarriage Emergency contraception Gonorrhoea Tocopherol Apollo 8 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ovarian cancer Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Knots Landing Pelvic inflammatory disease Urinary incontinence Turner syndrome Breastfeeding Folic acid AIDS Birth control Abortion Coeliac disease Anemia Social rule Guinea pig Anal sex Morning sickness Migraine Prolactinoma Boston Public Autism Public-key cryptography Malaria Vitamin C Ectopic pregnancy Diabetic retinopathy Multiple sclerosis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Endometrial cancer Radiation poisoning Prostate cancer Coffee Sexual revolution Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS First aid Friends Vernon Schillinger Poker jargon Childbirth Acne Stomach cancer Stroke Cleveland Browns Professional wrestling slang Saved by the Bell Days of our Lives Alanis Morissette Depo Provera 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Human adaptation to space Infertility Trainspotting (novel) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Infantilism Big Brother UK series 6 Great Teacher Onizuka Beavis and Butt-head Maprotiline One Tree Hill (TV series) Pregnancy test Thalidomide Indianapolis 500 Premature birth Hypoglycemia Prenatal diagnosis Sexual intercourse Lactose intolerance The Contender (television series) Polycystic ovary syndrome Hypertension Progesterone only pill Kevin and Kell Conker's Bad Fur Day Spina bifida Ovarian cyst Schizophrenia The Jam Snooker Jam (TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cytomegalovirus
