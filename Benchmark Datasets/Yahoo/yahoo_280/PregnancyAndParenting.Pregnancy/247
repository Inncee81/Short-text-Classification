why doesn't my doctor check my cervix i am weeks pregnant in most everything you read it says your doc will start at weeks or so well my doc doesn't want to it makes me feel like he thinks i am gross or something i am sure there is a great reason but i am too shy to ask him does anyone else have this problem thank him props to your doctor for the hands off policy there is barring complications no point why anybody wants to be 'checked ' i have no idea many people try to use the information that is gathered from a vaginal exam to predict things like when labor will begin or if the baby will fit through the pelvis a vaginal exam simply cannot measure these things okay so there's not really a great reason to have a vaginal in exam done routinely for most women so are there any reasons not to have vaginal exams there sure are vaginal exams can increase the risks of infection even when done carefully and with sterile gloves etc it pushes the normal bacteria found in the vagina upwards towards the cervix there is also increased risk of rupturing the membranes some practitioners routinely do what is called stripping the membranes which simply separates the bag of waters from the cervix the thought behind this is that it will stimulate the production of prostaglandins to help labor begin and irritate the cervix causing it to contract this has not been shown to necessarily be effective and does have the aforementioned risks http pregnancy about com cs interventions a vaginalexam htm Childbirth Abortion Breech birth Premature birth Obstetrics Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Vagina Strap-on dildo Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Cervix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Intact dilation and extraction Cervical cancer Sexual intercourse Condom Fisting Pregnancy Gynaecology Anal sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical analysis of circumcision Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fertility awareness Diethylstilbestrol Oral contraceptive Herpes simplex virus Caesarean section Safe sex Intravenous therapy In vitro fertilisation Ectopic pregnancy Human sexual behavior Cancer Birth control Psoriasis Candidiasis Inflation Orgasm Turner syndrome Intersex surgery Female genital cutting Coeliac disease Ovarian cancer Cytomegalovirus Fecal incontinence Placenta praevia AIDS Prolactinoma Abortion debate Douche Endometriosis Action potential Dialysis Keynesian economics Epidural Traumatic brain injury Insulin Vaginal bleeding Microeconomics Prenatal diagnosis Infertility HIV Traditional Chinese medicine Wound healing phases Colorectal cancer Body piercing Dyspareunia Paracetamol Multiple sclerosis Sexual reproduction Puberty Economics Abortion in the United States History of intersex surgery Nutrition Hypertension Folic acid Twin Capitalism Epilepsy Methamphetamine Human sexual response cycle Child sexual abuse Weight training HIV test Electrophysiology
