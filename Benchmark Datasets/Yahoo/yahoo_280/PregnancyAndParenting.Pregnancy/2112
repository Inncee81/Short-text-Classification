what do i do now my last period was on june th for about days so its been a while since ive had one since today is august th and i have no signs of it coming soon i took a pregnancy test a few days ago and i'm going to buy another one this afternoon and do it in the morning what do i do if it is still negative is there anything to be worried about with my period being non existant for this long my partner and i have just recently decided to try for a baby and this is the first month that i could be pregnant and now its all so confusing first relax you may be pregnant but you may not sometimes our body's play tricks on us it's not uncommon for a woman to miss her period at any given time this can be from stress or changes that our body's make sometimes the stress from trying to time your ovulation and the right times to have intercourse are just enough to make us miss a period or two sometimes your mind even tricks your body into thinking it can be pregnant you didn't mention if you were on birth control before if you were sometimes you cycle goes a little wacky for a few months when you come off of it because your body has to regulate itself again wait a few days and then re test if the test still comes out negative call you doctor and set up an appointment for a check up explain your concerns and your hopes of having a baby they can give you some helpful advice and get you started on your pre natals good luck and have fun this is an important first step into parenthood so enjoy it because before you know it those test will be positive Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Infantilism Birth control Oral contraceptive Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Ovulation Emergency contraception Sexual intercourse Condom Folic acid Pregnancy test Neighbours Childbirth Sharon Tate Insomnia EastEnders Roe v.
