weeks pregnant at my appointment yesterday my doctor did a pap smear then when he went to listen to the heartbeat he said the baby was not cooperating so we didn't hear it we heard the heartbeat two weeks ago at my last appointment he told me not to worry that i did not miscarry i am guessing that when doing a pap he could tell my cervix looked good he scheduled an ultra sound for when i am weeks this will be my second baby and i don't remember ever not hearing the heartbeat any one ever been through this i am trying to be optimistic cause my doctor told me not to worry but its hard do you think maybe the baby was just moving around and he couldn't find it with the doppler i also think i have been feeling fetal movement and did feel it last night should i be worried or should i just act like normal and wait till sept for the ultrasound i had an appointment last monday and am weeks as well before my dr even started the doppler she told me the there is a chance that the baby is hiding and we would not hear the heart beat and not to worry we did hear it but i bet your little one was just hiding good luck and trust your dr Miscarriage Breech birth Obstetrics EastEnders Pregnancy Jon Secada Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intact dilation and extraction I Want to Hold Your Hand Childbirth The Contender (television series) Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story The Inside Piccolo Junior Saga The Curse of Fenric Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cliff Richard Major League Baseball television contracts The Shining (film) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Time Out of Mind Singlish Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Medical ultrasonography Neighbours Heartbeat (television) Poker jargon AFI 100 Years series She Loves You Night (book) The 4400 Phoebe Halliwell Pitaten Le Malade imaginaire Hall & Oates Van Morrison Plame affair The Jazz Singer Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Hey Jude Fetal development Sharon Tate Rod Stewart The Star Wars Holiday Special Humphrey Bogart Ocean's Twelve Sydney Riot of 1879 Blood on the Tracks Heart Journey (band) Extreme Championship Wrestling Doppler effect Urinary incontinence Coronation Street Mary Wells Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters One Tree Hill (TV series) Leo Wyatt Wheel of Fortune Infidels Empire Burlesque Abortion The Family from One End Street Gynaecology The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Futurama (TV series - season 5) Leeds United F.C.
