when did you stop going to the gym while pregnant i'm weeks pregnant and i'm still going to the gym times per week i do about minutes cardio on the cross trainer and treadmill and i also do weights a couple time per week after my workout this morning my tummy was really sore like i pulled a muscle so i have decided to give the gym up and maybe just go for walks anyway i'm just curious to see when all of you gave up the gym and when did you start back again when you get to weeks i would suggest only going times a week and leave out the weights you know your body so if you feel tired then you need to stop what your doing since your pregnant you can't push yourself like you normaly would but going to the gym is fine throughout your whole pregnancy but if you feel tired or get a headache then you need to either slow down or call it a day remember times a week is good is way to many times to go to the gym when your far along in your pregnancy don't take chances with your health so to answer your question you can go to the gym up until you give birth after you have the baby you should wait weeks before you go back to the gym your body needs time to heal you may feel really good and want to go to the gym but it's your insides that need to heal properly you don't want to do any damage to yourself so just because you feel good doesn't mean your body is ready to put strain on itself weeks is the minimum time you should wait if you can hold off until that is better Pregnancy The Contender (television series) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bodybuilding Friends EastEnders Breech birth Folic acid Fecal incontinence Knots Landing Coeliac disease Abortion debate Prostate cancer Premature birth Guinea pig Psoriasis Fertility awareness Futurama (TV series - season 5) Swingout Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling holds Marathon (sport) Kodocha Pok__mon Live!
