induced labor i am w d at my appointment today he said my cervix was soft but i am not dilated at all he said he expects to see me next week to talk about an appointment for induction a few days afterward i have heard that when a woman is induced the contractions are alot more painful than if she goes into labor naturally is this true my baby boy has pyilectisis which is the reason for inducing a few days after my due date he said it would be better for the baby so his pediatrician can follow up on the problem i would suggest you don't induce when you let it come naturely the contractions come on slower and less intense allowing you to work up induction they come on hard and extremely intense also if you induce labor they usually make you stay in bed so your not alowed to move around or walk which helps with labor p s i've had three children first two were an induction and the next natural Childbirth Abortion Pregnancy Premature birth Miscarriage Breastfeeding Obstetrics Cervix Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Milton H.
