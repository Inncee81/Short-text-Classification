tired of hearing criticism about my wanting to get pregnant i have an iud but i can't stop the urge my mom told me to get an iud when hubby and i first got married i've now had it for two years in oct and want a baby very badly at times i want to wait until i finish school but i can't control the urge that is making me want to concieve the mom criticizes me about it and even mocked me the other day oh why dont you just take it out and get pregnant then she doesn't understand a lot of people my age with kids don't understand because they already have babies i don't think they understand what it feels like to ignore that urge and then mom has the nerve to mock me she said it's annoying how i always talk about wanting to concieve hello i'm in my most fertile time right now hormones do a lot i don't know what to do i don't know how to explain it to her to make her give me a break and i try to avoid the topic but my little sister is pregnant with her second baby and it comes up a lot this is so frustrating ok to the people who are calling me childish you obviously haven't waited or else you would understand how it feels if you don't have anything nice to say then go to another question listen i made it clear that i try to avoid the topic with my mom but it comes up because my sister is pregnant i didn't say i bring it up it comes up to all who are saying this and that being critical and trying to use 'tough love' don't bother i get that a lot already i'm not being childish i'm trying to fight a hormonal urge i want to stop the urge not run off and get pregnant i want the urge to go away everyone is different just because you never had a strong nagging urge doesn't mean i don't no one person is alike so lay off and give me a break and to the person saying that i'm 'stealing my sister's thunder' how do you get that from me trying to fight a hormonal urge i'm not jealous of her you need to know the whole situation before making personal attacks and judgments i understand exactly how you are feeling stop talking about it it will be hard i know wait until you are out of school talk to your hubby talk to your dr set a game plan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Pitaten Rent (musical) Kodocha Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Pok__mon Live!
