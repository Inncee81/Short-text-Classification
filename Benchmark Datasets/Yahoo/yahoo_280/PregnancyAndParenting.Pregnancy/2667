how do i counting pregnancy weeks we all know that they start to count the pregnancy from the first day of your last period that means that weeks are added on before the baby was even conceived well i didn't know when my last period was and my baby was dated by ultrasound at weeks does this mean that other people who actually conceived at the same time as me are saying they are weeks further along because they count from their last period the weeks have the weeks included the reason they do this is because not everyone ovulates on the same day after their period it actually depends on your cycle you usually ovulate days before your period begins so if you use a days cycle then you ovulate usually on your th day after your period starts if you have day cycle normally then you probably ovulate days after your period begins and days before the next one not to mention ultrasound is not an exact science just like using your period isn't this gives you a rough date for your due date remember a woman is considered full term after weeks and can go as long as weeks and no matter any date you or your doctor says your baby and your body have minds of their own congrats and good luck charm actually a baby is considered full term after weeks not weeks meaning the baby is developed enough to live outside the womb Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Niddah Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Ovarian cyst Maya calendar Abortion debate Roman calendar Ovulation Twin Abortion Polycystic ovary syndrome Hebrew calendar Obstetrics Estrus cycle Computus Julian day Prenatal care Emergency contraception Intact dilation and extraction Spina bifida Breech birth Childbirth Infertility Breastfeeding Sexual reproduction Urinary incontinence Gynaecology Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal diagnosis Person Gregorian calendar Multiple birth Liturgical year Partial-birth abortion Year Sexual abstinence Progesterone Pregnancy fetishism Premature birth Birth weight Artificial womb Season Ovary Full moon cycle Sadako Yamamura Month ISO 8601 Cephalic disorder Timekeeping on Mars Pregnancy test Numerology Anencephaly Ultrasound Abortion in the United States Virgin Mary in Islam Congenital disorder Entropy Social rule Time Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Charmed Elections in the United Kingdom Solar eclipse Religion and abortion Tide Ovarian cancer Stroke Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends HIV test Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Gonorrhoea Calendar Ontological argument Jewish holiday Flowering plant Embryo transfer Guinea pig Human sexual behavior Left-handed Infantilism Fruit Sothic cycle Premenstrual stress syndrome Sharon Tate Chinese calendar Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Mary, the mother of Jesus Extreme Programming Female reproductive system (human)
