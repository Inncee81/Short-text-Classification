danger zone i am weeks and day pregnant am i out of the dangerzone for miscarriage or do you have to wait until weeks to be safe also has anyone had a miscarriage at weeks without knowing and then they find out when they are due for a scan i am afraid this might happen to me when i go for my next scan i did have a scan at weeks and everything looked good and babys heart beat was bpm do you think everything will be ok i am just really scared because i have miscarried beforeand i dont want to loose another baby when i miscarried i was weeks along but i had bleeding so i knew somthing was wrong i have read that weeks is the general end of the danger zone if you are waiting to tell people about the pregnancy then i would wait until your next scan since you are so nervous about it but if you have already shared the news with others and it is just your own nerves that are bothering you then i have other advice if you have no reason to suspect that something is wrong then relax you can't change anything now if something has happened so relax in the knowledge that you have gone the full weeks without any danger signals relax and wait for the scan to see what happens if it is bad then you will have time then to deal with your feelings chances are really high really really high that you are fine try to focus on that in the meantime good luck girl i hope that you soon have a big wonderful belly and will be feeling the wonderful kicking that will come soon enough mommie of one month old and have had two very early miscarriages since also ttc Miscarriage Pregnancy EastEnders Poker jargon Twin Jon Secada Neighbours Abortion Jam (TV series) Urinary incontinence Social rule Blood on the Tracks Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Contender (television series) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rod Stewart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Conspiracy (TNG episode) Stroke Abortion debate Birth control Days of our Lives Miscarriage of justice Avenue Q The Inside Shaggy dog story Morning sickness Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Atomic Kitten Jennifer Lopez Menstrual cycle Marilyn Monroe Lucille Ball Cliff Richard Sex and the City Glen Jacobs Anne Boleyn The Death Gate Cycle Radiohead Spina bifida Nuclear fallout Coming of Age (TNG episode) Schapelle Corby Coeliac disease Ted Kennedy Time Out of Mind Computed tomography Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Anxiety Pregnancy fetishism Intact dilation and extraction Angel One (TNG episode) Heretics of Dune Magnetic resonance imaging Charmed Father's Day (Doctor Who) Oasis (band) Sharon Tate Shot of Love Boston Public Dinah Marler Grumpy's Three Wishes Scenes from a Memory Avalanche Pitaten Alex Ferguson Care Bears Caffeine Prolactinoma Premature birth Fertility awareness Canterbury Bulldogs Angel (vampire) Combat stress reaction Jean Grey Prenatal care Killian documents John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Breech birth Montreal Screwjob Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hall & Oates Pregnancy test Professional wrestling slang Big Brother (USA TV series) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Human sexual behavior Stomach cancer Crossing Jordan One Tree Hill (TV series) Prenatal diagnosis One Life to Live 2000 Australian Grand Prix
