iud problems i have an iud and have had it for about months now my period is really wacky until last month i got my period days after my last one and i've been feeling pregnant when i got my iud my doctor didnt check if i was pregnant so anything is possible but i would be showing by now but i had unprotected sex about weeks ago and i think i might be pregnant should i wait til my next period from what i understand on how an iud works it doesn't prevent sperm from reaching the egg all it does is prevent implantation some forms also have birth control imbedded in them for slow release to prevent you from ovulating that said there are some instances of women becoming pregnant inspite of an iud if you think you are pregnant from something that happened weeks ago a stick test would be positive by now so go get a test and if it's positive you need to get in to the doctor so that you can have that iud removed before it causes complications for the baby Pregnancy Emergency contraception Intrauterine device Birth control Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal diagnosis Urinary incontinence Pelvic inflammatory disease Obstetrics Pregnancy test Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Gonorrhoea Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coeliac disease Psoriasis Endometriosis EastEnders Cytomegalovirus Sexual reproduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Spina bifida Childbirth Fecal incontinence Friends Puberty Twin Human cloning Sex and the City Ovulation Fertilisation Jam (TV series) Pornographic movie Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Breastfeeding Malaria Breech birth Premature birth Medicare (Canada) Stomach cancer Dalkon Shield Ovary AIDS Niddah Neighbours Fetal development Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart Sexual revolution Prolactinoma Tupac Shakur Sexual intercourse Ocean's Twelve Melanie Wilkes Medicine Multiple birth Menstrual cup Hall & Oates Extreme Programming Traumatic brain injury Drawn Together Diabetic retinopathy Scientology beliefs and practices Adjustable gastric band Apollo 8 Kodocha Drug test Jennifer Lopez Sea Otter Charmed StarCraft: Uprising Sex assignment HIV test Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain George Costanza Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Mystique (comics) Ovum Characters of Lost Days of our Lives Janet Jackson Female reproductive system (human) One Life to Live Gender-neutral language One (Voyager episode) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Acne Boston Public Tocopherol
