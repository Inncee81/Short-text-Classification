pregnant and on a hour flight i would like to know up to how far in pregnancy will airliners allow you on a flight of hours i read somewhere that its days but i am not sure i might have to fly at months do you think this will be allowed please help the only reason you would not be able to fly is because you could go into labor not from being on the plane but from being that far along different airlines have different rules about how far along you can be while pregnant and fly on their planes check into that you may only require a note from your doctor Pregnancy Airline Eastern Air Lines Air traffic control Pilot certification in the United States Airplane!
