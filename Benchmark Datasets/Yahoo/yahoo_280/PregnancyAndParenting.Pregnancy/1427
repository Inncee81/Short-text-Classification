married and he was looking up some girls phone ok so we have been married a month i'm pregnant and he is a good husband came home from work and he was drunk not a usual thing and cleaning the house also not usual lol i went to close out the windows on his computer and i saw a yellow pages page looking for this girl in the town next to ours i don't know who she is i asked him he ignored me x but was half a sleep and drunk finally i said answer me before you piss me off the first times were nice sweetie who is soandso when he finally answered he said irritated a friend then back to sleep ok i stopped looking up old boyfriends long before we got married wtf i try not to get jealous it could be a friend of a friend trying to find out about an old guy friend for all i know but it pisses me off your opinions thanks ask him when he is sober if he still acts the same way then maybe there is something questionable going on it seems like you're at the beginning still of your relationship and i would think this especially since your preggy is a bit early on to start thinking of other girls how far into your pregnancy are you i don't want to get all he's cheating break up with him because it very well may not be this but you did say that both behaviors of being drunk and cleaning are unusual these things can indicate a guilty conscience of course the guilt could be that he forgot to do something you asked him to do or even that he feels inadequate for you because he wants to do more for you and he can't he maybe feel sad that he can't make you as comfy as you'd like to be during your pregnancy i mean men and women really do any number of things for any number of reasons like i said ask him when he is sober but do not attack him men and most people don't respond well to being attacked and in fact that only provokes them in the wrong direction just ask him he may not remember depending on how drunk he was he may get embarassed maybe he wasn't thinknig straight under the alcoholic influence and did something totally out of his norm i am not giving excuses just being real if this keeps happening or if you find hard proof of cheating then i would say that it is time to take things a step further counseling or temporary seperation depending on the severity of the issue don't freak out too much for a first offense unless he is downright cheating but even then keep your head and be the one in the right my theory is always be the better person two wrongs never make any right i'll be praying for you and best wishes and congratulations on your baby Friends Knots Landing Social rule EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Abortion debate Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Alcoholics Anonymous Human sexual behavior Piccolo Junior Saga Mojave people Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Days of our Lives George Costanza Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sex and the City Plame affair Boston Public Milton H.
