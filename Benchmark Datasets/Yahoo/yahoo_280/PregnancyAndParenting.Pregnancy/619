okay i am getting some understanding about blighted ovum okay in past couple questions i've been worried about my sister and her blighted ovum but now we have having some more problems well the day that she went and found out that she had a blighted ovum she went to the doctor and she saw the baby and the doctor said the baby was low then the doctor sent her to another doctors office but there they told her the baby wasn't there this all happened in the same day do you think that they could have got her confused with another person that's pregnant because my sister is huge she is getting so big day by day but there really is someone with the same name as my sister who is pregnant i would go through a different doctor and get another opinion generally they can tell looking at the us pics if there is a baby there or not also if it is a blighted ovum she shouldn't really be showing at all since there wouldn't be a baby growing there also the us machine in a doctor's office usually isn't as sophisticated as the ones in the hospitals so they'll get a clearer picture at the hospital either way she should get that second opinion to find out exactly whats going on before they decided to push her into a d c to clean out the blighted ovum Miscarriage Theory of conduct Friends Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Days of our Lives Phoebe Halliwell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Neighbours History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Knots Landing In vitro fertilisation Milton H.
