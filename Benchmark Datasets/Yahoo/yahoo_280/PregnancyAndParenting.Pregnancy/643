mucus plug i am weeks and i have had a light pink kinda watery kinda mucus like discharge i have also been having braxton hicks contractions is this my mucus plug because every woman and in fact every pregnancy is different i would suggest getting medical advice on your situation just to be safe being this close to your due date it's better if you can skip on taking any chances or second guessing any questions you have not sure if you've been for an interview at the hospital mat ward where you'll be delivering but calling them is probably going to be your best bet they have nurses on hand who work specifically with pregnancy and delivery related situations they'll be able to give you the best advice possible just call the hospital switchboard and they can transfer you to the mat desk in my case the discharge started when i was days away from my due date at that point i had already been dilated cm for weeks or so and was pretty much right on schedule i'd also had b hs contractions quite a bit during my rd trimester and they had gotten a bit stronger when all this took place i recall the discharge lasted a day and i found a large blob the next morning in the bathroom after i'd woken up labour started that night hours after i'd lost the plug i have heard that delivering before weeks can be a bit risky so as i've said i would check it out as soon as you can best of luck to you i wish you your baby and your family happiness god bless Pregnancy Childbirth Obstetrics Breastfeeding Abortion Abortion debate EastEnders Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Breech birth Fertility awareness Roe v.
