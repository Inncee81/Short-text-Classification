preg test line was very light could i stil be preg the preg test i took at home was a cheap one and i dont know if i should go byw aht it says at first there was no line and then after like minutes a faint line appeared and nowe the line got a little darker a few hours later someone told me that the line will get darker the longer it sits i think i am preg but could a test say positive and end up being wrong usually the instructions say that any line appearing after minutes should not count and definitely not a few hours later i've heard of many tests that are negative when you are pg but i've never heard of getting a pos test when you're not pg unless you're on certain hormone meds if i were you i'd buy another test otherwise call your doctor and ask for a blood test to be done that would be the most accurate good luck Prostate cancer Sleep apnea Chronic fatigue syndrome Triage HIV test Oscilloscope Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Ben Johnson (athlete) Blood type Blood pressure Craps Normal distribution Growth hormone treatment Thyroid Paget's disease of bone Blood on the Tracks Drug test Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Myocardial infarction Digital photography Gamma ray burst Blake's 7 Pneumonia SAT Diabetes mellitus Acne Obstetrics Malaria First aid Pitaten Sleep Liquid crystal display Nutrition Obi-Wan Kenobi Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Medicine Fertility awareness Education in Germany Prenatal diagnosis Professional wrestling throws Tour de France Urinary incontinence Final Fantasy XI Hannibal Lecter Graduate school False negative Halitosis Automated analyser History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Epilepsy Marathon (sport) Gemini 9A Speed of light Blood plasma In vitro fertilisation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insulin resistance Gross domestic product False positive It's All Gone Pete Tong Dialysis Hubble Space Telescope Endocrinology Lupus erythematosus United Airlines Flight 93 Kidney James H.
