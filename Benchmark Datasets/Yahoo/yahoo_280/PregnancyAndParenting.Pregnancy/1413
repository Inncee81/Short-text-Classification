when did you first feel the baby move this is my second pregnancy i know it is common to feel movement earlier than you did in the first pregnancy just wondering how early you felt it with my first pregnancy i believe it was around my fifth month i could just barely feel flutters and light kicks around the end of my fourth when i was pregnant with my twins it seems like they started moving at four months but maybe it was just me with my third pregnancy i detected movement at the end of my fourth month it pretty much varies but i have also heard that you can feel movement sooner with each subsequent pregnancy Pregnancy Miscarriage Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Abortion debate Cephalic disorder Friends Breastfeeding Knots Landing Spina bifida Pregnancy test Cytomegalovirus EastEnders Twin Breech birth Childbirth Kate Vaiden Pro-choice Pregnancy fetishism Obstetrics Bernice Summerfield History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Ectopic pregnancy Front crawl Roe v.
