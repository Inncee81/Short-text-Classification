um do u know how many days after conception can u take a home preggers test and find out if u r and are the cheap ones as accurate as the expensive ones well you can try taking it up to days before your missed period but while a lot of hpts make this claim usually that's only accurate in an ideal lab setting a day after conception most women have about hcg ml in their urine by day of the conception a woman might have hcg ml in her system making the most sensitive tests accurate but this is not not true for all women as hcg levels vary from person to person and pregnancy to pregnancy anytime after your missed period will grant you accuracy i found a website that tells exactly what level of hcg each hpt measures and surprisingly the cheapest ones out there are some of the best on the market i'll give you the link but it does say that the baby test from the dollar store measures hcg ml that's the best there is i think the reason it's so cheap is because you have to provide your own cup for the urine and it comes with a dropper instead of the fancy sticks in other packages so you can choose which test would be best for you http www fertilityplus org faq hpt html well good luck and i hope you get what you want Pregnancy Human chorionic gonadotropin Pregnancy test Menstrual cycle Drug test HIV test Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Cytomegalovirus Miscarriage Fertility awareness Dairy Oral contraceptive Redundant array of independent disks Cross site scripting Prostate cancer HTTP cookie Oscilloscope Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Blood alcohol content Explosive material Social rule PE ratio EastEnders Urinalysis Common Unix Printing System Uniform Resource Locator Abortion Infantilism Abortion debate Audiophile Digital photography Central processing unit Hypoglycemia Gmail Microeconomics Surveillance PID controller Gravity Mozilla Application Suite Mental retardation Analog-to-digital converter Progesterone Insulin Aortic dissection ELO rating system Quicksort Human sexual behavior Domain Name System Factor analysis Craps Web analytics Expert system Loudspeaker Japanese toilet Mach kernel Endometriosis In vitro fertilisation Diabetes mellitus World Wide Web Handloading CIE 1931 color space CPU cache Glucose meter Unicode and HTML IBM PC compatible Maya calendar Prolactinoma Normal distribution Hamster Unix In The Groove (game) DrumMania Ovarian cyst Geographic information system Theory of conduct Bicycle lighting Geodesy Equivalence principle Adoption Abortion in the United States Capitalism MAME Hydrogen economy Prothrombin time USB flash drive Model (economics) Software testing Intelligence quotient Supply and demand RISC Radiocarbon dating Password Electrophysiology Vitamin C Human height English cricket team Neopets Literacy
