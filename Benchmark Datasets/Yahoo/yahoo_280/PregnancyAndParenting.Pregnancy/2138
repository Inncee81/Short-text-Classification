m c in june ttc again w questions i had a m c in june we are trying again now any knowledge on if you ovulate differently in the first few months after a miscarraige ive heard that you may be more fertile also i had what seemed to be two periods last month one on the nd and one on the st each lasting only around days would i count the start of this cycle by the first as it may have just been a long one or by the second thanks for any info also if you did conceive in a few months following a miscarraige were your symptoms the same as the first go around i'm so sorry i too miscarried my baby recently my heart goes out to you wow it seems like the recommendations are all over the place i've heard that you can start right away i've heard that you should wait cycle i've heard that you should wait cycles who knows for sure i think the biggest this is to make sure that your body mind and soul are on the road to recovery after m c you're likely anemic which can affect fertility for instance after m c you are on an emotional hellish roller coaster stress can inhibit conception the soul when will the soul recover maybe never but maybe that's ok my ob gyn's office told me that i should avoid sex right now because the cervix is more open this can potentially cause uterine infection that's probably not the case for you i have an appt scheduled in a couple of weeks and assuming that things seem ok cervix closure uterine size i'll be cleared to ttc immediately it may be that your hormones are still too imbalanced hence the multiple pds last month for you to get pregnant right now maybe charting your basal body temp will help you figure out your cycles and keep in touch with your ob gyn office if your cycles don't self regulate w in say months regarding pregnancy symptoms they can always be different i don't know of any link between m c and a certain set of pregnancy symptoms when i was pregnant with my daughter now a healthy year old i didn't have morning sickness supposedly if you have morning sickness things are going well well i was very queasy with this pregnancy but i lost the baby again i am so sorry for your loss if you can bear it please share your m c story at http www mothering com discussions showthread php t we're never told what to expect with m c or especially what happens after m c i wish you a healthy and happy pregnancy very soon Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Miscarriage Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Infertility Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Premature birth Abortion Cytomegalovirus Anemia Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Twin Neighbours Gonorrhoea Birth control Cancer EastEnders Prostate cancer Estrus cycle Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Endometriosis Turner syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Spina bifida Clinical depression Breech birth Sexual abstinence Morning sickness Autism Coeliac disease Psoriasis Infantilism Cervix Herpes simplex virus Guinea pig HIV Sexual intercourse AIDS Glucocorticoid Chronic fatigue syndrome Progesterone Multiple birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Intact dilation and extraction Postpartum depression Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Nutrition Dieting Joke Whitney Houston Extreme Programming Homeopathy Genital wart Schapelle Corby Ovarian cancer Insulin Cephalic disorder Prolactinoma Elephant Psychosis Friends Common cold Biology and sexual orientation Stomach cancer Intrauterine device Sharon Tate Maya calendar Intersex surgery Habitual abortion Milton H.
