confused a little bit first off please be nice im young i think i may be really pregnant between and weeks along i got a super super faint positive pregnancy test like weeks ago and then negatives but i dont find hpt's very reliable so i am going to the doctor for a blood test i did have fluttering for like a little over a month and lately it has been really strong so i think the blood test is going to be positive anyways yesterday night i had super bad nausea normal but then it turned into this awful awful pain the worst pain i have felt in my whole life it hurt from my pubic bone up to my ribs and also my back its really hard to explain but it was the most painful thing i have ever felt it lasted like minutes do you think that could be related to pregnancy or am i sick you should go to your doctor right away in fact even if your appointment is in the next few days you should call them and tell them about the pain you had if they think it's something to be concerned about they may be able to see you sooner your doctor can check everything and may or may not have an explanation for the pain you had it could be anything from gas to a muscle pull to a pre term labor contraction just tell your doctor about it and if you have any more between now and going to the doctor call them right away even if it's the middle of the night more than likely it will turn out to be nothing and you won't feel a pain like that until you go in to labor but it's better to be safe than sorry if it does turn out to be preterm labor your doctor would likely send you to the hospital where they can give often give you medication to stop the labor so your baby can develop more fully good luck and remember that your doctor is there to answer any of your questions even if you feel silly trust me you'll feel better getting reassurance rather than sitting at home worrying Pregnancy Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Premature birth First aid Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Melanie Wilkes Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Abortion debate Myocardial infarction Miscarriage EastEnders Professional wrestling slang Menstrual cycle Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct The Inside Medicine Prolactinoma Endometriosis New York Giants Malaria Tobacco smoking Urinary incontinence Glen Jacobs Decompression sickness Equine conformation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Sharon Tate Psoriasis Futurama (TV series - season 5) Menstrual cup The Shining (film) Something Awful Jon Secada Weight training One Tree Hill (TV series) Anxiety Social rule Captain Thunderbolt God Emperor of Dune Carpal tunnel syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Jam (TV series) Chronic fatigue syndrome Hey Jude Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Traumatic brain injury Fecal incontinence Humphrey Bogart Blood on the Tracks Triage The Doctor Dances The Amber Spyglass Sin City Singlish Multiple sclerosis Puberty Pope John Paul I Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Cardiac arrhythmia Group A streptococcal infection Professional wrestling holds In vitro fertilisation Penis Smallpox Flat feet Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Ebola Maprotiline A Canticle for Leibowitz Goodness and value theory Days of our Lives Knots Landing Pain Professional wrestling throws Infantilism Kodocha Human adaptation to space Caesarean section Babe Ruth Massage
