what do you think about the name rachel i just found out i am having a baby girl which i 'm so excited about pretty much since the moment i found out i was pregnant i knew i was having a girl and was already calling her rachel even though i was trying not too b c i wasnt sure if it was a boy or not lol but i've been catching some slack about it b c my month old son is raymond i didnt even think about the similarities of their names until many many people are saying that it sounds funny raymond and rachel i guess they mean too similar i also thought about the name isabella but that name is so common now even though it is beautiful i guess i just want some more oppinions on what people think and possibly if anyone else just knew what the baby's name should be despite what others thought thanks i absolutely love it it's my name i may be a little impartial i love the spelling too and it goes great with raymond Friends EastEnders About a Boy Jon Secada Phoebe Buffay's songs Jean Grey AFI 100 Years series Academy Award for Original Music Score Cliff Richard Humphrey Bogart Days of our Lives Scenes from a Memory Neighbours The Inside Shaggy dog story Infantilism Ross Geller Alois Hitler She Loves You Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gunther (Friends character) Taliesin Pure Pwnage Frankie Vaughan Sharon Tate Urusei Yatsura Rachel McAdams Sex and the City Everybody Loves Raymond The Supremes Child sexuality Louie, Louie Comedy film Anime I Love the 90s Cardcaptor Sakura Kurt Cobain Academy Award for Best Picture The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Rod Stewart I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Negima Kodocha Sugo One Life to Live Ron and Fez Miss Saigon Doug Usher (entertainer) Spice Girls Rachel Stevens Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hollyoaks Rachel Green Rachel One Tree Hill (TV series) Gloria Trevi Rachel Nichols (actress) John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Hip hop collaborations Little Britain Password Wheel of Fortune Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Given name Earth Girl Arjuna I Love Lucy The Beach Boys Rachel Weisz Britney Spears Aramaic of Jesus Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Jacob Night and Day (soap opera) Another World (TV series) Phoebe Halliwell Isabella of Jerusalem Japanese name Remix Los Rold__n Joey Tribbiani Infinite Ryvius Futari wa Pretty Cure Takuya Kimura LOL (Internet slang) Terrorism against Israel in 2003 The Wotch Salad Fingers Boy Meets World Elvis Presley Royal Tunbridge Wells Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Baldwin IV of Jerusalem The Mikado Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress Sampling (music) Game show Marilyn Monroe
