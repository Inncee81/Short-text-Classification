dna tests before baby is born is it possible is there a way i can get a dna test done before my son is born i am having issues with my fiance and he is trying to doubt the baby please help i am so stressed out and just want to get this out of the way yes it is possible and there are methods that pose virtually no risk to mother and baby other than the normal risks associated with a blood draw from the mother during pregnancy you will find a link below to one of the few labs that offer this service it is quite expensive so that might make it impossible for you the lab is located in california but they can collect samples from anywhere in the united states and in other countries as well they will set up an appointment for you to go give a blood sample at a local hospital they will then use that sample to extract fetal cells that have been discarded into the mother's blood stream to create a dna profile for the baby they will test it against a dna sample provided by the father blood is not necessary he can also do a buccal aka cheek swab or a hair sample i believe this method of testing is still rather new but it is guaranteed and they do offer to retest after the baby is born at no additional charge just send in a buccal swab sample from the baby and they will test that against the sample already provided by the father http www dnaplus com fetal cell prenatal paternity test htm btw this is not a medically necessary procedure and it is not covered by insurance Prenatal diagnosis Genetic fingerprinting Obstetrics HIV test Drug test Cancer Genealogical DNA test In vitro fertilisation Stem cell Medical laboratory Prostate cancer Insulin Abortion Growth hormone deficiency Cytomegalovirus Pregnancy Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Miscarriage Acne Agar plate Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Abortion debate Insurance Partial-birth abortion Polymerase chain reaction Software testing Ovarian cancer Biology and sexual orientation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Newborn screening Gonorrhoea Cephalic disorder AIDS reappraisal Divorce Roe v.
