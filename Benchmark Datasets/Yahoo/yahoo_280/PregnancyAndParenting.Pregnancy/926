bleeding while pregnant i wen t to the er on for bleeding and i am weeks pregnant they said everything was fine but last night i started again should i be worried it depends on how much you're bleeding and what color it is and if you are having pain you can always call your doctor's office even on weekends they have an answering service and will have a doctor or nurse call you at home but generally if you are only spotting pink or brown or light red there is no need to go running to the er you only really need to go to the er if you are bleeding bright red blood that is heavy like a very heavy period where you are saturating pads or if bleeding is accompanied by a fair amount of pain that is an emergency if it's just the occassional spotting or very light flow that does not require changing pads frequently then it's a good idea to let your doctor know and let them decide if you need to be seen many women have light spotty bleeding in early pregnancy it is not necessarily a sign that anything is wrong it is heavier bleeding that is characteristic of possible miscarriage but even at this early stage if you were miscarrying unfortunately there is nothing that can be done to stop it it usually occurs because there was some sort of genetic problem or malformation that would cause the pregnancy to be incompatible with continued development good luck Miscarriage Obstetrics Pregnancy Childbirth Menstrual cycle Stroke Twin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cephalic disorder Diabetic retinopathy Folic acid Spina bifida Breastfeeding Intravenous therapy Turner syndrome Professional wrestling slang Color Coeliac disease Hypertension Abortion debate Endometriosis Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Gynecologic hemorrhage Bleeding Premature birth Urinary incontinence Von Willebrand disease Endometrial cancer Cancer Vaginal bleeding Polycystic ovary syndrome Psoriasis Gonorrhoea In vitro fertilisation Migraine Fertility awareness Ectopic pregnancy Hemorrhagic stroke Traffic light Rei Ayanami Maprotiline Birth control Coffee $ale of the Century EastEnders Anemia Prolactinoma Medicine Malaria Light-emitting diode Alcoholism Tocopherol Axial compressor Placental abruption Blood type Guinea pig Bruise Abortion in the United States Oral contraceptive Partial-birth abortion Blood Puberty Red Hot Chili Peppers Morning sickness Abortion in Canada Person Triage Female genital cutting Pelvic inflammatory disease Color blindness Multiple sclerosis Cytomegalovirus Lung cancer Prenatal care Subdural hematoma Eye color Needle aspiration biopsy Congenital disorder Intracranial pressure Red Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Ebola Chlamydia Melanie Wilkes Dialysis Nuclear fallout Tourniquet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Callus Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Malignant melanoma Prenatal diagnosis
