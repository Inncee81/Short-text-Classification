just wondering i started taking the pill last month during the first month of the pill you are supposed to use a back up method of birth control which i was but than one time there was a broken condom now i'm like weeks late on my period and i'm not sure if it's because of the pill messing up my period so i'm not really that worried right now but i was wondering if i did take a pregnancy test would it say positive because of the hormones in the pill and another thing if i was pregnant but i kept taking birth control would that hurt the baby you need to take a test asap the pill contains a mess of hormones but not hcg what a pregnancy test tests for therefore you will not get a possitive pregnancy test due to hormones in the pill you will only test possitive if you are pregnant it is dangerous to take the pill if you are pregnant soo take the test and if you are pregnant stop taking the pill right away if not then it is probably the pill messing up your periods Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Birth control Emergency contraception Pregnancy test Endometriosis Breastfeeding Obstetrics Miscarriage EastEnders Depo Provera Urinary incontinence Abortion In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Neighbours Acne Pregnancy fetishism Prenatal diagnosis Knots Landing Intrauterine device Tocopherol Psoriasis Gonorrhoea Social rule Ben Johnson (athlete) Sexual revolution Morning sickness Prolactinoma Turner syndrome Folic acid Elvis and Me Religion and abortion Elephant Spina bifida Chemical abortion Condom Ectopic pregnancy Premature birth Melanie Wilkes Apollo 8 Kodocha Progesterone Coffee Vernon Schillinger Hormone Hypertension Infertility Cryptorchidism Ovarian cyst Kate Vaiden Prostate cancer The Inside Sex education Postpartum depression Breech birth Mammary gland Cytomegalovirus Oral sex Caffeine Safe sex Amiodarone Sexual abstinence Marilyn Monroe HIV test Insulin Baldness treatments Endocrine system Lucille Ball Pornographic movie Prolactin Veganism Vaginal bleeding Human penis size Alanis Morissette Sex assignment Fiddler on the Roof Carpal tunnel syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coeliac disease Days of our Lives Boston Public 2000 Australian Grand Prix Syphilis Babe Carey Sexual intercourse Gallstone Drug test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Everwood Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an
