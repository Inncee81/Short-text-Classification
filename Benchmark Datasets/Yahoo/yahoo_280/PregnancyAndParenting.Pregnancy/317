i dont know what this could be please any ideas or suggestions let me know ok im ttc just started this month my last period was around july i have been having unprotected sex with my husband almost everyday well for the last week i have been feeling funny okward i was wearing white shorts a week ago of course they cant stay white and i went to the bathroom and noticed a spot on them in the crotch area it wasnt red like blood it was like a really light rusty color and no i didnt sit on anything but my underwear went colored at all like it went right threw then last mon i was in the wis dell and wore gray shorts with my swimsuit and noticed the spot again so i have been wearing paintyliners since and nothing for the past days i get a light pain in my lower back and feel like i do the day i get my period but i dont get it for like a few more days i dont know if this is enough info to get anything out of but its all i got now so any answers that might help me please let me know also fri i was lightheaded for awhile too i dont get my preiod for a few more days and i think it is too early to test yet im not going to waste my one test on a time when i know it will more then likely be a negative i will wait to see if i miss my preiod i didnt say i will be ovulating in a week i said i will be getting my preiod from what i read i already ovulated a week or so ago i think but just waiting on the preiod it's possible you have conceived because sometimes when the egg embeds itself you will have slight rusty discharge and some minor cramping can accompany it give it a little more time and if you are monitoring your temperature keep an eye for any spikes if you haven't started by the end of this month take a pregnancy test and make a drs appointment i wish you well Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy Ocean's Twelve Pregnancy test Ovulation Miscarriage Undergarment Niddah Prostate cancer Toronto Transit Commission Clinical depression Tour de France Dialysis Capercaillie In vitro fertilisation Oral contraceptive Avenue Q Pet skunk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diabetic retinopathy Menstrual cup HIV test Sauna Sexual abstinence Shaggy dog story Jackass: The Movie Opportunity rover Polycystic ovary syndrome Hazing Gonorrhoea Puberty Urinary incontinence Horse Ben Johnson (athlete) Red Fox Singlish Fecal incontinence Dog Time Out of Mind Hurricane Rita Salad Fingers EastEnders Swimsuit Speedo (suit style) Vitamin C The Shining (film) Milton H.
