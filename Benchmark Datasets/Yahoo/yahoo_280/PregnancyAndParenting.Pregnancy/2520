excercise during pregnancy i'm in my eighth month about halfway through and throughout my pregnancy i've been trying to keep in shape properly now that i'm so far along i was wondering what types of excercise is safe or unsafe like i know certain types of stretching and aerobics are designed for pregnancy but what about things like jogging sorry if this sounds dumb but it's my first pregnancy and i want to do it right lol if you have been exercising your whole pregnancy no problem as long as it is low impact non jarring and you are not an at risk pregnancy with my nd pregnancy i used to walk on the treadmill i stopped running and i also used the eliptical machine i lifted very light dumbbells too about days per week just be sure you are consuming enough calories to support the growth of your baby and to account for the ones that you are burning while working out also i don't remember the count your doctor can tell you but you should not let your heart rate go over a certain number or you are risking deprivation of oxygen to the baby i had a very easy delivery and i was into a size within weeks of delivering an pound baby Weight training Childbirth Pregnancy Breech birth Miscarriage Obstetrics Aerobic exercise Dieting Abortion Breastfeeding Explosive material Folic acid Milk Premature birth In vitro fertilisation Swimming Abortion debate Prolactinoma Hypertension Psoriasis Running Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetes mellitus Sewage treatment Spina bifida Equine conformation Coeliac disease Anorexia nervosa Postpartum depression Fetus Teenage pregnancy Omega-3 fatty acid Prenatal care Welding Obesity Myocardial infarction Birth weight Herpes simplex virus Atkins Nutritional Approach Partial-birth abortion Condom Exercise Brassiere Sex education Carburetor Cephalic disorder Congenital disorder Father's Day (Doctor Who) Oral contraceptive Super Size Me Muscle Car safety Energy development Iliotibial band syndrome Multiple birth Fertility awareness Cytomegalovirus Tobacco smoking Osteoporosis Angina Bicycle helmet Decompression sickness Road safety Turner syndrome Tank Hard disk Coffee Obedience training Tocopherol Prenatal diagnosis Heart rate Clinical depression Deflation (economics) Diabetic retinopathy Ectopic pregnancy Hand grenade Menstrual cup Gonorrhoea Motorcycle Pregnancy fetishism Prostate cancer Jon Secada Mental retardation Paragliding 2005 United States Grand Prix Rebreather Radiation therapy Low-carbohydrate diet Intravenous therapy Space Shuttle program Roller coaster Stroke HIV Nuclear reactor Hubble Space Telescope Doxepin Elevator Safe sex
