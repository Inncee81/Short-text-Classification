does any one know what the good resaon is for giving a women who is cm dialited week overdue an ambien my cousin went in last night with her first pregnancie and she was check and was only cm dialted with really bad contractions being min apart for a while and then minutes her pains were so bad they gave her a sleeping cocktail and an ambien why would they do that isnt that going to make the baby sleep too did that just hinder her labor sure sound like lazy hospital procedure i need to kow cause i am worried they just made it worse what can she expect now she is sleeping all of these answers are helping thank you everyone i shared these with her mom and her and i feel so much better i take back my comment about lazy hospital procedure i just dont like the sound of giving a pregnant women drugs of course i dont want her to be in pain for houres duh i am concerned mostly for the helpless baby most people know labor will be painfull what did they do years ago for women in labor i guess they just had to deal with it huh heaven forbid anyone now a days just deal with anything natural or painfull with out drugs i am gald she is comfortable though i hope this was the right decision i dont understand how ambien would not get to the baby so i guess if the fda says it it must be true huh lol yeah right i am a labor nurse and we do this all the time and it isn't because of laziness we want the mother to be as comfortable as possible when they come in for cervical ripening or an expected long induction they are freaked out scared nervous anxious just about every form of stress known to man that is not a good condition to go into labor we want them to be able to relax and sleep if at all possible during that time we want them to be able to wake up having some energy and ready for the hard work of labor that is ahead of them relaxation is also beneficial to labor a relaxed body is not fighting against any potential contractions that would help to efface and dilate the cervix which is why when women get epidurals they tend to dilate so much faster once they are comfortable ambien and other medications we use to help them sleep and to relieve their discomfort are relatively short acting we use them because we know the baby is not coming imminently and the medications will have been metabolized long before the child is born if we saw a lot of negative effects we would not use them at any rate we offer them to the mothers it is entirely up to them if they choose to take them or not we aren't forcing anyone to do anything they don't want to do Breastfeeding Pregnancy Obstetrics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Miscarriage EastEnders Fertility awareness Anxiety Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Singlish Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction Clinical depression Menstrual cycle Shaggy dog story Traumatic brain injury Cannabis (drug) Herpes simplex virus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Bipolar disorder Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Sin City Melanie Wilkes Social rule Caesarean section Breech birth Equine conformation LSD Sedative Psoriasis Transsexuality Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Electroconvulsive therapy Paracetamol Hypoglycemia Local anesthesia Neighbours Elephant Theory of conduct Opioid Narcolepsy Stroke Scientology beliefs and practices Myocardial infarction Folic acid Cocaine Weight training Milton H.
