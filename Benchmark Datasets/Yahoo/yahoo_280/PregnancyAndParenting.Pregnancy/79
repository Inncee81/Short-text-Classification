foods that give a fetus the extra edge i am a recovering alcoholic i am also months pregnant i have had three very short relapses during the past five months even though i a m not drinking now i know there will be people who feel they need to bash me for being irrisponsibal abusive or just a plain crappy mother i don't care what they have to say because i know how hard it is to recover and i also know that i am doing better now than i ever have before i have two other children both of which were born healthy with out any sign of fas and i struggled with those pregnancies as well this is our last child the doctor tells me she looks great on the ultra sounds what want to know however is about any special diet requirements i could implement during the last few months of pregnancy are there any foods that give a fetus an extra boost of any kind i'm not perfect but i do want the best best for our baby any sugesstions that takes a lot of courage to come out and talk about such a touchy subject like this i am very proud of you for asking i don't think you are a crappy mother by the way addiction is a terrible thing to overcome my only suggestion is to continue to take your vitamins and eat well balanced meals i wish nothing but the best for you and your family Pregnancy Abortion debate Breastfeeding Childbirth Miscarriage Guinea pig Anorexia nervosa Veganism Stomach cancer Obstetrics Fecal incontinence Alcoholics Anonymous Clinical depression In vitro fertilisation Addiction Urinary incontinence EastEnders Friends Abortion in the United States Hypoglycemia Egg (food) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Healthy eating Cytomegalovirus The Shining (film) Sant Thakar Singh Laura Schlessinger Premature birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Omega-3 fatty acid Down syndrome Tobacco smoking Vegetarianism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Spina bifida Birth weight Electroconvulsive therapy Everwood Alcoholic beverage Elephant Vitamin C Anemia Dieting Nutrition Milton H.
