we had sex should i be wrorried me and my boyfriend had sex with out a condom and well right after we had sex i threw up a couple of hours later and my is will i still get my period in a week if im pregnant and also how soon before i would no i doubt very much that you'd have gotten sick that fast i'm not saying that you might not have gotten pregnant because you could be the best way to not have to worry about pregnancies or std's is not to have sex then you won't have to worry about ruining your life you should have protected your self and you wouldn't have to be so concerned about it now i'm not trying to make you feel bad but you need to care and think about you let's face some facts here neither you nor your boyfriend even attempted to protect each other that is one reason that young people should wait to have s until they are older so that you won't end up with a baby or an std that could take you life since you didn't use protection you could get pregnant now is not the time to be worried about getting pregnant the time to worry about it was before you had s if you don't end up pregnant and are planning on having s again please use protection three kinds would be good like maybe get on the pill so that you won't have to worry about getting pregnant just so that you know when you first start taking the pill you need to be on it for one entire month before it becomes effective it must be taken every day the same way every month month after month and it must be taken pretty much the same time of day every day so that if you take it at pm make sure that you take it every day at around that time no later than twenty minutes after pm taken properly you will not get pregnant they also have the female condom that you can wear as well so that if his condom breaks you will be a lot safer also have your boyfriend wear a condom as well so that you won't end up getting std's do not rely on just a condom since they can break and you will end up pregnant it's your body that your letting some one be intimate with and you have to take responsiblility for your life so that you don't end up with a baby or and std if your periods are pretty normal then you should know wheather you are or not if you get your period when it is suppose to if you don't get it then you may be pregnant best wishes to you Condom Fertility awareness Sexually-transmitted infection Pregnancy Social rule Oral sex Neighbours Birth control Knots Landing Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Safe sex Pornographic movie Human penis size Menstrual cycle Anal sex Sex education Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Sex and the City Breastfeeding Marilyn Monroe Phoebe Halliwell Human sexual behavior Charmed Boston Public Emergency contraception Psoriasis Fasting Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Sexual intercourse Avenue Q Harm reduction Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) George Costanza TLC Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Jennifer Lopez Childbirth Sin City Apollo 8 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Days of our Lives Big Brother UK series 6 Gay bathhouse Joy (novel) Time Out of Mind Menstrual cup Prostitution Health insurance Swinging AIDS pandemic Sexual revolution Roe v.
