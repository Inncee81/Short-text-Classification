i was wondering with having my son in just a few short months what do you think a good about of diapers to have is so far i have of the mega packs but i also will be out of work for months with no pay so i would like to be prepared basically i am asking how many do you think i should have for the first months from you personal experience instead of actually buying the diapers i think you should put the money on a gift card to a store that sells diapers your child may end up out growing the first size really quickly or never fitting it at all i had a ton of newborn diapers or what i thought was a ton i figured they would last until she went up a size but i was wrong lol they didnt even last a month we probably went through diapers a day when she was a newborn and then once she got a bit older a day or you can cloth diaper instead its a lot cheaper in the long run and not the messy job that it used to be they have all in one diapers now so you dont have to but separate pads and plastic covers they even have adjustable ones so they grow with your baby do some research on the internet and you may find it to be a pretty good option perhaps use disposables when baby is a newborn since they go through so many and then switch to cloth once baby is a bit older oh and they dont use safety pins on cloth diapers anymore unless you make your own they use velcro they dont feel always wet either because of the plastic outer layer good luck and congrats Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Breastfeeding Textile manufacturing Floppy disk Plastic Comanche Undergarment Infant Mattress Strap-on dildo Menstrual cycle Procter & Gamble Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Dairy Urinary incontinence Internet fraud Kodocha MAME Genericized trademark Neopets 2000 Australian Grand Prix Windows XP Characters in the Smurfs Velcro Poker jargon Handloading EastEnders Social rule Bicycle lighting Animal Crossing DVD Wood carving Modem Social aspects of clothing Humphrey Bogart My Little Pony David Vetter Knots Landing Therion (band) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Computer Credit card Gaia Online Radio controlled airplane Fecal incontinence Christmas tree Electronic commerce Care Bears Screw Billboard (advertising) Early IBM disk storage Fire fighting Galactic Civilizations Money CPU design Childbirth Avenue Q Krag-J__rgensen Diving suit USB flash drive About a Boy Cytomegalovirus Ageplay IPv4 Mutual fund Menstrual cup Tesco Hiking Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 BS 1363 Conscription Mach kernel Jute Electrical wiring Sexual fetishism Bulk vending Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wal-Mart $ale of the Century Option Shirt Microsoft Windows Hand grenade Theory of conduct Light-emitting diode Elimination communication Printed circuit board Monopoly (game) Corset Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Textile manufacturing terminology Make money fast Tire Singlish Jennifer Lopez
