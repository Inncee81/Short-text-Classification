not so faint line on a pregnancy test i have taken three different brands of pregnancy tests in all three the control line showed up and the test line was there but not as dark as the control line it wasn't that faint but it still wasn't as dark what does this mean i was ovulating july about weeks after my period and usually have a week cycle so i haven't missed a period yet but i have had very very slight bleeding for the last days which is why i took three tests over a two day period anybody had this experience of course i read the directions only one of the tests showed a picture where one line was a little lighter than the other but none of the three of them said anything about it as long as you read it within the time frame then it sounds like it's positive if you still aren't sure hold out a few days and test again if you're pregnant the line would be darker then for sure spotting could be related to the implantation or something was the blood light dark old looking etc i have spotting usually around the time of my positive results no need for people to be sarcastic anyone who's wanted badly to see that line knows why you want to be sure and be reassured Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy test Oral contraceptive Miscarriage Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Estrus cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Diabetic retinopathy Abortion Birth control Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Solar eclipse Human chorionic gonadotropin Sharon Tate Spina bifida Jeopardy!
