am i feeling the baby i am weeks pregnant almost when i lay down on my left side i feel a spasm just below my ribs at first i thought nothing of it but it has happened at the same time days in a row the only thing is that i am not that far along and i am barely showing i mean you really have to look hard to see anything so i don't know if it is just a spasm or it is the baby anyone i've had the same thing and no it's not the baby your uterus is still around your belly button right now so the baby is still closer to your pelvis than anything trust me when you feel the baby you will know i know everyone says this and you get paranoid that you'll miss it i asked about times if what i was feeling was the baby but you'll start to recognize it at first it's like a stirring in your belly then you start feeling actual kicks or punches and it feels almost like a bubble has burst in your abdomen it's pretty cool the twitching is most likely just your organs moving and your ribs expanding your diaphragm also has to move a bit so that could be a cause i still get twitches from time to time and that's the only reason i can think of as to why it would happen it makes sense because everything has to move up and your ribs have to expand to make room for the baby get ready to start hooking your bra on a looser hook because that time is just a short time away congrats and best of luck to you with the baby i'm almost weeks and i can feel mine allll the time now so it isn't too long before you feel yours i was around weeks when i started feeling him move about Abdomen Breech birth Pregnancy Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Friends Equine conformation Theory of conduct AFI 100 Years series EastEnders Spice Girls Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Social rule Snake Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jon Secada I Want to Hold Your Hand Sharon Tate Milton H.
