am i really pregnant my husband and i have been trying to have a baby for about four months my period was due on saturday but nothing came i have had pretty bad cramps for the last three days so i figured that my period was on its way i just took a hpt for the heck of it and it came out positive i am still having cramps so i don't have a clue what is happening any help would be greatly appreciated i also had cramps when i first became pregnant im weeks and even now i have them from time to time but don't worry i always was worried it was a bad thing if you had cramps but when i went to the doc they told me to expect them because of your uterus stretching as long as there is no bledding you'll be fine congrats god bless if the test says positve then you are it is very very uncommon to get a false pos more likely to get a false negative so enjoy Pregnancy Menstrual cycle EastEnders Miscarriage Humphrey Bogart Prenatal diagnosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy test Obstetrics Social rule Marilyn Monroe Childbirth Cramp Gonorrhoea Infantilism Coeliac disease Tupac Shakur AFI 100 Years series Androgen insensitivity syndrome Endometriosis Jeopardy!
