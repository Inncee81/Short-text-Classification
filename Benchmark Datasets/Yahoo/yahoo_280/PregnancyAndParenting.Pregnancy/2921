home birth or birthing center for first baby i'm going to be close by a hospital either way in case of complications but i hate and i mean hate hospitals they make me tense i cannot relax in them so don't try convince me to go to one please also i want to do a water birth at least a natural birth one without interventions without medication so far everything is completely normal no complications at all which place would be better i'm kinda concerned about the mess at home how would a home birth be more painful the same thing will be occurring and i don't plan on having pain meds either way complications refer to the first sentence under the question my home the birthing center is about the same distance from the nearest hospital less than min away as to why i hate hospitals for one i don't like strangers much two i'm a light sleeper can't rest in a hospital three i'm not terribly fond of holier than thou doctors four they smell horrible five they like to restrict what you do six anyone in there as a patient they treat as if they are sick pregnancy is a condition not an illness or disease i can go on on i've been in the hospital a few times once in a burn ward for hrs i got no sleep they wouldn't let me eat drink what i wanted my only options were dry toast warm gatorade and then they complained that i puked it up on the floor when i couldn't get a nurse to respond to the call button they gave me stupid lectures it was just utterly ridiculous i signed myself out against recommendations they wanted me to stay another week i forced myself to handle the pain without morphine with a straight face while they scrubbed my burns to prove to them that i could leave birthing center hands down especially if they have a jacuzzi bath tub for labor the birthing tubs you can use at home just aren't as spiffy unless you want to spend major on a rental not covered by insurance now a lot of birthing centers wn't do an actual waterbirth for liability reasons so make sure you ask and lots of birthing centers carry nubain so you can grab an hour of sleep if you have a gosh awful hr plus type labor minutes from the hospital is plenty close in case of an emergency as long as the birthing center midwives are trained in infant rescue cpr and carry the standard array of hemorrage preventing medications for you and oxygen on site even in an emergency c section situation the hospital usually takes minutes to get the anesthesiologist ready i did my first at a birthing center and i'm glad i did the mess was incredible and i kept needing to get in and out of the water because i'd suddenly be freezing i don't even want to imagine how much laundry i'd have had if i'd been home a birthing center will also refer you to an ob if your pregnancy becomes high risk so no real stresses there and most birthing centers are completely capable of administering antibiotics for group b strep and iv fluids if you need them First aid Medicine Drowning Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Myocardial infarction Breastfeeding Pneumonia Premature birth Psoriasis Traumatic brain injury Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Folic acid Decompression sickness Diabetes mellitus Stroke Migraine EastEnders Pregnancy Breech birth Midwifery Prostate cancer Abortion debate Chronic fatigue syndrome Theory of conduct Nurse Triage Common cold Group A streptococcal infection Social rule Emergency department Health insurance Hypoglycemia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Apollo 8 Emergency Medical Services Medicare (Canada) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ebola Milton H.
