baby movements i am currently weeks pregnant and my baby has really slowed down i barely feel him move during the day but i do feel him some at night i asked the doctor last monday at my appointment if this was normal and he said the baby had a good heartbeat and he was just running out of room i also saw him on an ultrasound last thursday and he was moving just fine so my question is has anyone else's baby dramatically slowed their movements in the last trimester and if so how do you know they are ok if they are not moving as much also this morning when i turned over in bed i felt this burning pain in my lower abdomen i think it was just stretching but i don't know thanks for your help this is my first baby and i'm just nervous about every little thing most likely your baby has settled into a good position the best position for birth is the one where your baby's back faces your front and your baby is head down this makes it a lot harder for you to feel baby's movements because his her hands and feet are now facing your back the best thing to do is not worry about it throughout the day lay down in the evening on your side with a glass of juice and just wait for movements if you feel within an hour your baby is fine another thing that can affect how many movements you feel is where your placenta is if your baby is kicking the placenta you may not feel anything you may notice times when your baby seems to move more and then times when he she moves less as baby grows and then your uterus catches up giving baby more room don't worry just do some kick counts and you will feel a little better Pregnancy Childbirth Breech birth Obstetrics Miscarriage Professional wrestling holds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Equine conformation Breastfeeding Backstroke Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Swingout Urinary incontinence Operation Market Garden Abortion Prostate cancer Knots Landing Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fast bowling Jon Secada Abortion debate Breaststroke Intact dilation and extraction Professional wrestling attacks Fertility awareness Endometriosis Caesarean section Birth weight Conspiracy (TNG episode) Lindy Basic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Glen Jacobs Piccolo Junior Saga Rosa Parks Mattress Tupac Shakur Glossary of partner dance terms Ocean's Twelve Ben Johnson (athlete) Humphrey Bogart Melanie Wilkes Front crawl Fecal incontinence The Shining (film) Charleston (dance move) Skateboarding trick Milton H.
