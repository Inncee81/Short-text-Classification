should i tell the father so i found out im pregnant and im i havent told anyone yet i was wondering if i should tell the father of the baby i know i should but i already know what is going to happen nothing he is moving out of state for college and im going back to nyc for school i know he wont be involved he is a jerk we havent even seen eachother in about two weeks so were not even talking i plan on prob doing adoption abortion is not an option and i dont know how i could keep the baby and he would never find out i will be in nyc for a year so what do u think should i tell him there are a lot of pros and cons to either telling him or not telling him but i think he should know regardless of how he is going to react let the guilt eat at him for the rest of his life if he isnt going to help with the responsibility and also because he will know all his life that somewhere he has a child you need to try to stay on somewhat pleasant terms even if you dont stay in touch because regardless of what you do when the baby is born he will need either to pay child support or sign adopotion papers if you get assistance from the state with your medical care they will want to be reimbursed by him and will need as much info about him like his last whereabouts as possible same as with child support do you know his parents i think i would let them know also my story was quiet tragic but turned out with a wonderful ending which didnt include the natural father if you want to chat let me know there are many things to consider now that youre pragnet i am glad you havent chosen abortion as an option if you want to really make that choice solid go to youtube com and search for abortion videos it might be that his parents would like to keep the baby in the family yu might want to ask them and of course my family is always available for adoption we are raising our grandson and he would love to have a sister or brother but all things considered each one of these things is a different topic there are so many things about adoption i was adopted and i am so thankful for those parents i have met my natural family also it is very hard to do whats right for you and the baby you cant be told by people what to do because you have to live with the consequences keeping the baby truly has it's ups and downs i think parenting has been the most challanging job experiance of my entire life if you decided to keep it you may have to take longer to finish school but you would figure out how to do this if you really want to how about having someone help you care for the baby while you are trying to finish school i dont mean a babysitter although you could do that i mean somewhere else the baby can live until you can take care of it we did that for a friend for her kids it made it so she could keep her kids but be able to get on her feet i also did this years ago with little girls while their dad was in transition there are many aspects to all these things to consider sometimes i wish i had never told the father about his son who is now yrs old they know about eachother just have never had any contact because the father denied the child and refused contact as well as the rest of his family one way or the other i dont think you could adopt the baby out without his signature unless you lied and said you dont know who the father is you can take some time to think before you act and decide what to do if you decide to tell him he doesnt have to know right away one key thing is to document the time you spent together and when you got pragnet if for no other reason than keeping this info for yourself but sometime down the road there may be a need for this legally wishing you the very best in life if you need to chat tpettee yahoo com EastEnders Friends About a Boy Social rule Abortion debate Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Pitaten Adoption One Tree Hill (TV series) Abortion in the United States Everwood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Atomic Kitten Abortion Downing Street memo Neighbours The Amazing Race Charmed Child support Pro-choice 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Fathers' rights movement in the UK Days of our Lives Avenue Q Hillary Rodham Clinton Miss Saigon Hollyoaks Fathers' rights The Sims 2 The Apprentice 2 Lazarus Long 2004 Republican National Convention Divorce W.I.T.C.H.
