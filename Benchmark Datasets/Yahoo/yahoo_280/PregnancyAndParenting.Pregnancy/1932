question about father sighning birth certificate i dont think the father of my baby will be here to sighn our babys birth cerificate but i mean we all together and he wants her to have his last name can i still do that with out him sighning it or do we have to wait tell he gets back to sighn the birth certificate this may seem like odd advice but think carefully about this are you sure you want your baby's father to sign the birth certificate once he does you're stuck with this guy for a practical years or so and to a lesser degree for life it might be better to keep your options open consider the matrilineal model children belong to the mother and the family line is ordered along the lines that a mother passes down to her children if your baby's father wants to be part of your life and the baby's life without his signature on the birth certificate he's at your mercy unless he demands a dna paternity test in which case he's signing on for at least years of child support payments but let's say as much as you may be in love with him today you outgrow him and come to find a better man for yourself and a better father for your child if there's no name on the birth certificate you and the child are free and clear if not then you're giving your baby's biological father carte blanche to meddle in your life until your child becomes an adult the child support laws cut both ways a father whose name is on the birh certificate might even challenge you for custody some day how would you feel about that biology is not really all that selective about who becomes a parent you might be best to guard your options at least until you know for sure you want to share parenting with this guy for the rest of your life if you're not even sure enough to marry each other then that suggests there'll be nothing but trouble in co parenting Divorce Father Fathers' rights movement in the UK Adoption Child custody Fathers' rights Knots Landing Breastfeeding Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Incest Paternity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Child support Family name Abortion debate Matrilineality British nationality law Family Appeal One Tree Hill (TV series) Marriage Eugenics Alois Hitler Friends Transsexuality Babe Carey EastEnders Polyamory Hollyoaks Kodocha Infantilism Infant Single parent Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paternalism Childbirth Sex-selective abortion and infanticide David Blunkett 613 mitzvot Abortion in the United States In vitro fertilisation Jennifer Lopez Mental retardation Pretty Good Privacy History of British nationality law Canadian nationality law Prolog Primogeniture Incest taboo 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Days of our Lives Visitation Education in Germany Irish nationality law Infanticide Second language acquisition Charmed Biology and sexual orientation Babylonian law Left-handed Software testing Biology Midwifery Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Education in Australia Captain Thunderbolt Breech birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Matrilineal succession Prenatal diagnosis Human Illegitimacy Twin Indian nationality law Humphrey Bogart The Family from One End Street Infant baptism Intelligence quotient Rugrats President of Germany No Child Left Behind Act Attachment parenting Sant Thakar Singh John the Baptist Swiss citizenship George VI of the United Kingdom Tupac Shakur Life insurance Legal aspects of transsexualism Hereditary peer Motion picture rating system Masculism Scientific method Property (ownership right) Folic acid Reproduction Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case
