could it have been the baby i'm currently weeks pregnant with our first child obviously i'm experiencing a bunch of new things to say the least i was sitting on my bed reading and i felt a light i guess i could describe it as a thumping it wasn't hard and didn't hurt and it lasted for maybe seconds then it just stopped it almost felt like when you check your pulse that thump you feel but it felt like it was coming from the inside out i couldn't feel it from the outside i just noticed it when i was sitting still not doing anything could it have been the baby moving when the baby first starts moving it feels like a butterly in your stomach it goes without saying that a pregnant women experiences more gas than usual it could have been that too Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Slow Train Coming The Inside Milton H.
