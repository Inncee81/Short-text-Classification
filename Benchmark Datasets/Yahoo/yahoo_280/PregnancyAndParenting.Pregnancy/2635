my cervix is unfavourable and i am over weeks i am weeks and days pregnant and yesterday my midwife tried to give me a sweep to get things moving but she could not even reach my cervix she said she'd try again next week and has booked me in for an induction at the hospital if she is still unsucessfull i was induced with my first child and hated the experience and wanted to avoid it this time anyone else been in a similar situation if so what worked for you if anything just because your midwife recommends induction and its the usual thing to do doesn't mean you have to have one maybe you have long pregnancies speak to your mum aunts grandmothers and see how long their pregnancies were it can be a family thing you may be able to persuade your midwife to support you through another week maybe as long as you agree to vigilant monitoring to look for signs of fetal distress caused by the placenta slowly failing before you decide to go down this route please listen to the advice and experience that your midwife consultant can offer you make sure you ask lots of questions and be sure it is what you want to do in my opinion and it is only my opinion and i have no medical background everybody and every pregnancy is different maybe it is just that you grow your babies a litlle slowly and with a little extra time labour would happen naturally but it does go against current medical guidelines so please think about carefully ask lots of questions and do lots of research listen to the medical peeps and don't rule out the induction in the meantime get on those feet and walk walk walk Childbirth Obstetrics Pregnancy Miscarriage Abortion Breastfeeding Midwifery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Menstrual cycle Caesarean section Fertility awareness Intact dilation and extraction In vitro fertilisation Premature birth Abortion in the United States EastEnders Abortion debate Clinical depression Androgen insensitivity syndrome Social rule Milton H.
