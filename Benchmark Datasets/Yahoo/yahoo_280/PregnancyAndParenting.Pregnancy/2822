how long away was you labor when these signs started to show i know noone can tell me for sure but maybe they're own experiences i am at wks last week i was cent already lost the plug and effaced this week i am at a have had contractions off and on the baby's head is engaged and there is calcium in the placenta dr says this means the placenta is aging how long was it before your labor began with some of these signs i know your's may not be exact but what were somethings that happened like a week before your labor started one of the reasons i'm asking is my doctor has scheduled an induction for the th due to time conflicts of his and other patients which i really don't like and i am hoping to avoid it and praying that the labor will start on its own beforehand just wondering how far i am from that actually happening i lost my plug a week before and was dilated for a couple of weeks before giving birth but both times i went overdue had contractions on and off for a couple of months my second child was induced at weeks overdue and it was the best labour ever quick and easy my first child took hours of horrible labour where i was beside myself in pain so i really liked being induced it only took hours when i was induced much less stressful and much less exhausting Childbirth Pregnancy Obstetrics Abortion Caesarean section Premature birth Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Breech birth Breastfeeding Intact dilation and extraction Migraine The Twelve Labours Oxytocin Asthma National Football League Abortion in the United States Ja Rule Induction (birth) Marathon (sport) Wheel of Fortune Psoriasis Toxoplasmosis Contract Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.
