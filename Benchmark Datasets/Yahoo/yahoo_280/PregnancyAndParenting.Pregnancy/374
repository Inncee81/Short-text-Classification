mixed pregnancy test results i used my first morning pee today with a cheap dollar general test and got positive results i have tested more time with a dollar tree and a clear blue easy test they both came back negative how do i know if i am pregnant or not with results like these youa re most likely pregnant false positives are very rare false negatives are quite common if your hcg levels are still quite low as they often are in early pregnancy then it would be more concentrated in your first morning urine testing later in the day you would have been drinking and urinating more frequently than you did overnight and the hormone level would not be as concentrated perhaps nto enough for it to show up on the test you can test again int he morning using first morning urine but i would assume you are pregnant and make an appointment with the doctor keep in mind that their urine tests also give false negatives sometimes also because again in early pregnancy the hormone levels can be quite low and chances are you are not using your first morning urine at the doctor's office i wish you the best Pregnancy test Pregnancy Human chorionic gonadotropin Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Cytomegalovirus Diabetes insipidus Drug test Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Endometriosis Hypoglycemia Obstetrics Cyanide Bayesian inference Coeliac disease Prolactinoma In vitro fertilisation Urinalysis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kidney Prenatal diagnosis Cryptorchidism Gonorrhoea Urine Birth control Progesterone Blood alcohol content Diabetes mellitus Turner syndrome Normal distribution Thyroid Tocopherol Lupus erythematosus Biology and sexual orientation Sex assignment Morning sickness Ovarian cancer Postpartum depression Tobacco smoking Breastfeeding Abortion Falsifiability Coffee Folic acid Motivation Rabbit Vitamin C Operational amplifier Elephant Puberty Nandrolone Hyperglycemia Haloperidol Teenage pregnancy Cancer Hyperprolactinaemia Binary classification Lance Armstrong Antidiuretic hormone Insulin Breast cancer Thalidomide Emergency contraception Health issues and the effects of cannabis Acne Hypospadias Pneumonia Diuretic Twin Doxepin Blood type Anemia Leptospirosis Ectopic pregnancy Nephron Gout Quicksort Welding Guinea pig Phthalates IgA nephropathy Hypertension Halitosis Depleted uranium Urination Colorectal cancer Growth hormone deficiency IP (complexity) Sleep Androgen Hyperthyroidism Schapelle Corby Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Ben Johnson (athlete)
