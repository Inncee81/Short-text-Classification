this is kind of embarrassing to ask but this is a question that is very personal in nature but i want honest answers from other women who have had vaginal deliveries i delivered my second baby wks ago i had only stitches from skin tearing not muscle with my first child i had a th degree episiotomy and i swear to you my vagina was alot smaller than before now with this one i am scared to death that i am stretched out down south from having such a slight tear they did the perineal stretching to help with delivery and my husband almost passed out he could not believe my va jay jay could do that i am just wondering how many women could tell a difference in their elasticity after their second child most husbands know it would be instant death to make any comments about it to their wives but i have guy friends that have stated they could tell a difference did you feel you you had lost your muscle tone and yes i am doing kegels supposedly the vagina is very elasticy and will eventually go back to its natural normal state assuming you two don't start having sex as soon as the weeks mark is up the longer you give yourself to heal the better obviously but if you two start doing it right away he'll never notice the change because he'll become used to the loser weeks after birth version kind of like how if you are with someone everyday you don't notice if they lose weight or notice small yet significant changes Urinary incontinence Childbirth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Episiotomy Intersex surgery Breech birth Strap-on dildo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Condom Vagina Sex toy Pregnancy Child sexuality Milton H.
