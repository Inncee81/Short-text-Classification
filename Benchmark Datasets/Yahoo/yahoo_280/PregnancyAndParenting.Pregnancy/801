can i get pregnant this way my period ended days ago and i was fooling around w my bf as i was doing that he came on my stomach so we wiped it off w a paper towel then i washed it off with just water and wiped it off with a towel a minute later i took a shower w soap and everything could sperm have traveled with the water flow up my uterus somehow what are the chances of me getting pregnant that way could there still be sperm on my hands that could have traveled up my uterus from washing the vaginal region even though i washed them with just water and wiped them with a towel and how likely can i get pregnant that way i am not on birth control and there was no penetration involved can i get an answer from someone who works in the field because i have been getting different answers every time regardless of what part of your cycle you're on there's always a chance you can get pregnant while not on birth control as far as your particular situation it does only take one sperm to get you pregnant but the key here is that there was no penetration the only chance of pregnancy is if somehow some sperm stuck to your hand then you touched your vagina near it's entrance the chances are decreased the more time passes between sperm on hand and vaginal contact the other way would be if water traveled down your belly and carried some sperm with it past your vagina's entrance and the sperm went in from there both scenarios' in my opinion are very low about as low as if you were on the pill since sperm thrive in an environment that is closest to that of the inside of a vagina warm and moist obviously in other words the longer they stay outside the body the higher the odds are they will die i'm not a doctor but i've had some scares so i've done the research Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Menstrual cup In vitro fertilisation Birth control Vagina Pregnancy Sexual intercourse Anal sex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Miscarriage Obstetrics Breech birth Childbirth Abortion Urinary incontinence Female reproductive system (human) Abortion debate Sperm Whale Infertility Puberty Oral sex Tampon Towel Endometriosis Japanese toilet Intact dilation and extraction Safe sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Herpes simplex virus Twin Premature birth Niddah Fecal incontinence Human sexual behavior EastEnders Condom Transmission (medicine) Psoriasis Douche Sento Sex toy Breastfeeding Domestic violence Fertilisation Caesarean section Folic acid Gonorrhoea Cryptorchidism Tide Cervical cancer Strap-on dildo Semen Diaphragm (contraceptive) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Manicure Marsupial Earthworm Human sexual response cycle Gynaecology Tattoo Endometrial cancer Vulvovaginal health Solar variation Drowning Sleep Cytomegalovirus Smegma Ectopic pregnancy Coitus interruptus Spermatozoon Toilet paper Intersexuality Tocopherol Volleyball The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Sanitary towel Global warming Common cold Recurring South Park characters Nuclear fallout Snooker Electrophysiology Ionizing radiation Thermoregulation Tank Genital wart
