don't want to be induced i'm a couple days over my due date my doctor states the farthest they will let me go is days i heard it is safe to go to weeks but they say no it's a little early to cause conflict with the doctor but what if i refuse what will happen will they tell me to find another doctor i know they get scared of lawsuits and such i don't want to risk anything with my baby but days doesn't seem long enough and they say you are much more likely to have a csection if you induce i am aware of the risks on both ends but feel natural birth is almost always better my question is really what will happen if i refuse i know they can't make me do anything but i'm not about to find a new doctor either i don't doubt that the doctor knows best but his response is automatic he is saying days and thats it with no regard to my situation at days past it is simply by his book i was over my due date and this is what the dr told me to do he actually told me to have sex because there is something in sperm that will help induce labor i know that it is probably not that comfortable that late in pregnancy but it does work just find a comfortable position and get inducing yourself Pregnancy Abortion debate Childbirth Birth control Miscarriage Abortion Fertility awareness Breech birth Roe v.
