whats the problem i dont understand why its such a big deal for evryone if people have sex im and thinking bout doing it with my boyfriend and i dont see the big deal if we use condoms and i take the pill i dont understand why its such a big thing im sure we are going to be together a long time and we are going to be safe so wheres the problem people make a big deal about it because it is a big decision that should not be made by a child teenager we are old enough to know the consequences of the actions and i don't just mean pregnancy there are a lot of emotional ties that should go along with having sex if you want to have sex wait until you are married i had sex when i was and i feel stupid now because even though i thought i was going to be with the guy forever that isn't the case i am now married and i felt bad that i didn't save myself for my husband it's still ultimately your decision and if you do decide to just be careful a guy doesn't love you for sex they love you for being you keep that in mind Theory of conduct Sexual abstinence Sex and the City EastEnders Social rule Sex education Boston Public Atomic Kitten One Tree Hill (TV series) The nature of God in Western theology Time Out of Mind Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Saved by the Bell Recurring South Park characters Married... with Children Human sexual behavior Condom Laura Schlessinger Neighbours About a Boy Infantilism Futurama (TV series - season 5) Marriage Pitaten Ethics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends Knots Landing Phoebe Halliwell Birth control Procrastination Everwood Futurama (TV series - season 2) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie TLC The Ashlee Simpson Show The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Safe sex Teenage pregnancy Emergency contraception Meaning of life Transsexuality Hillary Rodham Clinton Coming of Age (TNG episode) Eric Cartman Undergrads Theodicy The Smoking Room Teen Girl Squad The Fairly OddParents Goodness and value theory Series finale Kyle Broflovski God Emperor of Dune Hey Arnold!
