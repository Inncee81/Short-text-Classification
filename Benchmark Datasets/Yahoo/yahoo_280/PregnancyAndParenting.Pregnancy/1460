my lady friend is one month pregnant is sex off limit we just did and i think i might have done a bad thing there was blood blood isnt good but can be quite common to spot as the cervix is very common to spotting during pregnancy if i were her i would refrain from further relations until her doctor gives her the all clear usually sex is fine during pregnancy unless it medically unsafe to do so being only month pregnant it could also have been implantation bleeding as that usually occurs around the time the period would be due which would be around weeks after the last pregnancy Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Obstetrics Childbirth Endometriosis Fertility awareness Ectopic pregnancy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gonorrhoea Premature birth Turner syndrome Twin In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Urinary incontinence Oral contraceptive Psoriasis Abortion debate Sexual reproduction Sexual intercourse Genital wart Diabetic retinopathy Vaginal bleeding Safe sex Cephalic disorder Placenta praevia Birth control Endometrial cancer Ovarian cancer Pregnancy test Marilyn Monroe Stomach cancer Emergency contraception Coeliac disease Abortion in the United States Hearing impairment Spina bifida Maprotiline Intact dilation and extraction Prostate cancer Progesterone Cytomegalovirus Abortion in Canada HIV AIDS Pregnancy fetishism Prolactinoma Roe v.
