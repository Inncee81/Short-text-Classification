is to young to be a mommy i'm not but my friend is no she just turned is she to young to be a mommy when she might have canser and might not have the change ever again cause the canser can be removed after she has the baby but she will never get to be a mom after that agian i think is too young to be a mommy but my one friend was when she had her first kid and they turned out okay and she did it singlehandedly no dad invoulved you wanna make sure the child has proper father care as well as mother i think having a kid somewhat holds you back from your life because you can't live your life when you start a new one your life has to be devoted to the baby and not yourself my sister got pregnant when she was and she wishes she could out to the bars and party and hang with her friends and get a job but she can't because she has a kid and do you know how expessive babysitters are as far as i suggest there is always adoption if she cannot produce on her own i was adopted and i always support it because i don't know where i would be to this day had i not been adopted i thank my lucky stars so it's up to her if she wants a child now or if she wants to wait till she's older i'm and i still have no intensions of having a kid until i'm atleast because i'm a big party animal and i wanna finish shit that i want to do with my life now and then when i'm ready maybe bring another one into life those are my thoughts good luck and i hope eveything goes okay with your friend Jon Secada The Fairly OddParents Baby Blues Kodocha AFI 100 Years series Friends Doug Kyle Broflovski The McGuire Sisters The Adventures of Pete & Pete Care Bears About a Boy Sheryl Crow Knots Landing Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) The Care Bears (television series) Treehouse of Horror V The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Jazz Singer Rocko's Modern Life Wonderland (McFly album) Cliff Richard The Marshall Mathers LP Mommie Dearest (movie) Pitaten Max Martin AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes Timmy Turner The Family from One End Street Situation comedy The Ashlee Simpson Show Infantilism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Alois Hitler Ren and Stimpy Whitney Houston Everwood Luke and Laura Spencer Kurt Cobain Frankie Laine Supergirl Ben Johnson (athlete) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Day care Good Morning, Vietnam The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kimi Finster Gregg Alexander 1989 Golden Raspberry Awards Hip hop collaborations Charmed Mommie Dearest Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Hollyoaks Billy the Kid Divorce The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Rugrats Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Something Positive Tom Jones (singer) Tupac Shakur Recurring South Park characters Melanie Wilkes Charles Lee Ray Pepper Ann Cartman Joins NAMBLA Phil of the Future Family Guy True Crime: Streets of LA Good Charlotte One Life to Live Married... with Children Phoebe Halliwell Teamo Supremo Paige Matthews Spice Girls Arjuna Eric Cartman Internalism and externalism Calvin and Hobbes The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Laura Schlessinger Caillou Sharon Stone Neighbours EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Social rule Sami Brady The Catcher in the Rye Dancing at Lughnasa Can't Hardly Wait Silent Night, Deadly Night Hall & Oates Harle Britney Spears
