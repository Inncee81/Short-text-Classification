conception ok i have a dumb question please don't be rude i am new at being pregnant so here it is conception when does that happen meaning is it right when you have sex or what thanks for answering p s my conception date was the th of may conception is when the sperm meets the egg if you're lucky it could be a few hours after you had sex but for most women it's a day or after you had sex what happens is that once the egg is released it can only stay alive for hours which is not much but sperm can stay alive inside you for several days so for example you could have had sex days ago the egg is released today and the conception would be shortly after that Pregnancy Abortion debate Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Ocean's Twelve Social rule Sexual reproduction Married... with Children Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Birth control Infertility Homunculus Sexual orientation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertilisation Miscarriage Game show Emergency contraception Futurama (TV series - season 5) George Costanza Ovum Dead Like Me The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Parthenogenesis Pornographic movie Spermatozoon Old wives' tale EastEnders Jam (TV series) Sex and the City 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Limp Bizkit The Children of Men Death Gene Simmons Orgasm Samuel Goldwyn Kill Bill Ploidy Young Earth creationism Human Billboard Hot 100 Twin Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Shark Man The chicken or the egg Strap-on dildo Same-sex marriage Easter egg (virtual) Teenage pregnancy Boom Town (Doctor Who) Gamete Ovulation Housefly Sex Sexual intercourse Feminism Little Britain Spanish verbs Oral sex Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Scientology beliefs and practices Spider Meaning of life Survivor (novel) Origin belief The Smoking Room Boston Public The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Charles Manson Joke Jennifer Lopez Sexual dimorphism Whaling The Ark in Space Satanic ritual abuse Sperm Whale Edward's syndrome Neighbours Dragons (Pern) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Human sexual behavior Artificial insemination Puberty Radio Yerevan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Megadeth American lobster Drosophila melanogaster Ron and Fez Madonna (entertainer) Sonic the Hedgehog The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan My Sassy Girl Big Brother UK series 6 Phoebe Buffay's songs
