couple questions about pregnancy and miscarriage i found out i was pregnant on when i went to my first visit with the obgyn they said that they couldn't see anything and i was having a miscarriage around weeks i did a few days later pass some blood a few days i was bleeding my question is how do i know that everything has for sure passed also i have still not got my period my last concern is my boobs just started feeling sore again is it possible i am pregnant again without even getting my period can i even get pregnant if everything has not passed yet what does it look like when you have a miscarriage at weeks is it just blood sorry for all the questions i am new at this a miscarriage at six weeks would be almost exactly like a regular period yes you could have ovulated again and gotten pregnant right away i miscarried at weeks and my period got right back on track the thing is you'll have to wait for quite a few more weeks to test since hormones from the miscarriage might still be in your system if you take a pregnancy test Miscarriage Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Pregnancy test Abortion Pelvic inflammatory disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Gynecologic hemorrhage Twin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma In vitro fertilisation Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Morning sickness Estrus cycle Human chorionic gonadotropin Birth control Gynaecology Breastfeeding Neighbours Chemical abortion The Inside Vaginal bleeding Cytomegalovirus Turner syndrome Stomach cancer Psoriasis Abortion debate Prostate cancer Antiphospholipid syndrome Intact dilation and extraction Friends Ovarian cyst EastEnders Urinary incontinence Tocopherol Coeliac disease Emergency contraception Folic acid Premature birth Infertility Schapelle Corby Stroke Glen Jacobs Prenatal diagnosis Gonorrhoea Habitual abortion Hypertension Tour de France Lucille Ball Anne Boleyn Puberty Ectopic pregnancy Oral sex Ovarian cancer Progesterone Ben Johnson (athlete) Caffeine Dinah Marler Ovulation Diabetic retinopathy Anemia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Mary Shelley Kurt Cobain Maprotiline Niddah Marilyn Monroe Obstetrical hemorrhage Stillbirth Blood on the Tracks Big Brother UK series 6 Abortion in the United States Endometrial cancer Traumatic brain injury Graves-Basedow disease Liza of Lambeth Knots Landing Ebola Group A streptococcal infection Drug test Parvovirus B19 Prolactinoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Religion and abortion Blood type Roe v.
