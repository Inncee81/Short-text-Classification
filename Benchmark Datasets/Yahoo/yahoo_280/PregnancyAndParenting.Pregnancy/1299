pregnancy pain i am weeks along and i have been having severe pains in my lower stomach not constantly but through out most of the day i was just wondering if this is normal the pains in your lower abdomen are most likely caused from your ligaments stretching this is actually quite common during the first trimester and some say even between and weeks when your uterus is beginning to push out at the tissues surrounding it the pain can be really severe i know i've had them with my pregnancies and it can be scary when you start feeling these pains sit and rest for a while try moving more fluidly and avoid jerky movements the pain should go away after a few weeks some people take tylenol to relieve the pain but i would suggest trying to relieve the pain without medication if you are still concerned give your doctor a call i suggest doing so anyway just to be sure especially if there are any signs of bleeding Obstetrics Pregnancy Miscarriage Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Endometriosis Urinary incontinence Childbirth Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Paracetamol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breech birth Premature birth Intact dilation and extraction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fecal incontinence Diabetic retinopathy Paget's disease of bone Uterus First aid Cancer Group A streptococcal infection Cirrhosis Stenberg v.
