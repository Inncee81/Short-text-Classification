when to tell your family i'll be weeks along tomorrow we already know the sex of the child etc but i havent told any of my family i already have an almost year old that was born right before my th bday so i had a really bad experience with my mother's response that time the rest of my family was very supportive including my father i don't want to go through the stress and bad moods that come along with hearing what my mother has to say when should i tell my family how should i tell them i basically just want to tell my mother i'm pregnant and if you arent happy for us then dont say anything at all but she always makes everything about her and starts crying like i ruined her life i'm wondering if it would be really wrong for me just not to say anything until it's almost time i didn't show much with my first and even though we live close we don't see each other a ton so if i avoided her she probably wouldnt realize yes this child has the same father and no contrary to popular belief not eveyone thinks that marriage is a must financially it's better for me not to take that step at this time while i'm finishing college to stay on my dads insurance rather than what my job offers because my son has dealt with speech delays and things which ends up being pretty expensive and my insurance wouldnt cover any of it and yes i realize that most people don't wait this long to say anything which was pretty much the basis of my question but at the same time when you bring home a child noobody is going to look at the child and say you're making a bad choice but for some reason during pregnancy they think it's ok thanks to all of the people who haven't tried to give me a lecture on marriage well you know your mother the best however waiting to tell her until you are in the hospital or coming home with another child might cause additional problems you are now older and if you have done a good job raising your first child then she will probably be more likely to accept this situation if you are really excited then share it with her if she gives you a negative response then put your relationship on the back burner for a while also keep in mind that you don't want your mom to get frustrated with your new baby a few more months might help her come to grips with the fact that you are having another miracle and hopefully she will come to accept this and be happy for both you and the father EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Ashlee Simpson Show Adoption Laura Schlessinger Divorce Kodocha About a Boy Health insurance Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Procrastination Friends Pitaten Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Time Out of Mind Hillary Rodham Clinton Neighbours Fathers' rights Avenue Q Everwood Jon Secada Sharon Tate Marilyn Monroe Boston Public Transsexuality Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Theodicy Cindy Sheehan Kender Goodness and value theory Stuttering Melanie Wilkes Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Married... with Children T'Pol Appeasement Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Scenes from a Memory Alcoholics Anonymous The Shining (film) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jennifer Lopez Nicomachean Ethics Alois Hitler Mojave people Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Singlish History of As the World Turns (2000-present) New York Giants Utilitarianism Sant Thakar Singh Microeconomics The nature of God in Western theology Pregnancy Whitney Houston Charles Dickens Breastfeeding Poker jargon G-Man (Half-Life) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Elvis and Me Rent (musical) Vernon Schillinger 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Children of Dune United Kingdom corporation tax 1957 World Series Transactional analysis John the Baptist Calvin and Hobbes Ethics Grandview, U.S.A.
