could something be wrong when i first found out i was pregnant at weeks i had a urinary tract infection i was given antiboitics for it and after i finished taking them i didnt feel like it was gone so a couple of weeks later i went back to the doctor and they told me my urine had no bacteria in it whatsoever and that my body was just getting used to the changes during pregnancy well i dont go back to the doctor till next week and im weeks along now im still having some problems my urine is a dark color its hazy looking and has kind of a strong oder to it and right after i use the bathroom i still feel like i have to go if i drink water all day long its not that bad but i mainly have the problem in the mornings after not drinking anything all night my advice to you would be to relay exactly what you stated in this question to your doctor express your concerns feelings of the urge to go even after you've already gone continue to drink lots of water and try to stay away from any colored liquids drink only clear non caffienated beverages pregnancy is tough the first one especially because there are so many changes going on with your body and you don't know what to make of them it could actually turn out to be nothing but don't be afraid to ask i ts your body your baby Urinary incontinence Urine Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Cystoscopy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Friends Gonorrhoea Fecal incontinence Miscarriage Knots Landing Urinary system Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cytomegalovirus Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Social rule Medicine Jam (TV series) Folic acid Caffeine Guinea pig Urination Alcoholic beverage Urinary tract infection Menstrual cycle Stomach cancer Obstetrics Birth control Tour de France Cephalexin Hyperthermia Jon Secada Theory of conduct Marathon (sport) Avenue Q Ethanol Schistosomiasis Endometriosis In vitro fertilisation Boom Town (Doctor Who) Time Out of Mind Elephant The Parting of the Ways Lucille Ball Housebreaking Escherichia coli Everwood Premature birth Drug test Kidney stone Big Brother UK series 6 Another Side of Bob Dylan Liza of Lambeth Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Adjustable gastric band Alcoholism Ted Kennedy Drink Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Ben Johnson (athlete) Muscle Breech birth Futurama (TV series - season 2) Chlorine Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
