my parents are thowing me a baby shower when i am wks is that to early in my pregnany no i had a baby shower at weeks usually that is the ideal time to have a baby shower because during the last couple months of pregnancy you will just be anxious to meet your new little one and will have a lot of other things occupying your thoughts like delivery and labor and whether you have the baby room ready and is the house clean enough to bring a baby home too etc having a baby shower will help you get ready for the baby so that all those other thoughts can be the ones you focus on and not how am i going to get thank you notes written with everything else just relax and have fun at your baby shower you deserve it Childbirth Pregnancy Breastfeeding Breech birth Social rule Premature birth Urinary incontinence Prenatal diagnosis Sento Postpartum depression Infant Bringing It All Back Home The Apprentice 2 Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate EastEnders Friends Melanie Wilkes Elvis and Me The Family from One End Street Blood on the Tracks Feminists for Life Elephant Abortion Niddah Sharon Tate Sauna Sudden infant death syndrome Obstetrics Phoebe Buffay's songs Sex and the City Meteor shower Charles Darwin's illness Bristol Grammar School Changeroom Drawn Together Slow Train Coming Abortion in the United States The Catcher in the Rye Psycho Big Brother UK series 6 Gay bathhouse Seven (film) Child sexuality Garfield Ex-gay Miscarriage Gwen Stefani Customs and etiquette of Japan Fancy Crane Midwifery Jon Secada Neighbours Bathing Knots Landing Babe Carey Stillbirth The Beatles discography Jam (TV series) Mental retardation Onam Childfree Max Martin One Life to Live John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Key West, Florida Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Philip J.
