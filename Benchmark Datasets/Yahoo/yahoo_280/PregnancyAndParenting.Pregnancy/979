to all those who believe in abortion why would you not want to just have your baby then put it up for adoption wouldn't you rather see a young couple who are not able to have children and would love nothing more than to be able to bring a baby into their lives to love and care for adopt your baby as opposed to killing your own flesh and blood if you are not mentally physically or financially ready to have a baby then you aren't ready for sex it's not the babies fault that the circumstances are such as rape faulty birth control etc the heart starts beating at weeks it's a baby just because you are selfish and don't want to give the baby a fighting chance at life doesn't mean you aren't murdering your baby you had sex you need to be responsible if you were raped it doesn't mean that there will be something wrong with the baby it's not the baby's fault so adoption is the only choice Abortion debate Prenatal diagnosis Theory of conduct Birth control Knots Landing Abortion in the United States Abortion Friends Adoption Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marriage Vernon Schillinger Laura Schlessinger Jon Secada Domestic violence Anti-abortion movement Humphrey Bogart Daredevil Days of our Lives Neighbours Frankie Laine Infantilism Tupac Shakur Sex and the City Sin City Evil Jam (TV series) Sex-selective abortion and infanticide YuYu Hakusho Serial killer Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Capital punishment Androgen insensitivity syndrome Statutory rape Rape John Howard Yoder One Life to Live Childbirth Religion and abortion All My Children Something Positive Partial-birth abortion John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Inside Teenage pregnancy Street-Legal Zoophilia Charmed Ten Commandments Kurt Cobain Marilyn Monroe Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Aileen Wuornos Premature birth Pitaten Drawn Together Kodocha Alignment (role-playing games) Characters in the Smurfs Little Snow Fairy Sugar History of As the World Turns (2000-present) North American Man/Boy Love Association 2004 Republican National Convention Social rule Time Out of Mind Theodicy Meaning of life Children of God Pregnancy The McGuire Sisters Polyamory Michel Henry Alcoholics Anonymous Luke and Laura Spencer John the Baptist My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Fetus Childfree Eugenics Moral Politics Child abuse Religion and sexuality Paradox Murder Ja Rule Characters of Lost Anne Rice Romulus and Remus Infanticide Kyle Broflovski Miscarriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Simone Weil Tom Jones (singer) True Crime: Streets of LA Infant Pedophilia
