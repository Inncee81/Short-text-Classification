i found a bottle of whiskey bourbon in my basement does anyone know about appraising antique bottles it is a glass decaunter and it has decorative stars cut into the glass it has a glass cork and the original label that says harim walker sons i don't know how old it is or how much its worth any info would be helpful i don't know a lot about appraising bottles but harim walker and sons has been discontinued for some time i recommend looking into either of the two websites the whiskey auction will pull more money than ebay ever could if it is sealed with possibly its original container and still in decent condition i'd say it would fetch a minimum old decanter's alone in decent condition can go for flea market prices for the more common ones hope this helped also once it has been removed from the barrel distilled spirits unlike wine do not continue to age Beer Soft drink Maple syrup Cider Coffee Rum Sugar Alcoholic beverage Candy Wine making Single malt Scotch Moonshine Food preservation Homebrewing Horehound Sugar beet German cuisine Tea Champagne (beverage) Sake Ethanol Wheat beer Coca-Cola Lambic Sugarcane Wine Root beer Turkish coffee Bread Lemonade Japanese cuisine Brewing Sucrose Halva Carbon dioxide Tofu Scotch whisky Jewish cuisine Water Ketchup Grog Mojito Chewing gum Sangr__a Yerba mate PHP Alcoholic proof Density Ice cream The Coca-Cola Company Guinness Soap bubble Starch Acetic acid Vinegar Concentration Peruvian cuisine Canadian slang Ammonia Agar plate Hop (plant) Carbonated water Idli Alum Hamster Dr Pepper Disinfection Prohibition Dishwasher Fanta Corn syrup Diet soda Malt liquor Sulfuric acid Vores __l Ethylene glycol Bong Bladderwort Street food Baby bottle Draught beer Sauna Cuisine of Singapore Collodion process Water purification Beer Pong Benedict's reagent Water (molecule) Cuisine of the Philippines The Jesus and Mary Chain Pisco Barq's Solvent Popcorn Pottery
