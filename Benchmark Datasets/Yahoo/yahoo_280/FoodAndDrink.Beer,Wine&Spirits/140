mixing my alcohol i don't drink that much maybe once or twice a week if i get the opportunity i'll go out and have a few whatevers with friends usually i'm a big snob i like good wine i like i'm sorry to say and so is my wallet expensive beer and i'm rather exclusive about it too blue moon honeyweiss and i like top shelf vodka in my cocktails grey goose i refuse to drink skohl i know stupid snob so here's my problem recently when i've been out if i have have more than one type of alcohold beer wine wine hard liquer i'm always sick the next day no matter how little i have no matter in what quantities yes i've followed the rhymes but still everyone tells me the mixing alcohols thing is an old wives tale is it just a tolerance thing can anyone settle this once and for all so i can stop getting ill i'm afraid to drink wine now because someone said i'm simply sensetive to red wine and wine is my favorite thans david v but i like to experience all my alcohol the grey goose doesn't get mixed with syrup about the girliest most complicated thing i order is a classic vodka martini olives i like to taste alcohol first off the rhymes are true i've found that if i start with beer i have to stick with it if i start with booze i can change to beer at any time and then change back it may just be in my head but i know it works for me i have and still can drink an entire liter of bourbon and still go to work the next day but if i drink beer before i'm praying to the porclion god as far as wine i don't really like it too fruity but i would put it in the same catagory as beer so don't make your first drink wine or beer unless you plan on staying with it by the way have you tried honey brown it's very good Vodka Beer Wine Alcoholic beverage Rum Moe Szyslak Pisco Prohibition Cocktail German cuisine Alcoholism Martini cocktail Humphrey Bogart Sake Soft drink Sin City Korean cuisine Cider French cuisine Brewing Time Out of Mind Homer Simpson Drinking culture Champagne (beverage) Cuisine of the Philippines Vinegar Brewery Muslim ibn Aqeel The Beach Boys Distilled beverage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Marshall Mathers LP Gin Coffee Mnemonic Cliff Richard The Catcher in the Rye Jennifer Lopez Miller Brewing Microeconomics Mead Liam Gallagher RuneScape quests Red Bull Sauna New Coke Characters in the Smurfs Ty Cobb Breastfeeding Jewish cuisine Street-Legal Fasting Australian words Traumatic incident reduction President (game) Radio Yerevan Billboard Hot 100 Bread Theory of conduct Oasis (band) James Bond Bar (establishment) Gluten-free diet Wine making Root beer Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Grog Lemonade Spidey Super Stories Roman eating and drinking Alcohol fuel The Time Machine Cuisine of Austria Guinness Eastern Orthodox Church German wine The Wizard of Id Blood on the Tracks Cuisine of Greece Eucharist I Am the Walrus Cultural Revolution Oktoberfest Remix Michael Garibaldi
