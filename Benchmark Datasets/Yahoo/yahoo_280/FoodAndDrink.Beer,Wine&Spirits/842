i turn on friday what should my first legal drink be my st birthday is just around the corner and i am having a hard time deciding what that infomous first drink should be first things first it should be something you enjoy if you already know you don't like something don't go for it just because it's there really though i'd avoid anything fruity or complicated etc sugary drinks are asking for a hangover complicated drinks will just annoy the bartender and make it impossible to taste just about anything the rest of the night welcome yourself into the rest of your life with style stick to the simple and pure classics they're classics for a reason think the classic cocktail like a martini or a manhattan these are serious drinks and then go and have whatever you feel like but for god's sake watch out for the tequila that stuff will sneak in and rob you of your mind Bong Plastic Glass Curling Milk Dundas Square Fiberglass Solar power Champagne (beverage) Rise of Nations Beer Pong Station wagon Stereoscopy Drill bit Uniform Resource Locator Quarters Sake Solar cell Coffee Explosive material Drinking culture Hong Kong-style milk tea Soap bubble Beer Bottle Shotgun shell Shell (projectile) Tuff Wine Dairy Cider Harmonica Sunglasses Eyepiece Ceramics Australian English Key (lock) Heinkel He 111 Guinness Laser engraving Internal ballistics Saxophone Wood Lacrosse Cardboard Rum Chevrolet Corvette Inertial confinement fusion Casting Refrigerator Tokusatsu Vickers Valiant Door Alcohol advertising London Brian May Cross-country skiing Ultraviolet Tea Shen Gong Wu Philip Glass British Columbia USS Trigger (SS-237) Tallboy bomb Nalgene Google bomb Messerschmitt Me 262 Violin Lightstick Liger Zero Menstrual cup Silicon Glasses Naval mine Beersheba B-47 Stratojet Vacuum tube Handloading Gramophone record Polyethylene terephthalate Tire Quarashi Hitler's death Alanis Morissette Website Battle of the beams Grey Cup Hash table Australian words Irn-Bru General Dynamics F-111 Solar variation Peruvian cuisine Douglas DB-7 Bomber Belgian beer Turquoise Compact disc Moonshine
