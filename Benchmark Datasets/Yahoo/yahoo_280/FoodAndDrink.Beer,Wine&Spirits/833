why do bottles of tequila contain worms occassionaly my answer would have been part it's a common misconception that tequila bottles contain worms it's forbidden by law however bottles of the drink mescal similar to tequila and also made in mexico usually contain worms the worm traditionally used is a kind of caterpillar that lives in the stems of agave plants from which mescal is made these reddish coloured worms can be quite rare and at times white worms from the leaves of the plant are used instead the practice of adding worms to bottles of mescal started in the s when a mexican named jacobo lazano paez found the addition of a worm changed the taste and colour of the drink and he decided to include worms as a marketing gimmick despite popular belief the practice hasn't been a mexican tradition for centuries my answer would have been part considered a delicacy by mexicans the worm is supposed to be eaten and is thought by some to have aphrodisiac qualities some also believe the worm gives strength to those who eat it and that it's hallucinogenic however apart from any psychological effects the worm might have in reality it's merely a worm saturated in alcohol genuine tequila never has worms inside the bottle however there's another alcoholic beverage made out of the same plant that is called mezcal which is a little bit stronger and this one does have a worm in the bottom of the bottle always this is just tradition i don't think it modifies the taste in any way but it's just fun to see whether the person drinking the last drops of mezcal will be brave enough to eat the worm too or not that's all they do it for those worms grow in the same plant that the beverage is extracted from Delicatessen Fred Meyer Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington Upper West Side Seattle, Washington Supermarket Coffeehouse Prohibition Beer Kensington Market Bellevue, Washington Chinatown Wall Street Queen Anne, Seattle, Washington Redmond, Washington Portland, Oregon King County, Washington Alcoholic beverage Sears Holdings Corporation Pacific, Missouri Public house Nordstrom Pike Place Market Milwaukee, Wisconsin Quezon City Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005) Liquor store Woolworths Limited Kroger Uwajimaya Brewery Aldi Soft drink Wine Grand Forks, North Dakota Convenience store Starbucks University Village, Seattle, Washington Edge city Liquor Control Board of Ontario World music Indianapolis, Indiana Microbrew Chinatown, Los Angeles, California Retailer Lake Washington Cigar Eastside University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Spadina Avenue University of Washington Diamond University District, Seattle, Washington Chinatowns in North America Royal Tunbridge Wells Whitman College Koreatown Tesco U.S. Highway 1 Chester Seattle Public Schools Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California Puget Sound New York University German cuisine Wedgwood, Seattle, Washington Wallingford, Seattle, Washington Seattle neighborhoods Wal-Mart Bulk vending South African Breweries Marshall Field's Brewers Retail Inc.
