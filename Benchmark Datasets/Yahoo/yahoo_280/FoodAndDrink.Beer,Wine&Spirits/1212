why does ice melt in alcohol so fast i know the freezing points are different but isn't there another reason basic thermodynamics the ice begins pulling heat energy from the alcohol it is not the ice cooling the alcohol it is the alcohol that transfers heat to the ice solid water the ice draws heat from the warmer alcohol inducing the ice to melt this is because the freezing point of the alcohol is much lower than the ice if we were to keep the ice in the glass by adding more the rate of melting of the ice would slow because the heat energy loss of the alcohol has been reduced but it would indeed continue to draw heat from the alcohol just more slowly this of course would require no atmosphere heat energy from contacting either the ice or the alcohol if we had solid co dry ice it could draw enough energy heat from the alcohol to freeze it solid this of course would require no atmosphere heat energy from contacting either the ice or the alcohol plus a lot of dry ice to replace what has melted or sublimated away Website HyperText Transfer Protocol World Wide Web Web server Apache HTTP Server Uniform Resource Locator HTTP cookie Domain name Wget Wireless Application Protocol Denial-of-service attack Virtual hosting Cross site scripting Representational State Transfer Squid cache Taxi Driver Web browser Uniform Resource Identifier San Jose Earthquakes Web crawler Typosquatting System of a Down JavaServer Pages Web cache Web service CPAN Ajax (programming) Republic Pictures Internet Spyware Port numbers Phishing Intranet Internet censorship in mainland China Gmail MSN Messenger Judo at the 2004 Summer Olympics Mydoom Proxy server Remote procedure call Domain Name System Slash (punctuation) Thumbnail gallery post Fremont, California Depeche Mode Google Web Accelerator WebDAV Genealogy Electronic commerce Winamp Software agent Internet Information Services Burzum MySpace HTML Jeep Deep linking WebSphere Wiki Television network Alex Jones (journalist) Web traffic Monster Rancher monsters Country club Computer Geocaching BitTorrent Apache Software Foundation Internet privacy Gopher protocol SAML Bbc.co.uk Web portal LiveJournal Google Java Servlet Patricia Ford Mecca Slayers Warner Bros.
