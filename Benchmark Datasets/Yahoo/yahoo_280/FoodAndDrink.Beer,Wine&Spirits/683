kegerators how to keep it from sticking sometimes i'll go a few days without pouring a beer from my kegerator when i do again the handle sticks because beer gets stuck in the moving parts and gets crusty sometimes i'm afraid i'm gonna break the handle right off what can i do to keep it smooth and lubricated actually i think all kegerators are co operated as mine is if i had a hand pump it wouldn't make a difference because the beer would go back due to exposure to oxygen after a few hours regardless i have the co system and i still have the issue try replacing the faucet with a forward seal model in any case you should really clean the faucet every once in a while or at least soak the faucet in sanitizer Bottled water Water purification Water Sewage treatment Ethanol Alcoholic beverage Beer Rum Dasani Disinfection Coca-Cola Brewery Scotch whisky Single malt Scotch Organic certification NEWater Organic food Water resources Hydrogen peroxide Acetic acid Dr Pepper Coffee Energy development Plastic Swimming pool Perfume Wine Champagne (beverage) Sake Cacha__a Chlorine The Coca-Cola Company Dairy Organic farming Chocolate Kashrut Chlorination Trans fat 7 Up Illegal drug trade Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hydrochloric acid Tequila Milk Cider Nuclear power New Coke Moonshine Ammonia Autonomous building Alcohol fuel Metrication Healthy eating Sodium chloride Sea-Monkey Bong Drink Marine aquarium Waste management Methamphetamine Mercury (element) MP3 Trademark Port wine Alkane Guinness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sodium hypochlorite Prohibition International response to Hurricane Katrina Pisco Fountain Tea Pesticide Van Halen Vodka Sprite (soft drink) Food Cable television Renewable energy Intellectual property Hemp Sugar Cigarette Soft drink Hydrogen chloride Pharmaceutical company Local food Biodiesel Sulfuric acid Snapple Ozone State Microeconomics Helium
