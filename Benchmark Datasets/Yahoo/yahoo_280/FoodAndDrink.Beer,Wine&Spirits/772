is alcohol heathy or is it always harmful i think beer is bad for health but something like wine is it healthy to drink not to get drunk though breathing kills brain cells too alcohol in general is not just in drinks but also in foods such as sugar alcohols for sweeteners in candy alcohols also occur naturally in fruits which is why they make such good wine so labeling it as bad or evil or even unhealthy is wrong people are consuming small amounts of alcohol and they don't even know it however alcohol in copious amounts eventually makes your liver focus more on processing the alcohol than on the nutrients you are supposed to be getting this causes your body to become dehydrated and leaches essential vitamins and minerals from your body read hangover it also makes your liver work harder than it needs to thus limiting the lifespan of your liver it is true that a glass of wine a day might make you live longer what they don't tell you is that the same effect is achieved with a glass of vinegar a day but no one wants to drink vinegar beer dark not light has nutrients in the hops and when used as a meal supplement once a day is not horribly unhealthy but the same effect can be achieved with switching to whole wheat bread so it really comes down to human consumption and moderating what you eat or drink treat your body like an expensive automobile you might put a little alcohol in the gas tank for a friday night drag race but you wouldn't fill it up with alcohol to drive around town Smirnoff Vodka Absolut Vodka Royal Warrant Alcopop Yakov Smirnoff LOL (Internet slang) Lol Coxhill Orange Order Chiasmus Martini cocktail Diageo Michel Gondry Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Alcoholic beverage Pure Pwnage Salmiakki Koskenkorva A Clockwork Orange Branson, Missouri About a Boy Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold William Grant & Sons Ethylene glycol Koskenkorva Internet slang Judge Jules Bottle opener The Old Man and the Key Conquest: Frontier Wars 10cc St John's College, Cambridge Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) T.A.T.u.
