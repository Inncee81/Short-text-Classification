what does it take to open up a small bar i have an idea for a small bar and would like to open one up can someone tell me what it takes as far as licensing goes and how much investment it will take do i need to be a bartender to own a bar how much money can you expect to make your first year and what are the challenges first is a license the going price in my neighborhood is cash only it can not be encumbered by a lien from property or other assets also you must determine if one is available the liquor control commission allows each municipality to determine how many licenses are allowed by population your application also involves a criminal background check the license can only be in an individuals name no corporation don't even think about getting a dwi your license would be in jeopardy ok next is obvious such as location lease insurance etc cash for initial inventory expect a minimum of to start all subsequent orders must be paid in days if not all distributors will require cash only and a notice will be given to the liquor control board ok this is mostly a cash business the irs and the state knows this so pay your taxes they like to watch businesses that deal with a lot of cash also because it is mostly cash you have to have controls to make sure every drink is rung in the cash register there are many tricks around this you would be amazed ok inventory control liquor wine and beer is very expensive very easy to give away to patrons by over pouring or under ringing the minimum is once a week if there is a problem you can hopefully find it yes the bar business is very profitable and can be fun you have to be very much in control Hangover The Shining (film) Alcoholic beverage Chicken soup Vitamin Alcoholics Anonymous Placebo (band) Quaker Oats Company Disulfiram Gastroparesis Andrew Dice Clay Gatorade Jackass: The Movie Midnight Run Cannabis cultivation New York Giants Bacon Fertilizer Folic acid W.I.T.C.H.
