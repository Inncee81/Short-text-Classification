what is a widget i've just found a little ball inside my can of guinness which my mate has called a widget what i want to know is what is a widget and why is it in my guinness i found the us patent by guiness beer foam device no mention of widget perhaps it is in the original patent in britian us beverage package and a method of packaging a beverage containing gas in solution derwent title country us united states of america inventor forage alan j seer green united kingdom byrne william j mount merrion ireland assignee arthur guinness son company limited dublin ireland other patents from arthur guinness son company limited approx news profiles stocks and more about this company published filed application number us ipc code advanced b b b d b d u s class current abstract a beverage package and a method of packaging a beverage having gas preferably at least one of carbon dioxide and inert nitrogen gases in solution has a non resealable container within which is located a hollow pod having a restricted aperture in a side wall the container is charged with the beverage and sealed beverage from the main chamber of the container enters the pod shown at a by way of the aperture to provide headspaces a in the container and a in the pod gas within the headspaces a and a is at greater than atmospheric pressure preferably the beverage is drawn into the hollow pod by subjecting the package to a heating and cooling cycle upon opening the container by draw ring region the headspace a is vented to atmosphere and the pressure differential resulting from the pressure in the pod headspace a causes gas beverage to be ejected from the pod by way of the aperture into the beverage said ejection causes gas to be evolved from solution in the beverage in the main container chamber to form a head of froth on the beverage the pod is preferably formed by blow moulding and located as a press fit within the container which latter is preferably a can carton or bottle primary asst examiners richman barry s mcmahon timothy m first claim show all claims we claim a beverage package comprising a sealed non resealable container having a primary chamber containing beverage having gas in solution therewith and forming a primary headspace comprising gas at a pressure greater than atmospheric enclosure means defining a secondary chamber having a volume less than said primary chamber restrictor means defining a restricted orifice said secondary chamber communicating with the beverage in said primary chamber through said restricted orifice said secondary chamber containing beverage supplied thereto from the beverage in the primary chamber and having a secondary headspace therein comprising gas at a pressure greater than atmospheric so that the pressures within the primary and secondary chambers are substantially at equilibrium said container is openable to expose the primary headspace to atmospheric pressure and wherein the secondary chamber is arranged so that upon opening of the container the pressure differential caused by the decrease in pressure at the primary headspace causes beverage in the secondary chamber to be ejected by way of the restricted orifice into the beverage of the primary chamber and said ejection causes gas in the solution to be evolved and form or assist in the formation of a head of froth on the beverage how does the widget in a beer can work it is in your can of guinness becuase guinness brewery wants you to have a real ale experience it is a device that creates a proper head to your guinness soon other brewers will be using their own versions to answer this question first we need to discuss what makes beer fizzy and how a head forms most beers are carbonated with carbon dioxide co when the beer is in the can some of this co is dissolved in the beer and some is at the top of the can the co that is dissolved in the beer is what makes it fizzy when the can is closed the pressure inside is higher than the pressure outside so that when you open the can the sudden drop in pressure and the agitation of pouring causes some of the co to bubble out of solution forming a head on your beer a stout like guinness has a creamier longer lasting head than a canned lager beer in addition guinness is less fizzy than a regular lager beer guinness is canned with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen nitrogen is not absorbed into the beer nearly as well as carbon dioxide so even though a can of guinness may be at the same pressure as a can of lager it contains less co and is therefore less fizzy because the nitrogen makes up some of the pressure because a beer like guinness contains less dissolved co if you poured it from a can with no widget the head not be very thick because most of the co would stay dissolved the purpose of the widget is to release the co from some of the beer in the can to create the head the widget is a plastic nitrogen filled sphere with a tiny hole in it the sphere is added to the can before the can is sealed it floats in the beer with the hole just slightly below the surface of the beer the guinness widget note the cavity near the center of the ball the tiny hole is located within the cavity just before the can is sealed a small shot of liquid nitrogen is added to the beer this liquid nitrogen evaporates during the rest of the canning process and pressurizes the can as the pressure increases in the can beer is slowly forced into the sphere through the hole compressing the nitrogen inside the sphere when you open the can the pressure inside immediately drops the compressed gas inside the sphere quickly forces the beer out through the tiny hole into the can as the beer rushes through the tiny hole this agitation causes the co that is dissolved in the beer to form tiny bubbles that rise to the surface of the beer these bubbles help form the head Lemonade Soft drink Chocolate Candy Rum Alcoholic beverage Drink Ice cream Drinking culture Cocktail Vodka
