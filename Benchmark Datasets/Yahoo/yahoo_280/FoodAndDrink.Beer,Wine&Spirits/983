is it true what they say about being drunk and not remembering anything the next day i guess that's not true because for the first time ever just one month ago actually decided to get drunk just to see what it was like and i'm years old i was fully aware of everything around me what i was doing but with all my worries doubts and inhibitions completely gone and i was loose i drank six ounce bottles of sam adams and i thought i was gonna feel a little different more drunk of something i'm a guy i'm ' i'm in my s and i'm years old when i woke up the next morning i remember everything like i would if i were sober the night before the right side of my head was pounding a little like my ear was aching i felt nautious if i were to suddenly overexert myself was that a normal for a hangover or are there even worse hangovers than that i wouldn't mind if i never drank again not rememebering things from a night of over indulgance is common in most people it does not have anyting to do wih being an alcoholic or long term drinker your body's metabolism and everyone's is dfferent has a set limit in which it can tolerate alcohol at times of extreme binge drinking your immediate thoughts can become cloudy simple things like not remembering the name of the bar your in or what someone's name is that you just met an so on at this stage is where from then on out you will have a hard time remembering things you said or even did if you continue to drink past that intoxicated stage again not everyone's metabolism is the same so for all you nimrods that get off trying come off as billy badass because you downed a gallon of rum and did tequila shot chasers it's not impressive and does not makes you anymore manly given your size and weight beers won't really put you over the edge it is usually alcohol mixed drinks that can really get you messed up especialy if you consume a considerable amount in a short period of time if your concerned about getting that drunk don't worry you don't seem to have the perpensity to become a binge drinker if you like beer and you made a good choice in samuel adams then drink beer again someone's excess level varies according to metabolism and individuals weight just don't ry to down shots of jager in minutes and you will be okay yes hang overs can get much worse your body can only metabolize and dispose of drink per hour the more your drink and the type of alcohol can drastically change what type of hangover you get for me a tequila hangover is way worse than a bourbon one not sure why but for me it's horrible sweating incredible migranes weekness and sever nausea turned me off of tequila Whisky Dylan Thomas Glenfiddich Scotch whisky Rum Scotch Scotch College, Melbourne Straight edge Beer Scotch Plains, New Jersey Alcoholic beverage Single malt Scotch Scotch Game Ron White Genericized trademark Oliver Reed Rikki Fulton William Grant & Sons Education in Scotland Irn-Bru Drinking culture Drink Irish whiskey Roger Meddows-Taylor Guinness Daiquiri Grog Yorkshire Terrier Manhattan cocktail Small beer Martini cocktail Diageo Humphrey Bogart Four Knights Game Lyndon B.
