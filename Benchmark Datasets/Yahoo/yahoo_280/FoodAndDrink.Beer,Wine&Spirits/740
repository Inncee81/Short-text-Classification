i feel stupid but how do you play beer pong trippy cup and quarters its played with two teams you each have ten cups that you make into a triangle all of them have a shot or more of beer but one has the money shot which is almost a full beer each team stands on opposite sides of the table just like ping pong and each person sees if they can throw the ping pong ball into the shot of beer if the person on the other team makes it into one of your glasses you drink it you win if the other team runs out of cups before your team does and then the loosing team has to drink the rest of your beer i think you can go on line for the step by step instructions but its really a fun game oh and the best cups are the solo cups the red or blue ones Bong Air pollution Asbestos Fire Xenon Methanol Smoking pipe Plutonium Carbon dioxide Nuclear weapon design Particulate Fire fighting Cocaine Hookah Tobacco Nuclear thermal rocket Charcoal Rebreather Helium Technetium Lighter Coal Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Asthma Furnace Uranium Nuclear fallout Solvent Gas tungsten arc welding Tank Combustion Torpedo Firefighter Haloalkane Radon Balloon (aircraft) Carbon Tobacco smoking Inhalant Lung Cannabis (drug) Mojave people Cigar Beryllium Pebble bed reactor Alpha particle Diving regulator Gasoline Kirby's Dream Land 2 Bird Portable stove Cracking (chemistry) Ionizing radiation Barbecue Solar power Vaporizer Hydrogen economy Smoke-screen Kretek Depleted uranium Campfire Town gas Steam engine Breath Explosive material Inertial confinement fusion Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Cyanide Cigarette Nitrous oxide High explosive anti-tank Engine knocking Greenhouse Fuel efficiency Nicotine Turbocharger Glossary of wildland fire terms Spacecraft propulsion Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tank classification William Murdoch Methamphetamine Hybrid vehicle Cuba Flash (comics) 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Poison Enriched uranium Internal combustion engine Kiln Hot air balloon Forge Anti-aircraft warfare Carbine Wood Carburetor Transformer Hashish Hand grenade Magnesium
