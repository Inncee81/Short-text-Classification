what about dark beer is it like coffee i love iced coffee and i drink beer a little my friend said that i might like dark beer because it is like a cold coffee he he right yes let me explain beer is made from water as is coffee malted barley hops and yeast the barley and or malted barley is roasted as coffee is this roasting browns the grain the more roasting time and higher temperatures produce a darker grain the result is tan often called crystal malt brown often called chocolate malt and black called black patent malt sorry for the delay phone by using a small percentage of these grains the brewer can make dark beer the flavors imparted to the beer are carmel roasted nut like chocolate and coffee so to an extent beer can have coffee like flavor try a porter style as it will be less heavy with these flavored and if you like that try a stout stouts have a stronger dark or coffee flavor also today the craziness of adding flavors to beer has produced a coffee beer the make it by using coffee in the beer so i would say your friend is correct enjoy Grog Rum The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Smile (album) Jon Secada Maldives Water Banjo-Kazooie One Piece minor characters Hip hop collaborations Rum-running The Temptations Hall & Oates International Talk Like a Pirate Day Climate of the United Kingdom Super Mario 64 Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson Aubrey-Maturin series Yohoho!
