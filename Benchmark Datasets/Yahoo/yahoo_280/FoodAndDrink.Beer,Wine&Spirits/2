how do i smoke cigars when i smoke cigars alot of times i dont taste any of the flavor am i doing it wrong how do i get more flavor out of my cigar are they too dry too wet taking puffs too often what i am doing wrong wow it is quite obvious that people answer questions in this forum who have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about the subject matter first you must select a cigar that has been properly kept what i mean by that is a cigar must be held in a controlled environment at a specific humidity range usually between humidity this is done using a humidor if you do not have a humidor you can use a wood glass or plastic container that can be sealed to make your own humidor take a folded paper towel and soak it with distilled water you can buy a gallon at wal mart for cents place the soaked paper towel in an unsealed sandwich baggy inside the container the distilled water will evaporate inside the container making it humid and keeping the cigar fresh when the paper towel dries repeat the process this will ensure your cigar is properly humidified and will change the taste dramatically there is a huge difference between a properly stored cigar and a dry one your cigar will dry out if you just leave it on a shelf for a few days in your house when smoking a cigar simply draw the smoke into your mouth and release there is no time limit for keeping the smoke in your mouth contrary to what the other person said when drawing smoke from the cigar make sure you do not have to suck on it if you do then the cigar is wrapped to tight and you should roll it through your fingers to loosen up the binder to allow a better draw most everything about smoking a cigar is personal preference the point of smoking a cigar is to enjoy fine tobacco the taste aroma etc the taste is much better if the cigar has been properly stored or fresh the only way a cigar can be too wet is if you dip it in liquid some cigar smokers do dip their cigars in a fine cognac for added flavor however i would not recommend this due to the possiblility of damaging the cigar if you aren't sure how to do it as for the puffs again this is personal preference but as a general rule one puff per minute keeps the cigar from going out so i hope that answers your questions and enjoy your fine cigars they are truly a pleasure if you know what you are doing hang in there and good luck Humidor Bong Cigarette Tofu Rum Cannabis cultivation Menstrual cup Smoking pipe Casting Hookah Wine Tobacco smoking Water Champagne (beverage) Textile manufacturing Brewery Milk Sake Barbecue Handloading Manicure Hamster Single malt Scotch Floppy disk Puff pastry Smoking ban Pisco Sauna Alcoholic beverage Bacon Scotch whisky Fire extinguisher Moonshine Chocolate Tea Condom Contract Carnivorous plant Blunt (drug culture) Microeconomics Upholstery Cocaine Fiberglass Humidity Agar plate Poker jargon Mattress Coriander Soldering Concrete Cuisine of the Philippines Papal election Common cold Alcohol fuel Theory of conduct Houseplant Air conditioning Hyperthermia Vinegar Ham Food preservation Paint Clarinet Thermal power station Cancer Campfire Pottery Gasoline E85 Brandy Vanilla White phosphorus incendiary Drowning Knife Chili con carne Paper towel Lake District Instant coffee Violin In-N-Out Burger Cello Cantonese cuisine Fishing Sauerkraut
