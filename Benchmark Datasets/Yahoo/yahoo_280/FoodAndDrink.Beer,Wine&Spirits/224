turning need a good drink i am turning and i would like to have a 'signature drink' that isn't too strong and that isn't beer any suggestions the mojito is my favorite but its not always easy to find a bar that stocks fresh mint leaves and without the fresh mint its a waste if you want something really light a wine spritzer is white wine and club soda the malibu and pineapple is also a good choice tastes like a pina colda but its very sweet and i find i can't drink more than a couple two other choices are an amaretto sour and a sloe gin fizz both are on the light side and have a nice taste give them all a try not on the same night and decide which you like the best Wine Fanta Alcoholic beverage Soft drink Rum Vinegar Gin Cuisine of Denmark Tea Beer Basic taste Cuisine of the Philippines Bong Mojito Pisco Kit Kat Bread German cuisine Lemonade Cuisine of Laos Chocolate Sake Peruvian cuisine Mint Cider Vodka Korean cuisine Lambic Breakfast Carbon dioxide Pineapple Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Sloe gin Russian cuisine Sage Carbonated water Laksa Convenience store Cha chaan teng Guinness Coffee Public house Columbo McDonald's Cadbury Schweppes Plastic Word of Wisdom Humphrey Bogart French cuisine Klingon Tofu In-N-Out Burger The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Cuisine of Malaysia Diet soda Drink Lime (fruit) Jones Soda Yoghurt Spanish cuisine Coca-Cola Mountain Dew Port wine Cocktail Shaggy dog story Martini cocktail New Coke Bock Punch (drink) Cantonese cuisine Barq's Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of Austria Ron and Fez Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Long Island Iced Tea Vending machine The Catcher in the Rye Alcoholics Anonymous Expert system OK Soda Theory of conduct Champagne (beverage) Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Japanese cuisine Ale Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Aftertaste Hiberno-English Acid Pitaten Moonshine Drinking culture Frankie Vaughan Polish cuisine The Inside Shasta (soft drink) Cold Stone Creamery
