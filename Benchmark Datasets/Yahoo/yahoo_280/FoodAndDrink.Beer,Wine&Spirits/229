i'm american but why do people waste their time with weak american beer with no good beer flavor i like american beer but it just isn't enough for me we must take all things in context i answered another question similar to yours yesterday and it went like this with a few additions a few examples of good american beers budweiser busch coors anchor brewing's steam anchor porter anchor wheat sierra nevada brewing's pale ale porter wheat boston brewing co's samuel adams wheat triple bock there are many more selections of good american beers as well it is a matter of taste we all have different tastes in both food and beverage i like most any beer although i prefer belgian trappist beers the most should i laugh and scoff at those that make or drink sam adams or budweiser i drink those also becuase it does not have the fuller pungent flavors of my beer of choice i also like continental pilsener but there is always some level of flavor loss with importation there exists more choices and tastes with the beers brewed by craft brewers these days ask yourself if you like liver many people love it where many others think it disgusting it is a matter of taste speaking from a professional perspective anheuser busch has some of the highest quality of beers in the usa world is it marketing perhaps but if someone was selling dead skunk juice and had funny and entertaining commercials during your favorite show would you buy the skunk juice it is highly likey that you would not so it must be more perhaps the laws of supply and demand people demand something light flavored beers and an interprising individual makes it anheuser bush uses the freshest ingriedents in the industry they important the highly desired and prized noble hop variety hallertau from germany when they say they know of no other beer that cost as much to produce it is fact compare the choices of beers including light beers to the variety of soda lime in soda caffeine in water people want it and someone is drinking them or they would not last long the sulfer that people smell and perhaps taste in miller beers is dimethyl sulfide dms it is a vegatable corn like aeromatic compound that is derived from the corn grits that miller uses in its beer the very reason anheuser busch and coors uses rice rice has a much cleaner flavor profile again a matter of taste the national brewing companies enjoy so much success for many reasons some of these reasons include history quality mass appeal marketing light beers as for a light beer being made for people that do not like the taste of beer i say no actually there is some truth to that but it is over simplified to say that also consider a reduction in calories and originally a slight reduction in alcohol it does have the taste of beer to those trained in the sensory analysis of beer but it is true that the lighter subtle flavor profile appeals to many many beer drinkers bottom line to me is enjoy all beers for what they are a wonderfully refreshing malt beverage tastes will vary don't sweat it enjoy pitboss while you say not to blanket craft brewers as included in american beers i say do not balnket the large brewers it tells me by your statment that you know little about beer anheuser busch uses the freshest ingerdients in the industry they import hallertau hops from germany they have teams of professionsl brewmasters that rival any in the world marketing i they marketed skunk piss would you by it being the leadiing brewer in the u s is due to more of a quality product than marketing Anheuser-Busch Hop (plant) Samuel Adams (beer) Soft drink Bread Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) Rum Sake American lager Bock Wheat beer Homebrewing Guinness Vinegar Wine Porter (beer) Breakfast Tea Miller Brewing Pale ale India Pale ale Microeconomics Pilsener Tofu Prohibition Belgian beer Diet soda Stout beer Gin Yuengling New Coke Alcohol advertising Mexican beer Supply and demand Pisco Burton-upon-Trent Coors Brewing Company Vodka Moonshine Public house Ethanol Ramen Alcohol fuel Yerba mate Canadian beer Acetic acid Cuisine of Argentina Agriculture Anchor Brewing Company Sugar Snapple South African Breweries Chocolate Free trade Cuisine of Africa Lemonade Soy sauce Honey Peruvian cuisine Reinheitsgebot Malt liquor Caffeine Green tea Economics Bass (beer) Law of value OK Soda Jewish cuisine Lambic Word of Wisdom Milk Bong Mountain Dew 7 Up Budweiser Budvar Tobacco Chicha Ford Motor Company Smoked beer Shasta (soft drink) Cadbury Schweppes In-N-Out Burger Drink 1982 World Series Cuisine of the Southern United States
