whats the difference between a gas oven and a electric oven and whats better aside from the obvious gas tends to give you more control on a cooktop once the flame is out you are pretty much not cooking anymore while the electric oven coils tend to hold a higher heat longer as for the oven itself i have found no difference unless you are broiling gas ovens use a broiler at the very bottom of the stove while that same area is a drawer for your pots and pans in an electric stove i prefer electric for the safety because i've had the pilot light on the gas oven go out and it's a pain to re light it Portable stove Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Microwave oven Glass-ceramic Barbecue Fire Heat Solar power Bread Thermocouple Slow cooker Vacuum tube Fire fighting Beverage can stove Dutch oven Town gas Renewable energy Welding Cooking on a campfire Refrigerator Major appliance Yoghurt Relay Furnace Thermostat Fire extinguisher Internal ballistics Internal combustion engine Explosive material Grilling Transformer Spark plug Gas tungsten arc welding Gas metal arc welding Camping Thermal power station Coffee Toast Spacecraft propulsion Natural gas Plastic Fluorescent lamp Bi-metal Temperature Hand grenade Tesla coil Bacon Carbon dioxide Solar oven Lighting Glass Roast beef Plasma (physics) Nuclear reactor Pizza Sun Printed circuit board Solar box cooker Incandescent light bulb Lightning Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hot air balloon Motor oil High-voltage hazards Aluminium Nuclear power Arc welding Albert Fish Power station Stave church Cremation Biofuel Alternating current Stirling engine Houseplant Baking Resistor Embedded system Ceramics Potentiometer Hydrogen Loudspeaker Optical fiber Mattress Gas turbine Idli Light Coal Autonomous building Electrical generator Planetary nebula Spark gap Soldering Tire Toaster Laser
