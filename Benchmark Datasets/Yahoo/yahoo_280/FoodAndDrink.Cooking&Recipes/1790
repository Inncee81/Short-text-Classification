is it safe to eat rare ground beef i made a hamburger from ground beef and didn't cook it all the way through i know you can eat rare steak but its ground beef ok yes and no but in your case i'd say no or at best maybe raw ground beef can be eaten and it's quite delicious and it's known as steak tartare but you should really get a fresh cut of meat and have it freshly ground at the butcher's it's the equivalent of sushi sashimi just ground and meat not fish ground meat should be cooked at least somewhat officially all the bacteria gets killed at degrees which is medium to well done i like my beef medium rare and i'm still alive so i don't totally hold to requiring degrees myself if you are talking rare cooked but not medium rare that's probably okay if it's relatively freshly ground but if you mean raw that's probably not so good unless you know it's fresh the reason is e coli bacteria which is basically not to be too delicate about it poop it's an intestinal bacteria but transmitted by exposure from droppings from animals if some is on the surface of a raw steak it really doesn't matter too much because it'll burn off when the steak is cooked but if the steak is ground up into hamburger it can be on the inside and if the hamburger isn't cooked sufficiently it can still exist on the inside and possibly make you sick or very sick so it depends was it pretty fresh meat did you get it from a decent place how rare was rare was it raw if it was cooked somewhat all the way through i'd eat it as i said i like my meat medium rare but the level of risk taking is up to you Escherichia coli O157:H7 Steak Hamburger Foodborne illness Japanese cuisine French cuisine Tofu Sushi Sausage Beef Barbecue Cuisine of Denmark Livestock Sashimi Vegetarianism Vitamin C Chicken Chili con carne German cuisine Horse meat Fish and chips Veganism Fugu Meat Cuisine of the Philippines Taboo food and drink In-N-Out Burger Hot dog Domesticated turkey Soul food Cantonese cuisine RuneScape skills Colorectal cancer Kosher foods Sewage treatment Food preservation Cheese Tooth Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Trichinosis T-bone steak Oyster Egg (food) Meatball Burger Matt Hardy Haggis RuneScape quests Insulin Feces Whaling Cuisine of Laos Pie McDonald's Causality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an MRE Bacteria Escherichia coli Korean cuisine Vegetarian nutrition Bengali cuisine Curry Ramen Salmon Cajun cuisine Comanche British cuisine Kashrut Cuisine of Malaysia Crohn's disease Toxoplasmosis Omega-3 fatty acid Miso Gray Wolf Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Africa Fancy rat Cheeseburger Cuisine of Thailand Chopsticks Explosive material Albert Fish Food storage Japanese grammar Tuberculosis Breakfast Garlic Nutrition Jackass: The Movie Raw food diet Pork
