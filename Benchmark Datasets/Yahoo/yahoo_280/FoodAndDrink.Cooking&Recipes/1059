why does water heated in a cup in the microwave boil over when the tea bag is put into it the water has been superheated from the microwave microwaves send energy into the middle of an object unlike heat which works from the outside in the center can get a lot hotter than the edges it forms a bubble or zone with more energy than the surrounding water this will stay for a while if left alone when you break the surface tension it suddenly boils as the hotter water is released Temperature Heat Boiling point Microwave oven Boiling Tea Brewery Water vapor Water Solar system Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Phase transition Coffee Phase (matter) Hydrogen Steam Ocean thermal energy conversion Evaporation Sea ice Steam explosion Big Bang Fire fighting Spark plug Energy Energy development Engine cooling Fossil fuel power plant Korean tea ceremony Caffeine Physical cosmology Stellar evolution Casting Tsunami Slow cooker Kitesurfing Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Teapot Nuclear power Solar power Turkish coffee Solar power satellite Baby bottle 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Saturn Pressurized water reactor Hong Kong-style milk tea Directed-energy weapon Fujian tea ceremony Solar panel Soap bubble Ammonia Solar sail Explosive material Fractional distillation Welding Geothermal power Origin of life Surface tension Bagel Sulfuric acid Japanese tea ceremony Powder metallurgy Hyperthermia Timeline of the Universe Radio Alternative biochemistry Sun Corona Cavity magnetron Alkane Cookware and bakeware Seismic retrofit Diode Cosmic microwave background radiation Infrared Microwave chemistry Agar plate Chinese tea culture Vacuum tube Torpedo Corrosion Horehound Refrigerator Black body Nuclear meltdown Kitchen Tesla coil Autoclave Kinetic energy Petroleum Opportunity rover Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner Electromagnetic radiation Plate tectonics Cooking
