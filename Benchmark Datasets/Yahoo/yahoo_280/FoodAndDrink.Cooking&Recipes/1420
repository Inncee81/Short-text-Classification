how are bay fruits used are they used whole or crushed in the pot how many leaves account for one berry also wouldn't it be better to use them in spice mixtures instead of the leaves which i find difficult to crush finely i've never heard of the fruit of the bay laurel being used in cooking it tastes completely different from the leaves and can't be used as an alternative for the leaves for that reason the seeds can be roasted and ground as a spice however but they don't taste like the leaves either as far as having difficulty crusing the leaves to use the leaves it's best if you leave them whole and remove them from the pot after the cooking time is over rather than trying to crush and eat them Coriander Black pepper Idli Rum Banana Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Tea Mango Bengali cuisine Curry German cuisine Dumpling Fennel Garden Strawberry Barbecue Cajun cuisine Sichuan Pepper MRE Cuisine of Malaysia Cantonese cuisine Dandelion Tomato Halva Chili con carne Fruit Muesli Roman eating and drinking Peanut Peruvian cuisine Loganberry Basil Cincinnati chili Potato Garlic Coffea arabica Cuisine of Singapore Allspice Japanese cuisine Tobacco Cuisine of Denmark Plantain Smilax Russian cuisine Cranberry Pomegranate Peanut butter RuneScape quests Nabemono Cuisine of the Southern United States Hot pot Comfrey Teapot Comanche Avocado Coconut Hamburger Brewery Watermelon Coffea Chocolate D__ner kebab Cuisine of Africa Alice B.
