hot air popcorn vs stove or microwave i just bought a hot air popcorn popper and used it for the first time it was alright but the popcorn was really chewy i was wondering if it has to do with the kind of kernels i used a generic brand or if it's the popcorn popper has anyone else had this happen and if not what kind of kernels do you use hot air popcorn does tend to be dry and chewy personally i cherish my old electric popcorn popper from the 's it's the kind that uses a little bit of oil and the popcorn is delicious if you ever find a regular popcorn popper at a garage sale or resale shop make sure that the cord is in good shape no breaks or frays then buy a good brand of popcorn and i'm willing to bet that you will end up with the best bowl of popcorn you've ever eaten Popcorn Microwave oven Coffee Sweetcorn Maize Ramen Movie theater Loss leader Happy Tree Friends Breakfast Alkyl nitrites Illegal drug trade Idli Bulk vending Pizza Curry Potato chips Hiberno-English Wok Chili con carne Fried chicken The Star Wars Holiday Special Spark plug Popcorn (song) Town gas Wood fuel Rock (music) Hot dog Japanese tea ceremony Kitchen Tire Lionel Corporation Futurama (TV series - season 4) Trademark Price discrimination Retailer Berkshire Hathaway Harmonica Pork rind The Ashlee Simpson Show Jo Dee Messina Coercion Dither Falsifiability Mach kernel Tofu Reading spark plugs for racing Unconscious mind Asbestos Janet Jackson Sears Holdings Corporation Nut (fruit) Plastic Parachute Jennifer Lopez Menstrual cup Ball lightning Sake Conspiracy theory Mattress Sling (weapon) SCO-Linux controversies Logical positivism Motor oil Beverly Hills, California Hot pot Seismic retrofit Stove Kernel (algebra) Jeff Bezos Hersheypark Subliminal message Imre Lakatos Ford Motor Company Leather Meat Loaf Dialectic Cider Customs and etiquette of Japan Billboard Hot 100 Knife Cruising (maritime) Cajun cuisine Instant coffee Solar power Breakfast cereal String theory Crossbow Filling station We Belong Together Korean cuisine Ironing Cookware and bakeware Steve Jobs First-sale doctrine Hot 100 Airplay Apple Roxette Fast bowling
