how many ice cubes in an ounce this might seem silly but i found a recipe that calls for ounces of ice it also gives it in grams i think it said grams so i think it wants the weight not the fluid ounces used to make the ice does anyone know the weight of an ice cube or should i just go with fluid weight and measure the water into the cube tray any help is appreciated i don't have a digital scale yet the recipe seems to be asking for the actual weight so oz of water is probably too much liquid a fluid ounce of water does weigh one ounce that is not true for all liquids or any solids like flour etc but it is true of water measure ounces into your container and freeze it and you will have ounces of ice bert Cooking weights and measures English unit U.S. customary units Volume Pound Ice cream Density Carbon dioxide Cake Porosity Cheese Ice Litre Phase (matter) Martini cocktail Metrication Explosive material Gallon History of measurement Ton Champagne (beverage) Gold Weighing scale Standard enthalpy change of fusion Mass Alcoholic beverage Fluid statics Coffee Pressure Water (molecule) Imperial unit Glacier Tide Tofu Viscosity Silly Putty Leather Breastfeeding Aluminum can Gold standard Mai Tai Relative density Russian cuisine Systems of measurement Liquid crystal Milkshake Kilogram Siphon Concentration Diamond Gelato Indus Valley Civilization Portable stove Buoyancy Nuclear thermal rocket Japanese cuisine STS-87 Mole (unit) Cryonics Space Shuttle external tank Tael Hamburger Caffeine N.W.A Stress (physics) Weight Soft drink Metrified English unit Paper size Chocolate Mesures usuelles Tea Plastic Vermicompost Temperature Apple pie British coinage Hydrogen economy Titan (moon) Liberty Dollar Mars Food preservation Vacuum Water Platonic solid Freeze distillation Game Boy Money in Harry Potter Brewery Fluid dynamics Bretton Woods system Metrication in Canada Hydrometer Dice Gatorade Halva Heat Ice core
