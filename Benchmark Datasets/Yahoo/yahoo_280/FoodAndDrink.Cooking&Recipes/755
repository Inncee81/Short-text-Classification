crock pot recipes anyone also can i cook a crock pot meal that's suppost to be on low for hours for to hours on high instead i wasn't sure if that would burn the food i just want it to get done quicker than hours easy crockpot chicken take frozen chicken breasts and put right into the crockpot pour can cream of chicken soup over the top of the chicken breasts as it cooks the juices from the chicken mix with the soup and make a wonderful gravy sometimes i mix a cup to cup sour cream into the soup before pouring over chicken so yummy i serve it over noodles or rice or even mashed potatoes with a vegetable side dish sometimes some crusty french bread its always a winner for a larger yield simply use cans of soup and more chicken breasts like it is possible to cut the time for some recipes but usually it is best to stick to what the recipe says so you don't end up with burnt or dried out food i tried to speed up a recipe once years ago by cooking it on high and too much of the liquid evaporated and it was baked on to the upper part it took lots of soaking and scrubbing to get it clean again sometimes i will start the crock pot out early in the morning and leave it on low for a couple hours and then switch it to high and this has seemed to work all right but like i said before sometimes its best to just follow the recipe and wait the recommended time Chicken soup Tofu Jewish cuisine Barbecue Ramen Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Malaysia MRE Cuisine of Denmark German cuisine Cajun cuisine Cantonese cuisine Breakfast Russian cuisine Pancake Dumpling Korean cuisine Cuisine of Singapore French cuisine Peruvian cuisine Bengali cuisine Soul food Gumbo Cuisine of Laos Ice cream Recipe Cuisine of the Southern United States Curry Dim sum Kosher foods Haggis French fries Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Thailand Hamburger Cookware and bakeware Vegetarian cuisine Chili con carne Coffee Domesticated turkey Idli Campbell Soup Company Risotto Slow cooker Tea Rice pudding Pizza Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Vietnam Cha chaan teng Street food Roman eating and drinking Mayonnaise Tamale Chopsticks Polish cuisine Beer Food preservation Hot pot Canadian Chinese cuisine Nabemono Taiwanese cuisine Laksa Satay Common bean Ketchup Mashed potato British cuisine Fondue Kelantan Potato chips Beef noodle soup Sandwich Flour Persian cuisine Kitchen Bacon Cuisine of Austria Cuisine of Cambodia Brewery Chicken Veganism Pie D__ner kebab Dairy Cholent French toast
