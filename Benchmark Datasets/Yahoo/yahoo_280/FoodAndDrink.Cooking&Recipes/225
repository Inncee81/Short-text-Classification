fig recipes hi my brother and sister in law have bought a house with a big garden it has a fig tree in it anyone know any good recipes and how you tell when they are ready to pick fresh figs are best eaten as close to the tree of origin and as ripe as possible when they re just on the point of bursting look for the telltale honey like drop of moisture on the surface thin skinned and easily bruised they need careful handling ripe figs however are highly perishable and will not keep for longer than three days in the fridge thin skinned and easily bruised they need careful handling and should be wrapped for travel in tissue like a romanov princess bring out their delicate scent and flavour by leaving them in the sun for an hour or so before serving try the following a compote of figs in marsala wine with mascarpone mousse figs are at their best in autumn and even if they're not squidgy enough to eat straight they still respond beautifully to light poaching in this recipe they impart their flavour to mingle with a sweet marsala wine serve them with the lightest mascarpone mousse and it's heaven on earth for the compote small ripe figs fl oz ml sweet marsala wine vanilla pod oz g caster sugar level teaspoon arrowroot for the mousse x g tub mascarpone at room temperature x ml tub fromage frais per cent fat at room temperature tablespoons milk level tablespoon caster sugar teaspoon vanilla extract level teaspoons powdered gelatine or vegetarian substitute large egg whites you will also need a saucepan or frying pan with a lid large enough to hold the figs in one layer and ramekins fl oz ml capacity inches cm diameter inches cm deep make the mousse first begin by whisking the mascarpone fromage frais milk sugar and vanilla together in a roomy bowl then place tablespoon of cold water in a cup and sprinkle the gelatine over put a small saucepan with about inch cm of hot water in it over a gentle heat when the gelatine has soaked into the water sit the cup in the saucepan and leave it until the gelatine has turned completely clear and liquid next in another roomy bowl whisk the egg whites to the soft peak stage now rinse the ramekins in cold water leave them to drain but don't dry them as this will make it easier to turn the mousses out now using the same whisk with the beaters running slowly pour the liquid gelatine into the mascarpone mixture whisking all the time so that the gelatine does not set when it's all in use a metal tablespoon to fold a spoonful of the egg white into the mixture to loosen it followed quickly by the remaining egg white fold thoroughly but gently to mix evenly together now pour or spoon the mousse into the ramekins smooth the tops and cover with clingfilm chill for at least hours before serving but preferably overnight to make the compote pour the wine into the pan add the vanilla pod and the sugar stir over a gentle heat until the sugar has dissolved then bring to simmering point stab each fig two or three times with a skewer then using a long handled spoon lower them gently into the simmering liquid stalk side up cover and cook very gently for minutes or until they are absolutely tender use a draining spoon to remove them from the liquid to a shallow serving dish where again they can sit in a single layer remove the vanilla pod and boil the liquid to reduce it slightly then mix the arrowroot in a cup with a tablespoon of cold water pour this into the hot liquid and bring it back to simmering point whisking all the time pour the slightly thickened liqueur over the figs leave to
