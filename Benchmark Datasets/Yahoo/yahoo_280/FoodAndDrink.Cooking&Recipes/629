how to be sure meat poultry and fish is thoroughly cooked i always cook meat thoroughly but lately for some reason my husband always believes that its undercooked and wont eat it no matter how long i cook it i know that i am cooking it thoroughly when i cook ground beef i get all of the pink out of it and get it evenly dark brown all around when i make chicken i make sure the inside is white and you can peel it apart with your fingers when i cook fish i cook it until its nice and flaky isnt this right i'm confused thanks for the helpful answers my husband is a sweet wonderful guy and he's not a germaphobic person in the least so i dont know why he's worried so much about the meat but i'm sure he has a good reason i think that the way that you handle the meat from purchase to serving it is really important cooking a piece of meat to the correct temperature that might have been mishandled prior to cooking might not be enough to make it safe to eat if it's frozen make sure it's thawed under cold running water in the refrigerator the best way or in the microwave the worst way but still safe if it's fresh check for appearance and smell if it is overly slimy or smells funny take it back or throw it out it's important to note though that meat can still look and smell fine but be contaminated these are just strong warning signs so if it looks good and smells good then cooking it to the correct temperature will do the trick make sure though to wash hands utensils and cutting boards that have touched the raw meat before using them again to touch the cooked meat a thermometer that's calibrated reads degrees in a cup of half ice half water will help but make sure for small pieces of meat like a fish filet burger or chicken breast for example that you shoot for about degrees below the desired temperature the reason is that everything continues to cook even after you remove it from the heat source small pieces like those will only go up around degrees before cooling larger roasts and whole birds will continue to go up around to degrees after pulling them away from the heat lastly let the meats rest for a couple of minutes before cutting into them if you cut into something right out of the oven or out of the pan a lot of the juices that keep it tender will run right out Cuisine of Denmark Escherichia coli O157:H7 Domesticated turkey Tofu Barbecue Hamburger Cuisine of Malaysia Egg (food) Refrigerator Jewish cuisine Bacon Cuisine of the Philippines Kosher foods Kitchen French fries Cookware and bakeware Microwave oven Roman eating and drinking Sushi Food Russian cuisine Coffee Bengali cuisine Cantonese cuisine MRE German cuisine Pork Cooking Chinese cuisine Chicken Knife Cajun cuisine Japanese tea ceremony Fire fighting Bread Sauerkraut Steak Chili con carne Bong Pizza Temperature Stock (food) Dim sum Refrigerator car Cuisine of Brazil Food preservation In-N-Out Burger Peruvian cuisine Brewery Ramen Burger Tea French cuisine Dairy Cuisine of Singapore Water (molecule) Sausage Fried chicken Ice cream McDonald's Breakfast Veganism Haggis Soul food Cuisine of the Southern United States Toxoplasmosis Omega-3 fatty acid Beef Pie Sauce Wok Comanche Fancy rat Vegetarianism Kashrut Autonomous building Dumpling Kebab T-bone steak Livestock Mango Internal ballistics Tlingit Fish and chips Recipe Coriander Chicken soup Water
