moist chocolate chip cookies i have a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies that i have used for years i've gotten lots of compliments on the recipe but i want to try making the cookies a little softer and more moist and chewy what ingredient can i increase the amount of to do this the recipe i use is below c flour tsp salt tsp baking soda c oleo large egg c white granulated sugar c light brown sugar tsp vanilla tbsp hot water oz package of choc chips cream oleo sugars and egg until smooth sift together dry ingredients and combine with creamed mixture add vanilla and hot water and mix well stir in chocolate chips and bake at for minutes i thought increasing the amounf of brown sugar and decreasing the amout of granulated sugar might help or maybe using butter flavored crisco instead of oleo or even using more oleo any suggestions ideas are appreciated the easiest way to make your cookies come out moist is to change the ratio of brown sugar to white sugar since brown sugar is coated in molasses it will be more moist in the final product try using a full cup of brown sugar instead of half brown and half white another thing to do which i believe was already mentioned is to change the fat in the recipe using something like crisco which melts at a relatively high temperature assures that the cookie has time to rise before it spreads using butter which has a very sharp melting point makes the dough spread faster giving you a flatter cookie that is more likely to overcook creating a crispy finished cookie ' you could mess around with adding more eggs but baking recipes are like equations adding to them without balancing something out could end up disastorous so if you were to add more yolks you might need more flour which could end up counteracting the extra yolks you put in Coffee Bagel Japanese cuisine Tofu Cake Bacon Rice pudding Jewish cuisine Potato chips Cuisine of Denmark Pancake Mayonnaise Oreo Cheesecake Soy protein Recipe Brewery Flour Cold Stone Creamery Breakfast Cooking weights and measures Cuisine of the Philippines Milkshake Rum Egg (food) German cuisine Cantonese cuisine Ramen French fries Cuisine of Brazil Tea Vinegar Carbon dioxide Soft drink Margarine Bengali cuisine Souffl__ Cheese Cocoa Trans fat In-N-Out Burger Mooncake Kit Kat Puff pastry Cajun cuisine Pottery Twix Chocolate Salty Balls Curry Peanut butter Dumpling Gumbo Halva Casting Sandwich Food Idli Kraft Dinner Dairy Hot dog Soap Granola Barbecue Vegetarian cuisine Chili con carne Maple syrup Muffin Wine Heath bar Sugarcane Potato Pop-Tarts Baked Alaska Polish cuisine Sushi Cookware and bakeware Soup Russian cuisine French toast Apple pie Gelato M&M's Custard Beer Butter
