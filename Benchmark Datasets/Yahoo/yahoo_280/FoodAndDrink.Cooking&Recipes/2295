any ideas for stuff to accompany a heavy chocolate mousse thanks everyone who gave me advice yesterday re making my chocolate mousse it came out really nice and my bf liked it very much however it's a bit too heavy only cream chocolate and sweet and i'm trying to think about something we can eat or drink along with it in order to make it a bit lighter yesterday i garnished it with strawberries and we also ate it with a cookie shortbread but that's still sweet i also tried adding whipped cream with no sugar on top to reduce the sweetness but it's already too creamy does anyone have a good idea about what we can eat along with the mousse so as to not feel it's too heavy sweet thanks try making a layered parfait with sliced bananas the mousse and some light whipped topping or whip the topping into it and freeze it for more of a ganache like dessert Ice cream Cheesecake Cuisine of Denmark Chocolate Cold Stone Creamery Coffee Breakfast Cream (food) Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Oreo French cuisine Cake German cuisine Milkshake Pancake Yoghurt Kit Kat Tofu Pocky Maple syrup Cuisine of Austria Cookie Meal Yoplait Apple pie Cuisine of Singapore Banana split McDonald's Wine Cuisine of Argentina Cuisine of Malaysia Girl Scout cookies Tapioca Peanut butter Peruvian cuisine Tamale Genericized trademark Pizza Sherbet Pie Soft drink Mars Bar Bengali cuisine Food Martini cocktail Sugar Soup Hamster Cuisine of the Southern United States Dim sum Custard Confectionery Kiwifruit Tea Bread Sauce Fecal incontinence Fanta Plantain Rum Bagel In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Brazil Polish cuisine Barbecue Sprinkles Porridge Kraft Foods Candy bar Mooncake Fruit Tea (meal) Cantonese cuisine Waffle Sugar substitute Gatorade Swedish cuisine Strawberry Shortcake Cuisine of Greece Cha chaan teng Mango French toast Food preservation Liqueur Avocado Sandwich Cajun cuisine Russian cuisine Cider Kugel Fortune cookie Cuisine of Cambodia Brunch Ranma __ characters
