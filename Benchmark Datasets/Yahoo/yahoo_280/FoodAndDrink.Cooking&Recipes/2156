anyone know any good recipes for making spaguetti sauce from scratch i have so many ripe tomatoes growing in my garden that i don't know what to do with them i've had them with rice and sandwiches please give me a spaguetti sauce recipe or any other recipes for tomatoes thank you ooooooo garden fresh tomatoes are to die for i like to eat them like apples but only the fresh ones not store bought you can slice them up and dry them for later to snack on to sprinkle on salads and other things you can broil them just carve out the core and sprinkle some shredded cheese on and broil until the cheese melts which usually is enough time to semi cook the tomato too you can throw them in soups i leave the skins on just cause i like them but others remove the skins make salsas there are lots of different salsas you can make and how about gazpacho yum tomato and muenster cheese sandwiches tomatoes stuffed with tuna shrimp crab salad or not tomato soup i've made spaghetti sauce from roma tomatoes since they tend to be less liquidy so their meat is denser and you don't have to boil it down so long with romas it takes about a day of boiling to reduce it to a proper sauce consistency and what you throw in is up to you my eaters have some intolerances green peppers can't be digested by some of us etc so our sauce usually is pretty basic i also have a problem with acid so i toss in a teaspoon of baking soda to reduce the acid parboil the tomatoes until the skin starts cracking usually only a few minutes then they are going to be real hot so maybe use something to protect your hands just pull the skins off core then chop them into cubes in a large pot put some virgin olive oil ok any olive oil but iike the taste of the virgin ones garlic cloves sliced or chopped onions and saute you can either leave the garlic in some people like to eat them i leave them in so any flavor they have left will go into the sauce but we remove them if they don't completely dissolve when the onions are go a little soft toss in the tomatoes you can add some wine if you like we never have any around and i'm not going to buy a whole bottle just for the sauce how much you use is up to your taste salt pepper oregano to taste fresh oregano will have a stronger taste but it's not available all the time add green peppers sweet red or yellow hot peppers if you like it spicy if you didn't add wine put in just a little water so the stuff on the bottom don't scorch bring the liquid to a boil cover turn down the heat if you have one of those heat diffuser things put that under the pot and simmer all day stirring periodically once the tomatoes start looking like real sauce add any other veggies sliced zucchini some folks add shredded carrots but i don't mushrooms etc you want cover and simmer some more tasting periodically so you can adjust the seasonings i also add grated parmesan cheese and stir well so it doesn't sink to the bottom when the consistency gets to where you like it some folks like thinner sauce some real thick if you're going to add sausage or meat or meatballs cook first then add to sauce and let them simmer too since this process takes so long you probably won't want to do this daily or even weekly so you might want to save some in the freezer or can some if you know how to do that Dumpling Cha chaan teng Tea Domesticated turkey Sauce Bagel Oregano Capsicum Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Turkey Vegetarian cuisine Polish cuisine Mayonnaise Idli Gazpacho Cuisine of Cambodia Catalan cuisine Pot Noodle Rum Cuisine of Thailand Pancake Chicago-style pizza Cuisine of Argentina Fish and chips Beef noodle soup Potato chips American Chinese cuisine Brewery Haggis Tamale Vinegar Fish sauce Kebab Mango Rice pudding Sushi Cheesesteak Meal Spaghetti
