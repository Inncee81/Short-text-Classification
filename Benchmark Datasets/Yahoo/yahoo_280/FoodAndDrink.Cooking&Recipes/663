grilling steak i'm going to grill some steaks for me and my girl and want them to turn out perfect what's the best way to grill a steak start with a quality cut of steak my personal favorite is the rib eye two other good choices are the t bone and strip steak any steak you prefer is fine but for a great grilling and dining experience a little extra spent on the steaks is worth it prepare your grill by cleaning and oiling the grate clean with a ball of aluminum foil rubbing back and forth over the grate oil the grate using a paper towel and a liberal amount of olive oil this will help your grate last longer reduce rusting and keep the meat from sticking charcoal or gas if using a charcoal grill remove and set aside your grate while the coals are heating to white hot allow plenty of time for the coals to completely heat and burn off any lighter fluid replace the grate on the charcoal grill just before you grill the steaks if using a gas grill leave the grate in place and preheat the grill for minutes before beginning to grill season your steak with salt and pepper a good quality steak won't need much more than this to taste great if you like a bolder taste you might like to try grill mates montreal steak seasoning a coarse blend of peppers and spices my wife prefers this on her steak while i prefer the traditional salt and pepper put steaks on the grill depending on the requested doneness start cooking the steaks requested well done first and put the rare steaks on last that way most or all of the steak s will be done at the same time a well done steak will take about minutes on high heat a medium done steak will take about minutes only turn your steak once during cooking halfway through the cooking time your best bet for steaks cooked to order is to use your grill enough to know the cooking times or use a meat thermometer practice makes perfect and you get to eat allot of steak while learning cooking times on your grill Steak Hot dog Jewish cuisine Charcoal T-bone steak Grill In-N-Out Burger German cuisine French fries Korean cuisine Chili con carne Bengali cuisine Kitchen Hamburger Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Tofu Cheesesteak Fish and chips Soul food Cajun cuisine Cantonese cuisine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bacon Welding Asado French cuisine Cuisine of Africa Rum Pizza Cuisine of Malaysia Incandescent light bulb Cuisine of Brazil Casting Risotto Kosher foods Fast-food restaurant MRE Steel Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Laos Coal Cookware and bakeware Internal ballistics Satay Aluminium Hot pot Carbon dioxide Bread D__ner kebab Explosive material Grilling Motor oil Bong Idli Coffee Domesticated turkey Fire extinguisher Sewage treatment Knife Breakfast Town gas Solar power Ramen Olive oil Fire Cooking Cuisine of Singapore Stove Hydrochloric acid Salisbury steak Brewery M16 (rifle) Hydrogen economy Nabemono Steak n Shake Kebab Petroleum Drawing Plastic Fire fighting Pottery Renewable energy RuneScape skills Meatball Peanut butter Russian cuisine Gasoline E85
