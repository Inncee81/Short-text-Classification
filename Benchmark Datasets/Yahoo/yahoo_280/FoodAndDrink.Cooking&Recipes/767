how long do homemade pie crusts last in the freezer nothing is better than a homemade pie crust but sometimes i need one quickly and do not have the time to start from scratch i was thinking about making several and freezing them than when i am in need of a crust i would just thaw and roll i thought this would also be good for around the holidays when i am baking several pies i'm not sure if this would affect the outcome of the crust does anyone do this do you store them in a freezer bag or a plastic container if so how long do they generally last if you wrap it well in plastic and foil it should last months in the deep freeze maybe months in a regular freezer Ice cream Bagel Pizza Puff pastry Refrigerator Bread Pie Australian meat pie Freezer Glacier Cuisine of Denmark Dim sum Baked Alaska Bong Genericized trademark Plastic bag Cold Stone Creamery Pizza Hut In-N-Out Burger Aluminium foil Apple pie Freezing Domesticated turkey Bone marrow transplant Fancy rat Key lime pie Cookware and bakeware Spidey Super Stories Alton Brown Maple syrup Lunar Prospector Cheesecake Pecan pie McDonald's Pillsbury Mardi Gras Europa (moon) Food preservation D__ner kebab Geology of the Moon Fish and chips Laserdisc Food storage Structure of the Earth Permian-Triassic extinction event Baking Ice core Poi (food) Freeze drying Mattress My Little Pony Tide Plastic Moon Avalanche Mantle (geology) Carbon dioxide Cryonics Reinforced concrete Life in the Freezer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Ocean Wok Label Diamond Microwave meal Soul food Tofu Weebl and Bob SB-129 Flood geology Eskimo Pie Wine making Printed circuit board Hydroponics Mayonnaise Microwave oven Dustbin Coffee Brewery Jute Milk Lava Potato chips Kayak Chicago-style pizza Tampon Textile manufacturing Mashgiach Tlingit Billiards Menstrual cup Paedophile Information Exchange Reed (music) Vodka Gramophone record American Pie (song) Mooncake Homer Simpson
