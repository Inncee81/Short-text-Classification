does anyone have a good recipe for fried chicken no milk i don't normally like to fry when i cook because i hate to get splattered and i get paranoid it will start a grease fire but i've been craving some good fried chicken and i want to make it tonight also is it better to use a deep frying pan or an electric skillet thanks for your help i pan fry mine just coat the chicken in a mixture of flour and spices depending on my mood it might be just salt and pepper or i might add garlic powder parsley sage rosemary or whatever else is around then i place it in about an inch of oil heated to about and cover the moisture then gets absorbed by the flour mixture which helps make a great crust cook about minutes then turn and cook for about minutes more its done when the chicken reaches or the juices run clear either electric skillet or deep pan would work so long as you have a cover electric skillet has more precise temp control if you're not used to cooking with oil but i use my grandmother's cast iron skillet the mass gives good temp uniformity Pizza Cajun cuisine Tofu Cookware and bakeware Curry Japanese cuisine Soul food Fried chicken Plastic Bread Pancake Jewish cuisine Idli Bacon Risotto French toast Mayonnaise Peruvian cuisine Chili con carne Cuisine of Malaysia Cantonese cuisine Barbecue Rice Wok Cuisine of Brazil Russian cuisine Kentucky Fried Chicken Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Denmark Scrambled eggs Dosa D__ner kebab Paella Roux German cuisine Chicken soup Cuisine of the Philippines Halva Recipe Fire extinguisher Sichuan Pepper Hamburger Explosive material Potato pancakes Stir frying Gumbo Ramen Cuisine of Singapore Deep frying Pottery Cuisine of Thailand Thermal power station Cuisine of Africa Szechuan cuisine Buffalo wings Cuisine of Laos Breakfast French cuisine Cooking Tempura Soup Dim sum Polish cuisine Meatball Cuisine of Vietnam Flour Food preservation Nabemono Hot dog Portable stove Ice cream Grunion Kosher foods Italian cuisine Dal Internal ballistics Cuisine of Ethiopia RuneScape quests Aluminium Satay Domesticated turkey Fondue Plantain Cookie Cuisine of Greece Chocolate Ham Tortilla Chaaru Roast beef Fried rice Asado
