how does this sound hi i was looking through some of my mom's better homes and gardens cookbooks from the 's i tried this recipe and i would like to know what you think would you change anything about it anything you can think of that might make it better i liked it but i still think it could use 'something else' ham loaf line up long loaf of french bread sliced almost to the bottom at inch intervals can prince's canned ham sweet relish or sweet picalilli thin slices of swiss cheese such as leerdammer mash the ham together with the relish until you have a paste spread inbetween each slice with butter then spread every other slice with the ham mixture then place the cheese slices in the empty spaces wrap in foil and bake at for minutes this was an american recipe that called for deviled ham which i have never seen in the uk so i used a prince's canned ham what do you think i think this has endless possibilities i would probably start off with adding mushrooms and see how that went or sweetcorn and diced peppers you'll soon figure out what works and what doesnt and it will point you in the right direction what to try next i think you're gonna inspire a few people to try this now Bread Hot dog Pizza Hamburger Sandwich Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark MRE French toast French fries Bagel Potato D__ner kebab Breakfast French cuisine Soul food German cuisine Meatloaf Chili con carne Tofu Soup Bacon Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of the Philippines Sushi Vegetarian cuisine Apple pie Cheesesteak Barbecue Pancake Ham sandwich theorem Salad Cajun cuisine M__m__lig__ Butter Bengali cuisine Ham Peruvian cuisine Risotto Pie Croissant Potato chips Pickled cucumber In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Greece Biscuit Chocolate Cha chaan teng Mooncake Pea soup Tamale Dim sum Roman eating and drinking Swiss cuisine Cuisine of Africa Kebab Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Cuisine of Brazil Ketchup Cuisine of Argentina Baklava McDonald's Empanada Domesticated turkey Baguette Meat analogue Eggs Benedict Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Cuisine of Singapore Fondue Cheesecake B__chamel sauce Cuisine of South Africa Reuben sandwich Cuisine of Turkey Brewery Sauerkraut Nabemono Curry Cake Custard Italian cuisine Gumbo Dairy Wiener schnitzel Haggis Poutine Black pepper Chowder Serbian cuisine Fish and chips Capsicum Russian cuisine Full English breakfast
