garlic mushroom bruschetta was in a restaurant on sunday and got that as a starter it was sooooo delicious thinking i'd love to make it but not sure how to do it the mushrooms were like ordinary not fancy ones sliced and in a creamy garlic sauce the mushrooms were only very lightly cooked so they were still a bit firm oh it really was lovely they were spooned over a couple of pieces of toasted french bread i wish i could make something like that to impress my friends crush some garlic then simmer in butter or olive oil until soft add the mushrooms and cook for a couple of minutes pour a drop of white wine in and simmer for another minute then add some fresh whipping cream stirring gently until heated good luck hope it tastes as good as the one in the restaurant Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine French cuisine Risotto Bread Chili con carne Pizza Cuisine of Brazil Tofu Jewish cuisine German cuisine Mayonnaise Soup Cuisine of the Philippines Barbecue Bengali cuisine French fries Curry French toast Idli Cajun cuisine Fondue Halva B__chamel sauce Ketchup Peruvian cuisine Donburi Pasta Sandwich Bagel Peanut butter Russian cuisine MRE Hamburger Fish sauce Butter Bacon Tea Chicken soup Cha chaan teng Full English breakfast Italian cuisine Ramen Stir frying Pancake Polish cuisine Cantharellus Salad Fish and chips Yoghurt Tamale Cheese Roux Ice cream Dim sum Gumbo Hot pot Kebab Cincinnati chili Cuisine of Singapore Nabemono Garlic Cuisine of Finland Cookie Soul food Coffee American Chinese cuisine Oregano Paella McDonald's Hot sauce Cuisine of Malaysia Mashed potato Cuisine of Turkey Hot dog Catalan cuisine Stock (food) Cream (food) Maple syrup Hummus Toast Shiitake mushroom Porridge Culinary mustard Roman eating and drinking Dumpling Vegetarian cuisine Milkshake Pea soup Miso
