how can i make my fried chicken breading stay on and be crispy fried chicken is a no brainer once you learn how a cast iron skillet works best but any heavy skillet will do if you don't have cast iron you will also need a couple of pie plates in your skillet heat two to three inches canola oil in pie plate crack three or four eggs and some sweet milk or buttermilk and beat well in pie plate put a couple of cups of flour and season well with salt black pepper garlic powder and a little cyanne if you want wash and pat dry your chicken pieces and roll in plate with the flour then take a piece of chicken and roll in beaten eggs and then back to flour to completely cover the fist dusting of flour makes the eggs stick genlty place in hot oil and cook you don't want your fire too hot medium or a tiny bit hotter is good you will cook the chicken for about ten minutes and then turn and cook another ten usually a good twenty minutes that is why you don't want your fire too hot you want to cook the chicken throughly but not brown the crust too fast happy frying by the way this is how you make chicken fried steak too only with tenderized round steak Japanese cuisine Soul food Cuisine of the Philippines Pizza Fried chicken Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Cantonese cuisine Breakfast Cajun cuisine Bread Cuisine of Denmark Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Brazil Hamburger Dumpling Dim sum Tofu French fries Peruvian cuisine Hot dog Chili con carne Ramen Dosa Cha chaan teng D__ner kebab Barbecue Fish and chips Cuisine of Singapore McDonald's Curry Pie Sandwich Chicken Brewery Idli Cuisine of India Biscuit Korean cuisine Fast-food restaurant Flour Egg (food) Plastic Porridge Gumbo French cuisine Kung pao chicken Scrambled eggs Bacon Mayonnaise Cookie Kentucky Fried Chicken Potato pancakes Russian cuisine Soup Chicken soup Casting Magnesium Tortilla Potato Pasta Sichuan Pepper Polish cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Halva Thermal power station Dairy Jiaozi Doughnut Cuisine of Greece Coffee Cuisine of Laos Rice Kitchen Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Thailand Wiener schnitzel Cuisine of Africa Internal ballistics Transformer Risotto Mooncake Kosher foods Welding Sushi French toast Stir frying RuneScape quests Nabemono Pizza Hut
