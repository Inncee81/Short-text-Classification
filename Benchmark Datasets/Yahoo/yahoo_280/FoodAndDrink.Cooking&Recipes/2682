can i make empanadas and not cook them until the next day i'm making them for a party and want to do all of the prep the day before but i've never made them before so i don't know what the protocol is and i love using the word 'protocol ' great word isn't it you can make the filling the day before but i would not suggest putting the filling in the pastry the day before as it will go soggy and not crisp up when cooked so prepare the filling cover and leave in the fridge then the next morning you can wrap them maybe hours beforehand and then brush lightly with either egg or butter depending on how you are cooking them hope this helps and hope you have fun at the party i'm sure your empanadas will be a big hit xx k Empanada Breakfast Puff pastry Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Peruvian cuisine Dumpling Bread French fries Cookie Bagel Pie Barbecue Pancake Cantonese cuisine Bento Sushi Rum Bon Jovi Mashed potato D__ner kebab Idli Poker jargon Butter Full English breakfast Cuisine of Brazil Pizza Sandwich Peter Cook Iggy Pop Paul Is Dead Recipe Sauce Bengali cuisine Potato Serial comma Mnemonic Curry Roux Bacon Soup Tooth Dairy Ex-gay Dosa The Catcher in the Rye Bong Oasis (band) Kyoto Protocol Peanut butter Solar power Comanche Hamburger French cuisine Fleetwood Mac Pysanka Stock (food) Ben Johnson (athlete) Pierogi Cooking weights and measures Blintz Apple pie Tamale Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Doughnut Sausage Japanese cuisine Escape from New York John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury 1957 World Series Girls Aloud Hal Trosky Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Butters Stotch Cuisine of Singapore Culture of Argentina Chocolate Potato chips Aerial (dance move) Croissant History of Test cricket (to 1883) Sea-Monkey Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Upholstery Kit Kat Endianness Independent school (UK) USS San Jacinto (1850) The Suffering (game) Policy Debate Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pastry bag The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Empire Burlesque Sex Pistols Balut Egg (food)
