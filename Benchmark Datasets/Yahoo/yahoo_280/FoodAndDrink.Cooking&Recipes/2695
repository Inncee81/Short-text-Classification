is food with freezer burn safe to eat it's perfectly safe to eat it'll taste lousy though ever try ice cream with freezer burn when ice crystals form at the exposed top and sides of the ice cream it's safe but not very good fyi freezer burn is caused by constant warming and cooling of a freezer the warming causes the frozen liquid portion to melt and the refreezing causes crystals to form thus freezer burn this could be based on energy savings low freezer temp power outages or simply opening the freezer door a lot and staring into the freezer trying to figure out what to microwave keeping a constant temperature below freezing is what you need to prevent freezer burn and if you are a freezer starer then you need to make the freezer cold enough that when you do have it open for a minute you don't kill the temp but it's much better to open get your stuff and get out in addition packing your freezer too full makes it hard for it to keep cold and you'll probably be more likely to see freezer burn if you have a house and can afford the space separate freezers are much lighter than they used to be and cheaper a couple of hundred bucks will get you a freezer you can stick in your basement and use for the stuff you don't need to get at every second so you can reserve the fridge freezer for stuff like ice cream Ice cream Refrigerator Ice Temperature Freezing Water (molecule) Carbon dioxide Sento Sea ice Pebble bed reactor Tea Bong Water Food preservation Cream (food) Dairy Carburetor Avalanche Welding Solar power Coffee Food storage Items in the Metroid series Tofu Solar cell Cloud Basement Microwave oven Cryonics Severe weather terminology (United States) Bagel Explosive material Water vapor Autonomous building Brewery Ammonia Diesel engine Genericized trademark Frost Winter storm Engine cooling Renewable energy Diseases of the honeybee Standard enthalpy change of fusion Amorphous ice Life in the Freezer Robot Master Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Cuisine of Denmark Little Ice Age Jet engine In-N-Out Burger Thunderstorm Freeze drying Blood (computer game) Milk Ice core Thermoregulation Global warming Glacier STS-87 Mr. Freeze Ceramics Chocolate Enceladus (moon) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Disaster Hydrogen economy Transformer Antarctic krill Fuel cell Internal ballistics Moon STS-62 Motor oil Plastic Cat Puff pastry Sulfur Nuclear reactor Common cold Nuclear power Bob and George Polyethylene terephthalate Vacuum Diode Heat E85 Nuclear weapon design Butter Big Bang Cooler Robert Falcon Scott Laser
