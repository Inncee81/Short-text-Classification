can anyone tell me what sweet milk is i have a old recipe that calls for it and i think it might be condensed milk but i'm not sure most of the southern us still calls regular milk 'sweet milk' as different from buttermilk so if your recipe is older and calling for 'sweet milk' that just means whatever you've got in the fridge that isn't buttermilk even old recipes would specify condensed milk that's been around forever same as evaporated milk has Condensed milk Biscuit Dairy product Breakfast Rice pudding Dairy Soul food Chocolate Ice cream Hong Kong-style milk tea Pancake Butter Candy Tea Cuisine of Laos Muesli Tofu Bread Cuisine of Thailand Coconut milk Milkshake Soy milk Tapioca Dulce de leche Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Africa Pongal Cuisine of the Philippines Bubble tea Milk Refrigerator Yoghurt Ketchup Coffee Bengali cuisine Soup Russian cuisine Glutinous rice Cuisine of Singapore Custard Key lime pie Rum Singlish Cuisine of Vietnam Idli New Zealand English Cheesecake Shaki Meat analogue Halva Laksa Red velvet cake Breast milk Cuisine of Malaysia Swedish cuisine Chicken soup Cider Gelato Paint Paneer Cuisine of the Southern United States Tea (meal) Phase (matter) Persian cuisine Kugel Pizza Evaporation Cuisine of Cambodia Porridge Cake Wealth condensation Dairy Crest Food Cream (food) Confectionery Tooth Polish cuisine Sugar Kelantan Cuisine of Brazil Sweet tea Rice Bose-Einstein condensate Johor Carton Sherbet Cura__ao Irish cuisine Mantou Chicha Curry Cuisine of India Cheese Pasteurization French toast Cocktail Lactose intolerance B__chamel sauce Water vapor Potato chips
