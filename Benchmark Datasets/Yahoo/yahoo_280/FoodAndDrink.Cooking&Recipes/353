bechamel sauce how do you make bechamel sauce when i attempt it i fond that it thickens too quickly even on a low heat how can i resolve this problem and make the perfect sauce i have my own ideas about the sauce but i will go to the sauce master for this one and the guy that said to add the roux i call it rux incrementally is correct give the man a cigar just as with seasoning salt it is always better to leave the food needing more than using too much sauce bechamel the amount of roux per given amount of milk depends on the use of the sauce thick versions used as the base thickner in traditional souffle' recipres often call for as much as ounces of roux per quart of milk grams per litre whereas bechamel based soups use approximately ounces per quart of milk grams per litre the following recipe produces a medium thick sauce appropriate for veretable gratin yield quart milk quart litre butter ounces grams flour ounces grams seasonings salt pepper nutmeg to taste bring the milk to a simmer in a quart saucepan whisk it from time to time to prevent a skin from forming on its surface short cut pour cold milk into the hot roux but stir very vigorously to prevent lumps from forming in a second quart saucepan gently melt the butter and add the flour stir the butter and flour over medium heat for about minutes until the flour has a pleasant toasty smell remove from the heat for about seconds to cool slightly whisk the simmering milk into the roux return the sauce to the stove and bring it back to a simmer while whisking once the sauce has returned to a slow simmer turn down the heat a move the saucepan so that only one side is over the flame this will cause a skin to form on only one side of the sauce's surface making it easy to skim cook the sauce gently for minutes to hour skimming off the skin that forms on its surface it is a good idea also to occasionally rub around the botttom and corners of the saucepan with a wooden spoon to prevent the sauce from scalding when the starchy taste has been cooked out of the sauce it can be seasoned and strained depending on its final use bechamel should be stirred while it is coling to prevent a skin from forming on its surface putting the pan over a tray of ice will of course speed cooling derivatives of sauce bechamel sauce mornay sauce soubise and cream follows sauce creme cream sauce traditional cream sauce is prepared by finishing quart of bechamel with fluid ounces of heqvy cream or creme fraiche sour cream is okay ml to l reducing the mixture down to three quarters its original volume and then adding fluid ounces ml more of heavy cream to enrich it and provide the correct consistency the sauce is then seasoned and finished with the juice of half a lemon in most modern kitchens unless the surface of the sauce needs to be glazed under the broiler cream sauce is usually replaced with lightly reduced cream enjoy the sauces Curry Cajun cuisine Soup Idli Sauce Ice cream Pancake Yoghurt Cheese Fish sauce Gumbo Cuisine of the Philippines Rum Carbon dioxide Russian cuisine Pizza Halva Bearnaise sauce Custard Chicken soup Cantonese cuisine Rice pudding Breakfast Cooking weights and measures French fries Cuisine of Brazil Brewery Pottery Chowder Chocolate Cream (food) Butter Chili con carne Cuisine of Malaysia French cuisine Stock (food) Japanese tea ceremony Ramen Peruvian cuisine Puff pastry Fire extinguisher Maple syrup Cuisine of the Southern United States Risotto Bacon Bengali cuisine Motor oil Soy sauce Explosive material Welding German cuisine Korean cuisine Cake Casting Flour Drill bit Milkshake Plastic Horehound Pasta Mango Polish cuisine Heat Wok Cuisine of Singapore Sushi Hamburger American Chinese cuisine Breastfeeding Fondue Soy protein Hypoglycemia Water purification Volume Bong Cocaine Dumpling Cha chaan teng Rice Internal ballistics Cuisine of Africa
