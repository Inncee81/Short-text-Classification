how to dry age a steak i love good steak i ussually get really high quality and rather expensive grass fed free range steaks ussually a porterhouse or ribeye but i would like to have one that is dry aged how can i do this at home and make sure it dosent go bad dry aging beef at home is not difficult to do at all yes it is difficult to get the same conditions as high end steak houses do it but it isn't all that difficult to get similar results one of the key differences between dry aging at home versus a professional butcher shop is you don't want mold to grow on your beef whereas if you are starting with a whole loin with the full thickness of fat and everything the mold and dried out exposed parts of the loin are just trimmed off if you keep your home aged beef relatively dry and sanitary you won't grow mold which needs a certain level of moisture but you will get the proper moisure loss and the enzymes will start to do their thing i usually use a choice grade whole strip loin or rib eye from costco rinse it well with cold water and pat dry with plenty of kitchen towels place it on a rack set over a sheet pan and put it in the fridge i usually start fat side down but you can start with either side up first depending on your personal technique let it dry out for a week or two depending on your preference make sure there is plenty of room for air to circulate check the beef on a daily basis to make sure you don't have a nice little microbiology science project on your hands as the beef ages in your fridge use kitchen towels to mop excess moisture as needed and clean the drip pan if necessary to keep things sanitary you want the temp to be farenheit fridges with built in circulation fans are best don't let the meat freeze or it won't work i have found it takes days to make a noticable difference in the texture and flavor of the beef without a good week or more of time to dry age whole strip loins i have cut double cut steaks first and dried them out a bit standing them on the fatty edge doing this for even days makes a difference overall dry aging at home is not difficult and is well worth results from the minimal effort needed Beef Steak Equine conformation Tofu Casting Bacon Bread Menstrual cup Dairy Cheese Upholstery T-bone steak Sushi Cuisine of Denmark Fish and chips Cookware and bakeware Barbecue Wood Hamster Mattress Desert Sewage treatment Sento Food preservation Pork chop Brewery Pizza Drill bit Insulin Poker jargon Hamburger Fancy rat Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hay Textile manufacturing Dialysis Vermicompost Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence Japanese cuisine Solar power Hemp Chili con carne Solar cell Food CPU cache Microeconomics Motor oil Coffee Pottery Breastfeeding Radio controlled airplane Jerky (food) Compost Ice core Mixed martial arts Welding Cheesesteak Refrigerator Veganism Gypsy moth Cuisine of the Southern United States Diving suit Professional wrestling throws Milk Foodborne illness Nutrition Knife Sugar Japanese toilet Soap Climate of the United Kingdom Blackjack Gas metal arc welding Tea Dishwasher French cuisine Hypoglycemia Blood (computer game) Butter Spark plug Kitchen Volleyball Houseplant Ramen Wound Towel Chicken Flax Ham
