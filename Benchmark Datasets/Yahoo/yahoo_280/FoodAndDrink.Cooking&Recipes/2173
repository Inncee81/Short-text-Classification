going to the grocery store on a budget i love food network and their recipees but quite frankly most of recipes cost you about or more to make this adds up to roughly only if you count on left overs for nights out of the week and doesn't even include you non food items for the many who are on budgets what recipes do you have that are frugel in the ingredient department thank you for any suggestions i love food network too best idea get a cookbook of some of your favorite chefs on fn or just go to their website the best way to budget when shopping is not to buy cheap stuff the way to do it is to select recipes that go together for example if you do one chicken one beef and one fish meal each week salmon filet with pineapple and rice spicy chicken with a pineapple salsa pineapple green peppers cilantro lime juice and whatever else sounds good to you spice up the chicken with chili powder black pepper and some garlic it will be delicious burrito night brown some ground beef use your left over rice from the first recipe throw in the cilantro lime juice green peppers and garnish with a little sour cream and cheese you can wrap all of it up in a tortilla and you haven't cost yourself a fortune total shopping list salmon chicken beef cilantro green pepper lime pineapple tortillas rice sour cream cheese easy to do it for under a week but like i said before just look for recipes that use a lot of the same ingredients good luck Pizza Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines MRE Cajun cuisine Chili con carne Cuisine of Thailand Breakfast Cantonese cuisine Salad Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Vietnam Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Barbecue Cuisine of Cambodia Bengali cuisine Korean cuisine Food Bread Vegetarian cuisine French cuisine Idli Russian cuisine Porridge Ketchup Sandwich French fries D__ner kebab Chile pepper Satay Recipe Fish and chips Cuisine of Greece Tofu Cuisine of Singapore Cuisine of the Southern United States Jewish cuisine Soup Laksa Chipotle Mexican Grill Soul food Mayonnaise Sauce Chicken soup Hot dog Cheese Salsa (sauce) Chocolate Polish cuisine Ice cream Cuisine of Turkey Coriander Burrito Cincinnati chili Pancake Potato Guacamole Coffee Cuisine of Argentina Sushi Nabemono Cuisine of Canada Empanada McDonald's Taiwanese cuisine Paella American Chinese cuisine Sichuan Pepper Apple pie Rice pudding Szechuan cuisine Gumbo Italian cuisine Worcestershire sauce Cuisine of Ethiopia Jiaozi French toast Cuisine of India
