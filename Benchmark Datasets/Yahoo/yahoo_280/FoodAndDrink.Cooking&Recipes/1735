does soy sauce expire yes it does and you may not know that it should be stored in the refrigerator after opening it looks like something that would last forever doesn't it i found this info from kikkoman when it comes to soy sauce i received the following advice from the consumer department at kikkoman while the comments refer specifically to kikkoman soy sauce in general they should be applicable to other soy sauce brands for the freshest tasting sauce we recommend using kikkoman soy sauce within three to six months after opening the sauce is still safe to use beyond this time but the quality may not be at its best once opened the freshness and flavor of the sauce will slowly deteriorate therefore we also recommend refrigerating the soy sauce after opening refrigeration helps the flavor and quality characteristics remain at their peak for a longer period in addition our soy sauce will not spoil if it is not refrigerated but its quality will decline faster a fresh bottle of kikkoman soy sauce should have a piquant flavor and reddish brown color when opened and exposed to air naturally brewed soy sauce will darken and become stronger in flavor and aroma over time this is the result of oxidation although this is not harmful in any way it will cause the quality to decline with an older bottle the sauce may appear darker in color and have a strong heavier taste we believe the flavor of our soy sauce is at its peak when the bottle is first opened Soy sauce Tofu Coffee Cantonese cuisine Milk Food science Natt__ Ramen Sake Japanese cuisine Ketchup Soy milk Vitasoy Bock Beer Mayonnaise Cuisine of the Philippines Tea McDonald's Trademark Peruvian cuisine Alcoholic beverage Basic taste Tobacco Cigar Soy protein Cuisine of Denmark Barbecue 7-Eleven Soybean Bread Chili con carne Tabasco sauce Vinegar Vanilla Sauce Brewery Pisco Sushi Conveyor belt sushi Cajun cuisine Cider Wasabi Soft drink Inca Kola Black pepper MRE Breastfeeding Cheese Domesticated turkey Champagne (beverage) Fish and chips Wine Hot dog Milkshake Bagel Tomato Fermentation Organic food Egg (food) Bong Cannabis (drug) Chocolate Yoghurt Fancy rat Yuengling Seitan Asiago cheese Tempeh Plastic Moonshine Pasta Fried rice French fries Donburi Cuisine of Malaysia Refrigerator Rooibos Korean cuisine Green tea Miso In-N-Out Burger Wood French cuisine Port wine Monosodium glutamate Wheat beer Vietnam Food Chicken soup Coca-Cola Water Cuisine of Laos Lager
