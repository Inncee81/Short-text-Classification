i made manicotti the other day and froze it this morning i defrosted it but it is very watery should i drain it before i put it in the oven to cook or will it need those juices it is manicotti with spinach and cheeses thanks for your help in my experience if it's watery going into the oven it will probably be watery coming out if the manicotti was still warm the steam may have turned back into water or the liquid may have separated from the tomatoes or tomato sauce here's what i would do drain some of the extra liquid off but save it bake the manicotti as usual but check mid way through the baking time if it seems dry you can always pour some of the reserved liquid over it again Pasta Tofu Cookware and bakeware Pizza MRE Bread Bagel Jewish cuisine Hamburger French fries Hot dog Baking Domesticated turkey Barbecue Japanese cuisine Breakfast Cuisine of the Philippines Ketchup Sugar beet French cuisine Dim sum Cantonese cuisine Microwave oven Mayonnaise Slow cooker Coffee Roman eating and drinking Solar power Bacon Water Coconut milk Cuisine of Africa Russian cuisine Cajun cuisine Ice cream Meatloaf Sauce Cheese Kraft Dinner Vinegar Chili con carne Dumpling German cuisine Cuisine of Greece D__ner kebab Rice pudding Idli Kitchen Bengali cuisine Food Dairy Brewery Cookie Salad Yoghurt Sugar Hot sauce Full English breakfast Carbon dioxide Soul food Dairy product Gumbo Curry Souffl__ Soy milk Ricotta cheese Chicago-style pizza Cake Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Turkey Refrigerator McDonald's Champagne (beverage) Hamster Wok Sandwich Flour Custard Oregano Skunk Water (molecule) Fire extinguisher Fish and chips Baptism Burger Wine making Fecal incontinence Soy sauce Renewable energy Cuisine of Singapore Peruvian cuisine Tomato Hydroponics Oyster Motor oil Basic taste Peking Duck
