i bought a new smoker what to smoke some ribs what seasonings should i use what temperature for how long any suggestions would be really helpful thanks i would suggest that you take it easy on yourself for your first run a dry rub of brown sugar ginger pepper salt perhaps some sage or cumin don't worry too much about this it's a 'side note' to the lovely smoke avoid liquid seasonings bbq sauce altogether they burn and are more mess that you want to deal with as for temperature i assume that you have a smallish smoker not some phone booth sized monster so set up your heat source whether charcoal gas or electric off to the side with your pan of fragrant soaked chips and put thed meat off the heat on the other side for ribs standing them on end like books on a shelf gives great exposure and will let you get quite a lot of meat in a small space a little trickery with aluminum foil 'snakes' can help you keep them upright and separate since smoking is slow and takes a while the safe cooking temp should not really be a problem if you are worried check with a thermometer for for a good safe temp that will insure doneness and not leave you with jerky your ribs will be just about done when you start seeing the meat shrink a bit and show off the bone ends mmmm save me one best wishes Barbecue Bacon Cantonese cuisine Cookware and bakeware Aluminium Bong Temperature Carbon dioxide Fire extinguisher Tofu Idli Renewable energy Hydrogen economy Jewish cuisine First aid Kitchen Welding Equine conformation Explosive material Korean cuisine Ham Dairy Gas metal arc welding Cuisine of Denmark Spark plug Plastic French fries Wok Alcohol fuel Steak Fire fighting Coal Stove Breastfeeding Soul food Curry Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Internal ballistics Hamburger Incandescent light bulb Prostate cancer One Piece minor characters MRE Bengali cuisine Comanche Food preservation Kosher foods Heat Electrical wiring Microwave oven Hookah Cigar Vacuum tube Casting Energy development Baroque chess Sauna CPU cache Chili con carne Cuisine of the Philippines Social rule Pottery The Smoking Room Shaggy dog story Black pepper Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fishing Battery (electricity) Dumpling Hot dog CPU design Stomach cancer Tobacco smoking Tire Coffee Survival skills Chile pepper Cuisine of Malaysia Mars Exploration Rover Laser Risotto Mercury (element) Vermicompost Red Hot Chili Peppers Apollo 13 Ammonia Hamster
