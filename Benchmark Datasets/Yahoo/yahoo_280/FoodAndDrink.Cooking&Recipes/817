ounce question i'm studying aromatherapy and i have to learn to make my own oils and it says to use ounce of fresh flowers or ounce for dried how much would that be exactly cause none of my utencils say ounce or my measuring cup so how am i supposed to know i think that you are attempting to make an infusion i also think that accurate measurement is a very important part of using essentials oils and should be addressed early in the education if you are indeed making an infusion you will be using measurements of weight and volume the ounces of flowers are weight the ounces of base oil are volume kitchen utensils for baking will have units of volume measurement if you are ordering your dry plant material you should be able to order by weight if you are picking your own you will need to use a scale to weigh your flowers if you are unsure of your judgement scales can be inexpensive and may be worth it if you are serious about blending if not your post office may have a scale in the lobby Cooking weights and measures Volume Pound English unit Essential oil Aromatherapy Ton Coffee Weighing scale United States Postal Service History of measurement Relative density Carbon dioxide Metrified English unit Gallon Lavender Cannabis (drug) Species Peanut Knife Imperial unit Metrication Leather Metrication arguments and counter-arguments Perfume Handloading Japanese tea ceremony Alcohol fuel Herbal tea Flax Porosity Champagne (beverage) Alcoholic beverage Systems of measurement Wok Bretton Woods system Malt liquor Illegal drug trade Weight Grape seed oil Indus Valley Civilization Yarrow Cookware and bakeware Explosive material Gold Transformer Kilogram Brewery Vacuum Tea Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Biodiesel Hamburger Hydrogen economy Kosher foods Litre Tea Classics Cheese British coinage Gold standard 613 mitzvot Grade (education) United States dollar B-2 Spirit Gramophone record Largest organism Plastic Oil refinery Plame affair Wood Caffeine Gumbo Hypoglycemia Hay Envelope Martini cocktail Casting Bayesian inference Age of the Earth Architecture of the California missions Jute Almond Temperature Pachypodium brevicaule Sea level rise Green tea Petroleum Cake Breastfeeding Hemp Intelligence quotient Units of measurement Margarine Graduate Record Examination Pachypodium baronii Diamond Jewish cuisine Menstrual cup
