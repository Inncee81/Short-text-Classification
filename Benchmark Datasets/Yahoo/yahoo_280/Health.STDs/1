curious on why i have a cold sore ok so i guess i have had cold sores before in the past but i have been with the same guy for years now we are sexually active i have always given him oral sex but just recently this started happening every time i give him oral a couple days later i get a cold sore i'm not sure why this would start to happen now he is completely clean down there but if he did have something i would definitley have it since we've been together so long we stopped using protection about years ago how can i stop this from happening what does this mean does this mean he has something i guess the main question i have is if i do have this hsv could he catch it down there i would never do anything with him if i had any type of cold sore but i mean but what am i supposed to do thanks for any advice you can give me many people have discovered that there are 'triggers' for the cold sores for some people it is prolonged sun exposure for other people it is trauma to the lips like when they hold your mouth open for long periods at the dentist and for others it is related to dry lips for others there is no discernible connection at all they just come if you have hsv and perform oral sex on him with an active cold sore you can pass it on to him he would have the oral form of herpes on his genitals the good news about that is that hsv infections of the genitals are usually not severe and may never erupt and if they do there is a good chance that after the first time it will not happen again if you are having frequent outbreaks it may be a good idea for you to speak with a doctor about suppressive therapy you should also ask your bf to get tested if he already has antibodies to hsv out of people in the us have antibodies you won't need to worry about infecting him because he would already have made antibodies Herpes simplex virus Oral sex Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Body piercing Cytomegalovirus AIDS Antibody Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS HIV test Safe sex Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hepatitis Cancer Radiation therapy AIDS reappraisal Urinary incontinence Aciclovir Syphilis H5N1 Child sexuality Transmission (medicine) Asthma Group A streptococcal infection Ebola Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breastfeeding Transsexuality Stomach cancer Massage Multiple sclerosis Sexual orientation Lupus erythematosus Chronic fatigue syndrome Herpesviridae Multiple myeloma Duesberg hypothesis Lyme disease Chancroid Female genital cutting Influenza Pneumonia Wisdom teeth Genital wart Autoimmune diseases Strap-on dildo Clomipramine Common cold Hearing impairment Traumatic brain injury Dentistry Penis Immune system Prostate cancer Immunosuppressive drug Chlorpromazine Wound Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders HIV Malaria Acne Avian influenza Traumatic incident reduction Fertility awareness Gay slang Infectious mononucleosis Child pornography Oral contraceptive Monoclonal antibody Intersex surgery Condom Anal sex First aid HIV vaccine Human sexuality Religion and sexuality Child sexual abuse Glucocorticoid Chemotherapy Obsessive-compulsive disorder Graves-Basedow disease Blood transfusion Propranolol Satanic ritual abuse Diabetes mellitus Human sexual behavior Infantilism AIDS pandemic Allergy Dentures
