positive and negative feed back of thyroid gland diseases im writing report right now please help me i checked wiki already anything you know about thyroid gland disease please thanks a lot n n all types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones but the condition can occur in several ways in graves' disease the release of excess hormones is triggered by an autoimmune disorder for some unknown reason the body attacks the thyroid causing it to spill out too much hormone at other times nodules called toxic adenomas develop in the thyroid gland and begin to secrete thyroid hormones upsetting the body's chemical balance some goiters may contain several of these nodules in subacute thyroiditis inflammation of the thyroid causes the gland to leak excess hormones resulting in temporary hyperthyroidism that generally lasts a few weeks but may persist for months although rare hyperthyroidism can also develop from pituitary gland malfunctions or from cancerous growths in the thyroid gland hypothyroidism by contrast stems from an underproduction of thyroid hormones since your body's energy production requires certain amounts of thyroid hormones a drop in hormone production leads to lower energy levels a common cause of hypothyroidism is hashimoto's thyroiditis an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks thyroid tissue the tissue eventually dies and stops producing hormones hypothyroidism can also result when the thyroid gland has been surgically removed or chemically destroyed as treatment for hyperthyroidism if you are exposed to excessive amounts of iodide perhaps from a hidden source such as cold and sinus medicines the heart medicine amiodarone or from certain contrast dyes given before some x rays you may be at greater risk for developing hypothyroidism especially if you have had thyroid problems in the past the drug lithium has also been linked as a cause of hypothyroidism untreated for long periods of time hypothyroidism can bring on a myxedema coma a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires immediate hormone injections hypothyroidism poses a special danger to newborns and infants a lack of thyroid hormones in the system at an early age can lead to the development of cretinism mental retardation and dwarfism stunted growth most infants now have their thyroid levels checked routinely soon after birth if they are hypothyroid treatment begins immediately in infants as in adults hypothyroidism can be due to a pituitary disorder a defective thyroid or lack of the gland entirely a hypothyroid infant is unusually inactive and quiet has a poor appetite and sleeps for excessively long periods of time cancer of the thyroid gland is quite rare and occurs in less than of thyroid nodules you might have one or more thyroid nodules for several years before they are determined to be cancerous people who have received radiation treatment to the head and neck earlier in life possibly as a remedy for acne tend to have a higher than normal propensity for thyroid cancer Folic acid Glucocorticoid Medicine Stroke Cryptorchidism Clinical depression Chernobyl accident Milk Vitamin C Cushing's syndrome Thyroid hormone Amiodarone Human height Fibromyalgia Polycystic ovary syndrome Bone marrow transplant Vitamin D Atrial fibrillation Pneumonia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Crohn's disease Hypopituitarism Gigantism Anemia Prolactinoma Brain tumor Chakra Rheumatoid arthritis Haloperidol Menstrual cycle Radioactive contamination Cytomegalovirus Endometriosis Addison's disease Group A streptococcal infection Multiple sclerosis Cardiac arrhythmia Kidney Herpes simplex virus Edible salt Obesity Delayed puberty Glycogen storage disease type I Homeopathy Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Pituitary gland Cirrhosis Protein-energy malnutrition Obstetrics Carpal tunnel syndrome Breast Radiation poisoning Hyperprolactinaemia Anorexia nervosa Erectile dysfunction Abortion Liver Diarrhea Allergy Tuberculosis Asthma Leukemia
