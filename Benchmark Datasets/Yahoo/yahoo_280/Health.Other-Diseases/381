scoliosis surgery pleasee help i have two degree curves and they both rotate i dont know how much first time i was there it was top and bottom about months later i got another x ray and now they are both last time my doctor said i would probobly get a brace next time i meet him but now he said that there are studies seeing if they even work so no brace i want a night brace at least since i think i have scoliosis since i sleep on one side and i tested it by switching on the other side and well its going to take a long time to explain so whatever im trying to sleep on my back they said im in the gray zone for needing surgery well the first doctor said i probably wont then the second person said i prob will im coming back in december which is about months after the last time i met them they planned it year but i was too scared since it would probobly get a lot worse its just the chances are im going to need surgery sure one of my curves only gained degree but i dont think that will happen for both of my curves in months not months they said i have about months year of growth left in me so i was searching up info on scoliosis surgery and i am so scared now i saw pictures of people after the surgery and its so scary seeing all the wires around them and the scar is so long i know i have like months left until i meet them but should i just make it a year if you had scoliosis surgery how was it the day you woke up was there a tube in your urinal system what about the back end if now how did you go im sorry for so much but im just so scared i have scoliosis too i wore a brace for almost a year but not to correct it i wore it to keep it from getting worse then i had surgery last november it took nine hours and afterward i was exhausted and in a lot of pain all i wanted to do was sleep sleep and sleep some more but i had to take walks around the hospital when i went home i felt terrible and sick but i got better over a period of weeks i'm doing very good now although i might have to have the surgery again due to a curve the doc didn't fix that's getting worse i have titanium rods in my back one on each side of my spine sometimes i have sharp pain in my back so i draw my shoulders back or rub the painful area and it goes away for a while just wanted to tell you my story so you'll know some of what to expect if you have to have it here are some answers to questions you asked me no i did not have any pain before surgery maybe some people would but i didn't i wasn't even crooked it was really weird i had the surgery on a monday and went home the next sunday afternoon so i stayed in the hospital for almost a week i don't really remember when i started walking but i guess it was maybe two or three days after surgery pretty soon after before the surgery was started after they put me to sleep they put a urinary catheter in me to drain the urine from my body until i could get up and go to the bathroom by myself which was just a few days after so then a nurse took it out i would always wake up at like in the morning having to go very weird for me and once i had forgotten how to get up so i called a nurse but unlike many people i'm really good at holding it in so i never had an accident i knew about the whole catheter thing from way before my surgery from doing research online so i knew it was coming hope those answers helped Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story EastEnders Stomach cancer Babe Ruth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
