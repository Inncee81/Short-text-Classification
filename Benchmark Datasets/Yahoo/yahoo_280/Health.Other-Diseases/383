what medical problems can result from exposure to a laptop explosion i'll try not to be vague here i'm not talking about the effects that result when the person is directly in front of the explosion i e burns wounds etc i was wondering if breathing in the smoke could result in health problems would it contain toxins and carcinogens that would be harmful even during brief exposure would it be expected to result in things like sinus pressure headaches fatigue nasal discharge etc i don't know if this makes any difference but the laptop battery which caused the explosion was a lithium battery hi i cant imagine that very short exposure could cause lasting effects a healthy person should be quite equiped to detoxify and process harmful things that are breathed in or absorbed through the skin of course if you live in the west you probably get a lot of non organic chemicals from detergents clothes soaps hygeine items etc so that can cause a bit of an overload over time so the short exposure to the laptop would just add to this collection of chemicals that your body cant get rid of some chemicals collect in the liver for example no one is entirely sure how to prevent toxic build up and some dont even think we are affected by the chemicals in our environment to play it on the safe side just eat a good diet with anti oxidants and maybe think about an alternative de tox program Cancer Explosive material Decompression sickness Sewage treatment Pneumonia Multiple chemical sensitivity Ionizing radiation Hypoglycemia Hydrogen peroxide Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Benzene Methamphetamine Clinical depression Vitamin C Pollution Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Polychlorinated biphenyl Beryllium Battery (electricity) Air pollution Fire fighting Hay fever Rebreather Ammonia Fire extinguisher Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Depleted uranium Hygiene Multiple sclerosis Carbon dioxide Hydrogen sulfide Uranium Plutonium Healthy eating Dioxin Nutrition Aspartame Welding Asthma Silver First aid Kryptonite DNA repair Diabetes mellitus DDT Cocaine Haloalkane Mercury (element) Animal testing Methanol Toxicity Anthrax Lung cancer Edible salt Eczema Common cold Theory of conduct Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coeliac disease Nuclear power Folic acid Raw food diet Alcohol fuel Use of poison gas in World War I Organic food Lithium ion battery Hydrogen economy Styrene Paracetamol Eutrophication Sunscreen Chloroform Tocopherol Polyvinyl chloride Allergy Epilepsy Hyperthermia 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Asbestos Insulin Omega-3 fatty acid Lithium Aflatoxin Nitroglycerin Technetium Thimerosal Cresol Plastic
