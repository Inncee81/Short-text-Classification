advise from chronic sciatica suffers i have had sciatica for years caused from a fall it has been pretty quiet lately i know its there but no full blown episodes the last time i had one the doctor suggested a nerve block i have read good and bad about this so i opted not to he then make the comment well when you start having incontinence you will change your mind now apparent sciatica can cause this or he would not have said it my question is will i just lose bladder control and pee all over myself or will i have slight incontinence i e dribbling i have back issues as well two herniated discs that give me the same symptoms of sciatica i have been also told that at some point that i could have incontinence and it was described to me like just having no control over at all i didn't take it as a scare tactic but as a potential result of the problem i am dealing with over the course of dealing with this for years long term like you i have had many nerve blocks done and they do provide immediate relief but short term for the most part the longest period of time i went pain free was months i have also have two discectomies done where they remove the part of the disc that is touching the nerve which causes the pain the main concern that i would have for you is to not get too many nerve blocks not too many how many is that i don't know i have lost count of the times i have had this done to my back i know it is maybe near times in the last years as they are done in a series of three injections over a week period some doctors do it over a week period depends on their thoughts on it i guess i now suffer from avn avascular necrosis which is a bone disease from having too much cortisone shot into my body please understand that this takes a lot of cortisone to get this disease so don't be afraid of getting a series or two of the shots for the pain relief i would do it all over again to be pain free for those short periods of time as you know back pain is one of the most miserable things to go through sorry so long i just wanted to give you another point of view Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Sciatica Carpal tunnel syndrome Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chiropractic Traumatic brain injury Addiction Migraine Multiple sclerosis Stomach cancer Clinical depression Penis Milton H.
