i have a question regarding ativan i take ativan only when needed and the next day i feel so tired and out of it is that normal my dr only told me to take it when i feel an anxiety attack coming on sometimes i just take it to help me sleep i have taken it the last few days and this will be the first day without taking it will i have withdrawals feeling tired and out of it after taking any sleep aid is normal you probably should use the ativan only for the anxiety attacks it can be habit forming if overused the reason that you feel worn out even after sleeping all night after taking it has to do with the mechanism of normal sleep have you heard of rem sleep rapid eye movement this is the stage of sleep that is when your eyes move rapidly back and forth and if i remember correctly it occurs when you are dreaming i do know that the amount of rem cycles that a person has varies night to night to reset yourself so that you feel rested you need to be able to experience rem sleep unfortunately when you take a sleep aid such as ativan it acts by tranquilizing your brain in effect keeping you from getting to those rem cycles that you need what you are experiencing with the tiredness etc is a drug hangover a safer alternative to something as strong as ativan would be benadryl diphenhydramine some of the newer sleep drugs state that they don't make you tired the next day but i have no idea if this is true as far as withdrawals after using the med for a few days to get to sleep unlikely however you may find it harder to get to sleep when you try to go without the med all this is from a purely medical standpoint there are many non med ways to promote sleep without relying on pills to get there ie exercise reading a book etc hope this helps Sleep Narcolepsy Dream Rapid eye movement Sedative Chronic fatigue syndrome Chlorpromazine Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Urinary incontinence Lorazepam Hypnosis Clinical depression Panic attack Insomnia Psychosis Anxiety Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Epilepsy Migraine Stuttering Alcoholism Polyphasic sleep Electroencephalography Diazepam Bipolar disorder Antidepressant Hypoglycemia Drowning Psoriasis Fibromyalgia Avenue Q Caffeine Drug addiction Infantilism Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Weight training Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antipsychotic Traumatic brain injury Common cold Stomach cancer Daylight saving time Clomipramine Benzodiazepine Malaria R.E.M.
