i think i may have an ingrown toenail i thought my shoes were just getting too small but when i took them off it still hurt to press on the skin of my left big toe the skin facing the outside not the other toes and i can't find the edge of the nail i think it might be grown into the skin and i'm really scared i'm only and i don't know what they'll have to do to it or how much it will hurt it doesn't hurt when i don't press it or if i just touch it the skin is slightly raised where the nail is hidden making kind of a bump but not a round one it looks different from that on my right foot please help me i'm so scared thanks a home remedy that i have used all my life works pretty well and no doctors involved get a tiny piece of cotton from a qtip or cotton ball and try to wedge the cotton underneath the side of the nail that is growing into your foot put a drop of nail polish over this and it should be better in a week or so this will hurt like heck but it has worked for me every time if it gets worse or gets to where you can't walk on it i would suggest seeing a podiatrist he can numb it and cut it out if it gets too severe hope this helps Aerial (dance move) Nine Inch Nails Callus Nail disease High-heeled shoe Milton H.
