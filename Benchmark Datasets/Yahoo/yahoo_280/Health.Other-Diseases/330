lupus rash or allergic reaction last night i began to have a burning sensation around my lips and lower cheek i figured i was getting a cold sore and would deal with it in the morning so i went to bed i awoke at midnight and to my surprise my whole face was hurting in painful burning sensation and a feeling of numb i couldn't open or close my eyelids completely so i decided to wake up and talk to my parents about it they tweaked i guess i looked either dead or like an alien my eyelids were swollen beyond belief and as they have before had slits in them which pour blood my eyes were and still are so swollen i can barely see and you can't see the white part of my eye just the color part and pupil barely my face was completely swollen cheeks chin lips nose and eyes all but my forehead and ears i was taken to the er and they diagnosed it as an allergic reaction but couldn't tell what i was allergic to i've had my allergy tests nothing showed up they prescribed me steriods predisone zyrtec and benadryll they gave me my first dosage in the hospital and i stayed there for three hours they said it would start working by then it hadn't nothing changed they sent me home and i continued with the medicine and it's been over hours and nothing has changed my face is the same except now i have a redish pink purplish idk rash on my inner cheeks and over my nose by the way my face doesn't itch but they said it was probably posion ivy oak or sumac but i don't have any of that in my yard and i was my hands like times a day important i have been dealing with an unknown condition for over years and haven't found a diagnosis i have seen myany doctors and now i'm going to see a rheumatologist because all my doctors think it's autoimmune and found autoimmune traces in biopsies all my symptoms are mostly autoimmune and most likely point to lupus which runs in my family usually every other or generations of the females both sides er information my hometown hospital doesn't bring me good luck i've been there a few times and all my diagnosis were wrong even after scopes x rays etc the doctors have mistaken a broken foot with a sprained ankle yeah ouch they have mistaken my benign brain tumor with brain cancer and wanted to operate asap but thank god my neurologist stopped it because i didn't need it and there was a fifty percent chance i'd live they mistook my gastritis with pud i didn't even had any ulcers and i've had over scopes and colonoscopies i had appendicitis and they confirmed and i needed immediate surgery but the surgeon decided he didn't want to come in so after hours of the docs and him fighting i was sent home sorry to blab on so much but my question is do you think this is just an allergic reaction possibly to sun because i get rashes and sick in the sun do you think it has anything to do with my immune system or some sort of disease especially because after so long nothing has gotten better on the medicine as far as i know i haven't been bitten by anything but two praying mantis did jump on me the other day when i was outside awkward but i don't think they're harmful i will say that we have a bat problem in our beautiful house yesterday my parents were up all night getting them out but as far as i know i wasn't bit because the burning started before i went to bed i've already seen a gi doctor and got all the tests available even camera pill they found what they needed to find and its autoimmune as i said before which is why i'm seeing a rheuma i'm not going into any other symptoms though not enough time p but i don't have celiac or any gi diseases except gastritis erosion and ulcers hi im chris im so sorry what is happening to you but i know exactly what you are going through from first hand experience i have lupus and severe allergies just this week i was exsposed to some ladies very cheap very flowery perfume i got the swollen eyes itchiness swollen lips blotchiness and on top of that spent days in bed because of the lupus my body could not fight the allergy my eyes took several days to go down its friday im still itchy and i still have a headache at times my lips however went down after days of massive doses of benydryl and allegra d it has happened to me so much i rarely bother with the er anymore ive kind of figured out what they do the dosage etc and do it at home just without the steroids im allergic to those ironically it sounds like the hospital you go to is very imcompetent and i very much hope you dont live in an area too rual you need another hospital also growing up i lived in an area with fruit bats which i suspect is what is in and around your house to my knowledge they are rather harmless though not very nice to look at are they ive never in my life heard of them biting or harming someone they used to live in one of my trees in the summer my suspision is that your allergic reaction came from somthing you have contact with pretty much on a daily basis it happens to me often as someone with an autoimmne disease i can be fine with somthing one day say strawberries then out of the blue have a severe allergic reaction to it another time then i dont touch them for awhile and ill be fine again so it could have been somthing in your diet a shampoo you use daily or a soap anything in the household that you developed some kind of temporary or even permenent allergy to it happens to me often just about any autoimmune disease can cause this to happen our own cells in our bodies become hyperactive thinking they are under attack so anything at anytime can happen we can form allergies overnight or get the flu when not even exposed etc about your hometown hospital i hope you live in an area that is not so rual that your parents can easily drive a half hour to an hour to get you to a better hospital that place sounds more dangerous than any illness anybody can have they are a lawsuit waiting to happen about the lupus your young i know dr's dont like labeling teens with things like lupus at such a young age unless your life is in immeadiate danger i know i waited until my 's though i clearly had it im now almost i know others in the same position i know girls that were both diagnosed around because they needed medications for their lupus right away they had organ threatining lupus also labeling someone that young can hurt your chances for going to college in case you have a remisson or the dr's happen to be wrong because once your diagnosed it cant be taken back here is the lupus critera you must meet of also your blood test can be showing any number of possible autoimmune disorders diagnostic criteria for lupus the following criteria are used to distinguish lupus systemic lupus erythematosus or sle from other autoimmune and rheumatic diseases a person with of these conditions can be diagnosed with lupus symptoms suggest that lupus is probably present and raise the possibility of lupus symptoms may be present all at once or appear in succession over a period of time butterfly malar rash on cheeks rash on face arms neck torso discoid rash skin rashes that result from exposure to sunlight or
