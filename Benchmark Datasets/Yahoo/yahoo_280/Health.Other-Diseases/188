what is the best treatment for injured herniated bulging or degenerative discs help i'm a college student who has tried everything from pain management to chiropractic to orthopedic to physical therapy no treatment has been deemed superior physical therapy chiropratic care and pain management have all been determined to have equal long term outcomes however i think part of the problem with reseach on treatments of low back pain is that most back pain is never properly diagnosed your mri may display bulging or herniated discs but they might be completely irrelevant to your symptoms a thorough mechanical assessment to see what happens to your pain during certain movements is necessary to classify your pain once your pain has been classified into mechanical or non mechanical and subsequently one of the further subcategories can you seek the appropriate treatment for instance for someone whose pain is due to a bulging disc and confirmed by mechanical assessment massage and stablization exercises will usually not help conversely someones whose pain is due to another reason will not be helped by the same methods used to treat the bulging disc to say the very least most back pain is poorly classified even if mri has been done a thorough classification is needed to do this this is a procedure that only a handful of pts dcs and mds are credentialed to perfrom if you have not done so already i suggest you have a mechanical evaluation by finding a credentialed provider at http www mckenziemdt org another option you might hear about is spinal decompression this is typically performed at a chiroprators office many are being lured to this with the statement that it has over a effectiveness rate however what they do not tell people is that this is at the day mark only short term results and only for people who have a one level problem without degenerative changes as more levels and degeneration is involved the numbers drop to etc similar to physical therapy no large long term outcome studies have been done and i suspect it has similar results as pt and pain mangement i'm not against it i just think it is not being fully honest with its marketing i have had patients who've gone through it and i was seeing them for another reason and they state they find themselves going back times a year for further treatment i would highly recommend the mdt website and also exploring different pratcitioners within the same fields you've tried there are always different treatment approaches among practicioners Prostate cancer Medicine Cancer Physical therapy Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Clinical depression Traumatic brain injury Aortic dissection Migraine Pneumonia Syringomyelia Addiction Traditional Chinese medicine Massage Paracetamol Asthma Intracranial pressure Stroke Bipolar disorder Autism Chronic fatigue syndrome Abortion Controversies in autism Malignant melanoma Hypoglycemia Childbirth Psychoanalysis Breast cancer COX-2 inhibitor Diabetes mellitus Intelligence quotient Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brain tumor Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alternative medicine Fibromyalgia Growth hormone treatment Carpal tunnel syndrome Sciatica Transsexuality Reparative therapy Homeopathy Medical analysis of circumcision Hypnosis Antidepressant Scientific method Stomach cancer Aphasia Osteopathy Oncology Endometriosis Magnetic resonance imaging Nurse Crohn's disease Myocardial infarction Epidural Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Stuttering Weight training Hypertension Mental Health Act 1983 Chlorpromazine Urinary incontinence Antiretroviral drug Mesothelioma Radiation therapy Psychosis Iliotibial band syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Colorectal cancer Acupuncture Electroconvulsive therapy Anorexia nervosa First aid Battle of the Bulge Parkinson's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Prolactinoma Psoriasis Cardiac stress test Neurofeedback Atrial fibrillation Adult attention-deficit disorder Psychiatry Post-traumatic stress disorder Lung cancer Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Palliative care
