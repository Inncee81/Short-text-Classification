what will happen if i skip taking my prescribed medicines for over a week i have severe lupus nephritis since i was prescribed by my doctors strong medications that according to them help control further spread of the disease in my system the trouble is in the next four years of treatment my medications increased from a dozen to up to different pills a day that were a combination of immuno suppressants anti osteoporosis anti cholesterol anti diuretic and anti hypertension it's like of them are there to counter the side effects of the prescribed suppressants so what made me skip everything for a week now was because i began hating each one of them due to their bitterness i'm at a loss so could anyone please tell me what to do your concern is highly appreciated hi i have lupus and autoimmune hepatitis like you i take strong meds some with very unpleasent side effects immunosuppresents at times ive been on iv chemo i take liver meds so many for i think one month i just totally forgot my liver meds i felt fine in that area plus like you i was rather tired of popping so many pills in a day it just gets tiring and the side effects can be horrendus well my liver was going into failure and at the same time i got cebritis of the brain both together landed me on iv chemo for almost months if you or if you have already stopped taking your meds for the nephritis or any of the other things your kidneys will totally shut down and you will probablly need one of two things dyalisis and or a transplant also with kidneys and lupus that really is what most lupus paitents die from if your not careful im going under the assumption that your on high doses of cellcept of the nephritis im on it right now for a flare like you im having some side effects that i need to talk to my dr about but the good news is you rebeled and only skipped week you can easily get everything back under control and start again i co own an online support group for those with lupus and similar diseases we all hate what we deal with but we all have to realize we didnt ask for this we dont deserve it but we have it and this is our lives we just have to cope with the cards given to us i think what you did is rather naturaual i think most of the people in my group have either done it thought of it or held back on taking a perscribed med at some point just because we get angry sad and miss what we were but at some point we just accept what is but with lupus nephritis you have to be super careful and though the pills and side effects stink to live and get the nephritis under control you have to take the medication for nopw at the perscribed dose we have a memeber with nephritis and she was put on a very high dose of cell cept but it worked and they are now lowering her dose slowly i hope this helps chris Lupus erythematosus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Antiretroviral drug Hypertension Prostate cancer Immunosuppressive drug Clinical depression Propranolol Paracetamol Multiple sclerosis Herpes simplex virus Migraine Maprotiline Bone marrow transplant Stomach cancer Liver Chronic fatigue syndrome Growth hormone treatment Cancer Doxepin COX-2 inhibitor Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Urinary incontinence Chemotherapy Endometriosis Pneumonia IgA nephropathy Kidney Clomipramine Glucocorticoid Rabies Amiodarone Alcoholism Tocopherol Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Malaria Oral contraceptive Buprenorphine Methylsulfonylmethane Sildenafil Primidone Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Haloperidol Anorexia nervosa Diazepam Dialysis Antipsychotic Hepatitis Insulin Gout Common cold Coeliac disease Bupropion Alzheimer's disease Crohn's disease Dieting Radiation therapy Stroke Bipolar disorder Alternative medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Radiation poisoning Dexamethasone Creatine Charles Darwin's illness Vitamin D Traumatic brain injury Nephrotic syndrome Endocrinology Growth hormone deficiency Diuretic Asthma Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Organ transplant Autoimmune diseases Hypoglycemia Menstrual cycle Fibromyalgia Caffeine Vitamin C Flecainide Chlorpromazine Sulfasalazine Acute renal failure Sarcoidosis
