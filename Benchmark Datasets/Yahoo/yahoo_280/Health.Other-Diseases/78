can anyone tell me what its like to have your gull bladder removed what was the surgery like how long did it take to recover are there any pre op requirements procedures to go through any other details would be great to hear about also thx i've never had my gallbladder removed but i have assisted several times in the removal of other people's gallbladder it's usually a painless procedure while u are having it removed you are put to sleep good ol' anesth they can either do the procedure laparoscopically they make about small incisions at various parts points of your abdomen they insert a long tube with a camera at the end to see your insides and another long tube that sorta has a scissor at the end to cut vessels and remove the bladder they also have a tube that is sorta like a hand to move things like your liver aside the camera will project your inside onto a nice screen that the doctors will be watching as they perform the procedure once they start not including the time u enter the room and go to sleep they can take anywhere from mins to over an hour once they removed the gallbladder they emove it while placed in a sack from one of the holes they made this will probably be the largest insertion made they rinse you out with sterile water and suction that out then they stick you back up when u awake in recovery you will have small tiny sticky tapes on your stomach where they made the incisions you may feel a little pain you should be able to ask for pain meds you will then be monitored for bowel sounds making sure everything is working ok and you are able to drink and things of that nature if no other complications arise you can go home the next day the other method is to plain out open you up make one big cut into your abdomen and everything is out in the open and take out the gallbladder the laparoscopic way leads to less bleeding and decrease hospital stay Cholecystectomy Cholecystitis Gallstone Prostate cancer Abdominal surgery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dialysis Colorectal cancer Gallbladder Abortion Abdomen Adjustable gastric band Stomach cancer Obstetrics Laparotomy Endometriosis Breastfeeding Acupuncture Cirrhosis Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hernia Cancer Stroke Appendicitis Menstrual cup Brewery Caesarean section Liver Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Cystoscopy Minimally invasive Childbirth Intravenous therapy Intersex surgery Mesothelioma First aid Bong Diabetic retinopathy Feeding tube Gastroparesis Apollo 8 Intraocular lens Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cocaine Thoracotomy Medicine Earring Fecal incontinence Pneumonia Intact dilation and extraction Kidney Gastric bypass surgery Drowning Fistula Tracheotomy Textile manufacturing Surgery Knife Sleep apnea Autopsy Inguinal hernia Autonomic nervous system Organ transplant Shaggy dog story Thermal power station The Inside Syringomyelia Hypoglycemia Alcoholism LASIK Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Printed circuit board Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Euthanasia Spina bifida Sigmoidoscopy Dental caries Floppy disk Sento Tourniquet Venipuncture M16 (rifle) Tattoo Terri Schiavo Poker jargon The Shining (film) Female genital cutting Emergency Medical Services Diarrhea Local anesthesia Theory of conduct Gastroesophageal reflux disease Kidney stone Acute pancreatitis Chernobyl accident
