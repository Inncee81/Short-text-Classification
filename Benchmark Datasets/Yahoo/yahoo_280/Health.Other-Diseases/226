different causes for headaches i got the headaches when i was have had them constantly for years the only thing that varies is the level of pain when they started my legs went numb i couldn't breath my vision went black i was constantly dizzy and walked with a cane to keep my balance dizziness subsided but headaches remain over the past month they have been increasing in pain have been to doctors had tests performed and they gave up other symptons are i get what i call black outs i loose my vision and get increasing pain it lasts minutes pain medications don't help the only thing that dulls the pain a bit are percocets have tried antidepressents migraine meds have been to neurologist heart specialist and chiropractor doctors gave up but headaches are getting worse does anyone have any idea what could cause this i'm looking into any illness that it could possibly be hopefully i can find some new ideas to go to the doctor with constant headache for years and wouldn't i be dead now if it were a tumor it's been years i got my first migraine at it took countless tests mri's ct scans xrays etc and went to every concievable type of doctor i went through nerve blocks epidural steroid injections trigger point injections spinal adjustments cranial sacral therapy and many more treatments as well as some major meds all of which were just 'band aids' but then i found a doctor brain and spinal surgeon who persisted and did a disc o gram they found two ruptured discs and it requires a disc fusion with titanium hardware to correct however another option offered to me was botox i get injections in the neck and shoulder area every to months to keep the muscles from 'locking' up and triggering migraines of course the explanation of how and why the botox works is much more lenthy but it worked something else worth mentioning is that when i moved from a big city to a small coastal area my migraines went from times a month to times a year whether it was pollution stress or the humid salt air i'm not sure but it made a huge difference the bottom line is to find a doctor that will do whatever it takes to find the real cause even if you have to sit in the hospital for a week everything else is just a guess on their part Urinary incontinence Childbirth Stroke Chiropractic Syringomyelia Epidural Cluster headache Local anesthesia Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Paget's disease of bone Clinical depression Epilepsy Carpal tunnel syndrome Pneumonia Lumbar puncture Stem cell Hypoglycemia Fibromyalgia LSD Diabetes mellitus Brain tumor Back pain Asthma Bipolar disorder Aortic dissection Prolactinoma Psoriasis Myocardial infarction Diabetic neuropathy Sciatica Aspartame Cephalic disorder M__ni__re___s disease Tension headache Diazepam Antidepressant Animal testing Stuttering Cancer Multiple chemical sensitivity Lamotrigine Insulin Spina bifida Propranolol Hyperthermia Clomipramine Medicine Dyslexia Neurology Botulism Radiation therapy Magnetic resonance imaging Growth hormone treatment Autonomic nervous system Osteoarthritis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pain Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Brain Myasthenia gravis Neurofibromatosis type II Malignant melanoma Post-traumatic stress disorder Folic acid Hip fracture Medical cannabis Spinal cord injury Obesity Headache Autism Cannabis (drug) Chlorpromazine Oscilloscope Spinal stenosis Neuropathy Benign intracranial hypertension Drowning Neurosurgery Fecal incontinence Subdural hematoma Colorectal cancer Hypertension Anxiety Adult attention-deficit disorder
