about familial spherocytosis i was always told by physicians that my frequent and easy bruising was a result of this genetic condition i was advised to increase my folic acid intake which i did as i now take of the rda every day it is a bit better but at times i still bruise pretty easily of what i have looked at online i cannot find any other recommended ways to help deal with the small effects this can cause bruising is small just leads to awkward questions at times if you have this or any familiarity with this is there anything else mineral vitatmin etc that would also help dude this is like best answer ever i swear i didn't cut and paste it from wikipedia hereditary spherocytosis is a genetically transmitted form of spherocytosis an auto hemolytic anemia characterized by the production of red blood cells that are sphere shaped rather than donut shaped and therefore more prone to hemolysis as in non hereditary spherocytosis the spleen's hemolysis results in observational symptoms of fatigue pallor and jaundice in a peripheral blood smear the abnormally small red blood cells lacking the central pallor as seen in non hereditary spherocytosis is typically more marked in hereditary spherocytosis other protein deficiencies cause hereditary elliptocytosis pyropoikilocytosis or stomatocytosis in longstanding cases and in patients who have taken iron supplementation or received numerous blood transfusions iron overload may be a significant problem being a potential cause of cardiomyopathy and liver disease measuring iron stores is therefore considered part of the diagnostic approach to hereditary spherocytosis hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant trait most commonly though not exclusively found in northern european and japanese families although an estimated of cases are due to spontaneous mutations a patient has a chance of passing the disorder onto his her offspring presuming that his her partner does not also carry the mutation hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that code for spectrin ankyrin protein and other erythrocyte membrane proteins these proteins are necessary to maintain the normal shape of an erythrocyte which is a biconcave disk the protein that is most commonly defective is ankyrin as the spleen normally targets abnormally shaped red cells which are typically older it also destroys spherocytes as in non hereditary spherocytosis acute symptoms of anemia and hyperbilirubinemia indicate treatment with blood transfusions or exchanges and chronic symptoms of anemia and splenomegaly indicate dietary supplementation of iron and splenectomy the surgical removal of the spleen experimental gene therapy exists to treat hereditary spherocytosis in lab mice however this treatment has not yet been tried on humans and because of the risks involved in human gene therapy it may never be just call me doctor ludd AIDS Von Willebrand disease Bone marrow transplant Mesothelioma Growth hormone Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Duchenne muscular dystrophy Cytomegalovirus Pneumonia Long QT syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Obstetrics Rheumatoid arthritis Spleen Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Genetic engineering Glycogen storage disease type I Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Stem cell Gout Traumatic brain injury Herpes simplex virus Lung cancer Growth hormone deficiency Immunosuppressive drug Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Kidney Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Protein Blood transfusion Senescence Protein-energy malnutrition Pulmonary embolism
