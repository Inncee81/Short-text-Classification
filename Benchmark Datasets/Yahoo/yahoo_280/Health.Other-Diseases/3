i am so worried can there be something done hi everyone it's me john i am here to complain about my vision problem and i need to know if they're any help available for me i am physically challenged and my vision is becoming worse due to excessive floaters my vision is fine as far as i am concerned just the floaters that are causing complication and annoyance i was told by my eye specialist that the floaters would gradually disapear on their own like fall below my vision i asked how long this will take and they told me approximately one year or two when i first suspected a floater it looked like a tread it was not a problem at first but gradually over time the tiny little tread has become a massive cobweb covering up my beautiful vision my eyes are corrected to with glasses but when the cobweb comes across my vision my vision would be less than very poor this causes problem for me to drive at nights and even to see road signs correctly like the small road signs i have been having floaters in both eyes now for years and they only get worse i have my eyes checked on twice a year and the doctors told there is nothing they can do to remove floaters unless they blast them which will make things worse than it is the floaters were the reason i had a hard time passing my vision test at the dmv department to obtain my driver license at that time i had to wait a few seconds for the floaters to completely move out of my vision in order to read the little letters at dmv which i successfully and luckily passed however the floaters has become worse now and i might be unfortunate this year to pass my dmw vision test to renew my driver license the floaters make driving at nights risky and difficult so that s why i do not drive at nights under no circumstances tell me what help you think i can get thanks john ps the doctors said i have no other vision problems so i won't go blind my mom had problems with large floaters in one of her eyes it turned out that her retina was detached and she had it corrected with an operation i would suggest checking with your doctor but i see from reading your question you have seen your doctor several times i guess the next time you go ask if your problem could be a detatched retina i hope they can find the problem and that your vision will eventually become fixed Floater Eye Diabetic retinopathy Myopia Color Debugging Poker jargon Driver's license GED M16 (rifle) Glasses Floppy disk Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Retina Eyeglass prescription Driving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball Apollo 8 Carburetor Light pollution Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Big Brother (USA TV series) Love and Theft Drunk driving (United States) Heinkel He 112 Conspiracy (TNG episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Combine (Half-Life 2) Tire The Shining (film) Philosophy of perception Chris Amon Car handling Sin City Collision detection Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Color blindness Kasparov versus The World Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer God Emperor of Dune IBM PC compatible Spacecraft propulsion Bike lane debate Second Battle of the Atlantic Operation Market Garden Web crawler Jam (TV series) Dead Like Me A Canticle for Leibowitz Urinary incontinence File Allocation Table Mach kernel Electrophysiology Heinkel He 100 Bicycle lighting Automatic number plate recognition Phoebe Halliwell Hard disk The Book of Five Rings Hypoglycemia Grand Prix Legends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule National Hockey League All-Star Game Fast bowling Chronic fatigue syndrome Refractive surgery British Free Corps Year 2000 problem Medicine Michael Schumacher Doctor (Doctor Who) Road-rule enforcement camera Traumatic brain injury Traffic light Logopolis Medicare (Canada) Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Spatial disorientation Multiple sclerosis Jumpstart 3rd Grade Health insurance Loudspeaker Speed of light Nuclear power Parallax The Lovely Bones
