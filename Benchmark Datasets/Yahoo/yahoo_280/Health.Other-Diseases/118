i think my new ear piercing is swollen infected i just got my ears pierced about days ago and my right ear is perfectly normal but my left ear is a little bit puffier than normal any conclusions on what to do help please make sure you clean the hole about times a day with whatever they gave you or rubbing alchol and then put some neosproin with a q tip and wash your hands before you do anything or something of that source every so often i'd say maybe you're allergic to the earring types of metals and alloys and such but if your right ear is fine then that's not the case whatever you do as long as you still want the peircing don't take the earring out also if you sleep on that side it might help to ice your ear lobe a bit before bed good luck Body piercing Earring Drill bit Knife Tattoo Vampire Cat Social rule Casting Psoriasis Violin Corrosion Mattress Diving Allergy Microphone Ear Otitis externa Mosquito Manicure Urinary incontinence First aid Textile manufacturing Internal ballistics Wudu Upholstery Certified Nursing Assistant Eczema Acne Traumatic brain injury Iron Elephant Common cold Metalworking Gramophone record Dairy Compact disc Loudspeaker Screw Fancy rat Swimming Scabies Shark Nine Inch Nails Drilling and threading Joseph of Arimathea Aphasia Otitis media Brush Strap-on dildo Wound Yarrow Cookware and bakeware Betting (poker) Skin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hearing aid Characters in the Smurfs Transistor Bedbug Bottlenose Dolphin Earwax Grommet Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Gong Naruto jutsu Stainless steel Gesture Ear piercing instrument Vegetto Dialysis Harlequin type ichthyosis Salah Olduwan Comanche Lathe Electrophysiology Hamster Humphrey Bogart Tarantula Dog Human adaptation to space Snake Futurama (TV series - season 3) Drag racing Computer virus Franklin Pierce Charles Peirce Spark plug Shaggy dog story Intravenous therapy Phineas Gage Nail (anatomy) Happy Tree Friends Dobermann Wood carving M__ni__re___s disease Depleted uranium Charles Darwin's illness Sento
