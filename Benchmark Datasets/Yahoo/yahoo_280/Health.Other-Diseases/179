can i catch a cold because of cold air hello it is cold outside these days so before going for a walk with my baby i decided to put a warmer coat on him so that he doesn't catch a cold but a friend of mine said i don't need to do that as people catch colds not because of the cold air outside but because of the viruses inside of them i was kind of puzzled by what he said he also said that it is a myth that people catch colds because of cool air and we all fell victims of that myth can anyone comment on this please as far as my experience yes you may all of us has virus in our system when our immunne system is strong then we can fight trhe virus in our body cold temperature weakens our resistance so the virus can easily strike and weaken us Common cold Weather front Virus El Ni__o Thermoregulation Solar power Antiviral drug Ebola Precipitation (meteorology) Diving suit Vegeta Immune system Hyperthermia Cloud Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer virus Professional wrestling throws Thunderstorm Nuclear power Climate of the United Kingdom Cosmic Era technology Vitamin C Hypothermia Severe weather terminology (United States) Atomism Heat Professional wrestling aerial techniques Ocean thermal energy conversion The Star Wars Holiday Special Year of the Spider Rabies Herpes simplex virus Fan death Diseases of the honeybee Hot air balloon The X-Files (season 1) Temperature The Catcher in the Rye Fog Chinook wind Vacuum Atlanta metropolitan area Duesberg hypothesis Professional wrestling holds Smallpox Guinness Roswell UFO incident Resurrection of the Daleks Kurt Angle Mario series enemies Frog Drowning HVAC AIDS Resident Evil: Apocalypse Swimming pool Zero (Mega Man) Deep lake water cooling Columbine High School massacre Crookes radiometer Urban heat island Smallville (Season 4) Poker jargon Melissa worm Spontaneous human combustion Water (molecule) Big Bang EastEnders 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Klingon World Series Carbon dioxide Electrophysiology Water vapor Spanish flu 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Oh My Goddess!
