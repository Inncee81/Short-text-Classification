post mortem autopsy question a friend of mine just died after years of degenerative brain disease while i am saddened by this news i am also relieved that her suffering is over countless tests while she was alive failed to establish a cause and now that she has died her parents have refused a post mortem saying she has suffered enough i personally am quite angered by this surely they must want to know what caused this what of other people who may be suffering from the same illness i feel that her life and struggle are meaningless without knowing if a cure can be found to save other people i can't believe her parents would be so selfish she lived in a vegetative state for nearly twenty years i lost a friend suddenly last year to menengitis everyone was devastated his family donated his organs and another eight peoples lives were improved as a result of this somehow it meant that his life and death weren't in vain i do respect the family and understand how hard it's been for them but not knowing what caused a beautiful and lively eighteen year old to debilitate in front our eyes seems harder somehow they are next of kin and their wishes are paramount i understand where you are coming from though they must feel her death very deeply and can't put her through anything else Death Rabies Sant Thakar Singh Autism Wolfrider Embalming Chronic fatigue syndrome Hide and Q (TNG episode) Mortification of the flesh Love Abortion debate Osteoarthritis Clinical depression The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Pitaten The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Alcoholics Anonymous Transsexuality Alzheimer's disease Tenshinhan Multiple sclerosis Dementia Hollyoaks Kodocha Year of the Spider Jiddu Krishnamurti Polyamory Empress Wang Zhengjun Borderline personality disorder Days of our Lives Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Boston Public Stomach cancer Mahatma Gandhi Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stroke Bipolar disorder The Marshall Mathers LP Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pneumonia Eastern Orthodox Church Theory of conduct Blood (computer game) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mental illness Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rei Ayanami Simone Weil Characters of Naruto Socrates Spinocerebellar ataxia The Brothers Karamazov Sheikh Abdullah Traumatic brain injury Darwin from Orchids to Variation Narcolepsy Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Glen Jacobs John Howard Yoder Immortality Luke and Laura Spencer Milton H.
