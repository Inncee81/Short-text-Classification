hospice health care they say that their not just for the terminally ill anymore is this true can they tell us if the person they are takeing care of is dying if that person was one of our parents if they are not for just the terminally ill why do they take over when you already have home health care don't be afraid to answer these questions it's just something i have been wondering about my wife's grandma just had hospice come in weeks ago before they would take over for the home health care she had to be declared terminal the way i understood is that you had to be terminal unless it varies from state to state just sit down with them and ask them to be honest with you about whether your parent is dying or not but if the person asked them to keep it a secret from you they may not be allowed to disclose certain information to you just ask everyone until someone gives you the truth good luck i'm sorry about the ill person in your life and i will pray for them Palliative care Mother Teresa Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Eastern Orthodox Church Marriage Plame affair Terri Schiavo Abortion debate Fiddler on the Roof Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Ethics Euthanasia Divorce Fight Club Infantilism Health insurance Cardiac arrest Dissociative identity disorder Polyamory Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Amber Spyglass Medical record Sant Thakar Singh Adoption Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) Abortion Vivian Solon Plame affair timeline Church of Christ, Scientist Prayer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Luck Expert system Sexual orientation Roe v.
