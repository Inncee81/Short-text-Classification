my huband was diagnosed with diverticulitis at this is the third time that he has been hospitalized in the two years since he has been diagnosed they are saying that he has an abcess and that they have to do surgery once the infection is gone from his system my question is how bad is this and what can i expect in the future with both the surgery and the disease thanks in advance for your answers diverticulitis is usually said to effect older age groups but i've seen this diagnosis being made in ppl in their s so he's not alone it is basically a disease of the western world and reflects on our bad eating habits without a lot of fibre and bulk from vegetables and fruit the intestines have to use more force to push stools along this causes increased pressures in the intestines and can cause little pouches of intestine to bulge between the muscle coat these pouches can become infected relatively easily since they're dead ends in the intestine and they can also become blocked the abscess your husband has if probably due to an infection in one of the diverticuli which got blocked and developed a collection of pus there is always the probability of further hospitalizations with diverticulosis diverticulitis is the name for infected diverticuli diverticulosis is the name for the presence of diverticuli since the diverticuli will still be there what can be done however is change your diet to make hospitalization less likely it is vital that your husband eats a large amount of vegetables and fruit a high fibre cereal in the morning is also of great help try to avoid products with a lot of small seeds which are not digested and can get stuck in the diverticuli reduce your meat and fast food intake and replace it with more veggies if your husband is still constipated he might need help wtih fibre supplements such as ispaghula husk sachets which you mix with water make sure he drinks plenty of water best of luck to you and your husband with dietary modifications i've seen patients go from regular hospitalizations to asymptomatic in a matter of weeks hope it works fine for you too Diverticulosis Diverticulitis Stomach cancer Diarrhea Colorectal cancer Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Ulcerative colitis Dieting Nutrition Prostate cancer Constipation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Tocopherol Escherichia coli O157:H7 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Adjustable gastric band Irritable bowel syndrome Folic acid Hypoglycemia Cirrhosis Hamster Laxative Glycogen storage disease type I Cancer Pneumonia Coronary heart disease Gout Hemorrhoid Cystic fibrosis Breastfeeding Fancy rat Hypertension Atkins Nutritional Approach Anemia Brewery Guinea pig Atherosclerosis Obesity Abscess Clinical depression Low-carbohydrate diet Abdominal pain Botulism Omega-3 fatty acid Diabetes mellitus Kidney stone Livestock Traumatic brain injury Insulin Ileostomy Hirschsprung's disease Gastric bypass surgery Clostridium difficile Protein-energy malnutrition Chicken Gastroparesis Trichinosis Medicine Tofu Dialysis AIDS Mesothelioma Small intestine Cholesterol Paget's disease of bone Breast cancer Anorexia nervosa Tooth Aortic dissection Multiple sclerosis Herpes simplex virus Vegetarian nutrition Esophageal cancer Soybean Veganism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Fasting Lumbar puncture Common cold Hypomagnesemia Chagas disease Traditional Chinese medicine Entamoeba histolytica Milk Babe Ruth
