unexplained nausea and bloating i plan on seeing a doctor but thought i would ask for some opinions i have had unexplained nausea for awhile months it can be in the morning at night in the middle of the day it just hits i don't vomit just the nausea it lasts for about minutes than goes away i don't get it everyday but enough to be a nuisance i also get full and bloated very easily when eating just small amounts i rarely seem to get hungry anymore and when i do i can only eat small amounts i also get sick at the site or smell of things that used to not gross me out but they do now i don't think it's anything serious but i'm just curious as to what can cause something like this anyone else experience this that can help note i am definitely not pregnant it could be an eating disorder let me refrase malnutrition something as simple as skipping a couple of meals not necessarily intentionally or not having balanced meals and missing some of your vitamins exetera option b is that you are not getting enough sleep so you don't have enough energy the bloating part is easy if one of these does occur your body is trying to retain the nutrients it gets because it is not sure when they are coming again this can happen anytime you don't eat regularly this also causes grossing out and lack of appetite watch your eating and sleeping habits if it might be why the answer is simple eat regularly extrecise and sleep sound familiar doesn't it i would know i have had it and study natural health healing Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Vomiting Food Atkins Nutritional Approach Guinea pig Folic acid Gastroparesis Binge eating disorder Morning sickness Sleep Fecal incontinence Diarrhea Malnutrition Diabetes mellitus Dog Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Dietary fiber Super Size Me Fasting Obesity Milk Adjustable gastric band Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vitamin C Tocopherol Migraine Urinary incontinence Traditional Chinese medicine Clinical depression Omega-3 fatty acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Marathon (sport) Vegetarianism Blood (computer game) Medical cannabis Radiation poisoning Friends Cat Breakfast Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hunger Supernatural Oasis (band) Common cold Chlorpromazine Rule of St Benedict Procrastination Veganism Soul Kitchen Reflexology Egg (food) Pregnancy Hiberno-English Charles Darwin's illness A Course In Miracles Carpal tunnel syndrome Eating disorder Stuttering Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Babe Ruth Kurt Cobain Reiki Cliff Richard The Amazing Race Obstetrics Abduction Phenomenon Psoriasis Esperanto as an international language Jon Secada Fancy rat Balance disorder Surveillance LSD Cancer Ulcerative colitis EastEnders Theodicy Milton H.
