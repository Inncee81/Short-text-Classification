my sister can keep any food down what is going on with her whenever she eats it all comes back up and it's not like she's throwing it up it just comes up like spit she has acid reflex but the doctor said that it's not it the doctor can't figure out what is wrong with her she is not bulimic she has lost pounds so far and is getting skinnier every day if anyone has any suggestion as to what might be wrong with her please tell me she's been taking medicine but it doesn't work she's had test done on her and nothing has come up and she has seen a stomach specialist when we swallow the food goes down into the esophagus and into the stomach between the stomach and the esophagus there is a muscle that usually helps to keep the contents of the stomach from going back up into the esophagus when it is weaken this causes the acid in the stomach to go into the esophagus and damage the tissues usually the doctor starts patients on mild things like pepto bismol and other over the counter items but when the acid become too severe he starts them on drugs like proton pump inhibitors to prevent the stomach tissues from making so much acid and gives the esophagus time to heal proton pump inhibitors are drugs like prilosec people who have acid reflux for some time that is not treated properly can start to feel like they are gagging or start to throw up usually the most damage is done at night when someone is asleep because they are in a level position the acid can move into the esophagus and up to the throat and even into the lungs i am posting a site here and recommending that you read the part on heartburn and reflux and then also the section on barrett's esophagus this takes a little time to load completely this is an excellant on line site that explains things in plain english it also give tips on what a person can do to help themselves http www gicare com pated ecd htm i had this problem also where i just start to throw up not even trying to do so i would just cough and up it came i hope the tips they give you here will be of some help to her testing usually they start out with an upper gi where they give you barium to drink and you stand behind an xray type machine to see how the contents you drink is going through then they usually move to an endoscopy procedure where they numb the throat with medication and place a tube like structure into your mouth and down to the stomach so the doctor can see what is wrong you are sedated and don't really know much after you are asked to swallow they can view the whole inside area because there is a scope with a camera and light on the end and it send pictures to a computer like monitor screen it is a little uncomfortable but is the best test to have they will usually show you pictures of your insides when they explain what is wrong an added note she needs to keep trying to swallow when she throws up she should try to keep sipping something to try an make her muscles work in the opposite direction try to take a sip every minutes it might help to lessen the chance of throwing up the medication might not help if she isn't able to keep it down when i first had my problem they gave me a clean slate also i was retested about three months later and that is when they saw what was going on Urinary incontinence Esophageal cancer Gastroparesis Prostate cancer Esophagus Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease Cancer of the larynx Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Peptic ulcer Breastfeeding Radiation therapy Stroke Proton pump inhibitor Pneumonia Medicine Hydrochloric acid First aid Achalasia Folic acid Feeding tube Obstetrics Barrett's esophagus Fecal incontinence Drowning Shock Traumatic brain injury Colorectal cancer Paget's disease of bone Vomiting Clinical depression Cocaine Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Myocardial infarction Lung cancer Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Adjustable gastric band Endoscopy Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling throws Common cold Paracetamol Psoriasis HIV test Antiretroviral drug Bipolar disorder Vitamin C Anorexia nervosa Dialysis Professional wrestling holds Weight training Cirrhosis Obesity Sleep apnea Aspartame Spina bifida Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Surveillance Stomach Epilepsy AIDS X-ray Chemotherapy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Oral sex Tooth H2-receptor antagonist Caffeine Diabetes mellitus Gout Antidepressant Hiccup Tobacco smoking Alcoholism COX-2 inhibitor Theory of conduct Fugu Social rule Diabetic retinopathy Osteoarthritis Terri Schiavo Enzyme Diving Ionizing radiation Humphrey Bogart
