healthcare professionals what physical reaction does a person have when they receive a blood transfusion do the patient feel relief nausea nothing are there any delayed reactions not talking about disease here just anything a person who receives blood might experience that the average person isn't aware of do they feel stronger or lethargic is there any acclimation period when you take in a stranger's blood someone in the religion and spirituality board mentioned their spouse was sick for over a week each time they took a blood transfusion in your experience is this statement an exaggeration about the effects of having a blood transfusion or could it be he was sick to begin with and recovering better than he would've without a transfusion i'm honestly curious i've never had a blood transfusion and for most of my life having one was religiously taboo any information you have to share would be appreciated i so appreciate all this information the religion i was in demonized blood transfusions to a point where people are literally scared to death to get one and not just because it doesn't please their religion they really fear transfusions and have all kinds of misconceptions about them i plan to share this information so thank you again silenced who knows maybe a person in a situation that required a transfusion would not really feel anything physically providing the blood was typed and cross matched correctly most folks don't get whole blood they get either packed cells or plasma as a rule they tend to get better since a lot of the healing that goes on depends on a good blood supply to get the materials to the site they certainly need the blood to get oxygen to the rest of the system when people feel odd after recieving blood it's more an emotional reaction than a physical one there are some problems that require transfusions and in those cases the person is already not is such good shape and is stressing over their other problems a hemophiliac may want to live a normal life and having to have the transfusion may feel like a slap in their face reminding them of their problem when you treat somebody a good bit of the treatment isn't just attending to the physical side of things people are not just an injured part they come with a brain attached and are full of emotions that you also have to attend to so although the blood product itself won't physically cause a problem you still have to deal with the person's feeling of having a foreign substance floating around inside them when you start talking about somebody's insides it doesn't get much more personal than that i've had patients that didn't give it much thought and others that it bugged i've even been asked if we could tell what the donor was if it was an oriental or whatever truth is blood is blood and as long as it's human and a match your body doesn't really care that doesn't mean the person won't physically you should show some improvement after gettting blood but of course it's no guarentee you will because you were obviously in bad shape to start with or you wouldn't have needed blood all the blood does is give you a fighting chance it's a fair bet without it things might not turn out so well but medicine is an art with a lot of science behind it you don't just treat a disease or injury you have to deal with the rest of the person as well and as mind goes body tends to follow the art comes in how you treat the whole person not the part Blood transfusion American Red Cross Stroke Blood Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Hypoglycemia Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ, Scientist Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Cancer Post-traumatic stress disorder Hepatitis C Blood type A Course In Miracles Social rule Traumatic brain injury Diabetes mellitus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Traditional Chinese medicine Pneumonia Insulin Francis Crick Immortality HIV test Bone marrow transplant Vitamin C Abortion debate Health insurance Blood donation Chemotherapy Love Radiation therapy Human sexual behavior Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The nature of God in Western theology Soul Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stem cell Stuttering Traumatic incident reduction YuYu Hakusho Equine conformation Childbirth Decompression sickness Anxiety Leukemia Alcoholism Publicly funded medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Cryonics Chlorpromazine Sickle-cell disease Death Multiple sclerosis Dualism (philosophy of mind) Religion Myocardial infarction Sigmund Freud Folic acid Cannabis (drug) Homeopathy HIV Jehovah's Witnesses Characters of Naruto Drug addiction AIDS Reiki Palliative care Reflexology Ethics Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Anemia Organ transplant Simone Weil Malaria Asperger syndrome Carbon dioxide Dog Anorexia nervosa Blood (computer game) Growth hormone treatment Self-harm Pain Pitaten Triage
