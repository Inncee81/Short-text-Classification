a question about lupus i've been dealing with severe joint pain in my legs for the last several months so i decided to see a doctor evidently the problems i've been having are classis lupus symptoms she took just about half my blood for a bunch of tests and gave me some pain medication and steroids to take while i'm waiting i started taking the meds and i'm feeling a lot better already so i'm guessing that's a sign it's either lupus or some other auto immune disease i've done a lot of reading already and the more i read the more it seems like this really is what i've got so what should i expect this may sound silly but my major concern is taking steriods for extended periods my mother my uncle and cousin all have crohn's disease took steroids for long periods and they've never been able to lose the weight i'm just curious about what to expect as far as steroids and weight gain goes any insight in general i've already been to tons of websites i'm looking more for personal info hi im chris i have had lupus a long time and have been on steroids off and on for a good years at this point i wont take them at this point not so much for weight but other side effects i was on them once for i think years straight i did gain about pounds i hated it but they did take me off for me they just didnt work and they eventually changed my medications to imuran and then methotrexate once off the medications i lost all the weight within months it melted of like water today i wont take them because they make me an insulan dependant diabetic give me migranes and a host of other things like you autoimmunes tend to run high in my family my mother has somthing called polymalgia rhuematica a cousin has crorhn's and another autoimune thyroid disease those i know little about but lupus i sure can help you with if your just now noticing signs of it which it sounds like with the joint pain you may also begin to notice that you may start having some skin issues like photosensitivity you cant go in the sun or be in ultraviolet lighting most stores use that and being in it a long time is like sunlight you may get a butterfly rash which bridges across your nose and your cheecks you may get different types of rashes anywhere else on your body sun exposed or not you may get low grade fevers muscle pain fatigue sometimes you may experience mild to moderate cognitive problems like what is called brain fog ability to think clearly sometimes get your words into sentances the way you would like you may find your self stumbling when you walk a bit etc those were a lot of my early problems also i noticed my hands feet and ankles would swell and go down usually when hot outside then i would be ok after putting them up drinking a lot of water or the next day you may have some months where you may show that your a bit anemic or your blood counts show some kind of non specific infection which they will give you antibiotics for some lupus paitents have major organ involvment some do not it stays contained mainly to the symptoms and issues i mentioned above in my case i am considered to have mainly liver involvment and central nervous system involvment my brain at times can be very bad to where i need chemo to get swelling down others have heart lung kidney lupus nerphritis involvment lupus dosnt discriminate it can go after any body organ or part for the most part i co own a lupus support group i have noticed most seem to dodge major organ involvment but a lot become anemic have minor to severe im the most severe that i know of with central nervous system issues some occasionally may get like kidney stone which clear up or tend towards brhoncitis and minor things that can be taken care of from all my years of doing research moderating and owning online message boards support groups its the ones that keep the most poitive attitudes that tend to keep the most normal lives no matter how ill they are they tend to look on the bright side and not see the what if's they are well informed have better support either from family friends support groups in their community or online or all they listen to their bodies and know when to rest they dont worry about every little ache and pain they comply with doctors orders they know how to continue laughing that my dear is a must we still live our lives though we have some glitches lupus isnt a life sentance we just have to modify a bit also since i wont do the prednison train i must add there are all kinds of classes of medications to help those with lupus once confirmed the first thing they will put you on is plaquinil it is an antimalarial and for somereason it helps to slow down a lupus paitents overactive immune systems a bit and protect our skin reason unkown there are other classes of medicaton mainly immunosuppresent and immunosupressent chemotherapy agents but your a long way from that my friend you said youve been doing some research but i will leave you with several links ill also leave you with the support group link we have many vetren diagnosed like me we constantly do reserach we have newly diagnosed and some waiting to be diagnosed my best chris oh here are the lupus critera you need to have lupus diagnostic criteria for lupus the following criteria are used to distinguish lupus systemic lupus erythematosus or sle from other autoimmune and rheumatic diseases
