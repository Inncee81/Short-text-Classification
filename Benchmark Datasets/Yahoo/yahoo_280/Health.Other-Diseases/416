rainwater run off from an asbestos roof used to water vegetables is the produce safe to eat my elderly father in law has just realised that the rainwater he'd collected to water his runner beans ran from his asbestos roof on his old garage any information is gratefully received safe asbestos is a mineral obtained from the ground it's perfectly safe there the danger arises when fibres from the purified product float in the air and are inhaled one of the measures used to make asbestos safer while it is removed is to spray water over the material and into the air around it wet fibres can't float around so easily and will stick to the wet ground they land on asbestos tiles will deteriorate and fibres will be released when this happens but on a roof the fibres will be washed off regularly by rain if these get into the soil they are harmless except when the ground is so dry that the soil blows around in fine clouds soil used for growing plants won't normally get so dry so he shouldn't be at risk from the fibres that have collected there plants select what they absorb from the soil very carefully the veg won't have any asbestos in them and if you ate any it would be unlikely to do you any harm your gut is also very selective about what it absorbs the common idea that you just soak up whatever you eat like a sponge would is a myth there is a possibility that fibres from the soil would be on the outside of the vegetable and could become airborne and be breathed in this is almost impossible because it would be unusual for any veg to become this dry exceptions might be the earth that is stuck to potatoes when they are stored for a long time and the outer skins of onions beans grow well away from the soil and are covered by a thick pod in order for there to be a significant risk the roof would have to have been severely eroded by the water flowing over it if it is still working reasonably well as a roof there is absolutely nothing to worry about earth normally contains a lot of toxic stuff including poisonous organisms and dangerous minerals washing your hands and the produce is a good safeguard against most of these hazards Asbestos Mesothelioma Jute Hemp Textile manufacturing Carbon dioxide Hydroponics Dietary fiber Coffee Wildfire Nuclear fallout Opportunity rover Fire fighting Potato Solar power Water Tofu Drainage Nuclear power Uranium Erosion Common bean Desert Dry cleaning Sewage treatment Flax Rain Soil Escherichia coli O157:H7 Weed control Rice Rebreather National Weather Service Irrigation Coir Carnivorous plant Soil pH Onion Soils retrogression and degradation Sulfuric acid Ammonia Menstrual cup Chernobyl accident Comfrey Energy development Compost Death Valley National Park Environmental concerns with electricity generation Ricin Mount Pinatubo Cannabis cultivation Deforestation Chocolate Air-raid shelter Charcoal Haloalkane Foodborne illness Vermicompost Bong Iron Combine (Half-Life 2) Fancy rat Bean Glossary of firefighting equipment Soap Vegetarian nutrition Acetic acid Fallout shelter Breastfeeding Air conditioning Veganism Drowning Urinary incontinence Pikmin Swimming pool Wood Ionizing radiation Organic farming Laboratory Plastic Hair Cave diving Date Palm Glass Ultraviolet Tank Chemical warfare Beryllium Green Revolution Hiking Firefighter
