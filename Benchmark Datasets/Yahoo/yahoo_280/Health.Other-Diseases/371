cannot figure out why i have a fever and abdominal bloating when test prove all organs are ok i ate a piece of fried chicken and not even a half hour later i had servere abdominal pain in the upper part but in the center of my abdomin i went to the doctor and he ran tests the tests ruled out gal bladder liver and infection my white blood count was normal as everything else was abdominal pain stoped and had soreness still have a low grade fever and bloating in my abdominal area the doctor is unsure what is wrong he thinks maybe an ulcer fried chicken contains a fair amount of fat from the frying oil does this happen to you when you eat creamy soups milkshakes etc if so the problem may be considerably simpler you may have fat intolerance in this setting you consume an oily or fatty meal and develop symptoms like you speak of following the meal the symptoms are more pronounced with liquid fats this can be assessed with a gastric emptying study but the test meal composition is essential to teasing this out it should be liquid fat alternatively you might have a problem with bacterial overgrowth this happens when your intestines don't move food through just right and things sit around too long and allow bacteria to inhabit normally clean parts of the intestine when you eat especially sugars or starches as in the coating of the fried chicken the meal may be fermented by bacteria instead of being digested and absorbed by you this leads to production of gas sometimes enormous amounts bloating pain and often diarrhea you can tease this out in the least invasive manner with a breath hydrogen test you swallow some non digestible non absorbable carbohydrate and then blow into a bag at regular intervals if you have high bacterial counts you will generate a lot of hydrogen among other gases which is absorbed into your bloodstream and then expired via the lungs if your doctor goes ahead with an endoscopy to look at your stomach lining to rule out ulcer he she can also go a bit farther down and aspirate some of the intestinal contents to check for bacteria however this may not be conclusive since the 'scope won't go down far enough to be able to get the bacteria Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Insulin Milk Coeliac disease Crohn's disease Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Ulcerative colitis Bloating Cirrhosis Aspartame Peptic ulcer Fecal incontinence Irritable bowel syndrome Cancer Tofu Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hydrogen sulfide Diabetes mellitus Stomach Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Lung Sewage treatment Tocopherol Adjustable gastric band Glucose Obesity Diabetic neuropathy Veganism Domestic rabbit Flatulence Colorectal cancer Chocolate Abdominal pain Cheese Dialysis Carbon dioxide Cantonese cuisine Anthrax Vomiting Cystic fibrosis Helicobacter pylori Acute pancreatitis Hydrochloric acid Bread Egg (food) Abdomen Halitosis Biochemistry Traumatic brain injury Vitamin C Ovarian cancer Common cold Coffee Urinary incontinence Cuisine of Denmark Stroke Botulism Paracetamol Decompression sickness Group A streptococcal infection Hyperglycemia Fugu Trans fat Intravenous therapy Caffeine Japanese cuisine Gastric acid First aid Tooth Atkins Nutritional Approach Aspirin Small intestine Alcohol fuel Breakfast Fancy rat Food allergy Esophageal cancer Folic acid Chlorophyta
