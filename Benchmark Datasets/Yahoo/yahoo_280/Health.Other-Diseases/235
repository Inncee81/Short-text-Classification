diagnosed pes on warfarin need clot buster too hi husband was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the lower lobes of both lungs after a routine post chemotherapy ct scan no cancer present thank goodness he has been admitted to hospital put on sub cut injection of enoxaparin heparin and oral warfarin but if i understand it right these are both drugs that stop new clots does he need clot busters too i'd like some information so i know how nagging to be with the doctors at the moment they are not telling us anything other than it's not safe for you to leave the hospital ha ha thanks for the advice and the major panic they were surprised at hubby's high blood pressure when they took it minutes after that statement thanks hh the heparin will assist the body in the natural break down of clots he needs to be in the hosptial until his blood clotting reaches theraputic value which is a very fine balance between clotting too much and beign too thin this is known as his protime and inr if he is at risk for pes due to his chemo it may also be possible that they will consider an ivc filter for him which will help catch any new clots before they reach his heart clot busters such as tpa are primarily being used at this time for relief from cerebral arterial clots such as after a stroke to the best of my knowlege it is not being used for venous clots or pes are there any nurses here who can clarify best wishes for your husband's speedy recovery Deep vein thrombosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Myocardial infarction Intravenous therapy Atrial septal defect Anticoagulant Traumatic brain injury Warfarin Heparin Atrial fibrillation Aneurysm Blood pressure Lung Stomach cancer Hip fracture Pulmonary hypertension Coagulation Folic acid Apoplexy Prostate cancer Cancer Hypertension Lung cancer Pulmonary alveolus Air embolism Mesothelioma Decompression sickness Oral contraceptive Angioplasty Hypoglycemia Paracetamol Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Tobacco smoking Dialysis Bleeding Pneumonia Tocopherol Acute respiratory distress syndrome Antiphospholipid syndrome Cardiac stress test Hemorrhagic stroke Colorectal cancer Inferior vena cava Blood vessel Magnetic resonance imaging Chemotherapy Cardiovascular disease Respiratory system Coronary heart disease Coronary catheterization First aid Obstetrics AIDS Aortic dissection Fibrinolysis Hormone replacement therapy Cardiac output Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Osteoporosis Medical cannabis Maprotiline Aspirin Radiation therapy Asthma Breast cancer Richard Nixon Tuberculosis Prothrombin time Erythropoietin Aspergillosis Heart Cocaine Blood plasma Medicine Terri Schiavo Bone fracture Aphasia Childbirth Computed tomography Cirrhosis D-dimer Turner syndrome Malignant melanoma Neighbours Traditional Chinese medicine Cerebellum Artery Multiple sclerosis
