if a native american is suffering from end state live disease due to chronic alcohol intake is a liver transplant a option it is my step daughter and she is on public assistance and her doctors have not ofter her that option should it be because she is a public charge or could it be because she has not taken the step to stop drinking a person has to be evaluated and go through a series of tests to be placed on the transplant list to be placed on the list a patient has to be without any alcohol for a period of months and willing to give it up completely the shortage of organs for transplant makes it harder to be placed on the list unless the person themselves prove to others that they do want to live and will be compliant with following the rules to have an donor organ which includes stopping bad habits so there is little chance that once transplanted the organ won't go into rejection and the alcohol won't react with the medication they need to take for the rest of their life when you said is a liver transplant an option that is exactly what it is the cost of a liver transplant is well beyond what anyone could afford it can range from to or even higher a person needs to have insurance that covers transplant or find a way to raise the money or they could be on disability and may receive help from the government or organizations the system for the transplant is fair people are placed on the transplant list according to how long they may live without having a transplant in other words if they are fairly well and may recover and not need a transplant according to what their blood work shows they will be placed lower on the list and may even go off the list and lead a normal life as you go higher on the list you are less well and if you are very near the top you will either receive a transplant or you may die before an organ becomes available this has nothing to do with sex race or any other similar thing blood type may be a factor cause some blood types are rare and it is hard to find someone else who had the same blood type the links below will give you alot more information about the process of liver transplant organ donation living organ donors pre
