remicade for uc i have had ulcerative colitis for years and have become steroid dependent i'm starting remicade injections as a last resort before surgery cringe and i was just wondering what type of reactions good or bad anybody has had while taking this medication i took remicade for krohns disease and i have to say this it is very effective and the treatments are actually pleasurable you get them in a chair for two three hours so you can just sit there relax and watch a good movie or read a book it is very nice however remicade causes an allergic reaction in over a third of most recipients on the second treatment the first one is usually a breeze but the body can develop a resistance to it which can result in hives or some other reaction on the second visit doctors are prepared for this eventuality and do have benedril and steroids on hand to combat the reaction but it is the only drawback to the treatment that i experienced yes i'm one of the allergic ones note if you have any other questions feel free to contact me Allergy Crohn's disease Psoriasis Insulin Ulcerative colitis Urinary incontinence Scar Eczema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoarthritis Stomach cancer Asthma Syphilis Diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Radiation therapy Conjunctivitis Drug addiction Ben Johnson (athlete) Blood transfusion Hay fever Growth hormone treatment Folic acid Colorectal cancer Acne Anabolic steroid Propranolol Urticaria Mouth ulcer Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Cortisol Cephalexin Multiple sclerosis Malignant melanoma Milton H.
