can you sell your organs when you pass and your organs are used for transplant in someone else how come everyone make's lot's of money but you or your family it doesn't seem real fair to me the argument isn't really that everyone is making a lot of money but that everyone is getting paid the surgeons who take the organs do get paid for their time and work it's not a reward it's a reimbursement so why can't the donor family also be reimbursed this has been a subject of some debate in the united states economists have suggested that one way to increase the donor supply would be to offer families a financial incentive for donating others have countered that this could really hurt because people would feel that the system was cheapened instead of organ donation being a wonderful gift a way for the deceased to live on it just becomes a transaction some have suggested more tolerable alternatives several state legislatures have considered bills that would pay for the funeral expenses of an organ donor but so far it remains the ultimate gift it's not a totally self less gift donor families can register to allow contact with the people who receive the organs there are donor quilts and donor medals and donor recognition ceremonies small thanks perhaps but the law still prohibits anything more lucrative Organ donation Campaign finance reform Gift economy Tom DeLay American Red Cross Microeconomics Credit card FairTax Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Insurance Supply and demand National Kidney Foundation Singapore Value added tax Taxation in the United States Campaign finance in the United States Charitable trust Economics Tax Elections in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ralph Nader Capitalism Islamic banking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Non-profit organization Divorce Inheritance tax Marcel Mauss Minimum wage Third party (United States) Supply-side economics Intellectual property Human cloning Blood transfusion Utilitarianism Financial endowment Law of value Kidney transplantation United Kingdom corporation tax Corporation Health insurance Money supply Public policy Money Principal-agent problem Social Security debate (United States) Theory of conduct Kidney Food and Drug Administration Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Copyright Efficiency wages Arbitrage Free trade Medal of Honor Say's law Inflation Capital accumulation Privatization Wealth Robert P.
