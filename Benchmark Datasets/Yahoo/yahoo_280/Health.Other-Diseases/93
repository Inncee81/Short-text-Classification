runner's diaherria question two days ago i was running six miles on a treadmill i had plenty of water beforehand and a small breakfast as my running progressed i felt that i needed to go to the bathroom bowel movement i decided that i would go after i was finished with my run when i finished running i hopped off an went everythig seemed alright but then it felt like i had to go again i tried to go but couldn't then i began to lift weights and the feeling stayed with me i went home and then tried again again nothing came out for about thirty minutes after that the cramps got worse i sat on the toilet for five minutes in pain then i got up and got so light headed that i thought i was going to pass out my dad who was in the other room drove me to the hospital when we got there i released alot of diaherria the pain was gone my question is what could have possibly caused this i stopped running for two days including today and i have not crapped since the day at the hospital please help if this happened only this once it is probably not a big deal if it becomes a regular happening see a gastrointestinal motility specialist to decide whether you have an underlying dysmotility when you exercise you activate your sympathetic nervous system the fight or flight one and deactivate your parasympathetic nervous system the one in control of gut motility among other things when you relax the inverse happens so while you may have felt the urge your continued exercise did not allow you to relax sufficiently to have a bowel movement once you relaxed a bit not stress wise but activity wise your motility kicked into high gear listen to your body if you have to go you have to go to better plan for your next workout relax beforehand and see if you can eliminate before you lock things up for a while Autonomic nervous system Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Vomiting Gastrointestinal tract Meditation Equine conformation Chronic fatigue syndrome Irritable bowel syndrome Aikido Weight training EastEnders Nervous system Muscle Milton H.
