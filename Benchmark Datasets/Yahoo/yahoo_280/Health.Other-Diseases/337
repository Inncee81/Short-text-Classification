speculate what's wrong with me i have had a varying degree of diarrhea over the last months around about the same time i started swimming every day maybe around the same time i stopped drinking tea coffee so i went to the doctors they note that i appear to be a healthy year old cm stones medium built i do not appear to be loosing weight from my problem had blood tests and the book me in for an appointment with a member of gastroenterology service they have also called me back for further blood tests because they think i am lacking vitamin b and i may need injections of it i wonder if these are related or maybe it's just that my body isn't absorbing the b because of a problem in my intenstines o i eat meat with most meals i have cereal with milk every morning except weekends i usually have bacon and egg any guesses don't worry i'll take your ideas with a pinch of salt stephen p i'm not a nervous person i get stressed though curleeyq i've only been to see the gp for intial diagnosis and further diagnosis with blood test and stool samples i've got the appointment at the hostpital st october miles away but on monday i'll go have another blood test in regards to the b defficiency rvrmldnd i'm glad that you agree with the swimming pool theory though i wouldn't like to give it up i'm in the uk and i don't have to pay for appointments as they're covered under the nhs i only have to pay a fixed amount of or something for prescriptions i've had the same problem i started swimming and started to get a case of daily diarhea not losing weight from it this stopped happening after months or so so the daily problem could very well be related to the swimming even the most careful swimmer will end up with an occasional sip of the pool water and i sincerely believe that this is where the diarrhea comes from i noticed back then that the problem went away after the pool was deep cleaned i stopped swimming due to an accident and do not know when i will resume so i do not know if the problem will occur again i'll have to wait and see as far as your lack of b goes and the appointments to me this is nothing but money making on the part of the health professionals you can buy supplements with b at any store and add that to your diet without having to have injections if you didn't have any other problems with your digestive system other than the temporary diarrhea i would check that my liver profile came back normal and then wait and see if the problem persists before i go back to the doctor Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Folic acid Vitamin C Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol Breastfeeding Diabetes mellitus Urinary incontinence Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Veganism Medicine Anorexia nervosa Milk Domestic rabbit Anemia Escherichia coli O157:H7 Guinea pig Dieting Dietary fiber Drowning Multiple sclerosis Psoriasis Nutrition Healthy eating Crohn's disease Publicly funded medicine Breakfast Clinical depression Cirrhosis Schistosomiasis Swimming Protein-energy malnutrition Anxiety Irritable bowel syndrome First aid Atkins Nutritional Approach HIV test Vegetarianism Insomnia Paget's disease of bone Ulcerative colitis Growth hormone treatment Medicare (Canada) Radiation therapy Food allergy Drug test Gastroesophageal reflux disease Colorectal cancer Terri Schiavo Theory of conduct Acne Fugu Pneumonia Marathon (sport) National Health Service Super Size Me Glycogen storage disease type I Dairy Obesity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coffee Cytomegalovirus Gastroparesis Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Fancy rat 613 mitzvot Hyperglycemia Vitamin D Controversies in autism Ebola Hepatitis C Cystic fibrosis Adjustable gastric band Sento Autism Tofu Halitosis Hemorrhoid Foodborne illness Social rule Osteoporosis Kosher foods AIDS reappraisal
