fibromyalgia i went to the doctor today and he diagnosed me with fibromyalgia and ran a test for osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are these standard tests with this condition it worried me a little bit and i forgot to ask him does anyone know what to expect with fibromyalgia hi im chris i think what your dr is doing was the most responsible and proper thing to do and he is keeping up with what is going on in research according to the guidlines of the autoimmune asocssiation first he is checking for ostaoarthritis because most adults do at some point end up with it because of childhood early adult injuriers in my case it was found from a fall taken in my early 's and i needed minor surgey to clean up some bone spurs from a broken collarbone i never knew i broke about the fibromyalgia rhuematoid arthritis and lupus ra and lupus are already known autoimmune diseases which means an inside invader our own cells are attacking each other for an unkown reason mainly because they become hypersensitve and go into overdrive fibromyalgia is now on that list as a possible list as a possible autoimmune disease but it may take a few years to know for sure so your doctor seems to know this and just wants to rule out the possibility that you may have either of these lupus being the most likely to him personally i have had fibomyalgia found a way to get rid of it but i still have lupus he just want to rule both of these out with a simple set of blood tests to check your antibodies to both of these autoimmune diseases and if you do have the antibodies one is the ra factor for rhuematoid arthritis the other ana for lupus he can catch it early start treatment this way if you do have one he has caught them before they become serious illnesses i consider this a responsible well ediucated dr who keeps up on current research while most people with fibromyalgia do not have lupus or ra there are a who do i run a yahoo support group many are lupus and fibromyalgia paitents some of the fibromyalgia paitents feel they only have fibromyalgia while others feel that they may have lupus but feel because of the fibromyalgia diagnosis it is possible the lupus is over looked your doctor as i may have said is just looking to see if you have certain antibodies to corralate to either of these diseases when he checked you he may have noticed signs such as swollen hands low grade fevers swollen lymph nodes a rash called a butterfly rash seen in lupus that a fibromyalgia paitent would not have or it may just be his basic policy to test every newly diagnosed fibromyalgia paitent for other autoimmune disorders as a person with lupus all i can say is kudos to your doctor he is on the ball in the off chance you do have another problem he is catching one of these before they get out of control for nither are curable in an autoimmune disease our bodies own cells become overactive beliveing they are being attacked by an outside invader when in fact they are not so they try to kill the invader instead they go after our own healthy organs cells bones and tissue he wants to make sure that is not happening more and more doctors are doing this as a standard procedure so dont worry to much escpecially if you live near a large city or a good teaching hospital fibro as it is nicknamed is exausting can be paniful as it exaust the muscles and causes pain and can cause great discomport even deppression if not treated properlly you i imagine are not the best sleeper not very good at relaxing and are probally used to being on the run the fibro will eventually slow you down if you dont get into a regular sleep pattern change your diet learn to relax and if possible get some type of physical therapy water is the most perfered type i will leave yo a few links for fibro ra and lupus including one to the yahoo support group i co own we have loads of information on fibro as well as many memeber with it or who have had it we have memebers with ra and many with lupus including myslef i hope some of this was of help to you but your dr is absoulutly doing the right this my best chris Immune system Breast cancer Crohn's disease Lyme disease Hypoglycemia
