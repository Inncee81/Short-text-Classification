what do you think is the worst illness i think mental illness or insanity is the worst illness when i accompanied my sister who is a doctor for a medical mission at a provincial center in the philippines my heart went out for the mental patients there imagine how it is for them its like you are there but you're not really there physically you are there but the people around you cant talk to you your surrounding is in chaos but you're acting as if its quite and peaceful there are important and life changing events that unfold around you but for you its a boring day they can be in a party where everyone's singing the same happy song except you you're humming a funeral hymn then everybody's laughing but you're crying everyone around you is watching tv but you're watching movie in your mind its like you're dead but you cant be buried when you're insane you're like a zombie except that you really haven't died i would rather be paraplegic than an insane person i would even rather have a malignant cancer than be crazy at least in cancer you and your loved ones know that you will die soon you'll get buried once you died but if you're insane its like you're just pretending that you're still alive Mental illness Psychiatric hospital Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Medicine Insanity defense Insanity Psychosis Days of our Lives Death Milton H.
