have you had carpal tunnel release surgery im awaiting cts open release surgery on both hands i've been told that i absolutely need the surgery by several doctors and neurologists i've been told by the doctors that it is a simple procedure with a very good outcome i on the other hand have a hard time believing them is there a lot of pain associated with it and is it really worth it i have had carpal tunnel proceedures on both wrists and it was quite successful and well worth it there is one point i would like to make whatever you do do not repeat do not have both wrists done at the same time my doctor wanted to do both at once and something made me sense this wasn't the best idea i am right handed so i had the right wrist proceedure done first the left wrist months later recovery from the first surgery took a long time and i had to teach myself to use my left hand for common every day things like brushing my teeth combing or washing my hair using the toilet and subsequent clean up needless to say it was hard tying shoes and using zippers on clothes were big hassles the left wrist took less time to heal and i had an easier time of it i don't regret the surgery now but after that first one i had my doubts that this was a good idea anyway i made a complete recovery on both and don't look back anymore it was worth it in the long run i also learned that pain killing drugs are good good luck Carpal tunnel syndrome Repetitive strain injury Milton H.
