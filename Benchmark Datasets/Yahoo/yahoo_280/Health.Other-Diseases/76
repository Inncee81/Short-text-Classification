pancreatitis what's the cure for pancreatitis i am so glad you asked that question there is no cure for pancreatitis i suffered with this disease for years there are many treatments and procedures that can be done but an actual cure doesn't exist ercp is an endoscopic examination that is done you are put to sleep but able to breath on your own and a scope is inserted into your mouth and moved around to give a picture of your pancreas some times they will do mamometry pressure readings this should give the endoscopist an idea about what is going on they can insert stents if needed during this procedure or open blocked ducts during also some people receive no relief from these procedures and opt for surgery such as myself total pancreatectomy with autologous islet cell transplantation the pancreas is removed and the small bowel is rerouted the insulin making cells are extracted from the removed pancreas cleansed and placed into the liver at the time of surgery this surgery isn't perfect and doesn't always remove all pain at this time it is however all we have most have mistaken belief that alcohol is the major contributing factor and most people i have met with this disease have never been drinkers i have met a few but the majority don't know why they have pancreatitis Insulin Acute pancreatitis Diabetes mellitus Cancer Hypoglycemia Organ transplant Liver Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pancreatic cancer Gallstone Prostate cancer Alcoholism Endoscopy Insulinoma Stomach cancer Cystic fibrosis Cirrhosis Stroke Congenital hyperinsulinism Colorectal cancer Fecal incontinence Needle aspiration biopsy Urinary incontinence Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Esophageal cancer Primary sclerosing cholangitis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bone marrow transplant Glucokinase Growth hormone treatment Pneumonia Diarrhea Kidney Psychosurgery Growth hormone Folic acid Hyperglycemia Ferret Acromegaly Gallbladder Gastroparesis Obesity Medicine Oncology Acne Traumatic brain injury Radiation therapy Fistula Multiple sclerosis Lupus erythematosus Intersex surgery Gene therapy Cancer of the larynx Dialysis Clinical depression Endometriosis Malignant melanoma Primary biliary cirrhosis Penis Diabetic retinopathy Ulcerative colitis Surgery Terri Schiavo Frederick Banting Chronic fatigue syndrome Zollinger-Ellison syndrome Serine protease Haemochromatosis Endocrinology Hemorrhoid Cholecystitis Dentistry Angioplasty Theory of conduct Sleep apnea Atherosclerosis Glycogen storage disease type I Carpal tunnel syndrome Common cold Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Acupuncture Cocaine Cholecystectomy History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Abortion Multiple myeloma Obstetrics Glaucoma Diabetes mellitus type 1 Chlorpromazine
