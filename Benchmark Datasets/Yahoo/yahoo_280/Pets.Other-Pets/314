can you bathe a hamster if so please share all info on the topic this will be much apsherated hamsters are aqua phobic afraid of water by nature so unless there is a specific reason that outweighs the stress and trauma of the bath then it is not a good idea the only reason i can think of to even try is if he has gotten something on his fur that self cleaning would be toxic in this case your best option is to put him in the bathroom sink and rinse him carefully and gently with a squirt bottle take care to protect him from injury near the drain never expose him to running water or leave him unattended in water you can dampen a washcloth ring it out well and pet him with it if he has soiled his fur with something sticky that could result in matting Hamster Pet skunk Sento Tattoo Toilet Menstrual cup Japanese toilet Bathroom Water purification Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Nuclear power Yerba mate Carnivorous plant Diving Water Fecal incontinence Poodle Animal testing Dry cleaning Body piercing Tobacco smoking Shampoo Sewage treatment Cat Customs and etiquette of Japan Psoriasis Rebreather Motor oil Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Mesothelioma Social rule E-6 process Mosquito Towel Upholstery Hard water Bidet Species Golden Hamster Polychlorinated biphenyl Plastic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bleeding Windows 2000 Bathing Chicken Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
