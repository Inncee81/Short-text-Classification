cats and pregnancy i am wondering if pregnant cats get morning sickness or experience similar symptoms to humans my cat is about months old and last night we saw my friends and neighbours cat trying to mate with her we want to get her desexed but i am scared she may already be pregnant will the vet check to make sure she isnt pregnant before removing her uterus i know its a lot of questions hehe thanks for your help you can still get your cat spayed it will abort any kittens she may be pregnant with though you won't be able to tell if she's pregnant unless your vet checks her out for weeks if you take the cat in now the vet will spay her anyway whether or not she's pregnant because the pregnancy is so early and at this point it poses no risk to her health a month old cat is pretty young to be having kittens if you don't decide to spay her now and wait to see if she's pregnant and she is make sure you keep a very close eye on her throughout her pregnancy and especially during labor after she has the kittens and she's properly healed make sure to get her spayed asap or keep her indoors away from males it's still wise to get her spayed even if she is an indoor cat as this will reduce her risk of some cancers good luck Cat Pregnancy Abortion Guinea pig Ferret Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Dog Socialization Kitten Obstetrics Feral cat Abortion debate Tobacco smoking Premature birth Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Tocopherol Prostate cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) EastEnders Endometriosis Manx (cat) Oral contraceptive Folic acid Toxoplasmosis Spina bifida Prenatal diagnosis Diabetes mellitus Condom Psoriasis In vitro fertilisation Endometrial cancer Haloperidol Cats (musical) Coeliac disease Partial-birth abortion Friends Cervical cancer Ectopic pregnancy Sharon Tate Morning sickness Castration Prolactinoma Breastfeeding Sexual intercourse Vitamin C Lion Coffee Turner syndrome Cancer Tooth enamel Infertility Cytomegalovirus Kangaroo Abortion in the United States Fertility awareness Housebreaking Cephalic disorder Pregnancy test The Joker's Wild Stomach cancer Diethylstilbestrol Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medicine Breech birth Gonorrhoea Herpes simplex virus Sex education Schapelle Corby Marilyn Monroe Chemical abortion Ionizing radiation Phoebe Buffay's songs Estrus cycle Elephant Feminists for Life Vampire Twin Isotretinoin Colorectal cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Big Brother UK series 5 Hypertension Garfield Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Delta Goodrem Intact dilation and extraction Maprotiline Malaria Doxepin Roe v.
