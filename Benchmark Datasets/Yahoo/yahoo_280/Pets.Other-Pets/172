how many pet owners here still vaccinate their dogs cats yearly i've done lots of research on this and have decided to no longer vaccinate my dogs every year once they've received all of their puppy vaccines and their one year booster i was just wondering how many others have done the same http www critteradvocacy org are we over vaccinating our pets htm http www naturalanimal ca new archives archive htm it's not only me but many vets in our area are beginning to see the problems associated with over vaccinating and have been changing their protocol some now recommend vaccinating every to years instead of every year do you vaccinate your children when they're a little older after they've already received all of their childhood vaccinations no you don't and you don't get shots yourself anymore either because you got them all when you were little right and you've now got antibodies in your body to fight off these diseases so why would your pets and their immune systems be any different truth is they aren't we're in the process of finding a new vet my current vet shudders at raw and won't do titer testing to see if the dogs actually need to be re vaccinated they can't it through their heads that its not a money issue its a health issue they keep telling me that having titers done is more expensive than just vaccinating i tell them that's not the point and we go round and round last time we were in with one of my labs and i practically had to beg them to do blood work and then they didn't even do the one specifially asked for was the last straw kind of got off topic there but as soon as we find a new vet no the dogs won't get shots every year rather they'll have a titer to test to determine immunity leves and if they are on the low side then we'll vaccinate rabies have to do that every years by law what alot of people on yahoo don't realize is that vaccines last for much much longer than a year in both people and dogs after that first series when your a kid you only need boosters every several years tetanus is a good example that one is good for years dog vaccines are no different so why give them every year if they don't need them especially since studies are showing that the every year vaccine protocol is leading to many health problems instead have a titer test done it involves a blood draw they check immunity levels to disease and you decide to vaccinate from there much more healthy for the dog that way Rabies Pet skunk Cytomegalovirus AIDS Cancer Multiple sclerosis HIV vaccine Pneumonia Thimerosal Vaccination Autism Dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Medicine Tetanus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MMR vaccine Malaria HIV test Smallpox Toxoplasmosis Controversies in autism Vaccine controversy Jonas Salk Autism epidemic Mumps Prostate cancer Allergy Louis Pasteur Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Tuberculosis Autoimmune diseases Herpes simplex virus Antiviral drug Pasteur Institute Measles Streptococcus pneumoniae HIV Andrew Wakefield 2000 Simpsonwood CDC conference Infectious disease Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Influenza Domain Name System Nutrition Hepatitis B Blood transfusion Hepatitis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Medical record Mark Geier The Invisibles Alzheimer's disease Veterinarian Marburg virus Anthrax Sickle-cell disease Housebreaking Epidemiology Microchip implant (animal) Natural Hygiene Duesberg hypothesis H5N1 Chagas disease Microeconomics Socialization Domestic rabbit Adverse effect (medicine) Ebola Labrador Retriever Genetically modified food Tocopherol Dog training Common cold Docking Fancy rat Extreme Programming Rheumatoid arthritis World Health Organization Cervical cancer Hypoglycemia Bioterrorism Guinea pig National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act Leukemia Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Tobacco smoking Theory of conduct Human papillomavirus Lupus erythematosus
