my rabbit keeps biting me how can i stop her from biting me she bites when i feed her and hold her i know some rabbits don't like to be held but we only hold her when necasary any help here she is not spayed and about monthes old plz don't suggest eating her cause i love her it sounds like your rabbit is aggressive rabbits do not typically bite for the fun of it they have been known to bite if frightened or when attempting to defend either themselves or their belongings including their space rabbits prefer to be on the ground a rabbit that isn't being held correctly will become scared and could bite in order to get the handler's hands to release them this is why it is very important that small children do not handle or carry your rabbit around small children just do not have the dexterity to enable a rabbit to feel safe and secure and this could easily cause either or both to end up seriously hurt whatever the reason your rabbit is biting for there are several steps you should take consistently always give a loud 'eeeeep ' whenever they bite you this is how rabbits communicate to one another that they have been hurt follow quickly with a firm no bite once the behavior has stopped be as quick to offer a praise and love to reinforce their good behavior however as soon as your rabbit stops biting you from the point you try to hold her try to pet her slowly and calmly don't let her see your hand though or she'll find it a threat for a while other than petting her head pet her back until she is calm and does not think about biting you when approaching a rabbit that bites use a flat hand palm side down with fingers spread as wide as possible but as you consider your rabbit safe enough to pet on the head have the hand several inches above the head and bring it down gently onto the rabbit's forehead and nose from the front if possible never let anyone or even you poke their fingers at your rabbit's face they're very likely to bite even if the rabbit isn't a known biter depending on the intensity of your rabbit's bite and your experience you may want to use a pair of thick gloves at first to prevent any bites when you become more comfortable you can start practicing without the gloves in time the behavior will improve as the rabbit unlearns it with your help patience and love Dog training Aerial (dance move) Guinea pig Dog Cat Volleyball Dog agility Fast bowling Ferret Drill bit Skateboarding trick Milton H.
