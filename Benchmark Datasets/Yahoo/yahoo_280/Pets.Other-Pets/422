how those a hen get pregent but there is soo many hens and usally one roster sorry for my spelling he selects the female usually the closest one to himself droops one wing to the ground circles her then grabs her by the back of the head and climbs on her back balancing himself by flapping his wings he lowers his tail and places his vent in direct contact with that of the hen where the passage of sperm from his cloaca to her oviduct takes place the entire sex act takes less than seconds and it appears the most satisfying thing for the female is fluffing the feathers and shaking the body immediately afterwards once sperm has been transferred they swim along the mucous lining of the oviduct until they reach the infundibulum where they fertilise the ovum as it passes through from the ovary it takes some to days for the sperm to travel and that explains why it normally takes that long after initial mating for fertile eggs to occur conversely a hen may still lay fertile eggs some days after being mated for the last time Sexual reproduction Fertilisation In vitro fertilisation Ovum Bird Spermatozoon Menstrual cycle Digenea Ovulation Sexual intercourse Earthworm Capercaillie Ostrich Spider Chicken Grasshopper Shark American lobster Skateboarding trick Ovary Egg (biology) Vagina Parthenogenesis Professional wrestling throws Fertility awareness Moss Sex organ Water polo Puberty Roundworm Dragons (Pern) Tuatara Infertility Flight controls Semen Beetle Pregnancy Ploidy Leatherback Sea Turtle Kakapo Orgasm Nile crocodile Glossary of American football Condor Twin Sex Krill Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Homunculus Emergency contraception Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Male reproductive system (human) Intersexuality Professional wrestling holds Sexual selection Sexual dimorphism Aphid Drosophila melanogaster Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Apollo 8 Annelid Albatross Hermaphrodite Pterosaur International League Egg (food) Peafowl Antarctic krill Whale Humpback Whale Single Transferable Vote Epididymis Ascariasis Spermatogenesis Alternation of generations Housefly Birth control Emu Glossary of partner dance terms Aerial (dance move) Acanthocephala Octopus Hen Harrier The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Death Gate Cycle Deluge (mythology) Chimera (genetics) Seabird Woman Abortion debate Man Anopheles Dog Coconut crab Mallard Penguin
