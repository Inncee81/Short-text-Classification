a friend of mine found something i haven't seen it but he's fairly certain it's either a frog or a toad however he said it's about the size of a dime apparently it's grey with yellow spots if it helps any he's in nebraska and found it near a lake most importantly he needs to know what to feed it however if you can offer other suggestions as for care that would be great it's important to him he'd like to make sure it stays alive letting it go is not an option keep in mind it's about the size of a dime too small for crickets tickling how does that help wtf correction not tickling licking crappy day most good pet shops sell small crickets ask for two day old crickets or buy flightless fruit flies he also needs to use distilled water frogs and toads are susceptible to toxins absorbed through the skin visit the frog and toad message boards at www kingsnake com to get more details and better identification of your frog btw licking it would let him know how toxic the frog is which would help in iding it but i wouldn't suggest it also keeping it may be against the law and open him up to huge fines and possibly jail time i don't know the laws in nebraska Frog Rocko's Modern Life Exploding toad Fauna of Australia Toad (Nintendo) Aerial (dance move) Social rule Creatures in Bionicle The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fishing Violin RuneScape Random Events Poison dart frog The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Advance fee fraud Toad Spidey Super Stories Kashrut Neopets Pet Hamster Rebreather Dime (U.S. coin) Alcoholic beverage Bird Mario Kart 64 Plame affair Illegal drug trade Union Pacific Railroad Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Licking County, Ohio One Piece minor characters Toad Patrol Theory of conduct RuneScape quests W.I.T.C.H.
