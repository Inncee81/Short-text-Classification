how do you disinfect the smell of rabbit's urine my indoor rabbits have been urinating on the floor and i don't know how to eliminate the smell you'll need to use an enzyme to neutralize the ammonia in the urine you can go to a pet store and find many to choose from however like others have said white vinegar works as well and it's cheaper dab up the urine as much as possible pour the vinegar over the spot then dab up the vinegar it will stink for a while but once the vinegar dries there will be no problem another good thing about using an enzyme reaction is that the rabbit wont be able to smell the urine either so if you've been having problems with your bunny peeing in the same spot this will likely stop good luck Ammonia Domestic rabbit Housebreaking Urine Vinegar Rabbit Cat Sodium hypochlorite Toilet Toilet humour Fancy rat Urinal Guinea pig Acetic acid Skunk Urinary incontinence Hamster Japanese toilet Vermicompost Horseshoe Protein Hydrogen peroxide Salt Luck Disinfection The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Fish and chips Carbon tetrachloride Ketchup Water Drug test Cosmo Kramer Ultraviolet Clomipramine Gaia Online Barbecue Insulin Art Digital audio broadcasting Cuisine of Denmark Menstrual cycle Diabetes mellitus Food preservation Amine Tobacco smoking Minor characters in Morrowind World War Three (Doctor Who) Hydrogen economy Social aspects of clothing Phenylketonuria Easter Bunny Renal physiology Bugs Bunny Enzyme Japanese cuisine Transaminase Food science Biochemistry Hillsborough disaster Mass spectrometry Stoat Rabbit Seasoning Penis Monty Python and the Holy Grail Vitamin C Urea Ferret Urinary system Urination Tofu Sulfuric acid KaBlam!
