my rabbit when i try to stroke or hold my baby rabbit he runs away from me how can i stop him from running away from me how can i get him to trust me keep spending time with your rabbit yes carry and pet your rabbit at small intervals at first occasionally hand feed him eventually he will learn to trust you once he feels safe and that he can trust you he won't run away when i first brought my rabbit home from the animal shelter she wasn't very friendly and she wouldn't let me carry her for more than seconds at a time she would often bite and growl at me i started out slow by petting her and picking her up for short periods of time i was always in her face actually eventually she learned to trust me and now she behaves more like a dog she follows me all over the place and she comes when i call her i can also carry her for long periods of time just be patient and gentle with your baby rabbit he'll come around best wishes Rabbit Dog training Dog Domestic rabbit Care Bears Who Framed Roger Rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Guinea pig Bugs Bunny Kodocha Rabies Animal testing Characters in the Smurfs First aid Pet skunk Ai Yori Aoshi W.I.T.C.H.
