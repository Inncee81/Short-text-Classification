my ferrets aren't gettin along i have a i have a month old boy ferret that has lived with me for about months and i recently adopted another ferret who is a month old boy ferret we've only had the new ferret for about days and i understand that they sometimes they get possesive and jealous but how long will it take them to become friends what can i do to help them get along the ferret that i've had longer doesn't exactley attack the newby he walks around sniffing and following him hissing but he will jump on the newby's back everyonce and a while and bite him on the neck other than that it's not too bad of fighting the only time you need to worry is when one ferret is screaming and there is blood if neither one of those happens most likely they are just wrestling for dominance and having a good time they are near the same age so that is good have you played with both of them at the same time they'll love that and also play with each other yes one might think a certain toy is his and will claim it and then the other one will take it from the first one and it will go back and forth that's the way ferrets are sounds like they are just having fun Ferret Kodocha Housebreaking Have I Got News For You The Beach Boys Pet skunk Eddie Guerrero Bret Hart Salad Fingers Shaggy dog story Ron and Fez The Shining (film) The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Social rule Scream (film) Internet slang Professional wrestling aerial techniques Dog training Notable lines in the Star Wars series Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Brian Wilson The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Static Shock Will Smith Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling slang Toy Story 2 The Inside Pure Pwnage Pok__mon Live!
