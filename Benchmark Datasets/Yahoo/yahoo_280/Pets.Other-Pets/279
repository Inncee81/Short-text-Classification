can rabbits swim and could they swim in a pool with cholorine it is a lop eared rabbit also yes rabbits can swim in fact they are really rather proficient at it i would not however recommend allowing a rabbit to swim in a pool with chlorine as rabbits are far more sensitive to products than humans are so a safe level of chlorine for a human would not be safe for a rabbit this fact that they are more sensitive is one major reason rabbits are were used in animal testing for products used on humans such as cosmetics lotions shampoos etc because if a product will not irritate the rabbit it is unlikely to do so on a human i had a rabbit when i was young that really enjoyed a nice summer swim in our kiddy pool when the weather was hot however one must also keep in mind that rabbits panic easily so if they are unable to get out of the water they may panic and drown they also are more susceptible to climate shock than many other animals so care must be taken that the rabbit not over heat itself or become chilled do to the swim Swimming pool Swimming Body piercing Chlorine Rabbit Dog Domestic rabbit Bathing Shampoo Hyperthermia Drowning Diving Cat Livestock Care Bears Sodium hypochlorite Pikmin Survival skills Sewage treatment Disinfection Tattoo Air conditioning Hiking Ranma __ characters Thermoregulation Hamster Aspartame Fountain Escherichia coli O157:H7 Kevin and Kell Asthma Multiple chemical sensitivity Water Guinea pig Diving suit Acne Chronic fatigue syndrome Volkswagen Golf European Rabbit Solar power Sunlight Ammonia Mobile phone radiation and health Energy development Platypus Veganism Sento First aid Dairy Explosive material Lake Burley Griffin God Emperor of Dune Psoriasis Plastic Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Triathlon Rebreather Hydrochloric acid Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Eye Haloalkane Menstrual cup Wind chill History of swimming Draize test Otitis externa Brewery Breastfeeding Shark Welding Orca Ecco the Dolphin Human sexual behavior Decibel Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gun politics Conjunctivitis Clinical depression Butterfly stroke Albinism Stroke Renewable energy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Full Metal Panic?
