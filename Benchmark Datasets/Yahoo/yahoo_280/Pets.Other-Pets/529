fur block in rabbits droppings are not normal help my rabbit has fur block where his droppings are mainly composed of hair and are stringed together i heard that either pinnapple juice or mineral oil will help break down the fur in his digestive system but he refuses to take any of it no matter what i serve it with any suggestions or other treatments he doesn't appear lethargic or anything but im worried about flies getting on him because the droppings are on one big string and sort of connect to him for a while thanks if the bunny were truely in fur block he wouldn't be pooping at all called gi stasis but it's good that you observed that he's producing strings of pearls the first thing you need to do is increase his roughage if he's on a pelleted diet cut back on the pellets add lots more hay to his diet make sure he's getting enough water you can add fresh greens to increase water intake pineapple juice has been proven not to do much fresh pineapple is good roughage if he'll eat it you can also try canned pumpkin no sugar added it is very high in roughage and some bunnies love it i wouldn't use mineral oil without a vets oversight the oil isn't digestable and can compact the hair even further in the gi tract and cause a blockage if you are not careful if you have a bunny savy vet near you i'd get his her opinion Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Veganism Dietary fiber Soft drink Ferret Tooth Milk Tocopherol Tofu Hamster Stomach cancer Tea Cat Crohn's disease Gastrointestinal tract Fancy rat Diarrhea Coprophagia Vitamin C Folic acid Acne RuneScape economy Pig (zodiac) Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Characters in the Smurfs Sugar Coffee Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Pineapple Sewage treatment Two-stroke cycle Conker's Bad Fur Day Vegetarianism Bugs Bunny Fecal incontinence Kosher foods Bengali cuisine Waste management Cheese Philosophical skepticism RuneScape skills Ultraviolet Poker jargon Raw food diet Carnivorous plant Omega-3 fatty acid Soul food Aspartame Coronary heart disease Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Tooth enamel Water Stomach SpongeBob SquarePants Capercaillie Bread Peruvian cuisine Pitaten Dieting Fasting Chinchilla String theory Cystic fibrosis Shit Anorexia nervosa Sugar substitute GunZ The Duel Motor oil Plastic Junk food Alcohol fuel Trapping Pet skunk Foie gras Food Ricin Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Malaysia Marilyn Monroe Obesity Cuisine of the Philippines Cryptographic hash function Ramen Quake III Arena Organic food Russian cuisine Piccolo Junior Saga Comanche Mario Dialysis Colorectal cancer Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)
