cats or dogs which do you like better cats or dogs i like dogs better some would argue that dogs make better pets but i have a few defenses for cats for one you will never have to worry about cats smelling foul they clean themselves constantly and thus emanate no odor no matter how many times you wash dogs they will inevitably end up smelling within hours for another dogs are much more high maitenance bigger dogs require food around the clocks while smaller dogs will bark until your ears bleed cats though they will beg for your love require food water and a litterbox nothing more they make toys out of anything and cats beg for love only to be accepted by the master those who say cats only want to be loved and will not love back are sadly corrupt the purr of a cat means it is contented that you have made it happy when you make it happy it knows that you care for it this leads to sleeping on the edge of your bed at night a generally happy disposition and a greeting at the front door when you come home from work sleeping on the bed means the cat will protect you from any creepy crawlies and that it trusts you enough to sleep near you a door greeting means that it has been lonely and missed you for it loves you but all in all both cats and dogs have their ups and downs they are both wonderful creatures and fill this world with enough love to get us through the day Cat Shaggy dog story Dog Sin City Hamster Care Bears RuneScape quests Ferret Guinea pig The Fairly OddParents One Piece minor characters Garfield Domestic rabbit Catscratch Animal communication Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Felis sapiens Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dean Koontz Toilet humour Keeshond Ren and Stimpy The Amber Spyglass The Time Machine Housebreaking Skunk The Family from One End Street Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Doraemon Miss Saigon USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Invader Zim Dog training Pet skunk Taikyoku shogi Gray Wolf Characters of Naruto Futurama (TV series - season 5) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart The Death Gate Cycle The Star Wars Holiday Special The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Salad Fingers Brian Griffin Golden Retriever Kodocha Manos: The Hands of Fate The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Rent (musical) Upholstery Morphology (linguistics) The Jazz Singer W.I.T.C.H.
