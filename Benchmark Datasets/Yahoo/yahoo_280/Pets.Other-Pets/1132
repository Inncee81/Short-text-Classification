question on duckling food i'm getting a week old duckling in a few days and i went to a feed store and asked for a non medicated starter food i bought what they gave me first of all it isn't mashed or crumbled its pellets and on the tag it says layer pellets is a complete food for commercial egg production it is not necessary to feed scratch grain if i crumble it up and make it small enough is it okay for my duckling to eat oh and it has protein and i'm pretty sure ducklings need about but i heard i can also feed them little chopped hard boiled eggs which are full of protein would that be okay this food should be suitable for a duckling although i would have preferred a game bird food i doubt you will need to crush the pellets unless they are of unusual size Tofu Chicken Vegetarianism Maize Hamster Chili con carne Cheese Milk Duck Rice Peanut Fancy rat Jewish cuisine Shotgun Bread Brewing Hamburger Egg (food) Cuisine of the Philippines Food preservation Japanese cuisine Mallard Soybean Soy milk Bengali cuisine Moonshine American lobster Capercaillie Healthy eating Ice cream Flour Insulin Cocaine Kosher foods Cuisine of Denmark Veganism Honeybee Potato Ant The Ugly Duckling Dieting Factory farming Homebrewing Fasting Diseases of the honeybee Sea-Monkey Spider Dairy Roman eating and drinking Cereal Organic food Bodybuilding Rice pudding Foie gras Tilapia Hemp Organic farming Meat analogue Food storage Pizza Liver FoxTrot Airsoft Fusion power Soul food Ramen Kodocha Quorn Chicken soup Couscous Quinoa Star Trek Customizable Card Game Peruvian cuisine Hot dog Porridge Cream (food) Beer Single malt Scotch Ethanol Stomach cancer Common bean Genetically modified food Soap Breakfast Natt__ Tea Livestock Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hunting Acorn Ecology Falconry Protein Bird Ham Mosquito Botulism
