how many times per day do you feed your dog i have a five year old yorkie up until recently she only ate dry eukanuba i would put one scoop in her bowl and she would eat from that one scoop all day and then suddenly she stopped eating it i tried several other dry dog foods but she would not eat i took her to the doctor and they told me that she was healthy but yorkie's are finicky eaters and was told to try a little wet mixed with the dry this worked like a charm she starting eating every drop of food in her bowl now she pretty much begs to eat all day i was feeding her this mixture twice daily but she started getting fat i tried feeding her two small portions per day but she would sit there licking the bowl after i fed her because the portions were too small i don't know what to do is it okay to feed her once a day i feel sad if i think she's still hungry but right now i feel i'm over feeding her but she's loving it you need to have her on a feeding schedule now feed twice a day morning and evening when you free fed her you had no idea how much she ate now you must know the right amount to feed her read the bag and see what amount of kibble it states to feed a dog her weight each day feed just under half that amount at each of the two feedings and add the little bit of moist or some gravy check her weight if it's stable she's getting the right amount each day if she's gaining weight cut back a bit on the kibble the moist food or gravy only needs to be enough to moisten and flavor the kibble it doesn't need to be more than that Bread Breastfeeding Foie gras Milk Little Shop of Horrors Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of the Philippines Dairy Hamster Binge eating disorder Vermicompost Ham The Amazing Race Carburetor Super Size Me Tofu Peanut Fancy rat Urinary incontinence Garfield Ramen Hot dog Dieting Little Britain Jewish cuisine Dog training Healthy eating Fecal incontinence Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Bengali cuisine Obesity Kodocha Blonde on Blonde Atkins Nutritional Approach Cat Flatulence Sea-Monkey Kakapo Bird migration Gastroparesis Comanche French fries Insulin Textile manufacturing Tocopherol MRE Domestic rabbit Stomach cancer Toilet humour Cuisine of the Southern United States BitTorrent Adjustable gastric band Idli The Amber Spyglass Sushi 613 mitzvot The dozens John the Baptist Guinea pig Cajun cuisine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Internal ballistics Tea Soft drink Hansel und Gretel Ice cream Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ron and Fez Sugar substitute Avenue Q Anorexia nervosa Hypoglycemia Carbon dioxide Coconut crab Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Bong Shaggy dog story Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 The Shining (film) Ron Weasley RuneScape quests Cheese Lutefisk Cuisine of Laos Hay Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Andrew Dice Clay Wood Meal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piccolo Junior Saga Tasmanian Devil
