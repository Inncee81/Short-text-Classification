chinchilla help okay i can pick her up and hold her inside of her cage but she usually doesn't like it any tips on how to pick her up how can i get her to be comfortable with me so i can hold her outside of her cage the store didn't know how old she was when we bought her and i've had her about a year got any ideas when you let her out to run around sit on the floor with her try doing this in a large closet or bathroom she will eventually run over to you especially if you sit near her dust or with some treats in your hand to get my chinchilla more tame i let her run around and got her used to the sound of a box of rasins shaking i'll sit down with her and shake the box until she comes over then i'll pick her up and while i am holding her give her a raisin not too many though it can be bad for their tummys once she got used to me holding her an associated it with treats and nice petting she let me do it much more just be patient and good luck Chinchilla Hamster Care Bears Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside Dog training Toilet humour Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Upholstery Domestic rabbit Whose Line Is It Anyway?
