if i were to buy a pet what kind should i choose and why i'm thinking of buying a new pet and i was wondering if anyone can help me out well it depends on how much space you have as well as what kind of animal you have time for for example if you are extremely busy i wouldn't suggest getting a dog as they need lots of attention they get stir crazy easily and will get destructive or depressed if left alone for long periods if you are interested in a dog do your research on different breeds some like a border collie are better suited to extremly dedicated owners who are willing to spend a lot of time working with them they are pretty high strung where other breeds like a chihuahua are good for people without a lot of dog experience cats on the other hand are more self sufficient they can be left home alone for a few days at a time and will still be ok the downside is cleaning litter boxes but that only has to be done twice a week or so rodents are pretty easy too rats mice hamsters but they smell a lot and need to be changed often rabbits are social animals and get depressed if ignored plus they smell also whatever your choice is make sure you do your research beforehand that way you are prepared and can make the right decision for both of you Hamster Dog Fancy rat Cat Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Brown Rat Pet Rat House Mouse Alaskan husky Mickey Mouse Animal testing Working dog Housebreaking Feral cat Pet store Invader Zim Mixed-breed dog Social rule Garfield Microeconomics Dog training Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Herding dog Pet Sounds Dog agility Domestication Chinchilla Taboo food and drink Pig Trapping Obedience training Breed registry German Shepherd Dog Theory of conduct Monster Rancher monsters Rabbit Skunk Kim Possible Keeshond Trademark Gray Wolf European Rabbit Philosophy of language Labrador Retriever SpongeBob SquarePants Artificial selection Border Terrier Rodent Dog intelligence Socialization Dobermann Sesshomaru Livestock Animal communication Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Companion dog Extreme Programming Bugs Bunny The Contender (television series) Dog breed Sleep Tobacco smoking Time travel Shetland Sheepdog Ren and Stimpy Stoat Animal Liberation Front Falconry The Apprentice 2 Cloning Walt Disney Aspartame Fox hunting Minnie Mouse Poker jargon Seabird Havanese Password Doxepin People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Golden Retriever Nintendogs Capital accumulation Clinical depression Internet phenomenon Long-term potentiation Zoophilia Thermoregulation Manx (cat) Greyhound Alaskan Malamute Fruits Basket Kurt Cobain Traumatic brain injury
