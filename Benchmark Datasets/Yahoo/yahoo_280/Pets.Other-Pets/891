would a guinea pig be good for me i get very emotionally attached to animals i have several cats and a dog i was looking at adding a guinea pig to my family and i want to know how long they live i had a teddybear hampster and i was devestated when she died at years old our vet said i should stay away from short lived animals and our animals tend to live a long time all of our cats and dogs we have had in the past have lived into their 's guinea pigs are wonderful animals a guinea pig is often thought of as a good pet for children and this is true but as with all pets parents must make sure the child is old enough to be gentle with the animal and mature enough to care for it properly a guinea pig is a sociable animal and needs a home where it will receive attention and affection being left in a cage and ignored is a harsh life for the guinea pig they are affectionate animals that love to be held and owners should be prepared for this a prospective owner should get a good book on guinea pig care and read it carefully a guinea pig s needs are not elaborate but include a roomy cage safe bedding a ceramic food bowl a water bottle with a sipper spout guinea pig pellets and timothy hay these are the basics some people put a little plastic or wooden shelter inside the cage but this is not recommended for the first week or so at home the guinea pig may retreat inside the shelter and refuse to come out except to eat a shelter should only be added after the guinea pig has become accustomed to its environment if you are wondering about the general lifespan of a guinea pig an average lifespan is years but they can live longer sometimes years when properly cared for the basic equipment you'll need for a guinea pig are cage food dish water bottle guinea pig pellets vitamins timothy hay salt spool and pine bedding only guinea pigs can be kept as singles or in groups of two or more two females are good but two males will fight remember that guinea pigs are prolific animals and a male and female kept together will most likely result in babies at some point many people say that more than one guinea pig will be better for both of them because guinea pigs are social animals and when the owner doesn't have enough time to give one of the guinea pigs attention the two or more guinea pigs can give eachother amusement guinea pigs are very popular pets because of their availability docile temperaments tendency not to bite or scratch when handled and relatively clean habits they are not long lived which can be disconcerting to owners especially children many parents however believe that having their children experience the relatively short period of companionship and subsequent death is a meaningful way to expose children to the ups and downs of life overall guinea pigs are wonderful pets and are easy to care for if you have the time if you think about it carefully guinea pigs can live pretty long with the proper care p s i read the answers at the top and please don't get your guinea pig a plastic ball to run in Pet skunk Cat Fancy rat Dog Garfield Socialization Dog training Pig Chinchilla Pet Social rule Taboo food and drink Japanese tea ceremony Strap-on dildo Domestication Ferret Breastfeeding Narcissism Animal rights Fecal incontinence Coprophagia Kosher foods Vitamin C Drill bit Golden Retriever RuneScape quests Peruvian cuisine Ranma __ characters Happiness Animal testing Stuttering Pottery Food Guns, Germs, and Steel Theory of conduct Life expectancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Animal Farm Lisa the Vegetarian Team Rocket Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sea-Monkey Livestock Sento Sinfest Tooth enamel Chicken Animal shelter Pitaten Professional wrestling match types Tarantula People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Housebreaking Veganism Maison Ikkoku Monster Rancher monsters Unclean animals Chopsticks Textile manufacturing Kodocha Floppy disk Vampire The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kashrut Animal Liberation Front Equine conformation Menstrual cup The Amber Spyglass Russian space dogs Olduwan Anorexia nervosa Knife Semen Ramen Tea German Shepherd Dog Infantilism The Secret of NIMH Bipolar disorder Whaling Electrophysiology Abortion debate Sewage treatment Pit bull South Park The Death Gate Cycle Labrador Retriever Little Britain Mojave people Customs and etiquette of Japan M16 (rifle)
