why the horse keep standing everytimes horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down they are able to doze and enter light sleep while standing an adaptation from life as a prey animal in the wild lying down makes an animal more vulnerable to predators horses are able to sleep standing up because a stay apparatus in their legs allows them to relax their muscles and doze without collapsing unlike humans horses do not need a solid unbroken period of sleep time they obtain needed sleep by means of many short periods of rest horses may spend anywhere from four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest and from a few minutes to several hours lying down however not all this time is the horse actually asleep total sleep time in a day may range from several minutes to a couple of hours horses require approximately two and a half hours of sleep on average in a hour period most of this sleep occurs in many short intervals of about minutes each horses need to lie down occasionally and prefer soft ground for a nap horses must lie down to reach rem sleep they only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum rem sleep requirements however if a horse is never allowed to lie down after several days it will become sleep deprived and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into rem sleep while still standing this condition differs from narcolepsy though horses may also suffer from that disorder horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators a horse kept entirely alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger source wikipedia Sleep Cat Insomnia Apollo 8 Dog Gray Wolf Rapid eye movement Polyphasic sleep Dream Sleep apnea Eye Spider Urinary incontinence Sumo Sleep disorder Lucid dreaming Horse Brown Bear Sleep paralysis Out-of-body experience Siesta Tide 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Thermoregulation Epilepsy Capercaillie Drowning Time Diazepam Involuntary commitment The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amazing Race STS-62 First aid Bipolar disorder Hypoglycemia Daylight saving time Ionizing radiation Fast bowling Caffeine Gamma ray burst Gypsy moth Electroencephalography Weight training Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Traumatic brain injury Battles of Lexington and Concord Muscle Fox hunting Leatherback Sea Turtle Bodybuilding Iditarod Albinism Childbirth Evidence of evolution Tyrannosaurus rex Hypnagogia Human height Bottlenose Dolphin Radiation poisoning Elephant Human adaptation to space Shark Mountain Gorilla Pikmin Orgasm Child sexuality Whale Sleeping sickness Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Electroconvulsive therapy Speed of light Shaggy dog story Tsetse fly Technetium Hipparchus (astronomer) Guinea pig Nile crocodile Minor Harry Potter Beasts Duchenne muscular dystrophy Animal communication Myocardial infarction Dairy Day Euthanasia Hypnosis Koala Clinical depression Decompression sickness Human Horse gait Domestication Dieting
