is anyone feeding blue buffalo food both my dog and cats are sick and wonder if it is their food my dog has diarhea and my cats are vomiting the food that is vomitted is completely undigested could be an intestinal parasite but they are all fed blue buffalo dry food there has been no recall on this food but i would like to know if anyone else is feeding this food and having issues as well i wouldn't think it is the food except for the fact that i bought new bags of dog and cat food only weeks or so ago and they are getting sick and having severe increases in thirst this is not a switch in food types they have been eating blu buffalo since the first of the year just a new bag of blue buffalo have you always fed them blue buffalo or is it a new food that you just introduced if it's new did you give them an adjustment period using both the old and new food just changing their food suddenly can cause them to vomit have diarrhea etc get them to the vet since they've been doing this since you switched the food the vet will give them antibiotics something to keep them from vomiting having diarrhea and maybe a science diet vet formula designed to calm their gi tract and keep them from being sick this happened to my dog a few months ago but with a different brand of food i mixed his old food and the new food for about a week increasing the amount of new food daily a couple of days after he was switched completely to the new food he started having diarrhea a week wasn't long enough to keep him from getting sick so the next time i try i'll probably switch him more gradually taking weeks to switch his food but the vet put him on an antibiotic an anti diarrheal a week's worth each and the special diet for a month at this point going back to the dog's and cats' old food would not make them stop it may make them worse take them to the vet Diarrhea Stomach cancer Vomiting Guinea pig Fancy rat Dietary fiber Gastroparesis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nutrition Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Adjustable gastric band Chocolate Garfield Vitamin C Fecal incontinence Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ulcerative colitis Pneumonia Insulin Ferret Kitten Atkins Nutritional Approach Folic acid Taboo food and drink Chronic fatigue syndrome Protein-energy malnutrition Radiation poisoning Coprophagia Foodborne illness Albatross Wheel of Fortune Cryptosporidium Heartworm Livestock Coeliac disease Milk Tooth enamel Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Rotavirus Botulism Gastroenteritis Brown Bear Chemotherapy Trichinosis Urinary incontinence Kangaroo Prostate cancer Antibiotic Dairy Food allergy Socialization Shaggy dog story New Coke Rocky Mountain spotted fever Dialysis Migraine Giardia lamblia Food Flatulence Allergy Cholera Diabetes mellitus Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Anthrax First aid Dai dai shogi Food Stamp Program Babe Ruth Famine Tai shogi Super Size Me Hypoglycemia Little Britain Cirrhosis Ebola Neolithic Revolution Kakapo Glycogen storage disease type I Dog food Capercaillie Marathon (sport) Housebreaking Traumatic incident reduction Mattress Cancer Common cold Healthy eating Cat food Diazepam
