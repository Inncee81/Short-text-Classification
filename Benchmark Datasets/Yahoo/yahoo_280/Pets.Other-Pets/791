what do you think ok so i am thinking of getting a baby spider monkey lots of people have already told me that they are dangerous or whatever but thats not why i am here i want to know what they are like around children we are now designing a room that the monkey can stay in that he she can do whatever they want to throw there poo and other stuff like that what do you think about this also can they wear diapers or no yes they can wear diapers but they are likely to rip them off and shred them they are not reliable around children at all they will bite if annoyed and children can annoy them without even meaning to monkeys any kind are really not good pets as shown by all the ones given up by individual owners so many that the zoos won't take them and if they are lucky they go to holding pens on a few private rescue havens where they wait to die literally it is incredibly cruel because they go from being babies getting individual attention from their families to being dumped as unwanted unloved and with very little to do they are not socialized with other monkeys so they don't know how to behave with their own and never bond think this over monkeys belong in groups in their own environment it is very cruel to keep them as pets get a sweet dog from animal services or a breed rescue dogs are ideal companion animals and add much to one's life monkeys are meant to be with other monkeys Monkey Dog Infantilism Kim Possible Cat Care Bears Shen Gong Wu Garfield Codename: Kids Next Door Hamster Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Family Guy Primate Pet Zoo Shaggy dog story One Piece minor characters Working dog Characters of Naruto KaBlam!
