what all should i get when buying a ferret i might actually get since i know they're very social animals but do you have like a list of things i need to get when buying a ferret s for the first time not 'might' get two you 'will' get two ferrets really do need a buddy to stay happy and healthy mentally and physically while it is ideal to get two at the same time because they are most likely of the same litter you can get one now and in a few months introduce another one this gives you time to save up money for the expense you will need a large cage with atleast levels levels being ideal the bigger the better here atleast large ferret litter pans buy the largest ones you can find they are typically about bucks a piece if you get the small ones you will be sorry the ferret will poop outside of them all the time you will need one pan for the cage and for outside of the cage in the room you will let them play in you will need litter i recommend feline pine it is the best i have found sure it is a little expensive for litter but one small bag lasts a week a week isn't so bad you will need ferret food of course i recommend a quality food such as ennova evo or zoopreem feel free to check out treats and supplements while you are in the food isle water bottle get a flat back glass waterbottle they are worth the expense they never crack unless you drop them on a hard surface of course and they do not get all moldy and yucky like plastic very easy to clean with a bottle brush hammocks two is ideal but you can get one for now and get another one down the road toys there are a lot of toys specifically made for ferrets and that are safe beware of thinking cat toys are equal ferrets will chew cat toys up and some like the little mice have small plastic eyes that ferrets will dislodge and swallow most quality cages will come with food dishes that fit into the levels of the cage if your worried your cage doesn't you can pick up a heavy crock style dish just in case don't forget the ferret it is important to never pick a ferret just by looking at them it is easy to pick the cutest ferret in the cage and say i want that one but you really should handle all of the ferrets in the cage and see how they behave while handled go with your gut and do not pick any ferret that seems unhealthy these are the basics and the other odds and end such as grooming products will fall into place later on down the line fyi baby wash works well for baths please don't bath more then once every months bad for their skin key to odor control is keeping everything including bedding nice and clean offering your buddy a clean old sweatshirt every couple of days will keep him happy do your research there are soooo many ferrets in shelters because people do not anticipate behavioral issues be prepared for everything http www ferretsr org good luck Fancy rat Ferret Cat Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Pet skunk Dog training Social rule Garfield Dog Poker jargon Plastic Customs and etiquette of Japan Equine conformation Knife Mattress Chinchilla Japanese tea ceremony Bong Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Bulk vending Milk Breastfeeding Care Bears Upholstery My Little Pony Canary House Mouse Organic farming Infantilism Dairy Rabies Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Cookware and bakeware Elephant Craps Champagne (beverage) The Apprentice 2 Tea Cruising (maritime) Pitaten Trapping First aid Surveillance Emergency preparedness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sento Piccolo Junior Saga Procrastination Tooth Violin Floppy disk Menstrual cup Illegal drug trade Dietary fiber Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Diseases of the honeybee Fecal incontinence Salad Fingers Physical attractiveness Codename: Kids Next Door Livestock Mouse (computing) Textile manufacturing Autonomous building Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diving Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Strap-on dildo Chopsticks Welding Foodborne illness Water Electrophysiology Kosher foods Knots Landing Gross domestic product The Star Wars Holiday Special Richard Feynman Alcoholics Anonymous The Inside The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain Economics
