how would i be able to aquire a tiger as a pet i really want a tiger and i'm sure there is a good reason i'm not supposed to have one and i really don't plan on getting one but if i was dead serious about going out and getting a tiger what would i have to do to get one no or at least not without proper training licensing and habitat of course it also depends on where you live and what you plan to do with the animal in general though wild animal permits are far less for pets than for rescue and show like a zoo even the people who train animals for circuses and movies don't consider them a pet as no matter how tame a creature might seem to the owner they are still a wild animal as sigfried and roy learned a few years ago if you're serious about becoming involved with them however look into animal handling and wildlife rescue programs or work for your local zoo Tiger Pet skunk Siegfried & Roy Elephant Working dog Domestic rabbit Ferret Liger Gerald Durrell Cat Domestication Lion German Shepherd Dog Panthera hybrid Wombat Circus Cheetah Tigon Extinction Issaquah, Washington Feral cat White tiger Phantom cat Steve Irwin Bat Dog Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus Giant Panda Brown Bear Dog training Dr. Seuss Auburn University Jack Hanna Exotic pet Hung Gar Lisa the Vegetarian Monster Rancher monsters American Bison Hybrid Nintendo DS San Diego Zoo Public domain Tenchi Muyo!
