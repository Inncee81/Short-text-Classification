how do you train a rabbit to use its litter box i gonna get a rabbit and some toys for it i want to learn to how to train it to go to the bathroom in its litter box rabbits are extremely neat animals and thus will normally use one certain area of the cage as their toilet once you have identified that area usually a corner place the litter box you plan to use in that spot i find that corner litter boxes work best as compared to square litter pans if your rabbit chews or pulls on the litter box use wire to attatch it firmly from the back of the cage to the wire around it usually the bunny will begin going in the litter box automatically but sometimes they need a little hint what you can do for that is use a litter scoop to place your rabbits waste into the litter box they'll recognize their own scent and will go in the litter box as far as litter goes i find that yesterdays news cat litter works best it's made of recycled newspaper compressed into pellets so its safe for the bunny and its a lot cheaper than litter made especially for bunnies the lb bags you can find at pick n' save are a lot cheaper than you'll find at a pet store too Domestic rabbit Hamster Fancy rat Dog Ferret Cat litter Pet skunk Trapping Cat Chinchilla Bugs Bunny European Rabbit Magic (illusion) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography The Inside Fox hunting Mel Blanc Dog training Professional wrestling match types Dustbin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese tea ceremony Gaia Online Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Animal communication Hydrogen economy Tick Modern animation of the United States Kevin and Kell Waste management KaBlam!
