buying hamsters where is the best place to buy a healthy hamster thanx i would definitely go to a store make sure that the cages are clean they have clean water and definitely you need to hold them if you or the employee reaches their hand in the cage and they all run go somewhere else i would not suggest a hamster for a first pet for a child they are very moody and they dont like to be woken up they often bite when woken up definitely do not buy your hamsters at petco reason being is petco's small animal area of the store has mostly feeder animals they will sell a hamster rat mouse bunny guinea pig ferret etc to anyone who walks in the store if you do decide to purchase from there please remember to ask the employee to have you sign a health guarantee form that way if something happens to your little guys or girls you can get a refund petco has been known to not give these forms to owners because they do have so many people come in to buy feeder animals hope this helped you out a little my favorite place to go is petsmart or pet supplies plus if you have any of those by you good luck Hamster Guinea pig Pet store Domestic rabbit Pet Ferret PETCO Park Animal testing Pet skunk Taboo food and drink Dairy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Breastfeeding Commodore International Poker jargon Garfield Rat Golden Hamster Confidence trick Sears Holdings Corporation Neopets Pets.com Animal Liberation Front The Hampster Dance Rodent Vitamin C Salad Fingers Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Rabies Internet phenomenon Mickey Mouse Gaia Online Octopus card Trapping Pinky and the Brain Eaton's The Young Ones (TV series) Microchip implant (animal) Pok__mon Live!
