petco or petsmart what store pet store do you prefer i've heard rumors that petco maybe be going out of business in a few years also it depends to me where petco or petsmart is petco kind of reminds me of petsmart though because they both are basically almost the same in new jersey there are petsmart's and they are all the same except one of them only sells reptiles and accessories for them i mean it's what i know for starters it also depends on the price of product in each store i'd usually prefer the store that cost less because i don't want to spend so much money on one product that may not be so useful afterwards not a lot of people can afford things in petco and petsmart i don't really notice anything different in petco and petsmart the only reason why i go there is because i want to keep my animals healthy so i don't really care about which one is better petco and petsmart both have the same amount of cons and pros so i guess everybody has their own cons and pros towards petco and petsmart i think they're both o k but i don't really think either one of them are the best what matters is what food and products they sell that can be helpful for an animal all of my petsmart's and petco's don't really catch my attention or even interest me i only go there for my animals not for myself PETCO Park Microeconomics Apple Computer Hamster Dairy Energy development Wal-Mart Theory of conduct Supply and demand Health insurance Pets.com Labor theory of value Capital accumulation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Inflation Fancy rat Bulk vending Law of value Domestic rabbit Insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Livestock Fish farming Urban sprawl Gross domestic product Free trade Nuclear power Surplus value Animal rights Confidence trick Exchange value Life insurance Philosophical skepticism Illegal drug trade Hyperinflation Economy of the United States Organic food Capitalism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hybrid vehicle Retailer Guinea pig Bread Chili con carne Organic farming Supermarket Married... with Children Neopets Pet store Bish__jo game Philatelic investment Laserdisc Kashrut Tax Microsoft Surplus product Commodore International Intellectual property PE ratio Productive and unproductive labour Opportunity cost Breastfeeding CPU cache Yu-Gi-Oh!
