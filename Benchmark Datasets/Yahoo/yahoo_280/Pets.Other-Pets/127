is it normal for my bunny to have black skin my bunny has been losing a little of its fur nd ive noticed a few days ago that her skin is black is that normal do some bunnies have black skin yes it's totally normal but what's not normal is that your bunny is losing much fur did you take her to the veterinarian for a check up there could be many reasons why your rabbit could be losing too much fur the most obvious reason would be as you mention that your rabbit is just shedding rabbits shed their coat every three months and a light shedding is followed by a heavy shedding then again a light shedding heavy shedding and so on there seems to be significant differences in the way rabbits shed some rabbits may shed completely in a week but with others it will take two weeks or even several weeks to complete their shedding process also some rabbits will get some bald spots here and there while shedding others can get even almost completely bald when they moult and still others will show no bald spots at all another reason that this could be happening is that maybe your bunny could have an allergy to a specific food fur mites stress or ring worm you should take her to the veterinarian to see what is going on or if it's just a process of shedding otherwise it might be an allergy or fur mites but my old bunny used to have pink and black skin mixed together and since i took her to the veterinarian every month he noticed it a couple of times and didn't really say anything bad about it if your veterinarian says that your rabbit has fur loss from stress related symptoms prevent this to prevent stress results from boredom keep in mind that a rabbit should get at least to hours of supervised free time outside the cage daily in the living room bunny proof the room i e make sure electrical cords are hidden or covered with tubing and that you should provide your bunny with plenty of toys such as twigs from untreated apple trees cardboard boxes untreated wicker baskets and so forth but if it's not because of stress listen to your veterinarian and do as he she says about your rabbit's fur loss good luck sweety and to your rabbit as well Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Allergy Moult Dog Cat Hamster Poker jargon Diseases of the honeybee Dairy Ferret Acne Manx (cat) Prostate cancer Asthma Hypoglycemia Pet skunk Breastfeeding Baldness Psoriasis Menstrual cycle Medical prescription Heartworm House dust mite Herpes simplex virus Livestock Hair Animal testing Insulin Fur Thermal power station Trapping Ozone depletion Clinical depression Human skin color Gaia Online Cat coat genetics Bugs Bunny Diode Childbirth Spina bifida Ultraviolet Migraine Eczema Ozone hole Rabbit Scientology beliefs and practices Leather Milk Leaf Winter Radiation therapy Christmas tree Aluminium Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Senescence Tire Cancer RuneScape quests Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Capercaillie Group A streptococcal infection Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Chinchilla Casting Psychiatric hospital Thermoregulation Honeybee Stoat Vitamin C Coeliac disease Garfield Myxobolus cerebralis Invader Zim Diabetes mellitus Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Textile manufacturing terminology Transformer Cephalic disorder Medicine Canary Audiophile Stopping power Kitten Shetland Sheepdog Big Brother (Australian TV series) Jumpstart 3rd Grade
