what do you think will incourage you people to spay nueter your dogs i am guessing for some people telling them that nuetering spaying your dog will result in a longer life for your dog spayed females no longer go into heat and this means no bloody messes and she wont attract unwanted unnuetered dogs to the area nuetered dogs wont go out looking for unspayed females and get hit by a car females will be releived from cancers that occur in their reproductive system males wont get testicle deiseise pets are much calmer after spaying and nuetering the number of dogs in animal shelters would go down if telling dog cat owners those facts isn't enough than what will get people to nueter their dogs cats should people lower the price should their be rewards such as a free dog collar or something to make people at least consider the operation there are so many people on yahoo awnsers that say they don't plan on spaying nuetering their dogs some of those people arnt even planning to breed yet they refuse to spay nueter and it sort of irritaates me day have you even listened what about your pets inprooved health does that matter or are you just stubborn delta dawn is sooo right more people need to visit their local animal shelter preferably one that isn't no kill so they'll see how many poor animals end up there with the possibility of being euthanized some people are just too thick headed to understand why it's a bad thing to leave an animal intact if they don't plan on breeding responsibly those people aren't going to be convinced too easily unfortunately thank god for places that offer free or low cost spaying and neutering i think offering affordable services will help bring down the number of unwanted animals in the world it won't solve the problem completely but it's a good start Dog Cat Domestic rabbit Animal shelter Sterilization (surgical procedure) Socialization Housebreaking Ferret Manx (cat) Pit bull Feral cat Fancy rat Dog training Theory of conduct Mixed-breed dog Hamster Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shaggy dog story Castration Pitaten European Rabbit Extreme Programming The Apprentice 2 The Price Is Right RuneScape quests Social rule Friends Kodocha Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Kakapo God Emperor of Dune Dog agility Reservoir Dogs Obedience training Shrek 2 Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taboo food and drink Kitten Goodness and value theory Microeconomics Animal Crossing Pekingese Capitalism Vernon Schillinger Dobermann Golden Retriever Rabies Livestock Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Death Gate Cycle Karma Discordianism Dilbert Public transport Cloning Rescue group Prostate cancer Past teachings of Prem Rawat Transactional analysis Philosophical skepticism Hunting Rabbit Rhodesian Ridgeback Bob Barker Border Terrier Phoebe Halliwell Incarnations of Immortality Alaskan Malamute Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insurance Supply and demand Pet store Pet Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dog breed Sin City Jam (TV series) Contract Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Free trade Working dog EastEnders Gray Wolf Ontological argument People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Puppy mill
