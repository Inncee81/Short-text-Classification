since when are animal shelter coordinators allowed to yell at ppl interested in adopting an animal i have been working with various animal shelters over the years i saw a post on craigslist for these two dogs that needed to be adopted out i was interested so i called the number i did not have the time to ask any questions or to even tell the woman that i was interested before she asked me whether or not i knew everything there was to know about that particular breed of dog when i responded that no i did not know everything about that breed but that i volunteer at the sh boom i was completely cut off as the lady decided to yell and scream at me that i should grow up and that i need to educate myself her screaming rant continued so long that a friend of mine heard it from across the room since i am obviously ignorant i would like some sort of explanation on why it is permissible to yell at someone who is interested in helping out with homeless animals i have never dealt with any vicious adoption coordinators before this phone call and wouldnt have believed they exist unfortunately i believe it was the cell phone number of this volunteer or that she was the head of the department shelter in the first place part of me really does want to call her again and ask her nicely why she spoke to me so cruelly yesterday i guess that there are just ppl in life that are not worth ruining your day over but unfortunately she did ruin part of my day yesterday thank you all for your answers you made me feel much better about the whole situation yes i know some of those shelter workers think they are the only ones that know or care about animals they give people who are interested in adopting additudes and act like no one is good enough to adopt no wonder why many people still purchase animals from breeders it is often easier and you don't have some pompous idiot judging you Theory of conduct Pet skunk Social rule Plame affair timeline Plame affair Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Socrates The Apprentice 2 Kodocha Dog Russian joke Shaggy dog story United Airlines Flight 93 Community emergency response team Animal shelter The Jim Rome Show Homelessness Kill Bill Sharon Tate Social work Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jon Secada Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Empty Child Sin City Singlish Animal testing Domestic rabbit Transactional analysis Rescue group Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Francis of Assisi Mach kernel I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Avenue Q The Marshall Mathers LP Animal rights Goodness and value theory Breed registry Prank flash Anarchism and society PANICS Pitaten Poker jargon Highway 61 Revisited Leo Frank Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina SMTV Live Golden Retriever John Kerr The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Fathers' rights Seinfeld Milton H.
