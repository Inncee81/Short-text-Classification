my guinea pigs i have guinea pigs they seem to get along well they are both females there names are princess and perky princess is very odd she doesn't react to noises or anything she is also very still when i hold her she also doesn't squeek at all i just got her yesterday but i lover her alot and i am so attached to her at persmare where i got them they offer days so you can bring her back if there is any problems my mother won't let me take princess to the vet so i guess i won't know if she is really deaf or not so i was just woundering if i should trade her in for a diffrent guinea pig if i do i will be so upset because i am so attached to her already i will probably cry if i take her back any suggestions any advice will be very help full to me thanks don't trade her in it sounds like she was a well handled guinea pig when she was first born and therefor is not threatened by humans just keep handling her and you will find her to be an acceptionally good pet to have it doesn't matter if she is deaf which i doubt as long as you keep her in a hutch where dogs and cats can't get to her then she will live a nice life all guinea pigs are different and i rear mine all the same but some are quieter and some are more relaxed than the others Guinea pig Pig Pitaten Dog Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Taboo food and drink Domestic rabbit Cat Ferret Friends Pet Hearing impairment Shaggy dog story Dog training M16 (rifle) Hamster Pet Sounds Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Reservoir Dogs Red Dwarf characters Blonde on Blonde Kodocha Social rule Kender Juliana of the Netherlands Garfield Prince Edmund (Blackadder) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Coprophagia The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Southeast Asia Sin City Stuttering Little Britain AFI 100 Years series Lisa the Vegetarian Chicken Jon Secada V (TV series) Livestock Kim Possible Chinese astrology Abortion debate Pig (zodiac) The Smoking Room Dead Like Me Code: Lyoko Dean Koontz Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Fairly OddParents The Critic Deaf culture Theodicy Phoebe Buffay's songs Five Little Pigs Domestication Psychedelic music Guns, Germs, and Steel Wolf's Rain Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) It's All Gone Pete Tong Fruits Basket Theory of conduct Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters The Pet Sounds Sessions W.I.T.C.H.
