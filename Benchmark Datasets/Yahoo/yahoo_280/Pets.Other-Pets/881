which pet should i choose for my avatar best answer included ok so i have pets that i take care of but i don't know which one a take a picture of and put as my avatar please if you could pick which pet you think that i should do for my avatar that would be great here are your choices male dwarf rabbit gray male guinea pig cream white and tan female dwarf hamster white female dwarf hamster brown and black female golden retriever female lhasa opsa tan black brown and white goldfish orange hermit crab with a petco shell on him hermit crab with a plan shell on her thank you so much for your help and for answering this whoever picks the pet that i go for gets best answer also if you could leave a message telling me why you choose the pet that would be great too thank you so much future vet i'd go for the female golden retriever because personally i think all dogs are wonderful animals i have two dogs and i love them very much no matter what breed a dog may be i think they are all adorible and affectionate rabbits hamsters guinea pigs lhasa opsa's fish and hermit crabs are all astounding creatures but the reason why i chose the golden retriever is because dogs aren't only a man's best friend but a girl's best friend too besides it sounds like you really love all your animals and that's the best thing an owner can give to his her pets overall the good choices you have pointed out the golden retriever caught my attention the most they are smart beautiful sturdy and well proportioned dogs and i think everybody should see that even if it was through a picture as everyone says pictures mean words but yours mean it would be an absolutely bright idea if you just took a picture of all your animals so everyone can see them but since that's not part of the question that's why i chose the golden retriever the picture of your dog will be very resourceful to other yahoo users and personally i think your other animal's pictures will too i never in my life had a golden retriever in my life because i already have a german pinscher and a yorkshire terrier but if i did have a golden retriever i think they'd all get along most importantly i'd even take a picture of them all together and set that as my avatar if i wanted to there are so many people out there who care less about the neglected and abused dogs and if these people saw how cute and innocent faced these creatures were they would start realizing a little more than just intelligence in these amazing dogs pictures show many emotion personality and affection and your dog will show more Dog Hamster Dobermann Internet phenomenon Nintendogs Pet German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Avatar Garfield Domestic rabbit As Good as It Gets Theory of conduct Ferret The Ashlee Simpson Show Golden Retriever Avatar (virtual reality) Animal testing Our Gang Friends Who Framed Roger Rabbit Monster Rancher monsters Care Bears KaBlam!
