are dalmations good dogs i am thinking about getting a dalmation from my local humane society could someone give me a website or something with some info many thanks god bless yes dalmations are wonderful dogs the dalmation is an active energetic dog that enjoys lots of exercise dalmations are people like and people oriented and they do best when given the opportunity to spend lots of time with and around their families they're rather sensitive too if a dalmation is what you're craving for be prepared to make him part of your life both indoor and outdoor dalmations love to play and play and play as most dalmations they don't get tired very easily but a lot of play will help dalmatians shed lots of hair year round their stiff short hairs cling to most surfaces and weave their way into fabrics making them difficult to remove shedding can be reduced by giving the dog a brisk five minute daily brushing outdoors dalmatians are natural dogs cat like in cleanliness and free of doggy odor their toenails should be kept trimmed as they grow rapidly long nails are understandably uncomfortable for any dog dals may object to having their nails trimmed unless they are trained early but it must be done frequent brushing helps to keep them clean without disturbing their protective skin oils during their daily brushing check eyes and ears for irritation also during warm weather check for fleas and ticks while outdoors frequent bathing especially with harsh soaps can lead to dry skin and skin problems in dalmatians most dals clean up well with a damp towel or the use of a plain gentle soap be sure to rinse very well as soapy residue will irritate the skin ask your vet to show you how to empty the anal sacks this procedure should be done whenever you bathe your dalmatian in order to avoid infection about food for your dalmation it's pretty simple there are as many brand preferences as there are dalmatian breeders but there are some generalizations that can be made the authors and other breeders have had good success with premium dry type foods pro plan nutro eagle purina one natures recipe etc because they contain high quality ingredients like real meats instead of meat meal and because they minimize the amount of purines corn meal soy meal meat by products and preservatives the dog seems to make better use of the premium brand foods therefore generating less fecal waste dalmatians do not generally require canned dog food however it is sometimes useful in encouraging the finicky eater do not feed your dalmatian foods with cute colors and shapes as these require additives that may cause or aggravate skin allergy conditions further information on food choices may be found in the medical problems section under the discussion of the unique urinary characteristics of the dalmatian breed please feel free to share your food success stories with us especially if you live in a country other then the united states dalmatians usually eat very quickly and most seem to be always hungry and as a result do not do well with self feeding this can lead to overweight dogs with higher incidences of medical problems later in life adult dals should be fed either once or twice preferred a day from to cups total depending on their weight and activity level some adult females do well on as little as cups of food per day most puppies do better with smaller daily servings your breeder should tell you how often how much they were feeding when you pick up your puppy if you want more information on dalmations you can go to these sites that are really helpful http www ehow com how care dalmatian html http www ehow com tips html http www dogpage us dalmatian htm http www dog names org uk dalmatian htm http dogs puppies dogs central com dalmatian puppy http www canismajor com dog dal html Fancy rat Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Menstrual cup Halitosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Dairy Tofu Veganism Dalmatian Food Soap Pet skunk Havanese Gas metal arc welding Stomach cancer Insulin Vegetarianism Labrador Retriever Tooth Strap-on dildo Sewage treatment Shampoo Milk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Hot dog Textile manufacturing Manicure Tire Anopheles Chicken Coeliac disease Hiking XML Acne Keeshond Mattress Garfield Radiation therapy Comanche Crohn's disease Mosquito Diabetes mellitus Customs and etiquette of Japan Cannabis cultivation Dialysis Cancer Mixed-breed dog Tattoo Physical attractiveness Housebreaking Tick Basset Hound Tarantula Kosher foods Dog training Anorexia nervosa Equine conformation Bong Agriculture Carburetor Organic farming Peanut Ferret Hypoglycemia Diving Hair Violin First aid American Eskimo Dog Biodiesel Nuclear power Egg (food) Diseases of the honeybee Brewery Infantilism Dog agility Sauna Animal testing Certified Nursing Assistant
