help a friend well see i have this friend who has this horse and she is leaving for college soon in providence but she lives in michigan and there is no way that she can aford to take her horse with her to keep her in the stables near her school i was wondering if anyone knew where she could get a sponser to pay for her to take her horse with her if she can't afford it herself and has no friends or relatives able and or willing to pay the next place would be an animal advocacy organization i'd stat with the aspca they probably don't have funds allotted that way but they know the names of any who do it's probably unrealistic for her to find a sponsor to pay all costs so she should begin looking for a new home for the horse ideally someone who'd let her visit horses are looked upon as luxuries so unless your friend or her horse have done something like participate in a rescue it's going to be difficult maybe she could find someone to board the horse at cost then at least he'd be hers when she came home for vacations ASPCA Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Escape of Charles II Swedish allotment system Education in the People's Republic of China Microeconomics U.S. 1st Cavalry Division Social Security (United States) Amtrak The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Socrates Pension Food Stamp Program John McDouall Stuart Education in Japan University of Michigan Baron Munchhausen Cryonics Supply and demand Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Wyatt Earp Open access Education in England Education in the United States Housing cooperative Professor Medicare (Canada) One Tree Hill (TV series) Medicare (United States) Tourism Pitaten Firefighter Public transport Salad Fingers Legal aid Rosa Parks Citigroup Horse gait Roush Racing The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Students' union Ferrari Horse Tram Economy of Africa Evidence of evolution Student loan Public education Amway Neopets Board of Cooperative Educational Services Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Chariot racing The New School at West Heath No Child Left Behind Act Walt Disney Minimum wage Education in Australia Avenue Q World Vision Organic farming School choice Carl G.
