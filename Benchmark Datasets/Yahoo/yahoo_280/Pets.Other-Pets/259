is it weird to feed my neighbors cat i just moved into a new apartment building and also just lost my second cat garfield there are a few cats roaming the block and i have fed them in the past and now i wonder if its appropriate to do so is it like baiting other peoples pets to hang out with me hi i dont mean to sound horrible but i think if you know that these cats are already well looked after you shouldnt be feeding these cats if its a stray then why not but otherwise i just think its unfair to the owner for years i've lost cats to my neighbours who feed them and you see your cat sitting inside their house and it feels like you have done something wrong cats wander thats what they do give them a cuddle thats cool but dont feed it so it knows where its real home is if your missing the company of a cat why not get a new one of your own i think your right it is a bit like baiting other peoples pets to hang out with you Garfield Cat RuneScape quests Feral cat Dog Fancy rat Azumanga Daioh Pet skunk Teacher's Pet (Disney) W.I.T.C.H.
