i want to breed a real racoons where can i get one i want to breed a racoons but i don't know where i can buy it or get it i living in orange county placentia and how much is it thanks a lot pshhhh well first of all racoons are pretty damn agressive well when it's season to catch them in cages we do and set them free far from away from our house because they like to kill our outdoor cats we also had a baby and when it got older it turned on us and bit us and trust me its worst then getting bit by a dog so we had to put him to sleep they are the meaniest animals that i know worse than a dog and also they can have rabies since it's common in them so i suggest you get a new hobby since you dont even have a racoon yet to know what they are like and if you do get one i garentee the first few days you'll be saying jeez i wish i never had one Rabies Ferret Cat Dog Puma Housebreaking Pet skunk Livestock Fox hunting Domestic rabbit Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vampire Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Family Guy RuneScape quests AFI 100 Years series Bat EastEnders Lion Fancy rat Garfield Spotted Skunk Gray Wolf The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Griffon Bruxellois Abraham Goldfaden Greyhound Animal Liberation Front The Ashlee Simpson Show Civet Canary German Shepherd Dog Boston Public Trailer Park Boys First aid Skinny Puppy Border Terrier Atomic Kitten Spot the Dog Shaggy dog story Rocko's Modern Life Pekingese Iditarod Characters in the Smurfs Selective breeding Knots Landing Monster Rancher monsters Friends Breed standard Flea The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Jennifer Lopez Jam (TV series) Milton H.
