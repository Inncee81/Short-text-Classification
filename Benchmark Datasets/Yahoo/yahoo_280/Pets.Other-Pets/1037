how do i care for a bunny i live in new your and i am thinking a getting a bunny but really don't know what they eat what kinda cage i need i am thinking of getting a mini lop or an angora bunny but i don't know anything about them please tell me a list of what they need of a good cage i'm thinking of getting it by a breeder but i don't know any please tell me some o angoras take a lot of work they have a lot of fur that needs to be brushed everyday to prevent tangles they also get a lot bigger therefore needing a bigger cage mini lops are cute and make great pets also if you are not set on one of those two the mini rex and netherland drawf are great pets the mini rex has fur like velvet and the netherland drawf is one of the smallest rabbits they weigh around pounds where you live plays a big role in which kind you should get if you live in an apartment i would go with a mini or drawf rabbit if you live in an apartment you would need a cage if you have a yard you could buy or build a hutch if you have a yard then you could get a bigger rabbit make sure to feed your rabbit a steady pellet diet but you also need to feed it vegetables to keep it healthy some rabbits like the salt blocks that you can get at a pet store my suggestion on where to get the rabbit is from an ad in either a vet's office pet store or in the paper breeders often charge a lot for their rabbits and they are often show material i am guessing you just want a pet pet shops are good too as long as they are clean ask a lot of questions to be sure that they are knowledgeable of their animals as for a cage you can either get a cage or a hutch if you get a cage you need to clean out the litter pan everyday and the cage about twice a week if you get a hutch it doesn't need much cleaning only once or twice a month a good cage has lots of room for your rabbit to move around you can put toys in it such as bells balls and toliet paper tubes put a corner litter pan in the cage and fill it with aspen shavings the rabbit will litter train itself rabbits are really smart animals and you can train them and teach them to walk on a rabbit halter i would definately recommend getting one i have four and love them to death if you need anymore help just email me i love to teach people about rabbits Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Rabbit Dog European Rabbit Cat Garfield Chinchilla Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Friends Keeshond Trapping Livestock Blood on the Tracks Labrador Retriever Shotgun Upholstery People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Kodocha Textile manufacturing SpongeBob SquarePants Havanese RuneScape quests Domestic goat Dog training Maine Coon Dobermann Tyrannosaurus rex Canary Bugs Bunny Plastic Humphrey Bogart Ai Yori Aoshi Internet phenomenon Sluggy Freelance Professional wrestling match types Japanese tea ceremony Tiny Toon Adventures Pekingese One Piece minor characters Wal-Mart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toy Story 2 Tooth MapleStory Clothing Happy Tree Friends Password Social rule Docking Weight training Poodle Cro EastEnders Little Britain Babe Ruth Chicken Pet Care Bears House Mouse Sesame Street Who Framed Roger Rabbit Veganism Theory of conduct Chihuahua (dog) Hunting Tiger Monkey Wheel of Fortune Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Inside John Cage Mealy Parrot House Mel Blanc Pet store Animal rights Textile manufacturing terminology Mid-levels Russian joke The Velvet Underground Brandy and Mr. Whiskers Meat Loaf Equine conformation Discus (fish)
