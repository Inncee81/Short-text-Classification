what is the best product to kill fleas in my house i have tried so many different home remedies and store bought products in the past week and honestly they have gotten even worse since i treated my house i am debating whether to get a teminator to come kill them or buy a product and do it myself i want to go with the cheapest most effective method the cheapest terminator i found was for two sprays if you list any products please tell me if you have used them the price and how effective they are thanks i keep my house really clean so i know it has nothing to do with being dirty but i talked to a terminator he said you can go back into the house after min not hours first and foremost you must treat your pet with advantage do not use the kind you can buy in the store they are a waste of money once you have done that you can try a few things to get rid of the fleas in the house try sprinkling borax powder on the rug and then vacuuming it up borax is in the laundry aisle of the food store keep your pet out of the room till you are done and there is no borax on the rug use raid flea killer spray it's like a regular bug spray you can do that aim it at the rug spray well and then vacuum make sure your pet is out of the house or at least out of the room for this you can use a bug bomb not balm that is something else entirely these bombs can be bought at walmart or wherever you must follow the directions carefully put away any food or dishes and make sure any pets are out of the house depending on the size of the room in question you may want to set off bug bombs you set up the bombs according to the instructions set them off and then immediately leave the house for at least a few hours the container will tell you how long when you come back in open windows and vacuum again to get up any dead or partially living fleas you need to get rid of the vacuum bag after this remember that there is a whole life cycle for fleas and you may get some eggs hatching after the treatment is done but it shouldn't be as bad as now and without a host to live on your pet they can't survive repeat the vacuuming and spray if necessary but you shouldn't need to bomb the house again your pet will stay flea free for at least a month with advantage it's not cheap but it works during the winter months you can skip the advantage or just keep an eye out for any fleas you will find that you can let it go or months without reapplying if it's winter time Flea Dairy Bedbug Diseases of the honeybee Theory of conduct Hamster Solar power Linked list Dog training Upholstery Shaggy dog story Wal-Mart Hydrogen peroxide Malaria Computer virus Bulk vending Autonomous building IBM PC compatible Fancy rat Vacuum cleaner Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Textile manufacturing Sin City Menstrual cup Vacuum tube Pet skunk RuneScape quests Quake III Arena The Shining (film) RuneScape cheats Printed circuit board Neopets The Dalek Invasion of Earth Casting Transistor Biological pest control Poker jargon Xenomorph Bread MMORPG Spidey Super Stories Sea-Monkey Sears Holdings Corporation Special Air Service Mosquito Fire fighting Password Colony in Space Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Thermal power station Animal Liberation Front Tlingit Menstrual cycle Weed control Stomach cancer Common cold Columbine High School massacre Domestic rabbit Instant coffee Coffee Conker's Bad Fur Day Toilet humour Explosive material Cochineal Kakapo Duke Nukem 3D Cat Gypsy moth Gross domestic product Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Chicken Red Hot Chili Peppers Tesco Recipe James Hanratty Target Corporation Carpet Toyota Prius Clothing Organic food Two-stroke cycle Strap-on dildo Rule of St Benedict Scientology beliefs and practices Animal Crossing Kitchen Theodore Kaczynski Transformer Wealth Dialysis Central processing unit Canary
