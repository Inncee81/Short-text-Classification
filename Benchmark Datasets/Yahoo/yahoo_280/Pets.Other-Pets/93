calm a horse down on the trail i'm a reasonably experienced rider riding for about yrs and recently i've started riding at this place that does trail rides and lets me come and take horses out on the trailes on my own the horses are pretty responsive on their own except when we get fairly close to home the horse starts to get excitable wanting to gallop home and start prancing it's hard for me to get them to just relax and not gallop home because if i relax in the saddle they start to run and i don't want to be constantly pulling on the reins or have really close contact it's western and circling only seems to distract them momentarily are there any tricks i can use to get them to be much calmer on the way home our rides usually last about an hour and we gallop canter part of the way home then start to walk for a bit but once we get really close the problems start to arise i'm only out on the trails with them so i don't really have acess to an arena to work with them before hand running home to be fed to see barn pals or just to be done is a horrible habit that many public trail horses seem to have quite frankly it's irritating green riders often let horses get away with such things for fear of correcting them or because it's fun to race back to the barn unfortunately unless you are the only person riding this horse i wouldn't expect this issue to resolve quickly if you are the only person riding this horse then i can offer some advice on how to fix this horse's nasty habit it can be very upsetting to deal with an excitable hot horse you try to pull and they fight it you try to slow them down and they prance in place in the back of your mind you know you should relax but you are nervous too start with the simplest thing to fix no cantering or galloping home as soon as you start back to the barn even if it's a hour away no running that said lope your little heart out once you are a good distance away from the barn on the first stretch of your ride try to really spend your horse's energy before you even turn around to come home now i said lope for a reason when you are trail riding one fun gallop up a hill is acceptable but tons of galloping and cantering up and down and around causes your horse's brain to go out the window all a hot horse wants to do is run run run so don't let him lope a lot trot walk second problem the horse's familiarity with the trip home this horse clearly knows what's going to happen because you are obviously very routine about it you canter part way home then you walk because you don't want to sprint for the barn your horse thinks okay we're starting to walk i'll be able to see the barn in minutes yesssss find a new way home even if you have to weave in and out of trees find a new way home now even with a new path home the horse may still bounce up and down with excitement at the sight of the barn when this happens stop the horse turn around and head for the hills do not reward your horse by riding to the barn you can both quietly walk to the barn or you can go back to the trails once the horse calms down turn back towards the barn if the horse gets jumpy again stop back up and turn around this will certainly become a mind game for the both of you you cannot overpower a horse but you can win the mental battle hopefully your horse will give in and walk to the barn don't let him when your horse is willing to approach the barn at a walk find a place to trot and lope some round pen sized circles work the horse as if he were on the arena flat circle to the left and to the right for minutes each way then once again turn the horse back towards the trail walk him away from the barn for about minutes dismount and lead him to the barn to break this habit you will need to be very patient never get off at the same place two days in a row and always dismount with the horse facing away from the barn don't run on the way back to the barn and don't give in hope this helps best luck Milton H.
