what are the chances of not smelling a wild skunk before you see it last night my mother and i ran across a live skunk on the side of the road we didn't smell a thing my worry is that it was someone's pet as skunks are legal with permit where i live thyat has gotten lose or was dumped what's the likelyhood of not smelling a wild scented skunk that's literaly two feet from your feet if the answer is slim i plan to go looking for it tonight and attempt to catch it as skunks are awesome animals and i don't want anything bad to happen to it okay then the captu re idea was simply on the thought that it may have been a pet i would never take in a healthy and capable wild animal if hurt yes but only until i could find out where to bring it who to call for help thanks for the answers unless you startled it or it felt defensive the skunk would not necessarily assume a defensive posture and spray i often see wild skunks in our area but unless one is afraid feels threatened or is injured they generally are content to go about their merry way i would not suggest that you attempt to catch it or any other wild animal as they are not domesticated animals and can carry diseases such as rabies if you decide to do so anyway you might wish to inquire here beforehand as to how to remove skunk musk Skunk Pet skunk Rabies Dog Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat Guinea pig Bat Bradley Nowell The Shining (film) American Black Bear Poker jargon Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Domestic rabbit Friends Fox hunting Gray Wolf Tasmanian Devil Kevin and Kell AFI 100 Years series Goodness and value theory Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Animal communication The Critic Joke Trademark Milton H.
