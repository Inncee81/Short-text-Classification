why is my cat so distant my cat doesnt like it when i hold it or wana pat it it scrathes me and when i let it go it starts licking its fur as if i made it dirty or something and it hurts my feelings does my cat hate me or am i doing something wrong not all cats like it when their owners pick them up or pet them at times it's common that cats lick their fur after you put them down ours do that if you have been aggressive towards your cat in any way as in hitting him her for punishment that will cause your cat to get skittesh around you and not want you to pet them if this is what's going on you will have to leave your cat alone for a while and let your cat come to you for affection when he she is ready it will take a while to regain trust in your relationship and you may never regain your cats trust if this is the case that is my mom's cat sarah is a 'pissy kitty' ever since we got pebbles she became hateful she doesn't like anyone to pet her or love on her or pick her up only my mom can do it and it's not very often i think it's a territorial thing and she just got mad at us getting a new kitty and stayed mad lol she's up there in age though too so it could be just crankiness i hope this helps i know it feels awful when your pet doesn't make you feel loved but hang in there she he could be just moody or i just reread your question and noticed you put that your cat scratches you when you put her down sometimes that could mean that your kitty has arthritis and it hurts when you touch in certain spots sarah my mom's cat has arthritis and it hurts her at times if your kitty is up there in age it could be that if your cat has arthritis or you suspect it take your cat to the vet so that they can give your cat some meds that will ease the pain then you just might see a loving kitty again Cat Garfield EastEnders Kodocha Guinea pig Teacher's Pet (Disney) Badly Drawn Kitties Ferret Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Random Harvest Pet skunk Knots Landing Days of our Lives Rent (musical) Eric Cartman Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Kim Possible Dog Rabies Recurring South Park characters Poker jargon Ranma __ characters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ren and Stimpy RuneScape quests Social rule Domestic rabbit Dog training Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Tag Housebreaking Revolutionary Girl Utena Theory of conduct Girly The Fairly OddParents Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Something Awful Rocko's Modern Life Atomic Kitten Dead Like Me Capital punishment Okashina Okashi Phoebe Buffay's songs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fruits Basket Great Teacher Onizuka Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yoko Ono Blood on the Tracks Hip hop rivalries Phoebe Halliwell Ron Weasley Zoophilia Mutts Phoebe Buffay Equine conformation The Death Gate Cycle One Tree Hill (TV series) Ed, Edd n Eddy Rheumatoid arthritis Trailer Park Boys Little Britain Past teachings of Prem Rawat Serial killer Catscratch Osteoarthritis Animal rights Fancy Crane Sin City Charmed Pok__mon Live!
