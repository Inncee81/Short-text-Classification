how come there are so many people in this q a that can not take constructive critism when some one asks a controversial question then attacks an answers credibility or doesnt like a answer he gets why do they become so offended they delete or block someone people of the world dont ask if you dont want to hear it get some cahonies sheeh you jnow yhis is directed at heart of glass but open for disscusion from anyone sunshine i said constructive not rude critism and i was answering a very controversial question to being with i was not rude in the begining i only became more mater of fact in my additions because he was attacking me in the additional info but if you read most of the answers in this one are people out there trying to stop the dog meat and fur trade and puppy mills i am not alone in this view though he didnt like it i dont mind being told if i am rude what i dont like is that i am reported for abuse when there wasnt any to being with also if you look to my profile you can see that half the questions i answer become best answer i dont vote for myself and i dont beg people to vote for me if you see the ones i dont win on its becauce i am telling them they are wrong and they dont like it i can take people who dont like me though this is my first abuse report in a thousand questions and wow i am not taking that well some people are used to answerers who suck up to them for points and when they hear the truth once in a while they can't believe that someone dares to be that brutal and honest i for one believe in constructive criticism but it is a sad fact that it takes some intelligence to be able to recognise it for what is is and it takes more intelligence to be able to do something with it instead of getting all indignant i do not support criticism and sarcasm in cases where people need some serious advice or answers but there is a thin line between constructive and destructive criticism and it takes a little insight to see it and it is even worse to go blocking people for no reason i wish there was a way to get rid of that i often catch myself thinking 'now you are on dangerous ground rather go to a different question' when i have some constructive criticism or an honest answer for someone you are absolutely right some people can't take it then maybe they should add the words sensitive to criticism only liars and kissers please with their questions Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Plame affair Discordianism Philosophical skepticism Downing Street memo Avenue Q Sydney Riot of 1879 Cult Ethics John R.
