what type of pet should i get click here please i was thinking about getting a dwarft bunny but then i changed my mind and i thought about getting a skinny pig i already have turtles cat and dog give me a estimate of how much everything would be if i got a bunny or a skinny pig thanks for your help i don't suggest you get a guinea pig or a dwarf rabbit to your cat and dog they pose as live food and will try to attack it if you must keep it out of reach but the scent of a predator in the house may scare them or stress it if your dog and cat is fine with prey animal then feel free to expose it to them always supervise but generally they don't do that especially dogs cats are better with rabbits but not dwarf rabbits dwarf rabbits are the same size as guinea pigs and will still look like live prey to them the cost isn't necessarily low either for all supplies i would say everything toys cage clean up litter food etc will cost up to dollars or more Domestic rabbit Dog Hamster Cat Ferret Guinea pig Rabbit Pet Bugs Bunny Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Fox hunting Fancy rat Coprophagia Pig Who Framed Roger Rabbit Island Fox Brown Bear Taikyoku shogi Tyrannosaurus rex Invader Zim European Rabbit Hunting Domestication Animal communication Livestock Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Pet skunk Housebreaking Lion Meat KaBlam!
