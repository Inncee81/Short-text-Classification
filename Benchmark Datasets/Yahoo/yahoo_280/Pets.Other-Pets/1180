hey a quick question i bought my horse from an auction house but not during an actual auction no one was there but the manager of the horses the horse i bought after a trot before he goes into a canter my guy sort of hops and and then slows back to a walk ok here is my actual question do western pleasure horses have lead changes or problems starting off on the wrong lead heres something else i learned after i bought him apparently he was an some kind of english competior i think your new horse is doing flying changes and he is doing them incompletely which is part of the reason he keeps dropping back to the walk instead of moving up into the canter like he should i think that when he starts off he changes leads in the front from habit but doesn't change behind which is why he appears to hop as you put it you are going to have to be very patient if you want to get past this situation and very definite with your aids when you want to canter so that he isn't tempted to keep dropping out of the gait before you ask for a canter make sure that your horse is on your aids and listening to you and that you are in or approaching a corner of the arena it's easier for horses to strike off correctly if they are moving through a corner because it helps both them and you to position the horse's head and body correctly when i ask my mare justice to canter i use my outside leg behind the girth and my inside leg at the girth i use my hands to position her head slightly to the inside of the circle and squeeze strongly with my outside leg justice has a tendency to race up into the canter at times so i make sure that i am very definite about signalling her so that she actually canters and doesn't just speed up at the trot sitting up straight and looking where i am going also helps try not to stare at your horse's ears this will throw your balance and his balance off some his ears aren't going anywhere another thing that i found that is useful is if i limit the time i canter to only about half the length of the arena at least at first once the horse is cantering you need to continue to support him by keeping your legs on him if you relax them too much he will drop back to the trot that's what happens with justice if i don't keep my legs on her work on the transitions up and down until you and your horse are comfortable with them and be patient because it will take time for him to understand that you want him to canter immediately and not change leads right away as he does he needs to learn to stay on one lead for a consistent period hence the reason for doing this in short spurts until he gets the hang of things and to change only when he changes direction or you ask him to do this the first few times you ask this way your horse is going to be like what does she want this is a mighty strange thing to ask me or i don't know what she wants so i will try it my own way just be patient and keep asking and supporting him eventually he will figure it out as for your question about lead changes in western riding the only place i can think of where this is expected is in the sport of reining for obvious reasons pleasure horses usually don't do flying lead changes because that is something which is not typically expected of a pleasure horse they are expected to be on the correct lead when asked to canter however and to remain on it until they are asked to stop or slow down by the rider try the method i mentioned above it works for me good luck i hope this helps Horse tack Fast bowling Swingout Milton H.
