pet owners with questions about sick dogs or cats i wonder why is it that a lot people would rather ask whats wrong with their pet online then call their vet as soon as they realize something is wrong why is it that no one seems to utilize their vets as soon as i sence something is wrong with my two dogs the first thing i do is call my vet and explain to them whats going on why would i care and more then that wait for random people who are not vets to answer my questions is it jsut me who is wondering that i mean if you were having a heart attack would you wait and post a question online and see who answers or would you call what i think is the best phone calls are fairly inexpensive and they dont charge for that i mean i call my vet first thing if i suspect something and may be i am just lucky to have a vet who is very willing to give up information and really never said i should come in unless he felt it was absolutelly important i mean just call the vet bekka sorry to say that but i would rather hear smth from a dumb vet with education then a smart person who knows nothing about being a vet and also you are not glued to your vet find a new one a lot of people have wondered this including myself i'm not sure why some post questions that should be answered by a vet i guess they are seeking validation that calling the vet is the right thing to do i always hope that maybe they have called the vet and are waiting for an answer or return call this morning i noticed that my dog was bleeding i took her to the emergency vet immediately didn't even think of asking why online but i've had pets before so maybe it is just experience or possibly common sense anyway my dog is fine urinary tract infection and i was able to get meds for her Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Password Guinea pig Ferret Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rabies Garfield Killian documents Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Cat Kim Possible Time Out of Mind Hip hop rivalries Past teachings of Prem Rawat Rent (musical) Philosophy of language Microchip implant (animal) Medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Plame affair timeline Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Plame affair Dog Goodness and value theory Beetle in an Anthill Winter Soldier Investigation Joke Crossword The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Veterinarian Religious Society of Friends The Fairly OddParents Calvin and Hobbes Infantilism The Inside Prostate cancer Swift Vets and POWs for Truth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Fancy rat Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Current teachings of Prem Rawat Dilbert Piccolo Junior Saga Coming of Age (TNG episode) Strategic management Sexual orientation Oh My Goddess!
