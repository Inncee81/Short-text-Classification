problem with larger tarantulas i can't seem to get my larger tarantulas' inches abdomens bigger in other words my tarantulas look unhealthy because their abdomens are too small for there size i have tried feeding more crickets feeding wax worms to fatten up larger waterdishes keeping the substrate more moist raising the humidity levels i can not feed them roaches or another large insect because they don't sell them around here just crickets what can i do to make their abdomens larger like other people's spiders beef up what you feed to the tarantulas what goes in those insects will eventually go in your tarantula after all you can look up the diets of the insects you feed using wikipedia org or google crickets are omnivores and will enjoy a variety of foods they love dog food cut grapes lettuce very small scraps of meat etc you can also purchase cricket food there is a brand called flukers buy it at petsmart or petco flukers also has special gelatinized water for feeder insects it's so they won't drown i know all this because i own two treefrogs and their main diet is crickets my white's treefrog when he gets big enough could even eat a small pinkie both frogs like minnows as well i used to work at petsmart read extensively and volunteer at the dallas zoo please don't think me arrogant i just want you to know that i know what i'm talking about in addition many larger tarantulas will eat pinkie mice and possibly small fish like a guppy or a minnow if availabe anywhere you can also feed them very young baby birds use domesticated ones that still have their yolk sac the yolk will fatten up the spider hopefully and will likely add a healthy sheen to the spiders' hairs Chicken Spider Hamster Egg (food) Veganism Guinea pig Taboo food and drink Vermicompost Frog Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Coconut crab Kosher foods Animal Biological pest control Salmon Hamburger Domestication Insect Omega-3 fatty acid Pig Carnivore Grasshopper Krill Cat Ant Roman eating and drinking Carnivorous plant Mosquito Agriculture Aztec Kashrut Moult Fauna of Australia Garfield Foie gras Tasmanian Devil Hot dog Cantonese cuisine Fancy rat Hedgehog Discus (fish) Cannibalism Beef Platypus Jewish cuisine Cockroach Healthy eating Stomach cancer Chlorophyta Double bass Banana Bee Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fish farming Cochineal Dog Unclean animals Acorn Squirrel Fish and chips Bird McDonald's Seabird Gypsy moth Korean cuisine Shark Dairy Tarantula hawk German cuisine Pet skunk Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Food preservation Sea-Monkey Environmental vegetarianism Sea star Cuisine of Denmark Cattle Antarctic krill Organic farming Bat Pet Milk FoxTrot Hunting Sexual dimorphism Food Dieting Ramen
