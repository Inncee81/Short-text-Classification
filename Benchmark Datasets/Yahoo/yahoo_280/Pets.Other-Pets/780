i am moving the pasture for my horses is part in the woods will the ferns hurt them i looked at the land i will have to use for pasture it can be cleared i want to leave a lot of trees because of heat but there are lots of ferns i plan to feed lots of hay as there is lots of sand in sc and grass does not like to grow but if they forage will the ferns hurt them some ferns are very poisonous to horses so yes i would consider fencing the wooded area off and not allowing the horses in there also because your soil is so sandy you need to start your horses on a regular regimen of sand clear once a month or so this will prevent the sand from accumulating in the horses' intestines and possibly causing a life threatening colic l live in central delaware and a few years ago my sister almost lost one of her prized geldings to colic caused by sand so take a lesson from what we went through with him he had to have surgery to remove the sand and was out of action for months afterwards if we had known about the relationship between sand and colic we would have been doing this all along and might have been able to prevent the colic we learned the hard way which is why i am warning you about this good luck with your move and i hope this helps Horse colic Breastfeeding Deforestation Laminitis Weed control John Forrest, 1st Baron Forrest of Bunbury Prosopis cineraria Hay Livestock Equine conformation Desertification New Forest Pitaten Opportunity rover Golf Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Desert Dune Days of our Lives Lawn Plant Agriculture Rooibos Geology of the Grand Canyon area Horse Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Hamster Tenshinhan Kidney stone Derbyshire lead mining history Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Fire fighting Gypsy moth Woodworking Fern Naruto geography Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Florida Keys Milk Cider Wildfire Stomach cancer Elis Prefecture Kakapo Sorghum Glossary of wildland fire terms Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Palouse Scientology beliefs and practices Lead poisoning Akatsuki (Naruto) Geography of Chile Alfalfa Diseases of the honeybee Eldfell Erosion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drill bit Shifting cultivation Flood geology Piccolo Junior Saga Crazy Horse Barbed wire Hern__n Cort__s Garth Brooks Flowering plant Goldenrod Fencing W.I.T.C.H.
