horse show colors i am looking into showing a brown and white pinto pony next year in western and i was wondering what main color i should wear i am looking forward to doing halter showmanship pleasure veratility and trail next year this is also my first year showing and i am really really nervous about it are there any pointers on how to keep my cool in the ring the color i had in mind was turquoise but i am having second thoughts on that i think a great idea is to see if you can hold mock shows at your barn maybe invite a bunch of kids and their parents that way there's other competitors and there's a bit of an audience too have your trainer or a volunteer act as a judge and run the gamut of classes you and your peers are primarily interested in a big part of my nervousness in the ring stems from being the sole person in the ring at one time with all eyes on me so to speak i think if you've got the opportunity to be in that situation beforehand and enable yourself to overlook it and relax with a bunch of people watching you perform then you'll be less nervous and keep your cool also the more shows you attend the better you'll feel about entering the ring as far as colors are concerned i think the following colors would go well with a brown and white pinto maroon bright red hunter green purple depending on whether or not its a gelding or mare of course navy blue bright blue Horse Color Horse show Arabian horse Dragon Booster Milton H.
