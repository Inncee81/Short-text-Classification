animal lovers please click here hi i only got one anwser te last time i asked this i was thinking about getting a skinny pig but i want to know how much it would all cost for the skinny pig bedding food cage etc it would be so nice if you helped me thanks a decent cage will cost at least i would say for it to have enough room to move around then there's the accesories like a water bottle food dish food dollars bedding for a large pack they'll also need a nice cozy igloo or something to cozy up in since they're bald and need to use more energy to keep warm as far as the cost of a skinny pig i'm not too sure they don't ever really sell them around here surprising since the guy that started the mutation for them was from here in rochester ny but the few i have seen were around it might be cheaper if you have more of them in your area i also know they usually go through food and water faster than a regular guinea pig since they use a little more energy to maintain body temp and that some because of the mutation that causes the baldness being produced initially from being inbred have lower immune system and are prone to respiratory infections but alot of people have been working to breed healthier pigs Hamster Obesity Fancy rat Chinchilla Dog Cat Vitamin C Nutrition Taboo food and drink Domestication Fugu Chicken Brewery Livestock Fish farming Equine conformation Baldness Milk Animal testing Extinction Factory farming Thermoregulation Kitchen Ecology Common cold House Mouse Gray Wolf Warm-blooded The Apprentice 2 Energy H5N1 Ramen Solar power Veganism Breastfeeding Energy development Care Bears Influenza Dairy Hydrogen economy Pig (zodiac) Hiking Autonomous building Anorexia nervosa Future energy development Iron Island Fox Semen Sewage treatment Cancer Apple Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rat Bon Jovi Pneumonia AIDS Bovine spongiform encephalopathy DDT Little Britain Pork Piccolo Junior Saga Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Spider Peruvian cuisine Malaria Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lisa the Vegetarian Tsunami Cheetah Vermicompost Tea Galactic Civilizations Agriculture in Australia Nuclear power Hybrid vehicle Tsetse fly Mattress Sugar Antigenic shift Swimming International response to Hurricane Katrina Team Fortress Classic Pebble bed reactor Domesticated turkey Insulin Labrador Retriever Industrial engineering Foodborne illness Shaggy dog story Discus (fish) Blood Chlorophyta Tooth enamel Cystic fibrosis Poliomyelitis Dobermann
