how would i be able to persuade my parents to let me have a rat i adore animals and recently had two hamsters which sadly passed away recently i know by wanting another pet im just not going to forget them because ill always love them and remember them its not like one after another i just hope to give animals a good life i told my parents this and they still said no i found out information on them they still said no they said they are too much hassle when we go away and the cats could get them i have female and male the male doesnt interest in other pets the female however loves to hunt and once caught one of my hamsters but me and my mum saved him however shortly after this i started closing the door to my bedroom at all times she could not get in isnt that all responsible however the thing with going away and the cats is still the main reason to not get a rat which btw has legswhich makes it even cuter and want to give it a good life anyway its impossible any ideas i would really appriaciate it it's great that you want to give animals a good home when you go away if you want to make sure that your cats don't get them you could bring your rat to somebody's house instead of them coming to the house they might leave your door open or let your cat get in keep taking care of your cats responsibly and don't beg constantly about getting a rat and your parents might decide that you are responsible enough to get one you can tell them that you took good care of your hamsters if this doesn't work find out why they don't want you to get one ask them if it is just because they are hassle when you leave or there are other reasons i hope this helps and i hope you get the rat Hamster Social rule Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Friends Aladdin (1992 film) Garfield Miss Saigon Kodocha Avenue Q My Parents are Aliens Fancy rat Shaggy dog story The Secret of NIMH Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Animal communication Theory of conduct Pet The Young Ones (TV series) Sin City Jon Secada Ferret Phoebe Halliwell House Mouse Coming of Age (TNG episode) Transactional analysis Ron Weasley EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tenchi Muyo!
