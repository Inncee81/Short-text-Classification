is for a llama a good deal i saw an ad on dreamhorse the other day and it was for a gelding llama is this a good deal it could be a very good deal but more likely it's a big headache generally with llamas you can bet that if it's cheap it is either very old completely unhandled or has some major behavioral problems males in particular can have behavior problems that make them unmanagable and dangerous a good price for a good gelding is a show quality gelding or one that is thoroughly trained will run quite a bit higher training can include many different things but at the very least the llama should be able to be caught haltered lead without too much fuss it should be able to be vetted have it's feet picked up for toenail trimming and be sheared without having to be tranquilized more extensively trained llamas will be trained to pack show do obstacles etc i would be very leary of a cheap llama they are easy to find but you will almost always end up with a whole lot more problems than you bargained for Equine conformation Horse tack Llama Paragliding The Sims 2 Poker jargon Plastic Dog training Camel Dog agility Draw poker Scientology beliefs and practices Code 46 Theory of conduct Fast bowling Paintball 1957 World Series Working animal Garfield Microeconomics Monty Python and the Holy Grail Kangaroo Pointer Contract Economics International Phonetic Alphabet Monty Hall problem Gambling Textile manufacturing Housebreaking 2000 Australian Grand Prix Texas hold 'em Blackjack Social rule Star Trek Customizable Card Game RuneScape economy Bicycle lighting Mountaineering RuneScape weapons Hydrogen economy Boston and Lowell Railroad Domestic rabbit Stud poker Sling (weapon) Betting (poker) Blood (computer game) Sheepshead CPU design Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hamster Alpaca Skateboarding trick Callus Camp Lazlo Surplus value Crime film Horse Illegal drug trade Let's Make a Deal Lama (genus) Ferret Intercolonial Railway of Canada Public good $ale of the Century Land use forecasting The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Spider Exception handling Halting problem Debugging Yugo Hash table Giffen good Wal-Mart Microchip implant (animal) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Inflation Motorcycle Digital audio broadcasting Might and Power USS Tunny (SS-282) Eventing Ecco the Dolphin Dynamic Systems Development Method Babe Ruth Extreme Programming Game show RuneScape Supply and demand Canasta Evidence of evolution Surveillance Gasoline Agriculture 2005 Iditarod Health insurance Procrastination German grammar Hubbert peak theory Arguments for and against drug prohibition
