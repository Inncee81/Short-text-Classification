is this summer job ok ok my parents have their own buisness at an animal shelter and this summer and the next summer they want me to work for them i have to clean feed animals bath them and let them out and stuff and they pay me a hour is that a good pay or not of course i mean if this is what suits you then yes i work in a shelter as well and i get an hour too none of my family members work there but the reason why i work there is because i love all animals and i love to learn about each one's personality everytime i look at an animal i'm always anxious to take care of it and learn more about it actually working with your parents is a very good thing you will be helping your parents and look on the bright side you'll be getting enough money some people won't prefer this job because some of them don't like animals or some just don't like the payment but as i said i get an hour and i love all the animals i work with at the shelter my mom is the one who convinced me to work in a shelter because she wanted me to learn the word 'responsibilty ' it also depends on how old you are if you are under years old i think this job will be perfect for you you shouldn't get a job that's too tough for you if you're years old or younger because you don't need so much money at that age cleaning feeding and bathing animals helps you with responsibility and is good enough Great Teacher Onizuka Social rule Care Bears Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Hamster Customs and etiquette of Japan Moral Politics Pet skunk Shaggy dog story Sento Pitaten Education in the United States Scouting Wal-Mart Lorelai Gilmore Free trade Unemployment benefit Sant Thakar Singh Education in the People's Republic of China Charmed Education in Germany Freeters Economic inequality Sweatshop Life insurance The Adventures of Pete & Pete Everwood Altruism Fruits Basket Microeconomics Domestic rabbit Dairy Health insurance Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tax avoidance/evasion Adoption Transsexuality Friends Hearing impairment The Apprentice 2 Autism Supply and demand YuYu Hakusho Insurance Vladimir Peter Tytla Unemployment Team Rocket Knots Landing Human Theodicy S.H.E Money Leeds United F.C.
