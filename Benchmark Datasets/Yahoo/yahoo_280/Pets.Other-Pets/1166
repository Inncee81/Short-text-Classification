do you know something about join up method used to make friendship with horse i used to use the join up method a lot when i would help break my cousins horses it helps to have a decent sized round pen the just take the horse in the pen and start to chase it around the pen in circles the horse may kick or rear but as long as you are in the middle of the pen and the horse isnt actually trying to hurt you personally you should be ok while you are chasing the horse make sure you make eye contact it shows the horse that you are the boss and you arent scared of it sometimes you can put your arms in the air as well as a sign of dominance have the horse run around the pen about to times one way and the chase the horse in the other direction to show the horse that you have the power to make it go in the direction you want it to keep chasing it around untill you start to see signs that the horse is starting to trust you the first sign is the horse lowers its head as the horse does this you know its starting to understand whats going on make sure you still keep eye contact with the horse while it dropps its head the next sign is when the horse begins licking and chewing with its houth its sort of looks like the horse has a bit in its mouth and it doesnt like it make sure the horse does these signs a few times and then slow down and dont make eye contact any more to let the horse know you are its friend walk slowly toward the horse still not making eye contact dont walk too close to the horse but close enough and put your shoulder towards the horse and walk forward not looking back at the horse if you do it right the horse will follow you around the pen if not just keep redewing this process and the horse will soon trust you this is a great way to earn your horses trust and bond you can do this every day untill the horse follows you areound every where it really is an amazing process Swingout Equine conformation Tag Horse Dressage Teen Girl Squad Atomic Kitten Taikyoku shogi Professional wrestling throws Diving Social rule Horse gait Backstroke Dog training Sin City Contredanse Breaststroke Doom enemies Internal ballistics Butterfly stroke Horse tack Glossary of partner dance terms Lindy Basic Milton H.
