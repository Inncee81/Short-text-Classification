do you have any information on an animal sacrifice this weekend while at my husbands parents farm an incident happened with their horse thursday the horse was found trapped in their bob wire fence they got her out and started to treat her wounds and she seemed to be doing fine early saturday morning the horse was found dead in the pasture this may be a little gruesome so stop reading this now if you are squeamish when they found her they said her throat was slit and there was no blood in sight it seemed as though someone had drained the blood also her ear was cut off and so were her genital area the police were involved and took a full report but said there wasn t any evidence and i m sure not much will happen anyway we are assuming that this is cult related and may have been an animal sacrifice does anyone know who or what kind of people may want to do this i m hoping to find some information on what kind of people would do this thank you for all for your answers they are greatly appreciated this took place in ruston louisiana sorry i did not mention that before also my mother in law called one of the animal protection programs in that area i m not sure exactly who she called about the matter i m sure she will not rest until she finds someone to help catch the people who did this to her horse this saturday was also my sister in laws wedding so not only were we busy preparing for that but we were also dealing with this situation i mentioned to my mother in law that she should get the media involved so everyone in that area is on a look out to watch for their cattle and horse there has been an increase world wide in the number of animal mutilations that occur but it is not related to any cult it is the work of sick individuals who get their kicks from hurting defensless animals i hope that every one of them is caught and punished if they are doing this to animals they will do it to people once the thrill of hurting animals does not give them a big enough high Female genital cutting Sin City Cattle mutilation EastEnders Cindy Sheehan Captain Thunderbolt Sacrifice Capital punishment Theory of conduct Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Domestic violence Fox hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Animism Supernatural Milton H.
