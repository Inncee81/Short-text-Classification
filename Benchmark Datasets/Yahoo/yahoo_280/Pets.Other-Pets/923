how do you get a bat out of your house ahh there's one in my house and its downstairs so we can't shut it into a room we have the doors in the living room kitchen and one right near the dining room open our windows have screens that won't come out my dad was chasing it with a broom stick hit it really hard twice and it wouldn't go out our door and then it just attatched itself to one of our textured walls great it's in a place where we can't get to it my dad was throwing tootsie rolls lol at it to try to get it down but it just kind of curls up more how can we get it out we also have two dogs and cats although they're shut up in rooms for the time being so we can get the bat so we can't really just wait until morning while it's sleeping and scoop it up to outside the pets need out what do i do uh bc fan idk if you have cats but they'll chase anything that moves they have rabies shots but still well funny story we tried to knock him into a box but he landed behind the piano a very old cast iron filled piano impossible to move seriously we tried to get him out but we made it worse and kept pushing him farther back and every time my dad would try to kind of pull the little guy out he would kick and was chirping we thought he was badly injured and felt absolutey horrible i mean absolutely reallllllly horrible we were gonna wait until the next morning to get him out and end his misery if he wasn't better but then this morning my dad was watching the news and he came flying in lol then he started flying around the dining room my dad opened that door and then went to open another door and when he came back the bat was gone so chances are he left i guess bats are kind of like teenagers when they're asleep they don't want to wake up for anything and ya think theyre dead punk rock girl shut up you're not making anything better by criticizing one of the best ways to do this is to use a large sheet from your bed have one person hold one end and someone else hold the other the sheet will be a barracade and then just guide him to an open door sometimes they will attach themselves to the sheet which also works to wrap them up and get them outside the other way i've done this is to take a brown paper bag and put it over the bat while it's still move the bag a little and it will usually fly into the bag close it and then just open it outside and leave it good luck Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon The Catcher in the Rye Columbine High School massacre Russian joke The Brady Bunch Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Reservoir Dogs Professional wrestling match types Curling Blonde on Blonde The Phantom Manor Grandview, U.S.A.
