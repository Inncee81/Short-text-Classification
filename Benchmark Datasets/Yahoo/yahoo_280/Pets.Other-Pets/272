do farmers hate their animals well i was wondering if they do because i was watching this video from peta and it showed how animals get treated and some answers say that thats a commercial farm what does that mean and if their is no such thing i was wondering do all farmers beat their chickens with metal poles or barb zap their cows or do they appreciate their animals please i just dont get it whats the truth i don't trust peta i agree with some of the things they stand up for but sometimes they are way too over the top most farmers that i know who have their own personal farm treat their animals well the veterinarian i work for grew up on a farm and now she is a veterinarian and takes care of animals for a living if she didn't love and take care of the animals on her farm then she probably wouldn't have grown up to be a veterinarian Animal rights Dairy Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Agriculture Veterinarian Farmer Garfield Animal testing Chicken Pok__mon Live!
