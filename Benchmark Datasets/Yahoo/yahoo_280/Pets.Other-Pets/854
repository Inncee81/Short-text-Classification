how do you know a hamster has fleas i found a flea a couple weeks ago and killed it but i am not sure if it was a flea it might have been a gnat but now i see her scratching herself sometimes how can you tell if your hamster has fleas it would be unlikely for a hamster to get fleas since hamsters are usually strictly indoor pets however i'm sure it is possible for your hamster to get fleas from your other pets if you have dogs or cats that are primarily outdoor pets is she scratching herself a lot is this a new behavior or is she doing it more than normal if so she might have fleas take a close look and see if you see any on her skin but if she's the only pet you have and she doesn't go outside i would think it was highly unlikely that she would have fleas if you do find fleas on her though you might want to consult a veterinarian or small animal expert to find out how to treat it since most flea treatments on the market are intended for much bigger pets Hamster Cat Flea Pet skunk Ferret Domestic rabbit Bat Dog Pet Fancy rat Guinea pig Heartworm Flea market Microchip implant (animal) Bubonic plague Housebreaking Socialization Livestock Animal testing Garfield Veterinarian Pet store Greyhound Manx (cat) Rabies Chicken Phantom cat American Alligator Red Hot Chili Peppers Golden Hamster John Frusciante German Shepherd Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Leopard Puma Dilbert Dog collar Animal communication Chinchilla Dog training Internet phenomenon Cheetah Tuberculosis Hamtaro Tattoo Teacher's Pet (Disney) Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Dobermann Animal rights Cat food Siegfried & Roy Codename: Kids Next Door Sid Vicious Malignant melanoma Animal euthanasia Rat Minor Harry Potter Beasts Shampoo Tungiasis Monster Rancher monsters Tiger H5N1 Monkey Animal shelter Estrus cycle Mutts Kitten InuYasha 101 Dalmatians: The Series Mange Allergy Comparative psychology Exotic pet Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fur farming Raccoon Clothing Tiny Toon Adventures CatDog Aladdin (1992 film) Illegal drug trade Richard Chase Galaxy Angel Hello Kitty Keeshond Coprophagia Asthma Taboo food and drink The Hampster Dance Hair Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Kangaroo Pet Sematary The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Contredanse Carnivore Domestication Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder H2G2
