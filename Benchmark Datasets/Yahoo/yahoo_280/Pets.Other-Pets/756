if a man's best friend is a dog what is a woman's best friend we all know what a man's best friend is but i want to know what a woman's best friend is please help personally i think it's just a phrase in which when they use the term 'man ' a dog is both a man's and women's best friend silly it's just a saying and when they do say a dog is a man's best friend they mean to us humans in general long long time ago people would say a dog was a boy's best friend and that a cat was a women's best friend the reason for this was because a dog seemed like a man's pet because they used dogs in armies military firefighting police business and so forth people also thought a cat was a girl's best friend because cats are smooth independant and try not to get into trouble kind of pet and people thought that cats would fit into a girl's lifestyle as said from long time ago but this is not true anymore and it's just a saying for us Shaggy dog story Internet phenomenon Ren and Stimpy Ranma __ characters Girly Azumanga Daioh Dog Cliff Richard Tenchi Muyo!
