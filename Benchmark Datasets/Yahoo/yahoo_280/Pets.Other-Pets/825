do they sell mini lop or angora rabbits at pet stores now that i think about it i've never seen an angora or any kind of lop rabbits being sold at pet stores xd the ones i've seen are always uh gray or dwarfs dutch and some others with kinda short fur do you have to get lops or angoras from a breeder orrr no you can get the from lops from pet shops or unexperienced casual breeders too but i would never recommend it i recomend buying from a breeder who is actively showing their rabbits at arba sanctioned shows though that is a good way to go they will give you a health and temperament gaurantee as well as offer personal support for the lifetime of your rabbit which you may need more often than you think just look at all the rabbit questions on this website try your local shelter too but you won't get the support that you would from a breeder Rabbit Guinea pig Dog European Rabbit Hamster Angora rabbit Cat Pet skunk Labrador Retriever Pet store German Shepherd Dog Domestic goat Havanese Puppy mill Who Framed Roger Rabbit Pet Chihuahua (dog) Turkish Van Knitting Ferret Turkish Angora Livestock Neopets Taboo food and drink Maine Coon Manx (cat) Monster Rancher monsters Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Dobermann Poodle English Springer Spaniel Dog breeding Sears Holdings Corporation Textile manufacturing terminology Fancy rat Microchip implant (animal) Chinchilla Black panther Keeshond Blockbuster Video ITunes Music Store Wal-Mart Bugs Bunny Retailer Shopping Horse racing Koi Whippet Mossberg 500 MapleStory Barry Horne Welsh Terrier Rabbits in Australia The Walt Disney Company Ankara Discus (fish) Positron emission tomography Anchorage, Alaska Golden Retriever Weimaraner Basset Hound World of Warcraft People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Corporation Commodore International Dachshund Border Terrier Rabies Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) German Shorthaired Pointer Serval Yarn Watermelon Dwarf Alaskan husky Animal shelter Gobi Desert American Pit Bull Terrier Jack Russell Terrier Thunderball Stoat Poker jargon Raccoon Xbox 360 Tesco Canary Ithaca, New York Angora (cat) IPod Password Australian Cattle Dog Convenience store Our Gang Honeybee Mixed-breed dog Animal Liberation Front Border Collie Sunday Silence
