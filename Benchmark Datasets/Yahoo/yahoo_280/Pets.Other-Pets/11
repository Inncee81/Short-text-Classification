flea tick medication recommendation does anyone have any recommendations when it comes to flea and tick medication for my dog and cat i don't care about the expense i would not recommend frontline i have two friends who work in separate vet offices and both have told me they've been receiving complaints and returns of frontline because it's not being effective i have used both k advantix and advantage and have never had a problem with either one i wouldn't spend the extra money on k advantix however unless you're in an area where ticks are a problem this is why i switched to just advantage because it doesn't offer the same tick protection and is therefore a little less expensive before at my old barn my dog was with me frequently on trail rides out in the woods and this is why i had her on advantix but now that i'm at a different barn with less of a threat i've chosen to save the money since she's never had a tick in her life anyways good luck try www jefferspet com for super cheap prices on any and all flea tick topical medications Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tick Health insurance Mattress Gross domestic product Red Hot Chili Peppers Insurance Theory of conduct Publicly funded medicine Lyme disease Bulk vending Flea Havelock Vetinari Cat FairTax Linked list Wal-Mart Veterinarian Floppy disk Heartworm Fancy rat Kasparov versus The World Social rule Dog Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Canadian federal election, 1993 Livestock CPU design Tobacco Inflation Sidekick Life insurance Economy of the United States Rocko's Modern Life Peter Griffin Savage Dawn Friends CatDog Bicycle lighting Food and Drug Administration Diabetes mellitus Graduate school Tariff Pitaten The Amazing Race Growth hormone treatment Garfield Microeconomics Hamster Upholstery Ron Weasley Socialization Phimosis 60 Minutes Spaceward, Ho!
