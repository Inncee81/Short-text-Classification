i just bought a panda hamster hi i just bought a panda hamster i cleaned its cage set everything up then i put my hand gently in the carrier she sniffed my finger then nipped it a bit then she sniffed it and bit my pinky hard making me bleed did i make the wrong decision or should i give this hamster some time to warm up to me thanks how adorable the hampster sounds pretty young so it's probably just like a baby teething spend time with it and let it get to know you be patient it will eventually love u d Hamster Humphrey Bogart Pet skunk Salad Fingers Breastfeeding Characters in the Smurfs First aid Ferret Fiat Panda (2003) Gesture Jackass: The Movie Poker jargon The Hampster Dance Milton H.
