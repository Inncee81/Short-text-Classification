has anyone ever had a sugar glider or a flying squirrel for a pet if so what are they like i've been thinking about getting one but i've never had a pet other than dogs cats and a rabbit i have seen sugar gliders at the flea market and they are the cutest little things what do they eat what can you do with them do they play will they play with toys do they use the bathroom on shavings or will they use a small litter box sounds crazy sorry tell me about them please hey there i own a family of sugar gliders mom dad and twin boys they really are a lot of work they need alot of socialization but they aren't as easy to socialize with as cats and dogs they are timid for the most part and completely nocturnal they need to have a very balanced diet to stay healthy mine get a blend of baby food egg honey vitamins and a bunch of other things that's all blended together and frozen called bml and a serving of fruits and veggies with the occaisional treat like mealworms or yogurt drops there are quite a few diets out there but they can be expensive the vitamins are over a jar and if they aren't kept on a complete diet they can die get sick smell horrible normally gliders on a balanced diet have very little odor these guys definitely play mine get lots of toys made of fleece and a bunch of infant toys too they're very inquisitive and hyper when they're awake and absolutely love feather teasers one bad thing about that is catnip and all related herbs are lethal to them so you have to be sure to get toys that have not been treated with catnip most feather teasers and other cat toys have been treated they can't be litter trained they go to the bathroom when and where they want including on you they usually wont go where they sleep but everywhere else is fair game many gliders are bred by mill breeders prime example is the ones you see at flea markets these guys are usually not handled much causing them to be terrified of you pulled from the parents too early making illness more likely and kept in poor conditions many others have been rehomed so many times they have no trust left for humans this doesn't mean they can't make great pets and companions they'll just take x more work and patience well again they're alot of work but if you have the time effort and money to put into them they can be a very rewarding pet i have one of my babies sleeping in my bra right now he loves chin rubs and will roll over on his back to wait for one he knows i can't resist Domestic rabbit Hamster Dog Fancy rat Pet skunk Guinea pig Ferret Garfield Kakapo RuneScape quests Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Livestock Hedgehog Food Canary Chinchilla Flea Friends Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Palindrome Nutrition Chicken Vegetarianism Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Codename: Kids Next Door Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Malaysia Milk Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City Ron and Fez Sugar Glider Yoghurt KaBlam!
