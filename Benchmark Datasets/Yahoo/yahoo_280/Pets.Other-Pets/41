tarantula is she being aggressive i have just bought two chilli rose tarantulas a male and a female they both have their own seperate tanks and cannot see each other the male always seems relaxed and we have handled him but the female is biting the air vents on the lid of her tank and was biting the kitchen paper in the tub she came in i dont know if this means that she would also bite us if we got her out but i dare not handle her yet we dont know if it is just because she is new and needs time to settle in she isnt rearing or anything and doesnt seem to have a problem when we put our hands in the tank i agree with the other answers wear some gloves i e rubber washing gloves to handle her until she gets used to you and her new environment if she is shedding the small hairs on her body which can irritate your skin she is frightened if she's not rearing up then thats a good sign as they usually do this just before they are about to take a good old bite Tarantula Motorcycle Ford Crown Victoria Customs and etiquette of Japan Dairy Diving suit Spider Automobile Clothing Japanese toilet Tattoo Menstrual cup Fire fighting Japanese tea ceremony Social rule Glove M16 (rifle) Smoke-screen Condom Chevrolet Corvair Tank Urticating hair Loudspeaker Sea-Monkey Cat Tire Singlish Urinary incontinence Car handling Textile manufacturing Dishwashing Laws of cricket Eczema Jackass: The Movie Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Atomic Kitten Domestic water system Acne Guinea pig Fencing M4 Carbine Menstrual cycle Climbing equipment RuneScape quests Boxing Fecal incontinence Beast Wars Computer numbering formats Australian venomous funnel-web spider Red Hot Chili Peppers Swimsuit Dandruff Triumph Spitfire Megatron (Beast Wars/Beast Machines) Honda CX series Knife P-47 Thunderbolt Drill bit Chevrolet Camaro Airbag Henri Murger Wound Table tennis Swimming pool Super Saiyan Hand grenade Porsche 911 Gay bathhouse Modem Hamster Gothic metal Autonomous building Thermal power station Futurama (TV series - season 5) Horse breaking Moult Puberty Upholstery Cessna T-37 PID controller Snake Imperial stormtrooper Mud People Tularemia Snorkel Acetic acid Anal sex Vickers 6-Ton Mazda Miata E85 Foodborne illness Dodge Neon Psoriasis World War II Hair Gray Wolf Horse Cricket Drag racing
