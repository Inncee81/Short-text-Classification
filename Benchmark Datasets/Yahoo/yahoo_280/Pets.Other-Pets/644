rabbit help my two month old holland lop is marking her territory which wouldn't really bother me except that her urine is a rusty red ish orange color and is staining my carpet which is weird because she only goes inside her cage some how its getting out side of it i've put down cage liners outside her cage but she still ends up getting it on the carpet i have two of them and my first never marked her territory at least not with rusty urine they share the same cage and i'm thinking thats why shes doing it i clean the cage every couple of days i was thinking this might be the problem maybe its forcing her to do it all over again i've been told that the rusty colored urine is normal just a sign of marking her space will she ever stop is there a way to keep her from doing this is the rusty color in her urine actually normal many rabbits often pass urine that oxidizes to an orange red or even brown color no one knows for sure why this is although raising netherland dwarfs we often found to much protine in the urine caused dark or orange looking urine you can buy urine guards at the pet shop which cover the sides of the cage about inches up this should stop them from peeing out the side of the cage Domestic rabbit Hamster Rabbit Salad Fingers Urine Color Ocean's Twelve RuneScape locations Penske Racing Toilet Urinary incontinence Dog Magic (illusion) Cat Japanese toilet Ferret Penis Chinchilla Staining (biology) Red Fox Upholstery Chaos Emerald Tour de France Plastic Blood on the Tracks Kidney Housebreaking Toilet humour Urinal Carpet Dobermann Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Opportunity rover Hundred Days Tag Diode The Venture Bros.
