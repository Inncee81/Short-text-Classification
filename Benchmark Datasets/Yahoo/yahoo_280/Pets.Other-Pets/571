which pet would you prefer to have as a friend cats dogs birds fish or rabbit i prefer rabbit 'coz i've already have it once ago dogs i have always had lots of dogs and i luv them to pieces they are loyal smart most breeds lol they have great natures again most do but of course there is always the occasional grumpy dog' but if u bring them up in a loving and caring environment they won't be a grumpy dog when you get a dog make sure you make the right choice for your type of lifestyle e g if you aren't home a lot don't get a dog that needs lots of attention and exercise if you have kids don't get big aggressive dogs get loving kind natured breeds such as cockerspaniels or labradors be very careful and make sure you are making the right choice fish are boring don't get a fish rabbits are cool i have them too and i luv them heaps they are a less attention needing pet they are also a lot less expensive dogs are quite expensive to look after and will require a lot of attention and responsibility birds so so i find some breeds a bit boring but some are very smart and you can teach tricks too cats i used to have them but i am personally not that interested in them they don't really like to be touched much not as much as dogs so my final word is a dog they are the best friends you could ever have Dog Hamster Domestic rabbit Ferret Garfield German Shepherd Dog Care Bears Pet RuneScape quests Border Collie Rocko's Modern Life Livestock Monster Rancher monsters Cat KaBlam!
