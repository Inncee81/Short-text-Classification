doesnt anyone feel bad for all the cows chickens pigs in the farm so i was watching this video a girl posted on the bulletin for myspace and it was about how animals in the farm cows pigs chickens oh yea chickens especially were abused the farmer would like hit chickens with a metal bar and then some people would stomp on them this is terrible and for thecows omg i feel terrible for them they would get shocked with a barb and then the farmer would slit his throat alive and what really bothers me here is that these animals never get any fresh air for not part of their lives they are always stuck in this weird building in metal cages so i want to know if anyone else feels this way or has had no idea this was going on because i know i didnt know any of this was going on but i did know they eventually kill these animals for food i just didnt know they abused them this badly have you ever been out in the country been to a real farm not a commercial farm a real farm farmers don't treat their animals that way it wouldn't be productive to be killing off and beating all their animals commercial farming is what the problem is Chicken Livestock Dairy Animal Farm Animal rights Garfield Guinea pig Factory farming Agriculture Agriculture in Hong Kong Guns, Germs, and Steel Farmer Cattle Agriculture in Australia Dairy farming H5N1 Domestic rabbit Egg (food) Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milk Taboo food and drink Fur farming Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Saturday Night Live EastEnders Barbed wire Kodocha Animal testing Organic farming Veganism The Marshall Mathers LP Vegetarianism Slaughterhouse Hamster Ed, Edd n Eddy Food Domestication Ranma __ characters Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Shark Common Agricultural Policy Ren and Stimpy Family farm hog pen Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse MRE Shrimp farm Kashrut Animated television series Pig (zodiac) Internet phenomenon David Firth Animal husbandry Pitaten Famine Hip hop rivalries Neolithic The Ashlee Simpson Show Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Dairy cattle Snowball (Animal Farm) Yami no Matsuei Cantonese cuisine Prehistoric Britain Halaal Biodynamic agriculture Science fiction on television RuneScape quests Animals (album) Static Shock Fish farming Tiny Toon Adventures Rais massacre Avenue Q Who Framed Roger Rabbit Genetically modified food Butters Stotch Family Guy Empire Burlesque Real Love (song) Domesticated turkey Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Whaling Pamela Anderson Escherichia coli O157:H7 U.S. Acres Fancy rat Neolithic Revolution Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr Serial killer MySpace Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Agriculture in the United States Recurring South Park characters Kosher foods Organic food
