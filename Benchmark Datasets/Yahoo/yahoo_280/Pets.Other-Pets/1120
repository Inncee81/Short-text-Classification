which is more affectionate towards humans rats or ferrets or budgies i had a rat and i really liked him but he died years ago at age i am going to get another animal and dont know which one to pick since you asked which is more affectionate i'd say either budgies or rats ferrets are adorable and soft but it's not like they'll nuzzle up to you as they're more independent rats are little attention seekers and love to be pet budgies can be too ferrets require a fair amount of maintenance and the vet bills can run high they're cute to watch at play though bouncing around rats have the shortest lifespan and that can be hard for some but you have experience with rats budgies maybe it's me but birds are just very messy and it takes some effort to clean up after them but they usually have a nice temperament when raised from a young age if you're asking my advice i'd say rat since you know and like them Ferret Fancy rat Rat Guinea pig Hamster Dog Pet Kakapo Rabies Brown Rat Exotic pet Budgerigar Kim Possible RuneScape quests Cat Sin City Holocene extinction event Nutrition Expert system Microchip implant (animal) The Secret of NIMH Azumanga Daioh Aspartame Sleep Cockatiel Domestic rabbit Rabbit Budgie (band) Life extension Veterinarian Ron Weasley House Mouse Garfield Gerald Durrell Hedgehog Violin Piano Lady and the Tramp Bish__jo game Sarah, Duchess of York Animal cognition Tom Goes to the Mayor Island restoration Ai Yori Aoshi Extreme Programming Animal testing Introduced species Chicken Domestication Kevin and Kell Housebreaking Aladdin (1992 film) Mina Mongoose Senescence Eye Kangaroo Rat Park Behaviorism The Drifters Vitamin C Fruits Basket Hearing impairment Golf Calorie restriction Flea Whaling Tooth enamel Pet Sounds Tooth Rat (zodiac) Feral cat Siouxsie Sioux Taboo food and drink Avenue Q H5N1 Chinchilla Dairy Mustelidae Creatures in Bionicle Degu Kitten Life expectancy German Shepherd Dog Human Bill Peet Garfield (film) Brian Close Strap-on dildo Kylie Minogue Batsman Sant Thakar Singh Anime Meaning of life Theory of conduct Falconry Mattress What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
