found a hedgehog what to do we found a hedge in our backgarden we gave it dog food and water but then we realised it didnt look to good so we put it in the rabbit run with a cardboard box and hay it was trying to get out of the cage so we let it go my sister said it was probably because it had babies it was the size of two teenage fist put together i called him henry i fell in love with him but he quickly ran to the bottom of the garden its really strange to find a hedgehog in our garden we live on a new estate so we dont really get hedgehogs could he be living in our garden we was going to keep him till the morning and call the rspca but asoon as he had a bite to eat we let him go wil he be okay we have alot of cats around here how old do you think it is and do u think it has babies he she will be fine it's a wild animal and not meant to be caged maybe it did have babies just be happy for the moment and maybe you'll see it again Hedgehog Hamster Sonic the Hedgehog Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rabbit Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Cat Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Guinea pig Atomic Kitten Animated television series KaBlam!
