newt tank still dirty after cleaning i just did a partial water change in my newt's gallon tank i was really annoyed though because even after that work it's still dirty it has little brown pieces of poo and some leftover bloodworms that he didn't eat floating around how do i get it clean do i have to take out the stones from the bottom and clean them is the filter still working right it's a gallon one and it was brand new a few weeks ago so it sould be fine is it harmful for my newt to be in kind of dirty water it may be harmful yes because poo releases certain types of gases that are generally not okay to be inhailed think of people working at a sewer treatment plant and how they have be aware of gasses around them i was thinking that it's possible the dirt and poo has wedged itself under the rocks or between the rocks and when you moved them it came floating up to the surface clean off the rocks to see if this helps test your filter in a seperate bowl to see if it's working right maybe do an experiment by mixing sand and water in a seperate bowl and putting the filer in if the sand is still there then you have a filter problem but my guess is there was hidden poo you didn't get when you cleaned it good luck Sewage treatment Brewery Fire extinguisher Marine aquarium Aquarium Bong Biodiesel E85 Thermal power station Motor oil Vacuum cleaner Carbon dioxide Japanese tea ceremony Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Opportunity rover Shit Houseplant Leo Frank Fire fighting Hydrogen economy Tuff Carburetor Eutrophication Tank Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Water Conker's Bad Fur Day Hamster Axolotl Goldfish Sewer Anchor Slow sand filter bed Flush toilet Hemp Toilet Ocean thermal energy conversion Swimming pool Pollution M60 machine gun Coffee Glacier M16 (rifle) Glass Tobacco Queen (band) Air pollution General relativity Dirty Work (album) Dairy Ron and Fez Nuclear fallout Diesel Water (molecule) Toilet humour First Battle of the Atlantic Nuclear power Solar power Kenny McCormick Erosion P-47 Thunderbolt Clothing Diving suit Motorcycle Coal Portland cement Drawn Together Nuclear reactor Hydrogen sulfide Piccolo Junior Saga Dialysis Blonde on Blonde Wheel of Fortune Bread Geology of the Moon Casting Fast bowling Energy development Sand Squad Leader Stereoscopy Textile manufacturing Pitaten Scouting Heinkel He 100 Automobile emissions control Hazing American lobster Tina Turner Glossary of firefighting equipment Magical thinking Scuba set Oil platform Gasoline Cannabis cultivation Tooth Gowanus Canal
