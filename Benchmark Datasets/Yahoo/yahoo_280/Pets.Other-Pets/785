peta says having a pet is cruel and they all should be free do you agree with them i believe you are mistaken peta stands for people for the ethical treatment of animals it is a group that cares passionately about animals they believe and i agree that it is cruel to keep animals in cages or capture wild animals and make pets or zoo exhibits out of them your small pet rodents like hamsters and gerbils are probably for the most part pretty content with the nice habitat you provide for them if their home is kept clean and they have plenty of fresh food and water i see nothing wrong with that caged egg laying hens however are another matter entirely that is probably the cruelest thing i can imagine i buy all my eggs from a local farm a few miles out of town way fresher than what's in the store cheaper cruelty free and i know where they came from i'm hoping to get a home out of town so i can keep a few hens of my own i really don't think peta actually encourages people to turn their pets loose into the streets can you imagine the chaos and accidents that would ensue plus dogs especially have been domesticated for thousands of years most breeds now aren't really adept hunters and they would have to resort to foraging to find food dogs rely on people to take care of them they crave companionship a dog kept on a chain out in the yard is a very sad thing cats could and do survive in the wild what happens to them is getting hit by cars or eating poison someone carelessly or intentionally in some cases left out man made hazards put them somewhere with no people and they would do fine however i have never had a well loved and well cared for cat that was miserable with it's lot in life cats are smart enough to know when they have it good having their food provided nice soft places to sleep being safe and getting lots of love and attention from their pet humans lol i envy my cats fish can have it good or bad depends on the fish keeper if he or she is someone who maintains a meticulously clean tank doesn't over crowd it feeds proper amounts of good food and provides an environment with structures to explore and plants to hide and sleep in then fish have a good chance to have an easy fulfilling life i feel sorry for pet birds especially when they never get out of their cages birds were meant to fly if you must keep birds and they are beautiful please consider screening in a covered porch or deck and creating an aviary the closer you can simulate their natural environment the better for them only adopt domestic bred and hand raised birds help stop the importing of wild caught birds if they can fly around perch on actual branches and have a birdbath they'll be much happer birds would you want to sit in a little cage all day every day year after year they don't want to either that's what peta wants people to understand just empathize with your pets treat them the way you would want to be treated if you were them pets with owners who know how to care for their pets and do so lovingly have a joyful life and make a wonderful companion pets who are mistreated or only given the bare necessities to stay alive are the saddest thing i've ever seen peta wants people to treat animals with compassion raising them solely for their fur cruelly slaughtering them for meat keeping them confined to little cages instead of letting them roam free as nature intended that's what peta protests those few zealots you hear about who throw buckets of paint on people wearing fur are the exception not the rule there's going to be a few nuts in every barrel most peta supporters are normal human beings who choose to not contribute to animal cruelty and to one degree or another do what they can to improve animal's lives and rights many times they are also environmentalists trying to do their part to bring back the balance on this planet that is what peta really is people who want all living things to work and live in harmony if you are going to adopt a pet learn all you can about it before you ever go and look at them buy a book or two from a pet store book store or borrow from your library find out what it takes not only to keep the creature alive but what it takes to make it a comfortable and satisfied pet realize that dogs cats and most birds live at least into their teens or twenties you are making a long term commitment to the animal pets aren't disposable if you don't want to make that commitment consider fostering pets adopting an older homeless pet or get something with a lot shorter life span like a hamster please get your pet vaccinated and spayed or neutered if it's a dog or cat it's the right thing to do it will make a better pet a better companion for you and it's better for the animal the shelters are full of puppies and kittens whose owners never intended to let their pet breed it just happened keep it from happening to your pet sorry my answer is so long this is an issue i feel very strongly about i support peta the aspca and the hsus i do my part and if this prompts one person to do their part or learn about a pet before adopting it or get their pet fixed i will feel it was well worth the time
