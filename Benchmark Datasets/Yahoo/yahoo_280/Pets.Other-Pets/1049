how can i get my horse to go everytime i try to go for a ride outside of the barn or the roundpen with my horse he always refuses to go he will go but i have to kick very hard or whip him and i really hate resulting to this and i have tried just taking him up the driveway and then comng back or waiting for him to calm down maybe or think about what i am asking but the most he will ever walk forward though leaving is or steps and i try to stay positive but i can't seem to think of anything i can do whenever he stops he tries to eat and alls he ever does is eat and so i think that is why he doesn't want to go but i can't think of anything to do please help i had a mare that would refuse to move on occasion you'll want to check your horses legs back and hooves for any type of injuries swelling or strains also check your saddle blanket and cinch for any rough areas or pieces of burs make sure your saddle fits your horse well it shouldn't pinch him or rub him in any place look for any worn patches of hair on your horse that's a sure sign you need a new saddle if you have been riding a lot horses will get sore after a work out like we do if this is the case you'll want to scale back on the hour trail rides and let him have some simple riderless unstructured time in the corral a little rest and a gentle ease into his workout will freshen him up also consider he may be hungry no it's not good to eat and run but if a stabled horse has had his breakfast at am and you are ready for a ride at pm he's missed his lunch schedule at least or feedings a day for a stabled horse if you find that he is fine there is a little trick that does not involve corporal punishment every time your horse refuses to budge turn him around and gently back him up about or paces praise him turn him around and proceed if he refuses to go forward again turn him around very gently and slowly back him up or paces praise him again do not punish him through your reins or legs you'll want to keep your horse sensitive to your cues repeat these steps until your horse happily walks forward Horse Equine conformation Horse gait Horse tack Seabiscuit Comanche Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Dressage Weight training Dog training Swingout The Amazing Race Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bicycle The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Milton H.
