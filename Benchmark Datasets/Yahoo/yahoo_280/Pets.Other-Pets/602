i keep getting reported have answered several 'cat' questions giving my opinion i have admitted i am not a cat lover yet have nothing against them however if someones young kitten goes missing as i said there is a great chance it is gone for good in another question i commented on eating cats not myself but i know of people who have and i know of a fast food shop near me that has been accused of skinning and eating them too i am giving an honest opinion maybe its not what people want to hear but surely people have better things to do than report people for suggesting cruelty to 'little kitties' as it happens i own birds and snakes which get a much rougher time from humans than cats ever will but i'm not reporting everyone who suggests to shoot a pigeon or kill a snake if you aren't happy with an opinion don't ask a question the question is why are people reported for an honest answer 'why are people reported for an honest answer' because some people don't like to hear the truth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Theory of conduct Kitten RuneScape quests Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Garfield Bird Phoebe Buffay's songs Meaning of life Little Britain Feral Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Social rule Plame affair Species Cannibalism Lie Adam and Eve Socialization Taboo food and drink Snake Philosophical skepticism Schapelle Corby Meat Hello Kitty Stomach cancer U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bernard Williams Ferret English grammar Fahrenheit 9/11 Schr__dinger's cat Ontological argument Feral cat Abortion debate Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Kill Bill Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Shannara creatures Timon and Pumbaa The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) David Hume Shaggy dog story Carnivore Trailer Park Boys Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Deluge (mythology) Philosophy of language Resurrection of Jesus Cats (musical) Rush Limbaugh Dog George Galloway Downing Street memo Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Pantera Lodge Committee Metaphysics Religion Guns, Germs, and Steel Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Internet troll Baldrick American Alligator Battle of Jenin 2002 Book of Isaiah Dodo Apology (Plato) American Psycho Simone Weil Game show The nature of God in Western theology Internet phenomenon Animal rights Sydney Riot of 1879 Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Cigarette Smoking Man Puma Slander and libel Theodicy Have I Got News For You Teach the Controversy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ethics SMTV Live Abduction Phenomenon The Strangerhood Media bias in the United States Current teachings of Prem Rawat Little Shop of Horrors 2005 United States Grand Prix Goodness and value theory Questionable Content Discordianism Salad Fingers Ron and Fez Aladdin (1992 film)
