would you change your life for your pet i have been offered a job in california i live in the uk but i have a dog who i love so much she is if i take her with me i think the heat could kill her she hates it and if i don't like my new job that would mean quarantineening her for months to come back to the uk and the seperation could also kill her she loves me and follows me everywhere shes like my child would you put your pet first or do you think im a little crazy i am seriously thinking of not going i think you're fantastic i moved abroad and got a puppy straight away i then decided that i wanted to return to the uk i simply couldn't do it and chose to stay abroad for the sake of my dog eleven years later she passed away and i'm still living abroad i believe that it was my fate to stay here but you only have one life i believe that fate has a path for you and you know what you really want to do if that means going to la then perhaps you could leave your dog with a relative until you figure out if you're going to like la if you take your dog make sure you research the kennels used for quarantine should you decide to return to the uk ring the rspca for advice on that matter it used to be six months of quarantine so at least that's been reduced if you chose not to go i believe that that's a good decision if you do go then that's a good decision also because you may be happier with life out there and your dog will be happy because you're happy the best thing would be to leave her with a relative that she's comfortable with until you get settled the main thing is you are agonising with this huge decision and that's the way it should be because she's part of your family i do believe that your needs and her needs should be considered equally good luck Shaggy dog story EastEnders Knots Landing Dog training One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Dog agility Dog Animal rights Pitaten Kodocha Into the West (miniseries) Obedience training The Critic Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.
