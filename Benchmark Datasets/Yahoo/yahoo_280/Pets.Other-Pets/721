hamster question i have a month old black bear hamster and after checking him over like i usually do i noticed bald spots on his butt that he was biting at like it itched him when you spread the hair apart around the areas instead of skin you see two weird black masses they don't look like tumors it looks almost like chunks of hard tar is the best way i can describe it he's eating ok drinking ok plays in his wheel like crazy ears are perky eyes are clear the only weird thing is him biting those two spots that are balding and the black stuff on the skin i don't see any evidence of mites could it be stress related from the new puppy looking into his cage or from a trip i took upnorth maybe the long car ride he did ok the last time we went up is this anything i should worry about making sure my dog doesn't catch i can't find any pics online of anything that looks similar any help would be appreciated i'm also calling the vet tomorrow edit they are not the testicles they are on his back towards his rump but not quite and they're not large masses they're just like black patches of something maybe scabby skin regrowing hair i can't tell he won't sit still long enough for me to really look he's only lost small patches of hair i'd say the black spots are about the size of your pinky finger's nail if even that big he is healthy in every other way as far as i can tell no wet tail ears perky like i said and eyes clear i'm going to rewash and sterilize his cage tomorrow to see if that will help i just can't find any info on the internet that resembles what he has sounds like it's just his hip spots scent glands if so they're perfectly normal very rarely a hamster's scent glands may become infected or blocked and the hip spot area may become sore and inflamed then u would need a vet but that's rare he's prob just fine Hamster Fancy rat Dog Guinea pig Prostate cancer Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Psoriasis "Weird Al" Yankovic Cheetah Haircut Ferret Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Elephant Stomach cancer Skin Shaggy dog story Dandruff Hair Radiation therapy Pet skunk Baldness Nail (anatomy) Animal communication Horse Tasmanian Devil Sin City Happy Tree Friends Erogenous zone Mange Baldness treatments Herpes simplex virus Basset Hound Leopard Acne Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Minor Harry Potter Beasts House Mouse Eczema Aerial (dance move) First aid Spidey Super Stories Rabies Three Stooges Sampling (music) Jackass: The Movie Group A streptococcal infection Discordianism Beagle Spider Double bass Domestic rabbit Bat Dog training Labrador Retriever Tire Ron and Fez Humphrey Bogart Skateboarding trick Tattoo Housebreaking Havanese Spotted Skunk Unreal Doom enemies Chinchilla The Ashlee Simpson Show Platypus Computer virus Codename: Kids Next Door Kim Possible Melanin Malignant melanoma Skinny Puppy Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling attacks The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Pinky and the Brain Mixed-breed dog Vowel Nigger Wheel of Fortune Vampire Boom Town (Doctor Who) Stuttering Coprophagia Drill bit
