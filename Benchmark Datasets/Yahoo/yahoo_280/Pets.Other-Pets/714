cat dog urine when my dog was a puppy he had a few accidents i cleaned these spots with soap and water then i used a carpet cleaner several times i recently purchased a black light and to my suprise these spots are still visible i tried urine gone but the spots are still visible under the black light they don't smell though i am getting a kitten on saturday and i am so afraid that it will try to pee on these places so my question is although these spots have been cleaned numerous times can the animals still smell them or is there anything else i can try more often than not when a carpet has been soiled only the top of the carpet is cleaned if it's possible lift up the carpet to clean the underside as well it's never a good idea to soak the carpet in anything including cleaners your chances of breeding mildew mold are much greater than if you were to dry clean it or use a light spray any time a pet soils on the rug immediately put a clean white absorbent towel and blot blot blot don't wipe or scrub it you only are working the soiled area further into the rug carpet powders don't do anything but mess up your vacuum and settle through to the bottom of your rug i always use my wet dry shop vac to get up most of the urine then i blot until the towel shows minimal signs of wetness and then i use a foam spray for pet accidents i put a towel on it and leave it overnight and then vacuum it up the next day there's not much you will be able to do to prevent another dog or cat from smelling it their sense of smell is far greater than humans but you shouldn't have to worry about the new kitten soiling over it Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Cat Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Toilet humour Skunk Manicure Housebreaking Fancy rat Fire fighting Diseases of the honeybee Carpet Sento Ferret Soap Diaper Brewery Towel Vacuum Wok Urinary incontinence Chinchilla German Shepherd Dog Jam (TV series) Pet store Domestic rabbit Kitten Menstrual cup Hand washing Roomba Kakapo Rabbit Dog Coffee Dairy Puma Bedbug Wound Rabies Glossary of firefighting equipment Coconut crab Casting Pet skunk Dog training Phosphorus Western blot Flea Garden Strawberry Socialization Hemp Air pollution Water Textile manufacturing Burial Urinal House Mouse Penis Cannabis cultivation Urine Death Valley National Park Ron and Fez Opportunity rover Tattoo Hyperthermia Leopard Dialysis Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Wildfire Kimberly-Clark Corporation Idli Composting toilet Teacher's Pet (Disney) Richard Chase Labrador Retriever Livestock Social rule Working dog Animal communication Fecal incontinence Toilet Chair Laundry detergent Shaggy dog story The Hoover Company Pansy Thermal power station Hazing Polyethylene terephthalate Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Wheat Tag
