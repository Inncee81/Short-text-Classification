diabetes or bad dinner i'm years old and very overweight i don't exercise often and my eating habits are horrendous i realize this is my fault but i do wish my parents instilled better habits while raising me anyway i've been urinating rather frequently lately i'll often have the urge to urinate but once i get to the bathroom the urge essentially diminishes about an hour ago i grew very thirsty i also find myself waking up with an uncontrollable need to drink something at first i thought it was because i've been sleeping with my mouth open the past two weeks a recent quirk i just started doing i haven't really experienced this need to drink before so i'm wondering if it has anything to do with what i ate tonight pizza and pepsi or if i may have diabetes it runs in my family so i was tested in but the results were negative do you think the current inability is due to what i ate drank tonight or something else go your doctor first he will send you for the proper tests but it does not consist only with the a c you seem to have the classic symptoms of family history thirst urination and weighing too much no one is on this board can properly diagnose you that may only be done with tests that the doctor orders do not blame your parents you are old enough and mature enough to know what to do you hinted that at least one of your parents are diabetic they should know what to do also although they may not be doing it you have a long life ahead of you let's keep it long without the complications i have been a diabetic for at least ten years i take my medications see my doctors there are many in order to avoid complications and am doing well you can lead a rich and fulfilling life with diabetes or you can have a short miserable one to a great extant the choice is yours good luck Diabetes mellitus Urinary incontinence Hyperglycemia Fecal incontinence Insulin Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Coeliac disease Anorexia nervosa Diabetes insipidus Diabetic coma Medicine The Shining (film) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Obesity Hypertension Terri Schiavo Lupus erythematosus Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancer Hamster Kidney Gastroparesis Stuttering Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Friends Obstetrics Medical analysis of circumcision Clinical depression Alzheimer's disease Stroke Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig Food Sleep Myocardial infarction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chlorpromazine Shaggy dog story Gout Adult attention-deficit disorder Cystic fibrosis Bipolar disorder Procrastination Caffeine The Death Gate Cycle Dialysis Anxiety Abortion Veganism Narcolepsy Traumatic incident reduction Group A streptococcal infection Marathon (sport) Schizophrenia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Health insurance Childbirth Carpal tunnel syndrome Pneumonia Addiction Crohn's disease Halitosis Euthanasia Cytomegalovirus Diabetic nephropathy Avenue Q Drawn Together Hikikomori Diabetic retinopathy Humphrey Bogart Hendrick Motorsports Rabies Clozapine Babe Ruth Ron Weasley Acromegaly Tobacco smoking Tour de France Tooth Erectile dysfunction Battles of Lexington and Concord Gonorrhoea Calvin and Hobbes Pregnancy Borderline personality disorder Diabetic ketoacidosis Diabetic neuropathy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten
