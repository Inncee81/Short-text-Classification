how do you get blood sugar down i am a type ii diabetic sometimes after a meal my sugars can spike to as high as i call the doc and they say do nothing and wait to call in the morning if it is after hours they do nothing i'm new to this so sorry if this is a stupid question how do i lower my sugars because i learned from someone who also has diabetes that when it gets over it starts killing brain cells well thanks for the input it is much appreciated from being a type ii myself here is what i did i got one of those testers at walgreen's one hour after each meal i checked my glucose level and recorded what food i ate and what the reading was this will tell you what foods your body can not tolerate then don't eat those foods you will find like most though that any kind of starch or carbohydrate will drive it up stay with low card low calorie and high in protein stay away from that fatty foods your best bet is to have fresh vegetables and salads with chicken fish hope this helps Hypoglycemia Nutrition Diabetes mellitus Glucose Insulin Dieting Veganism Atkins Nutritional Approach Glycemic index Glycogen storage disease type I Vegetarianism Healthy eating Low-carbohydrate diet Dietary fiber Hyperglycemia Omega-3 fatty acid Blood sugar Insulin resistance Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Tooth Milk Food Diabetic ketoacidosis Atherosclerosis Stroke Biochemistry Stomach cancer Sugar substitute Fasting Bodybuilding Sugar Calorie restriction Chlorophyta Glycemia Sulfonylurea Anti-diabetic drug Obesity Vitamin C Diabetic hypoglycemia Folic acid Foodborne illness Fugu Coronary heart disease Hamburger Chinese cuisine Crohn's disease Carbohydrate Aspartame Cuisine of Denmark Breastfeeding Ecology Hypercholesterolemia Cantonese cuisine Intensive insulinotherapy Gastroparesis Glucocorticoid Kosher foods Tofu Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breakfast Congenital hyperinsulinism Cuisine of the Southern United States Fat Salmon Cuisine of Malaysia French cuisine Hamster Egg (food) Tocopherol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chicken Glycation Alzheimer's disease Biotin Terri Schiavo Soul food Dialysis Polycystic ovary syndrome Oily fish Binge eating disorder Trans fat Fatty acid South Beach diet Cheese Jewish cuisine Ketoacidosis Weight training
