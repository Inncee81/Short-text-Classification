drinking alcohol i've been diabetic since i was in elementary school and have now been at a large university for two years my friends don't really drink and i have only a couple times but have never been drunk i was wondering if it is true that when you are drunk it is similar to feeling low any thoughts thanks i've never been drunk and i never plan to be i am just curious thanks for the info so far and yes anyone who i will go drink with in the future knows that i am diabetic i guess in a way it is you feel kind of disoriented and can't concentrate on anything but drinking doesn't make me shake or get hot and sweaty like low blood sugar usually does alcohol does make your blood sugar harder to control though and you could end up with actual low glucose levels so my thoughts be careful if you decide to get drunk make sure you are with people that under stand your condition and take your blood sugar Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Hyperglycemia Blood sugar Glucose Insulin Atkins Nutritional Approach Cider Hypertension Alcoholic beverage Insulin resistance Dieting Blood alcohol content Alcoholism First aid Diabetic coma Glucokinase Pitaten Diabetic neuropathy Sugar beet Diabetes insipidus Diabetic ketoacidosis Dialysis Coffee Stroke Cannabis (drug) Glucose tolerance test Glycemia Rum Brewery Soft drink Urinary incontinence Sake Fecal incontinence Intensive insulinotherapy Tooth Senescence Atherosclerosis Urine Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Glycogen Inulin Breathalyzer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Yerba mate Obstetrics Rei Ayanami Hemoglobin Alcohol Sugarcane Caffeine Ethanol Drunk driving (United States) Diabetic hypoglycemia Pneumonia Gout The nature of God in Western theology Aspartame Panic attack Taxi Driver Sugar substitute Lac operon Fructose Social rule Chocolate The Emancipation of Mimi Biochemistry Birth weight Customs and etiquette of Japan Pisco Breastfeeding Crohn's disease Chlorpromazine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Electrolyte Sulfonylurea Sugar Post-traumatic stress disorder Columbine High School massacre Corn syrup Hiccup Angina Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Beer Veganism Energy drink Vegetarianism Dehydration Cocaine Alcoholics Anonymous Michael Garibaldi Sauna Medicine Diabetic retinopathy Anne Rice
