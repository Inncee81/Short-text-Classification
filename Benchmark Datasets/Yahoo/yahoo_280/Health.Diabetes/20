gestational diabetes ok so today i got a phone call from the nurse at the doctors office telling me that i failed my hour test she said that of the came back elevated and that the worse out of all was the one that was up to my sugar level i did everything i was suppose to and still i failed i am really nervous about the health of our baby now i have read and heard from many people that this pregnancy related complication can cause you to have an extremely large baby and that it can cause other health issue if it isnt well watched for the remainder of the pregnancy i have a home health nurse coming out to get me all set up with my equipment to start testing my self i have to test times a day atleast and watch what i eat does anyone know what i can eat if anything i was to no high carbs and no sugar but what else do i need to watch out for please anyone that has had this tell me what you did i want to get a start on things now before the nurse shows up diabetes and the gastrointestinal tract james d wolosin md facp and steven v edelman md gastrointestinal gi disorders are common among all people including those affected by diabetes at some point in any patient's life the chances that he or she will develop a gi tract problem be it peptic ulcer disease gallstones irritable bowel syndrome food poisoning or some other malady are extremely high as many as of patients visiting diabetes clinics will report significant gi symptoms the entire gi tract can be affected by diabetes from the oral cavity and esophagus to the large bowel and anorectal region thus the symptom complex that may be experienced can vary widely common complaints may include dysphagia early satiety reflux constipation abdominal pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea many patients go undiagnosed and under treated because the gi tract has not been traditionally associated with diabetes and its complications both acute and chronic hyperglycemia can lead to specific gi complications diabetes is a systemic disease that may affect many organ systems and the gi tract is no exception as with other complications of diabetes the duration of the disorder and poor glycemic control seem to be associated with more severe gi problems patients with a history of retinopathy nephropathy or neuropathy should be presumed to have gi abnormalities until proven otherwise and this is best determined by asking a few simple questions see patient information many gi complications of diabetes seem to be related to dysfunction of the neurons supplying the enteric nervous system just as the nerves in the feet may be affected in peripheral neuropathy involvement of the intestinal nerves may lead to enteric neuropathy this is a type of autonomic or involuntary neuropathy and may lead to abnormalities in intestinal motility sensation secretion and absorption different nerve fibers can either stimulate or inhibit intestinal motility and function and damage to these nerves can lead to a slowing or acceleration of intestinal function giving rise to a variable symptom complex this article will highlight the most common gi disorders seen in people with diabetes the esophagus and stomach in diabetes gastroparesis diabetic gastroparesis is a condition in which emptying of food from the stomach is delayed leading to retention of stomach contents this may cause bloating early satiety distention abdominal pain nausea or vomiting gastric stasis may lead to worsening gastroesophageal reflux along with symptoms of heartburn and mechanical regurgitation of gastric contents in addition fatty foods and very fibrous foods normally exit the stomach slowly and may be poorly tolerated the diagnosis of gastroparesis is often suspected on the basis of symptoms alone upper gi endoscopy is helpful to rule out anatomic obstruction of the stomach or duodenum but does not provide an accurate physiological assessment of gastric emptying upper gi barium studies may confirm delayed gastric emptying with a dilated atonic aperistaltic stomach with retained gastric contents however the upper gi series is more commonly nondiagnostic because liquids may empty normally from the stomach in spite of severe abnormalities in the ability to empty solid materials from the stomach into the duodenum the nuclear medicine gastric emptying test is the best confirmatory test for evaluation of gastroparesis a test solid food meal containing a technetium isotopic tracer is ingested and scintography is used to quantitatively measure the rate of gastric emptying this test is highly sensitive and specific although false positives and negatives may occur in response to medications that accelerate or slow the rate of gastric emptying when performing initial diagnostic testing it is best to measure gastric emptying rates when patients are off of medications that may affect the rate of gastric emptying several different treatments may provide benefit in the management of diabetic gastroparesis consumption of frequent small meals may provide some symptomatic relief avoidance of high fat and high fiber foods may be beneficial as well it is common to recommend a liquid diet during an exacerbation of gastroparesis as symptoms worsen parenteral hydration and alimentation may be required nasogastric tube suction may also be used during severe episodes numerous medications have been shown to provide some benefit in the treatment of gastroparesis metclopropamide reglan is a dopaminergic antagonist that enhances gastric emptying and has primary antiemetic properties unfortunately it crosses the blood brain barrier and causes frequent neurological side effects such as sedation tremor confusion dystonia and at times tardive dyskinesia which may or may not reverse after the drug is stopped cisapride propulsid is a prokinetic agent that is very effective at facilitating gastric emptying pharmacological tolerance a problem common with metclopropamide does not seem to occur with cisapride and patient acceptability is excellent the food and drug administration fda has recently placed severe restrictions on the use of cisapride because of the potential for cardiac dysrhythmias due to prolongation of the qt interval this is of particular concern when the medication is taken with agents that delay the metabolism of cisapride such as erythromycin clarithromycin fluconazole idinavir and other agents that inhibit the cytochrome p a system the medication is contraindicated in any individual with a prolonged qt interval and an electrocardiogram should be checked in all individuals in whom therapy with cisapride is being considered concomitant administration of agents that can prolong the qt interval are to be avoided clinically this problem occurs infrequently especially when the prescribing guidelines are followed at this time cisapride is available only through the fda directly and only for patients who have failed other therapies and meet strict criteria for use of the drug domperidone motilium is another dopaminergic antagonist similar to metclopropamide that accelerates gastric emptying but does not cross the blood brain barrier and has very few side effects it is not yet available in the united states but is available in mexico and elsewhere erythromycin has unique properties that stimulate gastric motility and may be beneficial in selected individuals it functions as an agonist of motilin and enhances gastric emptying unfortunately erythromycin has many potential side effects including nausea and may not be well tolerated nonspecific antiemetic agents including prochlorperazine compazine and promethazine phenergan often can provide symptomatic relief of nausea and vomiting there appears to be no substantial benefit for the preferential use of the more expensive ht receptor antagonists such as ondansetron zofran or dolastetron anzemet recently a novel approach to refractory gastroparesis has been to use an implantable gastric pacemaker it has long been recognized that many patients with gastroparesis have abnormal electrical gastric rhythms that may or may not correlate with delayed gastric emptying surgical placement of a gastric pacemaker has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying and provide symptomatic relief in a small number of patients in preliminary uncontrolled clinical trials smoking cessation light postprandial exercise such as walking and dietary manipulation such as eating multiple smaller meals and avoiding high fiber and fatty foods can also improve gastric emptying most importantly careful attention to blood glucose control is essential and can have a tremendous impact on gastroparesis ulcer disease ulcer disease is a common problem in patients with or without diabetes and affects up to of the population at some time during their lives acid irritation of the stomach or esophagus leads to heartburn indigestion and a burning sensation in the upper abdomen or dyspepsia helicobacter pylori the bacteria responsible for most duodenal ulcers and many gastric ulcers is no more common in patients with diabetes than in the general population in fact diabetes itself does not increase one's risk of developing ulcers individuals with ulcers and ulcer like symptoms are treated in the same fashion regardless of whether or not they have diabetes treatment is geared toward suppression of gastric acid secretion with antisecretory medications i e h receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors if h pylori is present it will usually be treated with a specific antibiotic regimen along with anti secretory agents common antibiotic regimens include a week course of amoxacillin amoxil clarithromycin biaxin metronidazole flagyl clarithromycin metronidazole tetracycline or metronidazole amoxacillin in individuals with gastro esophageal reflux eradication of h pylori may result in worsening symptoms because acid secretion increases after this bacteria related gastritis resolves many individuals with reflux will require therapy with proton pump inhibitors to control symptoms these provide effective relief of symptoms in of affected individuals as opposed to the h receptor antagonists which provide symptomatic relief in of individuals with reflux disease candida infections patients with diabetes may develop yeast infections in the gi tract especially when glycemic control has been poor yeast infection in the mouth thrush is characterized by a thick white coating of the tongue and throat along with pain and burning if the infection extends further candida esophagitis results which may cause intestinal bleeding heartburn and difficulty swallowing oral candida can readily be diagnosed by physical examination but candida esophagitis will usually require endoscopy for accurate diagnosis treatment is highly effective and is focused on the eradication of the yeast infection with antifungal medications such as nystatin mycostatin ketocanazole nizoral or flucanazole diflucan the small intestine in diabetes in some cases of longstanding diabetes the enteric nerves supplying the small intestine may be affected leading to abnormal motility secretion or absorption this leads to symptoms such as central abdominal pain bloating and diarrhea delayed emptying and stagnation of fluids in the small intestine may lead to bacterial overgrowth syndromes resulting in diarrhea and abdominal pain metclopropamide and cisapride may help to accelerate the passage of fluids through the small intestine whereas broad spectrum antibiotics will decrease bacterial levels diagnosis can be quite difficult and may require small bowel intubation for quantitative small bowel bacterial cultures breath hydrogen testing and the c d xylose test may be helpful in diagnosing bacterial overgrowth as well all of these tests are somewhat cumbersome and an empiric trial of antibiotics is often the most efficient means of diagnosing and treating this condition numerous antibiotic regimens have been shown to be effective including to day courses of tetracycline ciprofloxin amoxacillin or tetracycline a short course may provide prolonged relief but typically additional courses of antibiotics are required when symptoms recur in several weeks or months at times enteric neuropathy may lead to a chronic abdominal pain syndrome similar to the pain of peripheral neuropathy in the feet this condition may be very difficult to treat but will sometimes respond to pain medications and tricyclic antidepressant medications such as amitryptilline elavil unfortunately narcotic addiction may be common in patients with chronic painful enteric neuropathy individuals with diabetes also have an increased risk of celiac sprue in this condition an allergy to wheat gluten develops leading to inflammation and thinning of the mucosa of the small intestine why this association occurs is not clear however sprue may lead to diarrhea weight loss and malabsorption of food this condition responds well to a gluten free diet but patients may have difficulty adhering to such a diet diagnosis can be made with endoscopic biopsy of the small intestine or with serological evaluation for anti endomysial and anti gliadin antibodies the colon in diabetes limited information is available regarding the effects of diabetes on the large intestine we do know that enteric neuropathy may affect the nerves innervating the colon leading to a decrease in colon motility and constipation anatomic abnormalities of the colon such as structure tumor or diverticulitis should be excluded with a barium enema or colonoscopy fiber supplementation with bran or psyllium products as well as a high fiber diet increases the water content of the bowel movement and may relieve constipation mild laxatives and stool softeners will often help as well in addition cisapride accelerates colonic movement and may increase the frequency of bowel movements diabetic diarrhea patients with a longstanding history of diabetes may experience frequent diarrhea and this has been reported to occur in up to of patients this may be related to problems in the small bowel or colon abnormally rapid transit of fluids may occur in the colon leading to increased stool frequency and urgency in addition abnormalities in the absorption and secretion of colonic fluid may develop leading to increased stool volume frequency and water content diabetic diarrhea is a syndrome of unexplained persistent diarrhea in individuals with a longstanding history of diabetes this may be due to autonomic neuropathy leading to abnormal motility and secretion of fluid in the colon there are also a multitude of intestinal problems that are not unique to people with diabetes but that can cause diarrhea the most common is the irritable bowel syndrome the workup and treatment of diarrhea is similar in patients with or without diabetes if the basic medical evaluation of diarrhea is nondiagnostic which it frequently is then treatment is tailored toward providing symptomatic care with antidiarrheal agents such as diphenoxylate lomotil or loperamide immodium fiber supplementation with bran citrucel metamucil or high fiber foods may also thicken the consistency of the bowel movement and decrease watery diarrhea in addition antispasmodic medicines such as hyosymine levsin dicyclomine bentyl and chordiazepoxide librax clindinium clindex may decrease stool frequency sometimes an empiric trial of antibiotics and or pancreatic enzymes is warranted because pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and bacterial overgrowth may be the etiology more recently the ht receptor antagonist alosetron lotronex has been used effectively for the treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome tincture of opium and paregoric have also been used to improve the quality of daily life in some cases finally in severe cases injections of octreotide sandostatin a somatostatin like hormone have been shown to significantly decrease the frequency of diabetic diarrhea obviously in these severe cases referral to a gastroenterologist is indicated the pancreas in diabetes pancreatic exocrine dysfunction occurs in up to of individuals with type diabetes but is rarely significant enough to lead to any clinical problems with digestion the pancreas has a tremendous reserve and a modest reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion rarely leads to difficulty in digesting or absorbing carbohydrate fat or protein the exocrine pancreas may also be affected in some patients with type diabetes but to a lesser extent individuals who have secondary diabetes because of severe pancreatitis or surgical removal of the pancreas usually have more severe symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency treatment with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is usually effective a trial of oral enzyme replacement therapy can be done safely for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes the liver in diabetes although liver function tests are commonly abnormal in patients with diabetes it is unclear whether this is a reflection of the underlying obesity that is so common in patients with type diabetes or whether it is an effect of poorly controlled diabetes fatty infiltration of the liver nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is common in obese individuals up to as well as in type diabetic individuals up to people with type diabetes in very poor control may also develop this syndrome although it is much less common fatty infiltration of the liver may lead to tender hepatomegally elevated liver enzyme tests and abdominal pain syndromes occasionally this may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver the diagnosis is usually suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation but can be confirmed with abdominal ultrasonography and if needed percutaneous liver biopsy metabolic abnormalities such as hemochromatosis and infectious etiologies such as viral hepatitis need to be excluded as part of the evaluation therapy is geared toward improving glycemic control and instituting a low calorie low fat diet caloric restriction will lead to weight loss better glycemic control lower serum triglycerides and cholesterol and improvement in the fatty infiltration of the liver ursodiol actigal may provide some benefit in the treatment of hepatic steatosis diabetic patients seem to have an increased incidence of gallstones and gall bladder problems but these much like fatty infiltration of the liver are primarily related to the obesity associated with type diabetes and not to the diabetes itself obesity leads to secretion of bile by the liver that is supersaturated with cholesterol leading to crystallization and stone formation typical symptoms of biliary colic include intermittent right upper abdominal pain jaundice or pancreatitis in the past patients with diabetes have been instructed to have surgery for asymptotic gallstones because of a concern for an increased risk of complications from gallstones such as infection pancreatitis or rupture of the gall bladder however more recent experience with modern medical and surgical care indicates that this is no longer the case thus patients with diabetes and gallstones should be managed in a fashion similar to nondiabetic patients surgery is generally recommended only for those individuals whose gallstones are causing symptoms conclusions gi problems in diabetes are common but not commonly recognized in clinical practice the duration of diabetes and the degree of glycemic control are major determinants in the incidence and severity of gi problems the entire gi tract can be affected including the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine colon liver and pancreas leading to a variable symptom complex the workup starts with a thorough patient history and appropriate laboratory radiographic and gi testing in addition to pharmacological therapy glycemic control and dietary manipulation play an important role in managing gi disorders in people with diabetes
