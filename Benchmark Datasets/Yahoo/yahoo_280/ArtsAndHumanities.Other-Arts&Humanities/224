world building how much do you do before writing a story i was just wondering how much world building some people do prior writing a story like studying various dialects brushing up on slang from certain time periods or locations creating languages making maps of places where the story takes place etc also does world building before writing the story help btw a question for those who create languages as part of their world building how do you use the created language in your story i mean you could obviously use the language for creating names but what else what would be the point of investigating dialects you might use phrases but if you can't hear the spoken word what's the point you as a writer would set the idea of dialect with your story line i as the reader would assume the accent if i were familiar with that language for instance 'ee by gum an expression used by lancashire people in england or pardon macherie obviously french but if you have a good story i don't think your reader will worry about accent too much French language English language American and British English differences Quebec French English English Southern American English Philosophy of language Hiberno-English Chinese language Cantonese (linguistics) Australian English Dialect Hungarian language Singlish Greek language Swedish language Japanese language New Zealand English Spanish language Hangul German language English grammar Swahili language Scouse Translation Formal written English - regional differences Non-native pronunciations of English Inuit language Chinese character Arabic language Hebrew language Phoneme British English Finnish language Standard Cantonese Languages in Star Wars Slang Italian language Polish language American English Languages of Hong Kong Chinese spoken language Tone (linguistics) Indonesian language Internet slang Old English language Tatar language M__ra-Pirah__ language Euphemism Engrish Regional accents of English speakers Lisp programming language Portuguese language Pinyin New York-New Jersey English Standard Mandarin Basque language Aramaic of Jesus Czech language Serbo-Croatian language Diacritic Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Manglish G-Man (Half-Life) Indian English Spanish dialects and varieties J__rriais Germanic languages Aramaic language Joke Jacob Neusner History of Esperanto Canadian English Moldovan language Okay Deconstruction Dictionary Old French Korean language Leet Shtokavian dialect Old Norse language T-V distinction Pleonasm Logic Germish Written Cantonese Ojibwe language Japanese dialects Dark Ages Syriac language Tlingit language West Country dialects Vietnamese language Storytelling Classical Chinese Russian language
