do you like writing with a sharp pencil i have several pencil sharpeners and i use them regular because i like to write with pencils do you know what i mean i like writing with ordinary pencils too but obviously only for personal use they're so cheap and simple and biros don't always work if you're half lying down and have them at a funny angle and they can suddenly go all smudgy on you when you don't feel like getting up and looking for another incidentally i have some old family postcards dating from the long ago pre biro era which went through the post written in pencil so trusting somehow that was when the only alternative was those dipping pens or fountain pens and if you'd run out of ink or didn't want to get messy pencil was presumably the only other option i think there's something comforting about pencils too because they're what we all started out with in our earliest school years although it can look a bit pale sometimes i find an 'h' grade quite good because you don't have to sharpen it as often Ballpoint pen Fountain pen Pen Drawing Autograph Writing GED Jim Aparo Runaways (comics) Typewriter Comics BIC Corporation Knife Drill bit Pencil sharpener Desk Pen and ink Dip pen Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
