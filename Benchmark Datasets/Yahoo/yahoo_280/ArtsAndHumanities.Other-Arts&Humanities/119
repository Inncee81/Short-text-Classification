creative block how to get out of it when i was writing came very naturally to me and i did not need to search for ideas since then i've had a massive creative block and haven't written anything for pleasure in a couple of years i'm nearing my th birthday and i want to rekindle the passion any ways to spark inspiration that maddening kind where you couldn't stop if you wanted to i miss it so i think part of it is fear that i'm no good teachers would compliment my writing and instead of being motivated it made me set standards i could not reach it made me too nitpicky about getting it perfect that i wouldn't write freely dear ha writer's block can strike any writer at any age and oftentimes repeatedly what you need to do is forget the standards you've set and find your muse again that inner creative voice that speaks to your right brain do something fun like the first answerer said enter some competitions submit your work to some magazines and ezines that only accept submissions from teens i'll post some links for you enter the scholastic art and writing awards if you're a us citizen it's open to all students grades if you just sit down and start writing and don't give up until it's done the passion will come back and the ideas will flow again i'm a published author of books and my rd is getting ready for release when my dad died i felt like i would never write again it took me nearly a year to start writing what i did was i went to the park and people watched then i picked certain people gave them names and personalities and wrote paragraphs about why they were visiting the park if i saw a couple then i wrote what brought them to the park it was a great exercise that eventually led me to a short fiction piece that won a competition it was what i needed pick a short writing exercise that you'll have fun with and make sure you follow through with it once you finish one story more will come if you give in to the writer's block it will only grow more and more difficult to defeat work on defeating it before it wins good luck to you o Milton H.
