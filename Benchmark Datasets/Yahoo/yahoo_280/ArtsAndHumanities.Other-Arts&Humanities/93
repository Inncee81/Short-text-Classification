what is the importance of music in our lives music a stress buster music isn t that something which is so close to all of our hearts i just can t imagine life without something so important though you may not realize there is some part of you craving for music every time but the only thing is that most of us suppress it in today s modern world of rushing and hurrying music always proves to be an ideal stress buster music is one of the very few things which qualify among the things that i always keep close to my heart while writing while playing or while doing any damn thing i hum to myself though not during lectures or classes as i am sure i ll be butchered if i hum when someone is teaching through experience i have found that music when it is playing in the background or when you are enjoying it helps you to be focused on your work when it comes to me let me tell you that i am totally addicted though one can t carry an i pod or a walkman you can always sing to yourself or just hum good music transcends all linguistic boundaries and proves to be a great bond maker when it comes to making friends music is something which just can t be discarded or disowned music belongs to everyone and it plays a vital part in one s character formation those who don t have time to spare for crooning or listening to melodies are often found to be gloomy dull and short tempered on the other hand music lovers are often those who are the most loved in gatherings and are very cheerful music will indubitably help us to transform into hip fun loving teens rather than remaining as dismal jimmies so come on friends let s embrace the part in our self yearning to groove to beats and cut loose The Emancipation of Mimi Sex and the City Hip hop culture Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Isley Brothers Music genre One Tree Hill (TV series) Dragon Booster Jazz Emo The Ashlee Simpson Show Freestyle music Sally Ann Howes Shaggy dog story Film soundtrack Phil Collins Eric Cartman Herbie Hancock Jon Secada Lindy Hop Another Side of Bob Dylan Social rule Kurt Cobain Humphrey Bogart Blood (computer game) Buddy Guy Philosophy of language Soap opera Beat generation Transcendentalism Drizzt Do'Urden Real Love (song) Ludwig Wittgenstein Cliff Richard The Amber Spyglass Buddhism Sampling (music) Meditation The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Tone (linguistics) Chibiusa Prince Buster Friedrich Schleiermacher Spidey Super Stories Blues Great Teacher Onizuka Native American music Mantra Socrates Buster Keaton Existentialism Roy Orbison Generation X Pitaten Charles Ives Scenes from a Memory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Intelligent dance music Time Out of Mind UK Singles Chart Tai Chi Chuan Nicomachean Ethics EastEnders Hip hop music Stan Lee Plato Science Love Charles Mingus Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Walkman The Jazz Singer Elvis Presley Tiny Toon Adventures Extreme Programming Samuel Taylor Coleridge Karaoke The O.C.
