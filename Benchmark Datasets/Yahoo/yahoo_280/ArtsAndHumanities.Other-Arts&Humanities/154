how do you get into the modeling buisness i want to become a model my top few choices would be victoria secret juicy couture places like abercrombie but how do i get started well miss cali i have been a professional commercial photographer and a certified model consultant for a long long time and bring a word to you on this front that comes from experience and knowledge this is my business there are three things that are a must here besides the main thing of having great looks that photograph very well and those are as follows one must have at least the basics of a portfolio together this is the actual proof of photogenic ability and even though the digital portfolio is beginning to take the day the call for and acceptance of the printed version of this set of photos is still the standard this must be to x 's in a binder that are as absolutely different from one another as is humanly possible it should contain at least some black and white as well as color should have some studio and some location shots some of casual as well as more formal and the absolute necessary bathing suit shot makes no difference one or two piece one can pay quite a bit of money for such a presentation but it really isn't necessary to break the bank here one by going slowly and methodically can do this on a budget over time with far less expense than most people think next is to get at least some experience in front of people or in print ads to have as a reference for a resume beginning there are a lot of places that this can be accomplished local shows are conducted by specialty shoppes and shopping malls on a regular basis and the co ordinators for these events are always looking for new great looking people for their shows and are willling to give people a chance to get experience in exchange for their efforts here third and one of the most important finding an agency or representative that isn't a scam artist there are thousands of them out there they say they are agencies but their real job is to sell you classes and high dollar portfolios my suggestion here is to talk with actual clients of any agency that you are considering or that is considering you and i don't mean people that they have working for them i mean actual people who have found work through them or people who use them for people in their ads ect wish i could personally school you here there are a lot of nuances within this field that are to be learned and a lot of things that you could benefit from knowing but alas the time and space constraints of the y a the best of luck to you in all of this hope to see you on the printed page some day in the near future i am a regular contributor to a number of fashion publications myself and who knows one day we might get a chance to work together Photography Advertising Plame affair Insurance Inflation Microeconomics Gross domestic product Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Ra (board game) MapleStory Economics Apple Macintosh The nature of God in Western theology Modelling agency Cheating in Counter-Strike Neopets MMORPG Doomsday argument Economic inequality Capital accumulation Mutual fund Mach kernel Advance fee fraud View camera Spanish verbs Monopoly (game) Undergarment Software engineering John F.
