what makes your heart pound be creative this is going to sound odd but when i was young i came from a family situation that was let's just say not healthy and i was punished very severely for anything that went wrong in my vicinity whether it was my fault or not i won't get into some of the stronger details but you can use your imagination anyway to this day my heart pounds the hardest whenever there is an accident around me whether or not i am the one that caused it my pulse quickens and my adrenaline starts pumping and the fight or flight gets ready to kick in maybe it's the fact i was working on a diy and something simple happened like a drill bit broke or maybe it's something more severe like someone nearby takes a spill on their bike or skateboard of course now that i'm older i've prepared to deal with such things i know a lot of first aid and i know a lot about how to make repairs my rational mind kicks in and fixes the problem but right away when the accident occurs i still get the adrenaline push as if i'm about to be blamed and punished for it nobody but nobody can f someone up for life like a parent can Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Cardiac arrhythmia Time Out of Mind Oh My Goddess!
