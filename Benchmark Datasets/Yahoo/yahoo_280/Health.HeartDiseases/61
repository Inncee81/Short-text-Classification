stress ecg test next week i am undergoing this test which is part of an employment contract i have had a heart murmour for several years and the upper left ventricle of my heart is inflamed although feeling very healthy and i cannot see this test 'being a problem' however i was wondering if this is a test that you 'pass' in terms of the outcome any points of view my future depends on this test it is sad to say i have undergone stress tests in a mere two years i've only had one that sounds like the one you will be having there's no 'passing' and 'failing' i don't see why an employer would be having you do this unless you work a very physical job really what the test does is just measure your heart rate and blood pressure when i had my test i found out that my heart skipped a few beats during exercise and that my blood pressure also dropped during exercise because of your heart murmur and or inflamed left ventricle you really need to make sure that there are trained professionals on site and tell them about your condition perhaps you should even call your doctor and tell him her about this test and see what they think because your left ventricle is the one that pumps blood through the aorta you really need to be careful before i had my surgery my left ventricle was enlarged due to my stenotic aortic valve my doctors thought it was too risky for me to have a stress test with my severe condition so you really do need to seek medical advice i take back what i said before here's how you 'pass' tell your doctor and make sure it's okay for you to have the test and make sure there are trained professionals that are comfortable with dealing with your condition at hand and if you don't something could happen and you might 'fail' i hope everything goes well Aortic valve stenosis Heart Aortic insufficiency Aortic dissection Mitral regurgitation Atrial septal defect Cardiac cycle Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Myocardial infarction Heart sounds Blood pressure Cardiac arrhythmia Hypertension Mitral stenosis Urinary incontinence Heart valve Cardiology Circulatory system Traumatic brain injury Electrocardiogram Stroke Aorta Childbirth Clinical depression Medicine Atrial fibrillation Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Ventricular fibrillation Cardiovascular disease Heart rate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tetralogy of Fallot Shock Turner syndrome Prostate cancer Psoriasis Fetus Physical examination Angina Patent ductus arteriosus Artery Fecal incontinence Mitral valve prolapse Stomach cancer Artificial pacemaker Aneurysm Aortic aneurysm Hypoglycemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Obstetrics Insulin Cephalic disorder Health insurance Infantilism Physician Breastfeeding Intracranial pressure Cardiac arrest Transsexuality Pulse Emergency Medical Services Anorexia nervosa Dialysis Long QT syndrome Pneumonia Cirrhosis Asthma Marfan syndrome Coronary heart disease Stem cell Acute respiratory distress syndrome Coronary catheterization Explosive material Stress (medicine) Diabetes mellitus Exercise Coronary artery bypass surgery Combat stress reaction Organ transplant Diabetic retinopathy Tachycardia Software testing Pulmonary hypertension Atheroma History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Miscarriage Anxiety Alcoholism Lupus erythematosus Paget's disease of bone
