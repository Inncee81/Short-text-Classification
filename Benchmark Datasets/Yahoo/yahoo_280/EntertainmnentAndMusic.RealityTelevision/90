bb us isn't it obvious that dick and daniele are on the block no spoilers please it is obvious that they are on the block what is not obvious is that the veto competition has been played and the veto ceremony held and big brother is pretending that what you tell eric will effect any of that it will not i won't tell you a spoiler but i will tell you that people watching cbs are getting a false version of the reality they want you to tell eric who to cold shoulder i say pick amber she needs to learn what a mistake she made not voting out eric last week she and jameka need to see eric turn on them like dick and daniele said he would eric tried to use america to win this competition but like i said the orders he is given are often too little to late for the damage he does on his own and as for dick and daniele i actually see a good side to putting them on the block together in that it forces daniele to face her problems with their relationship and it helps dick to show the world that he truly loves his children and wants to see them get along as a family most of that is lost on cbs as well plus both have them have said if you are not hoh or on the block being in the house is boring time to vote http www cbs com primetime bigbrother americas player vote shtml Big Brother (USA TV series) Cincinnati Bengals Hollywood Squares Survivor (TV series) The Amazing Race Knots Landing Pyramid (game show) Pete Rose Hulk Hogan Kurt Angle Big Brother UK series 6 Stone Cold Steve Austin Table tennis Professional wrestling throws Game show Tic-Tac-Dough Marching band The Price Is Right Wheel of Fortune Betting (poker) NWo American Idol Alex Ferguson EastEnders Television in the United States Paul Levesque Oakland Athletics Chess (musical) Poker jargon American football strategy Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers NFL on television World Championship Wrestling Leon White MTV2 To Tell the Truth Elix Skipper Dick Williams Fox Broadcasting Company Survivor: Palau Press Your Luck Instant-runoff voting Super Bowl XXVII Major League Baseball television contracts Girls Aloud San Francisco 49ers Edward R.
