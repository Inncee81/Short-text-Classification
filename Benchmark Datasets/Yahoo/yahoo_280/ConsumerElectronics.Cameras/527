how can i fix the lighting in my camera i have a digital camera the sony cyber shot mega pixel camera its works perfectly when i take pictures outside but indoor the color is all yellow and really bad is there any way i can fix this with like the settings or something right now it's on auto and i dont have any flash on it yes that is one of the wonders of a digital camera over a film type with film cameras we were playing around with a gadget bag full of different types of film and a stack of filters now all you do is go in to your menu and hunt for white balance you should find several choices listed for the type of indoor lighting you are dealing with pick the icon that looks like a little light bulb the others are for different florescent lamps lighting conditions etc the auto mode does a pretty good job out doors but sucks under most indoor with out flash lighting cases for serious indoor work you need to calibrate the camera's white balance as per the instructions with your particular camera with most though you choose the little bulb setting point the camera at a white piece of paper under that lighting and press the shutter button to the first position and then release it then go ahead and take your pictures in that lighting setting you can test this by copying a white bordered photo take a copy with out setting the white balance and you will see the border is kinda yellow then do the white balance thing and take another picture and the border should be white and the colors of your copy should be very close to the original that you are copying Color temperature Digital photography Photography Stereoscopy PlayStation Portable Light-emitting diode Digital camera Canon T90 Traffic light Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Digital cinema Nintendo DS Film Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Stage lighting View camera Nintendo 64 Game Boy Single-lens reflex camera Gamut Cinematography Floppy disk Technicolor Poker jargon Color Danger Hiptop Leica Street photography Windows Vista Enlarger RGB color model Computer printer Digital IPod Motion picture terminology Traditional animation Christmas lights Sega Saturn Mouse (computing) Television Road-rule enforcement camera Original Amiga chipset Compiler optimization Starsiege: Tribes Digital cinematography Charge-coupled device Pixel Video Anamorphic widescreen Atari 8-bit family IMAX Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) NTSC Nintendo GunBound Photographic film Nintendo GameCube Rail terminology Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Canon PowerShot G Game controller Windows XP System/36 Macro photography Bubble Bobble Shutter speed History of computer and video games Game Boy Advance Bicycle lighting Raw image format Camcorder Panavision Lightsaber Depth of field Embedded system Resident Evil (video game) Super Nintendo Entertainment System BZFlag Tungsten Handheld Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Aliasing Widescreen Photograph Xbox Compact fluorescent lamp Autostereogram EXpanded MultiPlayer
