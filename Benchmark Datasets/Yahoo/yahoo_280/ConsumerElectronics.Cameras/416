before i consider buying it what are your opinions on this camera link included http www jessops com store s home cameras and lenses digital compact cameras pentax optio a digital camera details aspx your opinions would help thanks seems like a nice little point and shoot camera obviously one of the best ways to tell if it is for you and how you'd feel operating it is to go into the store and have a play around with the camera you've got a good megapixel rating an average zoom you're best only really paying attention to optical zoom if you're looking for the sharpest of pictures the camera uses sd which in my opinion one of the best memory cards you can use also a nice large screen one of the main downsides i'd think off is that there is no optical viewfinder so you are forced to use the lcd screen which will obviously reduce battery life and on sunny days glare may be a problem maybe be worth checking to see what scene selection modes and light balance modes are built into the camera also overall if you're looking for a straight point and shoot camera i think you'll be very happy with the results from this pentax if you want to ask me any further questions please feel free to contact me Digital photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera Konica Minolta Pentax Leica Pixel Photography Contax Camera Movie projector Stereoscopy Point and shoot camera Binoculars Secure Digital card Nikon Corporation Canon T90 Widescreen Cinematography Oscilloscope Anamorphic widescreen Photographic lens Digital cinematography Camcorder Handheld game console Canon EOS Digital camera back Digital cinema Nintendo DS Panoramic photography CPU design Modem Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Surveillance Film Game Boy High-definition television View camera Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) Panavision Tungsten Handheld Federal Standard 1037C Windows Vista Digital image editing IPAQ Canon PowerShot G Solar power Endoscopy Automatic number plate recognition Lens (optics) Windows XP PlayStation Portable DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX USB flash drive Holography Parallax Sharp Zaurus Motion capture Aperture Rangefinder camera Zire Handheld Nikon FA Liquid crystal display Bluetooth Ebook Canon Inc.
