camera and lens i have an olympus om with a lens thats like inches high is there a site or a quick way to learn how to take nice pictures within the next two days from bottom to top or from the camera outwards the lens read first ring om second ring macro the next thing slides back and forth i take it zoom and the next slide reads in ft and m with a sign that looks like circles attached also there is a accessory flash buts its a nikon it has two options m and asa whats that help please i'm so confused first ring is the aperture ring the lower the number the faster you have to take the picture in other words the faster the shutter speed and at the same time the less depth of feild meaning only what you focus on comes out in focus in the picture the higher the number the slower you have to take the picture and the more things that come out in focus if the lens is inches long im guessing its maximum focal lenght is mm according to the second ring but besides that i dont know what else the ft and m are feet and meters so you know how far your subject is when you focus unless you chose to focus by first finding out how far the subject is the two circles attached is the mathematical symbol for infinty on your lens this means that at this point anything farther than the previous foot or meter marker on the lens is in focus for the nikon flash the m is manual unless its a table suggesting distances and the power you should set your flash to i haven't used a manual flash for a while so the asa i am hazy about but might be something with power output you should experiment with the different settings on a roll of film and write down what settings you use for each picture you take keep in mind when you buy film the lower the iso number or speed example the slower you have to take your picutres or slower shutter speed and the higher the iso the faster you can take a picture have fun Digital photography Canon T90 Photography Leica Nikon FM2 Aperture Nikon FA Macro photography Camera Nikon Corporation Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photographic lens Konica Minolta Canon EOS Single-lens reflex camera F-number Canon EF lens mount Nikon FE Film speed Cinematography Floppy disk Nikon FM Canon T70 Point and shoot camera Stereoscopy Exposure (photography) Mouse (computing) Rangefinder camera Pinhole camera Photographic film Digital camera Binoculars Street photography Shutter (photography) Amateur astronomy IMAX Stage lighting Movie projector Panoramic photography Speed limit Eye Autostereogram Manual transmission Canon FD Slide rule Anamorphic widescreen Zoom lens Eyepiece Redundant array of independent disks Digital camera back Film CDC 6600 Motion picture terminology Equine conformation Headlight Aberration in optical systems M16 (rifle) Recumbent bicycle Camcorder Super Mario 64 Drag racing Bokeh Opportunity rover Time-lapse Wind turbine Canon PowerShot G Dog agility GunZ The Duel Drill bit Telescope Color temperature Modem Beatmania IIDX Panavision Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME EIA-708 DVD Parachuting High-speed rail Interstate Highway Advanced Photo System Explosive material Olympus (company) Faster-than-light Chair Widescreen Oscilloscope
