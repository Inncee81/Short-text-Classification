why does the canon a seem to take better pictures then the sd when the sd has digic lll ok so digic lll which only the sd has has face detection technology and it says outstanding image quality reading off the canon flyer while the a only has digic ll i know that the a has a higher mp its mp and the sd is mp but does it make that much of difference is it just me cuz it seems when viewing sample photos that the a is better in image quality how come even with the sd 's digic lll and it's face detection technology that potrait photos on the a have better color and is more clean and crisp comparing to the sd 's portrait photos if ur gonna say its cuz a has a larger sensor tell me what a sensor is judge for urself look at the sample photos http www pbase com cameras canon powershot sd http www pbase com cameras canon powershot a by looking at the sample photos urself which has better image quality turn off face detection as this can be fooled and you can detect a face just as quickly yourself you are right that sensor size makes the difference the a sensor is about twice the size of the one in the sd here is a comparison between mp image from the sd which is a sensor like the a and a mp image from an sd is which is a sensor like the sd okay i don't know if we are comparing pixel count or sensor size here but take a look anyway and see what you think about the differences click on all sizes and then original to judge http www flickr com photos samfeinstein here's another http www flickr com photos n here is a mini tutorial i made myself to compare mp sensors in a digital slr dslr and a point and shoot p s camera i have tried to keep everything on equal footing with no unequal cropping of the original images both images were taken at the equivalent of mm from about feet away view this full size and scroll through the image to compare the resolution at various points of the images to me the p s sensor practically looks like an impressionist painting compared to the dslr sensor please note also that this is the large size p s sensor as most are using the smaller x mm sensor http www flickr com photos n Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera Digital camera back Pixel Foveon X3 sensor Photography Canon EOS-20D Single-lens reflex camera Macro photography Gamut Stereoscopy Geographic information system Mouse (computing) Canon EOS Charge-coupled device Digital Image file formats Aspect ratio (image) Sensor Advanced Photo System Medium format Digital image editing PNG Full frame digital SLR Closed-circuit television Thermographic camera Leica Digital cinema Nikon Corporation Movie projector Digital cinematography Image scanner Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Opportunity rover Four Thirds System Analog-to-digital converter Raw image format Motion capture Panoramic photography View camera Nikon D70 Camcorder Grayscale Photo sharing Widescreen Ajax (programming) Konica Minolta Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Clementine mission JPEG Canon EOS-300D Anamorphic widescreen Huygens probe Canon EF lens mount Liquid crystal display Road-rule enforcement camera Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft DVD 8 mm video format Dots per inch Secure Digital card IPod Optical coherence tomography Flickr Floppy disk Raster graphics Autostereogram Anti-aliasing Electronic organ Camera World Wide Web Laserdisc Schneider Kreuznach HyperText Transfer Protocol Shroud of Turin IMAX Photographic film Wallpaper group Amstrad CPC Canon T90 Chroma subsampling Fuel injection Atari ST Apple Computer Digital video Compact disc Digital image London Digital art Binoculars Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February
