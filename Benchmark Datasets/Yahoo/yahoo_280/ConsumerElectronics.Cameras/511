nikon d or d thinking of upgrading my nikon d for a trip to nepal later this year i've read lots of reviews on both the d and d i'm edging toward the d should i be worried about the extra weight are nikon about to upgrade the d intoduce new model should i wait a couple months or take the plunge now so i can get up to speed with new functions i'm not sure why you would upgrade from the d your not going to see you picture magically improve to any noticable point with either the d or d at least not any improvement that would justify the cost not to mention its very likely nikon will be discarding both those cameras with new models in the next months and before you listen to the poster suggesting the d realize that the d doesn't have a built in motor for auto focus so depending on which lenses you have already they may work fine or they may only be manual focus with the d if your dead set on a new camera you might well consider the fuji s pro at least with that camera you would see an improvement in the picture quality and still be able to use all your current nikon lenses Digital photography Leica View camera Konica Minolta Rangefinder camera Nikon D70 Nikon FE Single-lens reflex camera Binoculars Nikon FM Nikon FM2 Camera Photographic lens Photography Canon T90 Nikon FA Mouse (computing) Point and shoot camera Movie projector Floppy disk Panoramic photography Secure Digital card Extreme Programming Road-rule enforcement camera Apollo 8 Camcorder Oscilloscope Depth of field Widescreen Contax Radeon Space Shuttle program Cinematography EXpanded MultiPlayer Panavision Film Speed limit Television Macro photography Natural Selection (computer game) Autostereogram Bicycle lighting Digital camera Stereoscopy MS-06 Zaku II Resident Evil 4 Auto rickshaw Automatic number plate recognition Ford Mustang Medium format Lens (optics) P-51 Mustang Dassault Mirage III Anamorphic widescreen Audi Strategic management Battery electric vehicle PlayStation 2 Commodore 128 Information Technology Infrastructure Library Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March CPU cache Personal rapid transit Redundant array of independent disks Traffic light Pentax Walkman Windows Vista Closed-circuit television Auto racing Stage lighting Ford Thunderbird Driver's license Automatic transmission Disposable camera Porsche 911 Digital cinema Movie camera Digital cinematography Piccolo Junior Saga Canon PowerShot G Bloodstain pattern analysis Technicolor Mitsubishi 3000GT Mac OS X F-number Automobile ATI Technologies Windows XP Street photography Headlight Raw image format Jet engine Ford Focus DVD
