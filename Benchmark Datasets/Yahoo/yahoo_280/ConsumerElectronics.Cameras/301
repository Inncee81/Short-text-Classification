question on digital cameras i just recently bought a olympus fe digital camera today i wanted to put one of the pictures that i took on it as my desctop background when i did that though the pictures were super big when i whent to the picture and right clicked on it and then said set as background the picture was all stretched out then i when to properties and selected center or tile rather then stretch but when i did that the picture came up huge and i could only see a fraction of it ie a pic of my cat but could only see the tip of its ear how do i down size the files or the picture so that it fits you probably have the camera on its highest resolution mp your desktop is usually x or less than mp so you have a mp window through which are looking at your mp photo that is why you only see a small part of the picture if you have a flat screen monitor it might be x resolution but this is still only mp the solution is to resize the photo to the resolution of your monitor you can retake the picture at a lower resolution or use an image editing program to resize the pic you already have to your screen resolution one of the above values then you will see the entire picture on your desktop Digital photography Pixel Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen Digital image editing Image file formats Opera (web browser) Mouse (computing) Apple Computer Digital camera Digital cinema Digital cinematography Windows Vista Oscilloscope Display resolution Stardock Photography PIC microcontroller Computer display QuickDraw Object Desktop Super Nintendo Entertainment System Microsoft Windows Hash table Geographic information system File Allocation Table Digital video Aspect ratio (image) Digital single-lens reflex cameras Video Laptop Video Graphics Array Icon (computing) Movie projector Apple Macintosh Google Desktop Computer animation Mac OS X Atari 8-bit family Liquid crystal display Enlightenment (X window manager) Windows Mobile NTSC Film Microsoft History of the graphical user interface 2D computer graphics Window Maker IBM PC compatible Teletext Windows Picture and Fax Viewer PostScript Taskbar QuickTime Dither Iriver Computer International Phonetic Alphabet Motion capture Bluetooth Panoramic photography Blue screen of death Mars PlayStation Portable Portable Document Format Digital television Raw image format Floppy disk X Window System Nintendo GameCube Windows 2000 Depth of field Opportunity rover IPAQ Microsoft Office Digital camera back Machinima IMac Autostereogram Apple typography Embedded system Cinerama Graphical Environment Manager Unicode CPU design Java programming language Steam (content delivery) Game Boy Camera Linux 35 mm film Visual Basic
