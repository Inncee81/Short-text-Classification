wireless security camera help can they share reciever i have two wireless hgz security camera's i bought one of them is astak and the other sony but the astak camera brought receiver can the sony and the astak security camera share receiver so if put one in the living room and the other in my yard will both of those cameras go to the one receiver so i can record i researched and know for a fact they are both ghz cameras plz help if they are both wireless they could possibly share the same receiver if set up the right way there is some software out there that could turn your cameras on and off so it could turn on the yard camera take a shot then shut off that would allow the other camera to use the receiver take a time lapse shot then shut off it would be a way to alternate cameras on one receiver otherwise a multiplexer and multiple receivers would probably be necessary Bluetooth Wireless LAN Wi-Fi Telephone Universal Serial Bus Panavision New York Giants PlayStation 3 IEEE 802.11 MAME Mouse (computing) Transmission Control Protocol Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Closed-circuit television Xbox Modem Surveillance Nintendo Revolution Resident Evil (film) Radio Freeview PlayStation Portable Cell (microprocessor) Windows XP Sony PowerPC Mobile phone WiMAX Secure Digital card Apple Macintosh Broadcasting Thunderball Cellular network BlackBerry Resident Evil: Apocalypse Apple Computer Handheld game console Computer and video games Konica Minolta Floppy disk Digital photography Nortel Networks High-definition television Copy protection Electronic journalism Wearable computer Angels and Demons PowerBook Sprint Nextel Corporation Walkman Global Positioning System Camera Ericsson Wireless Application Protocol Internet Resident Evil 9/11 conspiracy theories Movie theater Microwave Nintendo The Mysterious Planet Vodafone Amateur radio Wavelength-division multiplexing Opera (web browser) Danger Hiptop 8 mm video format Syphon Filter USB flash drive Panoramic photography Wireless network Nintendo GameCube ZigBee Movie projector Digital camera The Inside Wardriving Code division multiple access Sega Videotape Camcorder Microsoft Digital cinematography WNEP-TV MIM-23 Hawk Ocean's Twelve Resident Evil (video game) Smartphone Spirit rover Resident Evil 4 Database Columbine High School massacre Bad Wolf Television
