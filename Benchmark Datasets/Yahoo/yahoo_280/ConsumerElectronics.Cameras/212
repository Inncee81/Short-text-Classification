mb micro sd card problems i have a mb micro sd card i am having problems with it i like to take videos with it and a couple of days ago i was able to take up to almost min of videos when the card was empty now i can only take min with the card empty what happened and is it fixable okay i just reformatted it in my camera but how do i do it on my computer i have an apple powerbook g i looked at can't find where to do it your camera should have an option to format the card back to it's original state i've heard of several bugs where a camera will unlink a large file that is you won't be able to access it anymore but it never actually deletes the data or bugs out and only deletes a small portion of it irregardless try formatting the card first in the camera itself and then in windows if the problem persists this process varies by camera for example format card on my camera is on the same menu as delete modify picture to do it under windows right click on the camera or device in my computer and select format leave the default options alone because the camera will only force a format the first time you try to use it anyway since cameras and windows don't usually use the same file system Mouse (computing) ITunes Screenshot File Allocation Table Floppy disk Computer Surveillance Common Unix Printing System Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Windows Windows XP System 7 (Macintosh) Mac OS X v10.4 Macromedia Flash Digital photography Java programming language Bluetooth Hard disk Apple Macintosh Virtual memory System/36 Windows 2000 WordStar HyperCard MDAC E-mail The Sims 2 Universal Serial Bus Secure Digital card Steam (content delivery) Hello world program PowerBook DVD Punch card Mozilla Firefox Debugging IBM PC compatible USB flash drive File format Library (computer science) Personal computer Commodore 64 HTTP cookie Spyware Apple II family Anti-virus software Movie projector USB mass storage device class File system Gmail Flash memory Windows 3.x History of Microsoft Windows ITunes Music Store Mac OS X Game Boy Visual Basic Control Panel (Windows) System/34 Device driver Linked list History of the graphical user interface Unicode Mozilla Application Suite Pixel SonicStage Memory Stick H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mac OS history Digital rights management Mach kernel Atari ST AppleScript DirectShow AirPort ALGOL 68 PC Engine Btrieve SAS System Apple typography Memory card Oscilloscope Micro Channel architecture PlayStation Portable IMac
