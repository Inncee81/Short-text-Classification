i'm looking for a good quality digital camera for under anyone have a suggestion if you could give me your review on your digital camera that would be helpful i own a few nikon dslr's which cost more than but i'd buy the canon powershot a or a for myself these cameras have the larger sensor or mm x mm that is nearly double the sensor size you find in many point and shoot cameras and this translates into better image quality they allow fully automatic use or total user control and offer several stages in between the only significant difference between these cameras is that the a is mp and the a is mp if you're going to spend up to look at a canon powershot a my son has had his a for over a year may and we both like it my brother has had his a for over a year and it's a very nice camera also you can get it at b h photo available through yahoo shopping for if you can go to look at the mp canon powershot a this is an excellent camera it sells for and you can add a very nice memory card for under the images from the a compare very favorably with the images from a canon g which costs about twice as much for either camera buy a or gb sandisk ultra ii or extreme iii card you will need the increased capacity and write speed to fully realize the benefits of your camera the ultra ii would be excellent but if you are really into video you might prefer the faster extreme iii these cards cost from about at b h and several other outlets a http www steves digicams com reviews a html also http www dpreview com reviews specs canon canon a asp read owner opinions a http www steves digicams com reviews a html also http www dpreview com reviews canona if you want a superzoom camera the s is is now the one to get but some still prefer the s is there are other brands but my experience is with the canon s is and s is see http www dpreview com reviews compare post asp method sidebyside cameras canon a ccanon s is ccanon a show all click on read owner opinions and in depth review the a series cameras have a sensor that is about twice as big as the s is and this translates into generally better image quality they both have more pixels than the s is which isn't everything in image quality but it is certainly worth considering the only thing the s is has going for it is the tremendous zoom range yeah it has image stablization but without that huge zoom you will not need it the a series cameras are somewhat smaller and easier to carry around in a bag or coat pocket too personally i think i'd choose either the a or a over the s is i'm sure others will have a different opinion my son has an a and my daughter has an s is and they both love their cameras Digital single-lens reflex cameras Photography Camcorder Leica View camera Secure Digital card Canon PowerShot G Mouse (computing) Konica Minolta CPU cache Nikon Corporation Stereoscopy Binoculars Floppy disk IBM PC compatible ATI Technologies World Wide Web PlayStation 3 Radeon Hard disk Canon EOS CompactFlash Atari 8-bit family Computer Pixel Bluetooth Closed-circuit television Apple Macintosh Ajax (programming) Macro photography Canon EOS-300D Photographic lens Single-lens reflex camera Flash memory Windows Vista Amateur astronomy Rangefinder camera Gramophone record Digital camera back Internet Memory Stick Personal rapid transit Ebook Nintendo GameCube Nintendo NVIDIA Warez Charge-coupled device Panavision Road-rule enforcement camera Screenplay Movie projector Blog Portable Document Format Parachuting Apple II family Cinematography Galactic Civilizations USB flash drive Gross domestic product Fuel injection IMac Television Panoramic photography Camera Apple Computer Machinima Hubble Space Telescope Contax HTTP cookie Aperture Digital cinema CPU design GeForce 6 Series Computer and video games Geographic information system Computer vision Mac OS X Canon EF lens mount Canon EOS-20D Sport utility vehicle Extreme Programming Gmail PNG Timeline of computing 1990-forward Film PlayStation Portable MP3 3dfx Nintendo Entertainment System
