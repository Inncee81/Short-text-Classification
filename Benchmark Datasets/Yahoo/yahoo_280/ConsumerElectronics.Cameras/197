can canon lenses be used on both digital and mm cameras i have a canon rebel xti and have some really nice lenses and im planning on buying just the regular canon rebel t but im curious if the lenses i already have will work on the mm help me out what was answered is true but totally inclusive if you are buying non canon lenses there are a lot of lenses that are designed for digital only by that they mean that they are designed for aps c sized sensors only your xti is an aps c camera while you could still fit the lens on a film camera or canon's full frame cameras canon d and the d mark i and ii you'll get extreme vignetting around the edges so yes if you stick with canon brand lenses with the ef mount you'll have no problems using those lenses on all ef mount cameras but if you go off brand you'll have to be careful to check if the lenses are made specifically for aps c sized sensors for example on the following website you'll see on the right hand column that there are a bunch of lens under the category dc lenses for digital slr camera click on any of those lenses and the first thing it says is that the lens is purposely made for dslr's with aps c sized sensors http www sigmaphoto com lenses lenses all asp just about every major off brand has these specialized lenses for aps c cameras these lenses also tend to be cheaper than lenses that can be used on all ef mount cameras because they don't have to project that large of an image onto the sensor since the sensor is smaller than a full frame sensor mm Digital photography View camera Canon EOS Full frame digital SLR Advanced Photo System Leica Konica Minolta Nikon Corporation Photographic lens Digital camera back Macro photography Single-lens reflex camera Digital camera Panavision Camera Movie projector Canon EF lens mount Contax Digital cinematography Photography Panoramic photography Charge-coupled device Canon T90 IMAX Canon EOS-300D Vignetting Four Thirds System Binoculars Contact lens Rangefinder camera Cinematography Depth of field Telescope Reflecting telescope Medium format Widescreen Schneider Kreuznach Floppy disk Eyepiece Olympus (company) Pinhole camera Computer Shutter speed Lighting Parallax Canon FD Aspect ratio (image) Photograph Aperture 35 mm film Bluetooth Nikon FM2 Glasses Geographic information system Canon EOS-20Da Digital cinema Digital video Galileo spacecraft Photographic film Zoom lens Motion capture Violin Secure Digital card Computer vision Nuclear weapon design MS-06 Zaku II Pentax Cosina Nikon FA Film speed Enlarger Disposable camera Traffic light Point and shoot camera Film Stereoscopy Headlight Star Destroyer Zeiss Cinerama Sensor Motion picture terminology Professional video camera Lens (optics) 135 film Pixel Traditional animation Nikon FE2 Clementine mission Lunar Orbiter program Hubble Space Telescope
