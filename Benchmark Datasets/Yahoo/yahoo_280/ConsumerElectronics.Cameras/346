digital camera my digital camera broke but i have a memory card in it if i just buy one of the same cameras and put the memory card in that would that work and would i have to instal the same software again there's no problem with the software as most will work with any camera you chose the brand of the camera is less important than the type of card it takes if you have a sony then you have to chose the same brand as only sony uses memory sticks if you have an olympus or fuji then you have to stick with one of those two as they are the only ones that use xd cards if your camera uses an sd card then you're in luck the vast majority of current cameras use sd cards if your camera used cf cards you would have to move up to the 'pro' line of dslr cameras memory cards are very inexpensive so i wouldn't make that the only thing to consider when choosing a replacement in fact i highly recommend that you use a memory card reader to transfer your images to the computer they're inexpensive and if you get one that takes multiple types of cards you can use any camera and card you can share with friends use current or future cards and save your camera's batteries as well hope this is helpful Digital photography Secure Digital card Digital camera Computer XD-Picture Card Sony PlayStation Portable IBM PC compatible Memory Stick PlayStation 3 Memory card IPod PlayStation 2 SmartMedia Copy protection Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Universal Serial Bus Konica Minolta Nintendo 64 CompactFlash High-definition television Bluetooth Traditional animation Windows Vista Digital audio player Nintendo DS Digital single-lens reflex cameras Apple Macintosh Photography Apple Computer Floppy disk Digital rights management IPAQ Windows XP Panoramic photography USB flash drive Redundant array of independent disks Xbox DVD Nintendo Revolution CPU cache Motion capture Digital cinematography Acorn Computers Multimedia Card Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Computer and video games Tungsten Handheld Smart card Teletext Surveillance CPU design Personal computer Raw image format Sony Computer Entertainment Credit card Ebook Flash memory 3dfx Hard disk Camera Sharp Zaurus Extreme Programming Game controller Read-only memory Stereoscopy ATI Technologies 8 mm video format Digital video RFID ITunes Ethernet Computer bus Intellivision Unicode Wi-Fi Sega Dreamcast The Sims 2 History of computing hardware MAME Year 2000 problem Punch card Leica Hubble Space Telescope Sega Digital circuit Modchip FireWire History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Neopets Poker jargon Oscilloscope IBM 1620 The Amazing Race Jumpstart 3rd Grade
