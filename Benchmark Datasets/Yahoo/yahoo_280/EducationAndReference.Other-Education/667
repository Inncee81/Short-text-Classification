highschool good or bad hi i'm going into highschool this coming school year and i'm like freakin out should i be worried i hate highschool im going to be a sophomore and school is hell for me however with that being said you probably wont make the same mistakes that i did make sure that you're super friendly and outgoing with everyone i go to an average sized high school and i had no friends from middle school in my classes during freshmen year i didnt thinnk that i could survive because no matter how 'cool' you are making new friends quickly is a hard task but now i don't even bother to talk to the ppl i went to middle school with because i made so many new friends it was really simple all i had to do was be outgoing and friendly here are some tips do not mess with the seniors i cussed a few of them out during my first day and punched on at a debate meeting not a good idea however do be nice and say to hello to everyone even people that you dont know most likely you will end up making more friends each day than you could have hoped for do not think that you can get away with stuff just because you are in highschool no matter how many students are at your school the principals will always catch you and trust me theyre alot more strict than the middle school principals do your homework its amazing how quickly you can get ahead or fall behind based on the amount of homework you complete oh and last thing i thought id clue you in on you may think that everyone at highschool are mature but theyre not i remember during my freshmen days i thought that i was in a school full of mature teenagers like me but boy was i fooled have fun and dont be shy Theory of conduct Student Education in Romania Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Secondary education Okashina Okashi Saved by the Bell Pitaten Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Singlish Great Teacher Onizuka Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha Yearbook Richard Feynman Spidey Super Stories Full Metal Panic?
