reference letter request for former boss hi i'm relocating to a new city at the end of this month and would like to ask my current boss a local daycare a reference letter that i can enclose with resumes that i'm currently mailing out to daycares at my new location prince rupert bc i only have till the end of august before i move and would like to ask my boss if she'd be willing to be a reference does anyone know of any templates that are suitable to use when asking a previous employer about wheather or not they'd be willing to provide a reference for me any help would be greatly appreciated thanks shy you are over thinking here almost all employers are more than willing to give good references if you have been a reasonable and reliable employee just ask the personal letter that he she will probably write is much better than any form letter that you could find ps a little confusing here are you just asking for a letter from your current employer or are you asking from a former employer you don't need a letter for your current employer a face to face is much more personal and will probably get better results Day care Sydney Riot of 1879 Statistical survey 2005 United States Grand Prix Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Cross site scripting Gottfried Leibniz Joker (comics) Finnish language Flag of Denmark Royal Assent Lotus Software 2001 anthrax attacks Scientology beliefs and practices DNA Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Panay incident Transsexuality Annuity Wood carving Expert system Advance fee fraud Computer virus Password Social rule Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Telephone numbering plan Infantilism Dilbert Astroturfing Identity theft Graphology Appeal Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Charmed Dissociative identity disorder United States Postal Service Fast bowling Max Payne British Rail Class 86 Prince Rupert, British Columbia The writing of Principia Mathematica C plus plus Greek language Filioque clause Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution First English Civil War Mega Man X8 Charles Goodyear Mail Health insurance Entropy FairTax Abortion Domestic partnerships in California Friedrich Schleiermacher Database Pretty Good Privacy Euro Friends Morality Humphrey Bogart Galileo Galilei Tekken characters K__ppen climate classification Sant Thakar Singh Plame affair Michael Griffin William Adams Toronto Cleveland Browns Customs and etiquette of Japan Same-sex marriage in Canada Freeters Anemometer Grade (education) C programming language Nico Robin Unemployment Jack the Ripper Final Fantasy IX Oasis (band) Welding Melanie Wilkes Computer Explosive material Provisional designation in astronomy Offshoring It's Walky!
