i'm miserable at school will highschool ever end i don't like my school very much i just don't fit in i live in virginia and i attend one of the best schools in the country the work is tough we go at an insane fast pace the kids are very well rounded they have the looks the brains the money the girls or the guys they live what you might want to call the all american dream it's a preppy school mainly not trying to sterotype here as best as i can and when you're not like them they look and treat you like you're nothing i have a disability in math and i just feel so bad i do get a's in b's in everything else but math is just difficult i feel so stupid there i can't change schools because i have so many times in the past and i don't want to conform either it's not really a question more like a rant i'm not in the mood for any bad comments does highschool ever end yes it does and your brain just works a little differently babes so try to give yourself a break you can fit in and still maintain your individuality find something they like or do that you like or do as well and there you have it common ground doesn't mean you have to stop being who you are and it sounds like you're beings so hard on yourself surely you have some looks some brains and a friend or two sounds like you're having a tough day so lighten up go do something you love to do and put school out of your mind for a while when you come back to it maybe it won't seem so bad good luck babes Social rule Kodocha Avenue Q Shit The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Doug Babe Ruth Kyle Broflovski Electrophysiology Wonderland (McFly album) The nature of God in Western theology The Delinquents Education in Romania Sin City The Catcher in the Rye W.
