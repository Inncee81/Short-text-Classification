do you work in a gym anyone on here done a gym fitness intructor certificate what did you have to do and how much money can you earn no but a friend of mine whom i am no longer in touch with did one before i met her and she started training me it is quite intensive you have to study diet and nutrition sports injuries as well as everything to do with the gym as well i don't know how long it took her and she did it in addition to her regular job she absolutely loved it though and she earned good money doing weekend step and aerobics classes which were really popular back then she also made very good money as a personal trainer the best thing to do would be to approach a local gym and ask the staff or managers there what qualifications are needed and how to go about it i know my friend didn't spend a huge amount on it but it was something she did over a long period of time while she was working she started doing it when she lost a lot of weight and wanted to get fit one of her instructors said she would be a good instructor as well and it took off from there go for it there will always be money in the beauty fitness industry sorry i can't be more specific but i think you should give it a go it may well be that you could get a job in a gym and the training might come from there i just don't know good luck The Contender (television series) Parachuting Graduate school Exercise Pok__mon Chronicles Aerobic exercise Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Meat Loaf Lou Duva Social rule Education in the United States Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Dog agility Paralegal Mixed martial arts Human height Dublin City University 1957 World Series Pok__mon Trainer Drill instructor Bilkent University The Apprentice 2 Boxing training Bodybuilding Pok__mon Live!
