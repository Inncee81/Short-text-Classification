how reliable are edu or gov sites my english teacher told my class that we could only use edu or gov websites for internet research i understand that it would be impossible for her to check nearly students' sources but i was stilled bothered her poilcy many edu sources i found were research papers by students or professors which i wouldn't consider credible information necessarily i wasn't able to find any gov research it was a literary project this teacher also forbid time and newsweek articles claiming that they were nothing but gossip although i turned this project in many months ago i'm curious for my own sake how to determine an internet source credible are there certain domain names or is it a case by case basis how reliable are edu sites anyway surely edu sites contain as much opinion as newspapers or news magazines and as a side note in what situations are news magazines credible sources perhaps with biographical info but not political analysis thank you any source web or print is only as credible as the person who provided the information some are incredibly reliable and some are not the idea behind wanting edu and gov sources is that these often cite their sources news magazines may well be filled with facts but they don't often cite their source of information any better than a spokesman from said and that doesn't cut it in academic research remember a credible source doesn't have to be correct it simply has to be reliable you get the same answer all the time the news may well be accurate but generally speaking you're getting the information second hand it becomes a secondary and not primary source let's say you're writing about the value of education in terms of increased income and a newspaper wrote a story about it using the statistics from the census bureau wouldn't you rather use the same stats and see if you reach the same conclusion as the reporter if you're writing a research paper if you're reading biographical sometimes the news is a valid source of information an obituary for example might be acceptable to source in a paper most news isn't original research it's reporting so it's not a source with some few exceptions there is a lot of government research out there you can look at this popular gov that many news people use for their source material and ideas http www fedstats gov more information than anyone wants to know and you helped or will help pay for it also i use google scholar a lot it can help provide you with plenty of scholarly journals to use as source material and very very few teachers will disapprove of the use of a scholarly journal as a source the difference between these and things like newsweek is that to get published in a scholarly journal think new england journal of medicine a group of experts in the field have to agree that your work is acceptable and correct in news the reporter decides what to write and the editor says yes or no plenty of errors get through Plame affair John Lott Wikipedia Plagiarism Open access Academic publishing Downing Street memo The Bell Curve Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda World Wide Web Karl Rove Roswell UFO incident Newspaper 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Bogdanov Affair Debugging Economics Publishing Deconstruction Cross site scripting Scientific journal Plame affair timeline Philosophical skepticism Killian documents Peer review 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Hutton Inquiry Condon Committee Science Scholarly method Public domain Bigfoot The Skeptical Environmentalist Academia Teach the Controversy Race and intelligence Professor Standardized testing Biblical inerrancy Copyright The Standard Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Logic Noam Chomsky Scientology beliefs and practices The Washington Times Domain Name System Drudge Report Graduate school Ann Coulter Journalism ethics and standards Media bias in the United States Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Ye Shengtao Slander and libel Alcoholics Anonymous Education The Bible and history Autism Ming Pao Historical method Education in the United States Aesthetic Realism Software engineering Talmud Expert system Computer virus New Testament Jacob Neusner Solar variation Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Anonymous remailer Criticism of Prem Rawat Floppy disk GED Novel Style guide Bj__rn Lomborg Asperger syndrome Advocacy journalism The New York Times Technology Review Fair use Chronology of the Ancient Near East Mass media Freedom of the press Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Age of the Earth Joseph C.
