how do i organize myself for high school we have block scheduling meaning we have minute classes per day each class lasts semester i prefer binders we can't carry backpacks can you give me your own personal experience it would be greatly appreciated well i'm a college student and i like to use the spiral notebooks with the different subject sections for my classes if you get the stars ones they come with pockets so you can keep loose papers there so you could just get a big one and carry that around and maybe a small paper folder just in case you need it to carry extra papers in or since you like binders just use the separators with pockets Education in Romania Graduate school Academic term Brown University Gramophone record Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Lynbrook High School Education in Germany Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy IB Diploma Programme Marching band Scuba set Laptop Tulane University Japanese tea ceremony Community emergency response team Mattress Hopkins School Hunter College High School Juris Doctor Education in Taiwan Student British Rail Class 42 Welcome Back, Kotter Education in the United States Microsoft Office Paper size Cornell University Franklin W.
