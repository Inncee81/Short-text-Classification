mathematicians have the concept of rigourous proof which leads to knowing somethig with complete certainty consider the extent to which complete certainty might be achiveable in mathamatics and at least one other area of knowledge i'm not exactly sure what your question is however i find that this is one of the attractive points of mathematics it is absolute in it's reasoning rarely if ever are mathematical teachings repealed all of a sudden no one can say oh the pythagorean theorem was wrong after all but boy is it a close approximation though in a related field physics theories cannot ever be proven they can only be disproven while i love physics it just doesn't have the certainty that mathematics does mathematical proof is a great example of logic at it's best to prove truth conclusively it doesn't meant that mathematicians know everything but they do know some things for sure and that is more than most fields can claim Philosophy of mathematics G__del's incompleteness theorem Mathematician Epistemology Science Halting problem Mathematical logic Kurt G__del Theory Scientific method Axiom Natural deduction Reductio ad absurdum Real number Existence of God Vacuous truth Axiom of choice Complexity classes P and NP Pi Philosophy of science Western philosophy Philosophical skepticism Fermat's last theorem Augustus De Morgan Non-standard analysis Pythagoras Carl Friedrich Gauss Presuppositional apologetics Mathematical proof Archimedes Modal logic Trigonometric function Numerology Number theory Phaedo Regular polytope Logic programming Propositional calculus Arthur Cayley Adjoint functors Interpretation of quantum mechanics Atheism Pythagorean theorem Hermann Weyl Burden of proof Philosophy of language Euclid's Elements Riemann hypothesis Ontological argument A New Kind of Science Lebesgue integration Paradox Formal methods Meaning of life Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Where Mathematics Comes From Prime number Theodicy Model theory Imre Lakatos Conjecture Laws of Form Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Economics Irrational number Aristotle Cosmological argument Joseph Louis Lagrange Blaise Pascal Begging the question Willard Van Orman Quine Summa Theologiae Alfred Tarski Axiomatic set theory Victor Cousin Social sciences Rudolf Hermann Lotze EPR paradox Monty Hall problem Causality Intuitionistic logic Timeline of mathematics Complex number Scientific skepticism George Boole Curry-Howard
