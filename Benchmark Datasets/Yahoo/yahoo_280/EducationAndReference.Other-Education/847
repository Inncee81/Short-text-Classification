what is better to use at school my folder at school is failing me it is falling apart and i need to get a new one but i was just wondering what is better to use at school folders or books becuase books is my other option apart from having a folder so could anyone help consider a looseleaf book you can insert pages where you want them use it for several subjects and use dividers reinforcements can be placed on pages that are in danger of falling out some looseleaf books have pockets which you can use to insert tests and worksheets you can also obtain a two or three hole punch and you will be able to insert items that were not prepunched for you good luck in the new term Monster Manual Windows 2000 Battle of France File folder Gmail Knife Freenet Industrial engineering Scientology beliefs and practices System 7 (Macintosh) Quicksort Mac OS X Grommet Seismic retrofit Windows Explorer Tobacco MegaMan Battle Network 5 Printed circuit board Climbing equipment Object Desktop Insertion sort Stamp collecting Spam (electronic) Macintosh Finder Chernobyl accident GED Contract Fialka Punch card Bluetooth Uploading and downloading SpamAssassin Floppy disk Legal research Slashdot trolling phenomena System/36 Standardized testing Royal Assent Book of Kells Limit Break Test (student assessment) Marching band Polish September Campaign Slot machine System 6 Xerox Star File system Bible Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Bible code The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Bong Freedom of Information Act (United States) Belt (clothing) Sorting algorithm Condom Yearbook Medical record The Price Is Right Windows XP Hogwarts subjects Tab Punch (engineering) USB flash drive No Child Left Behind Act Betting (poker) Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons Education in Sweden Dungeons & Dragons manuals Piccolo Junior Saga Prime number Graduate school Windows Vista Neopets HTML element Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tab (GUI) Lotus Notes Casting Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Unconscionability Spanglish PlayStation Portable Metal Gear (video game) Grade (education) Web page Getting Things Done Debugging Screw Continue (video games) Dominion Cascading Style Sheets Spotlight (software) Mouse (computing) RX-78 mobile suit series The Time Machine Machine tapers Prostate cancer San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
