i am really worried about high school points best answer i'm starting soon i don't know what to expect what is it going to be like please answer i'm seriously freaking out what happends on the first day do you make tons of new friends any advice thankss ok dont worry its all going be ok when i first started highschool i felt the same way and hearing how people panic on tv shows about starting highschool only mad it worse but i knew that i had no other choice but to try and think positive being a freshmen in hs is not as hard and scary as it sounds its actually pretty fun because unlike transfering from one school another most of the people are new to the school and know no one there and so its very simple to make friends and fit in with the rest on the first day its akward like every first day of school but eventually as the week goes by u'll find that u've made a lot of new friends by the end of the first week so dont worry about it just be happy and enjoy the rest of ur summer because highschool is not what people say it is its actually much better good luck sweety Education in Romania The Ashlee Simpson Show The Beach Boys Pitaten Shaggy dog story Kodocha FoxTrot 2000 Australian Grand Prix RuneScape quests Weezer Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) The Apprentice 2 Highschool!
