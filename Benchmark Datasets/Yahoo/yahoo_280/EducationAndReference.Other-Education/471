why don't kids under type in english anymore it worries me i am trying to read questions or postings and sometimes i have a very hard time reading and understanding the way people type the subject matter usually tells me it is a young person writing or they will reveal their age and it is always between and years old is it because it is cool to leave out grammar and punctuation or is there a problem with the english education in the public schools shouldnt you be embarassed if you write so unintelligibly i don't know its really hard to think of people like that as my equals being sixteen i fall right in the middle of the chat speakers but i myself prefer not to use it i think it makes you sound stupid you cannot honestly expect someone to take you seriously when you type like a first grader the grammar and language is not cool it doesn't make you seem anything than other than un intelligent i don't think that our school systems our to blame i think it is more habit when you talk to someone on instant messenger it is more convenient to use shorthand to converse however when people stat using that outside of personal conversations it gets to be obnoxious and annoying to others if you want someone to take your questions answers and opinions seriously than you need to use proper grammar spelling and english to communicate not internet shorthand Singlish American and British English differences Esperanto as an international language English grammar Chinese language Social rule Leet Instant messaging Aphasia Finnish language Indian English Hearing impairment Greek language Newbie Pinyin Lie English language Theory of conduct Persian language Hindi Written Cantonese Cantonese (linguistics) Korean language Philosophy of language Hiberno-English Indonesian language Writing system Vietnamese language Ojibwe language Turing test Dutch language Japanese language Polish language Shit Plame affair Kodocha Chinese written language Surveillance The Fairly OddParents Esperanto grammar Hungarian language TOEFL Arabic alphabet Internet Romanian language Welsh language Chinglish Chinese spoken language Internet Relay Chat The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll Spanish language Quebec French Education in the United States Interlingua Multilingual MSN Messenger Slovak language African American Vernacular English Social software Non-native pronunciations of English Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Little Britain Noam Chomsky Pronoun Hanja Spam (electronic) Joke Karl Rove Ben Johnson (athlete) Ido English as a lingua franca for Europe Standard Mandarin Education Tetragrammaton French language Independent school (UK) Urdu Hebrew language Deconstruction Classical Chinese Shorthand Greeklish Lojban Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Translation Danish language Russian language Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Originalism Philosophy of mathematics Password Dialect Manually Coded English Norwegian language Liaison Gender-neutral language
