does anybody know the difference between c c c and c mouth piece for the trumpet well i have been playin the trumpet for about years now and i heard that the more that u progress u should get a lower numbered mouth piece and i just wanted to know what the difference was between them all the more experience that you have playing the trumpet the more air you have learned to put thu the mouth piece you will begin to learn to get your air from your diaphragm and not from your lungs which will not let you hold your notes as long so when you begin you will need a bigger mouth piece so you can get all the air into the trumpet you can get and also as you grow your mouth will to and thus you will need a smaller one so none of the air goes out side or around your piece it is kind of like a clarinet player and reeds when you are a beginner you will need a size and then you progress into a different size if you hold up a sheet of paper and you blow on it and it is a heavy paper you will need more air to make it flutter as a piece of paper that is thin does not take as much air to make it flutter or move with the wind or air you are blowing on it the same goes with a mouth piece that you use the stronger your lips get and the more you use your diaphragm the smaller size mouth piece you will need and the better sound will come out and it will be pure and clear as to muffled and forced and you can hold your notes out longer Clarinet Trumpet Big band Saxophone Mouthpiece Harmonic series (music) Trombone Harmonica Hornbostel-Sachs Flute Woodwind instrument Bong Bassoon Bagpipes Transposing instrument Alto horn Authentic performance Diving regulator Timpani Violin Mute (music) A Day in the Life Concert band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rigging Vowel Pneumothorax Marching band Two-stroke cycle Drowning Wood Cornet Cello Manner of articulation Oral sex Anemometer Breaststroke Vibrato Western concert flute Ney Carburetor Shogi Textile manufacturing Traditional animation Go (board game) Stuttering Backstroke Tetrapod Horn (instrument) Front crawl Microphone Double bass Music genre Chopsticks Lung Paragliding Scuba set Drill bit The Waterboys Recorder Puberty Internal ballistics Axial compressor Musical instrument classification Reed (music) Respiratory system Weather lore Taikyoku shogi Voiceless palatal-velar fricative Oboe Dominoes Equine conformation Mattress Bass clarinet Chess strategy and tactics Kitesurfing Brass instrument Gramophone record Loudspeaker Viola Anton Webern Glass Conducting Gaida Skateboarding trick Terminal ballistics Phil Collins Key (music) Brass band Pet Sounds Mario Davidovsky Miles Davis Diving suit Radio controlled airplane Ko shogi Warrant Officer Fixed-wing aircraft Jazz Tet Offensive
