highschool c uhm my first day of highschool is this friday any advice on being a freshman joining clubs sports studying friends all highschool stuff my advice be yourself no one likes someone who turns out to be a fake just walk in smiling and everyone will like you from the start just don't suck up to the teachers too much you want to seem like you're on the side of the other students with clubs and sports it should be relatively easy to ask someone about them like a new friend who is in the spanish club or the field hockey team or whatever as for studying i would totally suggest doing all of your homework and honestly putting some effort into it since whatever happens from the moment you step into those doors goes on your record and things might happen you don't want colleges to see yes i know it seems really far off but these four years of your life will go by incredibly fast so yeah if you need any more advice drop me a line i've been out of high school for a year and i'm starting my sophomore year at bucknell u oh yeah one more thing be open to change since a lot of things are going to be different from now on Jon Secada Student Lynbrook High School Little Britain She Loves You Bucknell University Shaggy dog story Michigan State University Social rule Yearbook Education in the United States Playoff Merrimack College Can't Hardly Wait Theory of conduct Brown University Secondary education The College of New Jersey Columbia University The Citadel (Military College) Sport Boston University Washington State University Clements High School Trinity College, Dublin Columbine High School massacre FoxTrot Georgetown University Kyle Broflovski Texas A&M University University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Hiberno-English J.P.
