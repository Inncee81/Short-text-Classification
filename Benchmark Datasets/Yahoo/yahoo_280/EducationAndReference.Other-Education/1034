should schools require uniforms or enforce stricter dress codes well i'm a year old girl so you can probably guess what my answer to this is no uniforms i don't mind a strict dress code since there's a lot of slutty girls in mini skirts and guys with pants down to their knees but where do you draw the line when does it stop from setting some rules for decency to telling kids what they can and can not where we kids don't get a lot of say in what we learn what classes we take what school we go to but we do get a say in what we look like so why would uniforms be any better for us or do you agree it depends where you live for me they definitely have to lighten up a bit i was suspended for three days for wearing one skull shirt t t Social aspects of clothing School uniform Japanese school uniform Suit (clothes) Trousers Avenue Q Islam and clothing Jesuit College Preparatory School Hogwarts Skirt and dress Boy Scouts of America Pantyhose Marching band Football (soccer) Irish dance Hijab Softball The Hockaday School Kilt Mixed martial arts Gurkha Contingent Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Education in Romania Culture of the United States Scrubs Policing in the United Kingdom Teen Girl Squad The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Toronto Transit Commission Kyle Broflovski Basketball Jewish services Dunman High School Volleyball Military uniform Okashina Okashi Theory of conduct Brigham Young University Warrant Officer Raffles Institution Eton College Plame affair Swimming pool Clothing Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Recess (TV series) Singapore Police Force Code: Lyoko Canadian Armed Forces Modern Western square dance The Warriors St. John Ambulance Humphrey Bogart Raffles Girls' School (Secondary) French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Harrow School White-collar worker Child pornography Class (computer science) Article One of the United States Constitution Paul Is Dead Friends Buckingham Palace Japanese tea ceremony Milton H.
