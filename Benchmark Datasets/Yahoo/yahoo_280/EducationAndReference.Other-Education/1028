do employers care if you have a minor in something on your resume i know that your major as well as your experience is what's important when job hunting but if you also have a minor does that help for instance a major in marketing and minor in communication i ask you because my mother was telling me that i shouldn't waste my time getting a minor because it's only about hours of education in that particular field of interest and that an employer doesn't care about the minor what do you think if you're experienced can you please share if you're an employer please share your view s hello i am an employer as well as the owner of an educational consulting company that does work in college admissions and counseling as an employer i believe that a minor suggests that a student made effort beyond what was required in order to learn about a subject that may be relevant in a future career as an educational advisor no education is a waste of time i completed three majors in college and did so in four years if you are truly committed to becoming the best potential job candidate i would suggest that you pursue additional education such as a minor in communications in conclusion declaring and completing a minor cannot hurt you and it may even help you secure a position one day good luck Graduate school Plame affair Affirmative action Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Paralegal Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor Divorce Lawyer Academia Economic inequality Hillary Rodham Clinton Education in Portugal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mach kernel Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Unemployment Karl Rove Extreme Programming Physician Education in Germany Third party (United States) Labour economics Equal Protection Clause Abortion debate Single Transferable Vote Consensus decision-making Community college Education in the United States Software engineering Cooperative education Gross domestic product George W.
