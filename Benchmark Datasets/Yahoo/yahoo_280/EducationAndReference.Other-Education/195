overall what is really better private school or public school i've heard that some of the most misbehaving kids are in privat school so i look to public school where the quality of education is horrible and lacking i want the best for my future kids so give me some pros and cons which do you think is really the best one i think its really a matter of opinion on this one if you can afford a year to put your kid in private school kudos to you i have two kids and personally i can think of several other things to spend a year on than education plus the cost of uniforms and books i wouldn't want to bust my butt and work plus hours a week to put my kids in private school and never see them because i am working to keep them in there public school is just as good private schools are for the ones that can afford it and don't want their children associating with underprivileged kids kids are you kids rich or poor some parents are just too ignorant to see that i knew several girls boys that came out of private school into public school in high school and they turned out so bad my niece also has had several problems with the after school care my sister in law had dcf called because my niece was touched by a fellow male student it happens in both public and private as far as the education goes my niece also has a speech problem and after two years in private school has yet to improve she is and my daughter who is and her speech is much better but i wish you the best of luck and hope you find the school that fits you and your familys needs School choice Boston Public Education in Australia Terri Schiavo No Child Left Behind Act 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Independent school (UK) About a Boy Charter school Publicly funded medicine The Fairly OddParents Education in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Education in England French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Theory of conduct Hikikomori Education voucher Education in the People's Republic of China Private school Education Class in the contemporary United States Poker jargon Child abuse Public education Brown v.
