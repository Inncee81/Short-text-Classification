will award best answer i look back with hind sight and wonder what i should do and should have done when i got out of high school i joined the army spent years in and got out because i did not like being a specialized grunt it took me years to get a job at a department store partly because i could not swallow my pride enough to want to work there or any place like it i wonder if i had not joined if it would have made any difference i would still be working at a department store i would just be higher up on the chain instead of just being a traineee i consider what i did before much harder then what i do now i wonder if i should have taken the easy way out and just got a job at a department store i could always go back in the army with a desk job mos and make the same pay and more then i make now and do less harder work all i know is i am thinking seriously about starting school for an auto body tech i just want to save a little money first i am just wondeing what path i should choose and what i have chooses should i always try to find the easy way out like some people around me don't feel guilty about not being able to swallow your pride you've done a great thing with serving our country i believe that is the biggest thing anyone could ever do in their life and to me you deserve better opportunities after serving our country all military personnel deserve better opportunities after serving our country did you learn a trade in the service did you attend a school there if auto body is your passion and you love cars and trucks then i would go for it your heart has to be in it or it won't work for you as far as the 'easy way out' per say some people love living on the edge and taking risks and sometimes unnecessary risks in life but there is nothing wrong with trying to make your life easier for yourself my gosh you have been through what i would believe to be the most intense training anyone could ever imagine being in the service so if you want to take things easier now a days with you being out of the service by all means do so you deserve it but just to make you aware that sometimes what we want out of life we do need to take some risks and not the easy way out i believe if you follow your heart in what you want to do with the rest of your life whatever career that may be you will succeed at it what ever choice you make in your life if it's the easy way out or charging through the hard stuff it doesn't make you less of a person if you take the easy way out only if that's what you truly want i like what will smith said in pursuit of happyness he said if you want something in life go get it period that movie is not only a true story and not only a great movie but it has a great message out there for everyone i think you will be just fine just choose something from your heart and go get it keep positive and open minded and you will achieve greatness good luck to you ps as a person who greatly appreciates any one who serves our country i want to thank you for taking the time to do so god bless you Theory of conduct Social rule Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Justification (theology) Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten A Course In Miracles Summa Theologiae Capitalism Goodness and value theory Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theodicy Procrastination Tenshinhan Alcoholics Anonymous Grand Theft Auto (game) Jon Secada Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Scientology beliefs and practices 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sola fide Economic inequality Graduate school The Apprentice 2 Original sin Shaggy dog story Hey Jude Current teachings of Prem Rawat Meaning of life Kimi Finster John Howard Yoder Labor theory of value The Amber Spyglass Nicomachean Ethics Numerology Care Bears Microeconomics Surveillance W.
