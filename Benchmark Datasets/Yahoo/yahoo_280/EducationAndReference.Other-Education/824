should i move before my senior yr of hs ten point for best answer i need more opinions ok i've spent two years at my high school in ri and am in the top of my class i have also made many great friends however i'm almost definately moving after my junior year to ny where i will spend my senior year i have made many friends to where i might move because my family lives there and that is where i spend much of my summer however their hs doesn't have italian i'm in italian honors next year and italian eep sr year so at my new hs i won't have a language my sr yr because they have no italian will this affect my college opportunities will this move affect my class rank and gpa because schools weight classes differently this hs is more competitive will new high schools look at my transcript and actually weight my grades how they weight theirs or will i just not be counted in the class rank or even just moved unfairly back in rank because they didn't weight it right now i'm in the top of my class should i move with all the effort you've put in to being successful at your present school and considering the class standing that you've attained you are right to be concerned about potentially losing that standing when you're on the verge of graduating your class standing and course availability at the new school could have a dramatic impact on which colleges admit you and the amount of financial aid you may receive i recommend sitting down with a counselor or talking on the phone or via e mail from the new school to find out exactly what will happen with your grades transferring and approximately where your current grades will place you in the new school if the answers are not satisfactory do you have relatives or a close friend with whom you could stay and finish at your present school if the answers are satisfactory then you want to consider whether or years at the new school will be best for you from a social perspective being the new kid's always tough but a second year is not likely to make a big difference good luck Grade (education) Education in the United States Graduate school High school New Trier High School Education in the People's Republic of China Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy College admissions The Citadel (Military College) GED University of Central Florida Law school Education in Hong Kong National Certificate of Educational Achievement Bowl Championship Series Inflation Pitaten Appeal Single Transferable Vote Education in Germany Microeconomics Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Japan Voting system University of Connecticut University of Michigan Affirmative action Dr. Michael M.
