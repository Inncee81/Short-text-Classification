im not sure if i should take my ged im years old and im already supposed to have graduated but i didnt have enough credits my school requires credits and i still need about credits still school has been stressing me since forever and im not sure if i should just take my ged test or wait even more longer to get a diploma i want to go to a community college and then transfer to a university if possible would it matter if i didnt have my diploma becuz i heard community colleges accept people with geds im in such a stressful pickle right now and i just would be thankful for any kind of advice consider this each semester thousands of students in each state request a transfer from their community college to universities during that evaluation process they look at everything with a fine tooth comb your grades in college your grades in high school your test scores etc do you think they won't notice that you opted to take the geds over graduating high school proper also consider this college is significantly tougher than high school if you find high school stressful college will most likely be even worse my suggestion finish up high school if you really are serious about going to college then finish up high school and then move on you'll be more prepared for the next step this way if nothing else you won't have a black mark on your record that states you opted to take a shortcut when you could have just as easily finished high school the regular way GED Education in the United States High school Community college Graduate school Education in Germany Juris Doctor College admissions Advanced Placement Program Medical school Grade (education) SAT Education in Malaysia Education in Taiwan Education in Finland National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in the People's Republic of China Kwantlen University College Ontario Academic Credit Massachusetts Institute of Technology Law school Education in Australia Stuyvesant High School Middle Tennessee State University Students' union New York State Department of Education College Test (student assessment) Homeschooling Associate's degree Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Secondary education in the United States Australian Qualifications Framework Master's degree Student loan Education in Canada Education in Singapore Education in Sweden Brown University IB Diploma Programme Hunter College High School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Japanese tea ceremony Physician Prostate cancer Lynbrook High School Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science No Child Left Behind Act Law School Admissions Test ELO rating system Athabasca University The Citadel (Military College) Affirmative action Pennsylvania State University Missouri Academy of Science, Mathematics and Computing Trinity College, Dublin Secondary education UCAS Education in Austria University of Alabama Teacher Seneca College Education in the Republic of Ireland Graduation Welding Hampshire College Academic term American University Second language acquisition Appeal Education Tulane University Anglo-Chinese School Overclocking Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Education in France Program for the Exceptionally Gifted Marching band College Board Graduate Record Examination Bachelor of Arts Academic degree Quizbowl Dentistry Barrister Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination Salt Lake Community College Numerus clausus Hostos Community College Ohio Wesleyan University New York University Martial art Western Kentucky University Bologna process
