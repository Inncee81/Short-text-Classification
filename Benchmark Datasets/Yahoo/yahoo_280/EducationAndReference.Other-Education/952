a question for nurses and midwives do you like your job why would you recommend it to others i practiced as a nurse before doing midwifery i hated nursing it depressed me how ungrateful many people were for their care how the elderly are neglected how many people are coming from abroad to abuse the nhs how many nurses and doctors were physically attacked or sworn at how the shift patterns were unfair and i often had to work over time without being paid for it how there are so many staff shortages yet they are still cutting back on nurse and midwife recruitment you can forget about having a social life thats for sure then i trained as a midwife and guess what people are still abusing the system and are rude and ungrateful its really sad a lot of my collegues have left or are considering doing so me included the crappy pay is just not worth all the abuse there are aspects of the job i enjoy but the negatives far outweigh the positives im afraid to say if you are thinking of training as a nurse or midwife i would say unless you are a true saint dont waste your time or energy Midwifery National Health Service Childbirth Nursing Nurse Medicare (Canada) Medicine Publicly funded medicine Clinical depression Dead Like Me Health insurance Psychiatry Borderline personality disorder Social rule Drug abuse Physical therapy Child abuse Infantilism Nursing home Mental Health Act 1983 Breastfeeding General practitioner Socrates Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medieval medicine Adoption Education in the People's Republic of China Hillary Rodham Clinton Cult Knots Landing Florence Nightingale Gender role Breech birth Physician Piccolo Junior Saga EastEnders Exploitation National Institutes of Health Ranma __ characters Obstetrics Education in Portugal Urinary incontinence Postpartum depression Economy of the United States Goodness and value theory Unemployment Psychoanalysis Division of labour University of Manchester Prostate cancer Paralegal Arguments for and against drug prohibition United States Army Substance abuse Public health in mainland China History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Rent (musical) Keynesian economics Secretar__a de Inteligencia Pitaten Health science Prenatal care Microeconomics Henry Dunant Anorexia nervosa Theory of conduct National Insurance Spanking Margaret Sanger Education Health profession Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Terri Schiavo Graduate school Anger management George Brown, Baron George-Brown Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Psychiatric hospital Ambulance Health care in the United States Prostitution Conscription Inflation Economic inequality Transsexuality Stoicism YuYu Hakusho Simone Weil Neuro-linguistic programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pontiac's Rebellion Scientology beliefs and practices Polygamy Jayant Patel Anxiety The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Password Capitalism
