question about college loans and jobs im going to college in the fall and i was wondering if i can get a loan to pay off my college so i dont have to work while im in school the reason is because i want to go to school full time which is four years so i dont think i can work if i need time to do homework and study think its a good idea thanks for evey answer yes and no i did the same thing that you are about to do and i regret it i wish i would have just worked and took care of my financial debt as it occurred you need to weigh out two things is it possible for you to work and go to school full time if not then you are going to have to get loans if you can work are you dedicated enough to keep your grades up and miss out on some social activities again if not you need to get the loans the problem with loans is that you literally forget about them then when you get out of school and you are thinking about all of this money to be made and getting a new car and a house ect you realized that you still have to pay off those nagging college loans so my advice is to avoid them if you can do it now for one more bit of bonus advice if i were you i would look for a nearby junior college or community college to take your first two years these colleges have transferrable degrees and can save you thousands of dollars over going straight to a university when you finish at your community college you will be ahead of your peers already you will have an associates degree while they have no degree yet and you will transfer in as a junior just like them only with little or no debt this is a great way to save big and even gain an advantage from it i hope this helps and if you need any more advice let me know Education in the United States Mortgage Student loan Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Avenue Q Deflation (economics) Community college College Education in Germany Hyperinflation Mutual fund Life insurance Portsmouth F.C.
