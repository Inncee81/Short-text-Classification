can anyone help there is a full time course i want to do i am a mature student i have not been able to do it before now due to looking after my son who has learning emotional problems this course that i have wanted to do for years i couldnt do cause i didnt want to ruin my chances by not being able to give it my full attention my son is now and going to college himself so perfect timing for me but due to his age now i have to claim jsa and the job centre are saying that i cant do study for more than hrs a week or i receive nothing from them because i wouldnt be actively seeking work my argument is i had no choice but to stay at home with my son he had no school until the last years because nobody could help him i had to provide the help he needed before i thought of myself wouldnt you think the job centre would encourage us to better myself so eventualy i could get stable employment that would better my life and not have to rely on anybodys help does anyone know a way around this yes you can claim a bursary which will probably be a similar amount to jsa if you go to the college student support services they will tell you the best way to go about claiming other than that you can claim income support which again will be a similar amount you should be entitled to other benefits too you should contact your local welfare rights officer they will tell you all benefits you are entitled to and will even help fill in the forms there are so many unclaimed benefits because people just don't know about them you can find your welfare rights officer through your local council these people know everything about benefits and will ensure you get what you are entitled to good luck with your course and well done for making the move into education as a mature student Unemployment benefit Unemployment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Affirmative action Minimum wage Labour economics Education in the People's Republic of China Voluntary Student Unionism Capitalism Economic inequality Same-sex marriage Scholarship GED Students' union Hikikomori FairTax Tai Chi Chuan Consensus decision-making Community college Education in the United States Trinity College, Dublin Externality Israeli Arab Social Security (United States) Fathers' rights Jobseeker's Allowance Graduate school Education in Hong Kong Microeconomics Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Civil rights Homeschooling Independence Party (Iceland) Anarchism and capitalism Hawkman Criticism of libertarianism Past teachings of Prem Rawat National Certificate of Educational Achievement Childlove movement Welfare Free trade Corporate personhood Academia Politics of Canada Call centre U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Caulfield Grammar School Education in Germany Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Justice Society of America SAT Democracy Corporate governance University of Bristol Progressive tax National Insurance Labor theory of value Public policy School choice Plame affair Franz Boas Separation of church and state Technocratic movement Education in New Zealand Lincoln-Douglas Debate University of Nottingham Students' Union NHH Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Elections in the United States College admissions Administrative law of the United States Politics of the United States Anti-intellectualism Extreme Programming Copyright Social work Altruism Gay rights Alexander Technique London mayoral election, 2004 Osteopathy Breastfeeding Galactic Civilizations Socrates Grade (education) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Social security Privatization Indian nationality law Divorce Single Transferable Vote The New School at West Heath Prostate cancer
