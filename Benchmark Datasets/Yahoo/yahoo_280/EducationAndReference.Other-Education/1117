plz tell me about the academic system in usa like when does the session begins and how one gets promoted to next class how many classes do one has to pass before going to any college university there are both public government operated and private tuition based schools each locality runs its own school system so there is quite a bit of variation nevertheless the most common system is to have two semesters per academic year generally the first or fall semester begins at the end of august or beginning of september and runs through december or january the second spring semester begins in january and ends in may or june some schools are on a tri mester system but this is more common in college there are academic years before admission to college most areas also have a kindergarten program to get children used to going to school before academic work begins kindergartners are typically years old after that there are grades through ending with graduation from high school students are promoted from one grade to another based on their accomplishment in the current grade some schools have also permitted social promotion where students are passed along to the next grade regardless of their performance but this is getting less common many schools now have standard tests to ensure that students have mastered certain key subjects i hope this helps good luck Academic term Graduate school Education in the United States Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Juris Doctor Education in Taiwan Education in Romania Kindergarten Medical school Education in Canada High school Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Hunter College High School Education in Portugal Law school Students' union College admissions Tulane University Cornell University Education in Japan Brown University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affirmative action Public education Lawyer Master's degree No Child Left Behind Act Education Carnegie Mellon University Education in Sweden Education in France University of Houston Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Stuyvesant High School Duke University Physician A-level American University Ontario Academic Credit Brigham Young University Education in Austria Hopkins School Education in Malaysia Bologna process Culture of the United States Professor University of Central Florida The Citadel (Military College) Private school Miami-Dade County Public Schools National Certificate of Educational Achievement Johns Hopkins University Harvard University Quizbowl Western Kentucky University Virginia Commonwealth University University of Michigan Columbia University SAT University of Pittsburgh Advanced Placement Program Education in Finland University of Alabama Secondary education in the United States Education in Qu__bec Taipei American School Simon Fraser University University of Arizona Washington University in St. Louis Homeschooling Standardized testing Georgetown University Kwantlen University College Glen Ridge, New Jersey University of Bristol Lowell High School (San Francisco) Experiential education Shreveport, Louisiana Education in Albania United States Air Force Academy North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Gwinnett University Center University Independent school (UK) Tripartite System Dallas Baptist University University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Higher education in Japan
