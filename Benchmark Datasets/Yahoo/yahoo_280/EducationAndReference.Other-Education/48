if you intern at a place the whole summer does that allow you to do other things that summer like maybe working at starbucks or something like that i'm thinking of interning at nih oh yeah definitely next year depends on how flexible nih is with their schedules are you thinking about doing it this summer or next year it's probably too late to do anything for this summer now but if you're planning this for next summer i can't imagine nih being anything but flexible because i'm sure they don't have any interns for then but anyway when you're scheduling you also don't want to do too few hours per day i'm currently interning for congress and i'm the only intern who works full time so i get perks like helping out on legislation and getting to go along to events while the others who come in for less than four hours a day get to scan business cards so given the two things above i'd say the best solution would be to intern full time for a couple of days a week then work at wherever you want for the other days i'd also make sure the days were continuous like if you were planning on three days a week do monday wednesday rather than monday wednesday and friday staffers are always less likely to give you good assignments if you can't be relied upon to finish them now if you were willing to take stuff home it'd be a totally different ballgame anyway just extend some feelers out to nih when you're talking to them and just ask upfront it never hurts say that you're completely committed to them and that they're the first priority but you were wondering if there was a way you could do something else while being able to make the maximum amount of impact for the office best of luck Extreme Programming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Holiday Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Open access The Ashlee Simpson Show Fasting Cliff Richard Liturgical year Hebrew calendar International Date Line Monday Night Football Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Ken Jennings Soap opera Social rule Gregorian calendar 1896 Summer Olympics The Daily Show Daylight saving time Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Wednesday Weight training Wal-Mart Good Friday August 2005 in Britain and Ireland International League Rosa Parks Easter Jon Secada Operation Market Garden Video game developer National Institutes of Health Fathers' rights Caribbean Carnival United States House of Representatives Calculating the day of the week Saturday Night Live Friday Call centre UK Singles Chart Monday Kurt Angle Ron and Fez Paul Is Dead Satchel Paige Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Plame affair Time Out of Mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vietnam Veterans Against the War Days of the week She Loves You Robert L.
