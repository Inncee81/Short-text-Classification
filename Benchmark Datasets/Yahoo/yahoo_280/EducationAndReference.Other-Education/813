why do schools favor the primary parent divorce especially those earning more income don't they teachers staff and administrators realize how difficult this is for the student in the u s many students come from dual or two family households the secondary parent does not like to be treated unfairly and out of the loop and the child does not like witnessing this joint shared custody secondary parent lives in different city due to job child goes back and forth sounds like you are speaking from a specific experience and i'm not sure i can answer your question without more information in my experience although my husband and i are together the school personnel typically directs personal correspondence to me as i am the parent that most often appears at the school to volunteer attend meetings and signs the notes we send back in to the school the school sends home one 'packet' of information for each student and expects that whatever 'internal' communication that needs to happen between parents whether living together or separate will happen as long as there is no court order to the contrary both parents have an equal right to information from the school and to participate in their child's education if you are not receiving the information from your child's other parent then make an appointment with the teacher and brainstorm how he she can get the information to you this may involve some work effort on your part but the teacher should be so grateful that you want to be involved that they are willing to do their part too some possible suggestions the teacher keeps a manilla envelope with your name on it and deposits all the regular notes announcements in it that are sent home during the week you pick the packet up at the school on friday leaving the envelope for the next week if picking it up is not possible go ahead and prestamp a stack of envelopes for teacher to use to mail them to you once a week if the teacher communicates via email ask to be added to the email list ask the principal to add your number to the phone message list that way you'll get those telephone messages about special events and pta meetings make sure the teacher has your phone number and knows to call you too anytime she's calling all the other parents if you're not getting respect from the teacher talk to the principal if you're not getting respect from the principal call the county office and ask to speak with the person who supervises the principals that's usually pretty effective good luck Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China E-mail Voice over IP Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Homeschooling FidoNet Direct marketing School choice Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Password Education in Germany Surveillance GSM services SAT Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Cindy Sheehan French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses ARPANET Secondary education in France Divorce Public-key cryptography Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Gmail Education Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Email authentication Teacher Child support Sender Policy Framework Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Internet fraud Communications protocol Wheel of Fortune Education in Japan Religious Society of Friends Boston Public Karl Rove Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Charter school Short message service Pretty Good Privacy Quizbowl Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Catechism Intelligent design movement UK telephone numbering plan Appeal High school Israeli Arab Graduate school Skype Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam Packet switching AppleTalk Cellular network Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Lord Chancellor Modem Plame affair timeline Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Spam (electronic) Separation of church and state Franklin W.
