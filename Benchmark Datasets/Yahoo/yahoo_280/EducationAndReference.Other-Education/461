starting college in a few weeks what to expect i start classes at dvc a community college and i'm just curious to know what i should expect classes assignments teachers other students attending help i'm nervous i suppose that you can expect classes will be harder than high school some will seem interesting and relevant to you and some will not teachers will not be teachers but professors and that makes a big difference teachers teach professors profess in college the only person who is responsible for your learning is you other students will be like you and different they will be fearful worried excited smart at some things and not so smart at others lazy and not so lazy depending on the day and the subject if you are lucky they will be from all different places and you can expand your world by knowing them if you don't like anyone at your current school you won't like any of them if you enjoy lots of people at your current school you will enjoy lots of them the most important thing to know about what to expect is to know what you expect of yourself be ready to listen get organized or get behind study understand that what you do from day one will affect everything when you need help don't whine go get help love learning enjoy every day even the tough ones because education is a privilege go do have a wonderful life Education in Germany Education in the United States Professor Teacher Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Education Current teachings of Prem Rawat College Education in Japan SAT Asperger syndrome Graduate school Tai Chi Chuan Community college Avenue Q Enneagram Homeschooling Past teachings of Prem Rawat Reiki Extreme Programming Milton H.
