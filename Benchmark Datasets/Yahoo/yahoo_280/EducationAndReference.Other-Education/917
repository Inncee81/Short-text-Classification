how can i write a good opening for an essay without sounding cliche i am intending to study abroad in costa rica this spring but as part of my application process i have to write and essay about why i want to study abroad i have a pretty good idea what the body of my essay is going to be but not a clue how to open and close these are my weaknesses would it be too cliche to start with a good quote if i can find one please help aw thank you guys you are so helpful now i just have to get off my lazy but and write it ug i'm stuck again part of the reason i want to study abroad is b c i want to get a taste for traveling in order to prepare me for a career where i could travel but this will be hard to elaborate on considering i have no freaking idea what i am going to do after college other then travel lol my other reasons include wanting to learn spanish and wanting to learn more about costa rica it is an incredible country wow okay i'm giving you an answer idea but keep in mind it has been forever since i've written something like this you could definitely elaborate on the bilingual thing it's a very marketable skill in many big cities and then tie it into how this could only enhance your ability to be a good candidate for travel in your future job this may be broad enough so that you don't have to state exactly what you want to do but you could make that a strong point too in other words being bilingual with travel experience could get you ready for a multitude of professions and would be useful in many different fields your job opportunities could be amazing when you are writing get pumped about the thought of going your enthusiasm will start to come out in your writing and will draw your reader in hope that helped a little good luck Spanish language Software engineering Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Calvin and Hobbes Costa Rica Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Mnemonic Multilingual Second language acquisition Franz Boas Milton H.
