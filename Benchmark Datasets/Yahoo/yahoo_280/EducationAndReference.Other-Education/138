what kind of clubs would you join in high school i am a freshman and i dont no so help me please join anything that you find interesting if you like photography try yearbook if you like acting join drama if you like to help save the earth join an environmental club some high schools even allow you to start your own club if they do not have anything that interests you a caveat however don't waste your time be active in these groups and go for leadership positions whenever possible when applying to college you will have to list all of your extracurricular activities and what you did in them so it is better to start as soon as possible and have an active hand don't fill them up with clubs that you think will look good and don't assume that more is better colleges want students that are focused and dedicated to their passions and that are willing to be leaders Yearbook Education in the United States Franklin W.
