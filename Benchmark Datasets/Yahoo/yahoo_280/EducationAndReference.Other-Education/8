do you believe that state universities should put the local community people that pay taxes first for example the university of florida has many programs that require a gpa to get in and some only have say spots open but apply i do not like the gpa requirement i think if you live in the state of florida and in the county where the college is you should get first in as long as you have a gpa in addition i think that florida residents should get free tuition to any state college what do you think i thank that any resident of any state should get free tuition in their stste i think that the gpa requirement is fair because that ensures that anyone wanting into the program is willing to work hard enough to get there i also think that all students should get free tuition to their state universities that's what it's like here in new mexico any student that graduates from a state high school with at least a gpa gets years of free tuition provided that they maintain a through that time we're really lucky the state lottery pays for those students however a lot of them slack off and lose their scholarships very quickly which is unfortunate Education in the United States Grade (education) Student loan Tuition Graduate school HOPE Scholarship Affirmative action College admissions Scholarship Education in the People's Republic of China Kwantlen University College Middle Tennessee State University University of Michigan University of Central Florida University of Florida California Polytechnic State University Medical school School choice Franklin W.
