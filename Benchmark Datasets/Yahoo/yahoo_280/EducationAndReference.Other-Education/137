would cooking at school be helpful to be a dietitian i am interested in becoming a dietitian and i know i have to take maths chemistry and biology but it says nothing about cooking and i have asked people do you think cooking would be a good subject to take to be a dietitian i think that would be a great way to practice what you preach coming up with healthy food items complete with prices and spices with a no salt low salt or low potassium diet etc would be a great way to see how hard it is for people to cook right especially when it comes to a low income i know low potassium diets are a real bear on a budget especially when oranges bananas and canned tomato products are so easily available i think you're thinking ahead of the curve and i like the way you're thinking something like this could bump up your marketability as a new grad to a better job because it shows your dedication to your craft good luck i hope you can pull it off Potassium Dietitian Raw food diet Microeconomics Food Veganism Tofu Cuisine of Africa Vegetarianism Organic food Tomato Healthy eating Food preservation Labour economics Cuisine of the Southern United States Cheese Stomach cancer Inflation Chili con carne Commodity markets Cuisine of Malaysia Edible salt Economy of the United States Omega-3 fatty acid Macrobiotic diet Atkins Nutritional Approach Cantonese cuisine Sodium chloride French cuisine RuneScape skills Mathematics Ramen Ketchup Plastic Hamburger Bread Hypokalemia Banana Vitamin C Sauerkraut Nutrition Cuisine of the Philippines Supply and demand 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kosher foods Keynesian economics Aluminium Peruvian cuisine Knife Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Barbecue Mayonnaise Prostate cancer The Apprentice 2 French fries Coca-Cola Pottery Salad Tariff Gross domestic product Electrophysiology Salt Economy of Russia Refrigerator car Giffen good Hamster Ecology Supply-side economics Common bean Fire extinguisher RuneScape quests E number Monopoly The Coca-Cola Company Shrimp farm Diet soda Fanta Medicine Economic history of Canada Potassium chloride Graduate school Campbell Soup Company Luck Garlic Professional wrestling slang Milk Bengali cuisine Diet Coke Unemployment Rice Fancy rat Internal ballistics Cuisine of Singapore Cooking Cajun cuisine Marginalism Soul food Genetically modified food Trans fat Potassium iodide
