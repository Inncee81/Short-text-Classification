help when am i going to stop quitting my jobs i've had three jobs this year calling people to get them to donate blood answer all kinds of calls even for a ministry that had us praying for people and then trying to get them to buy things or make donations calling people on the phone to do surveys about anything from snack cakes to pest control i've had to work crazy hours and i haven't made enough money and right now i'm tired i'm tired of quitting jobs but i know i won't advance or thrive on them i only get them to say i have a job i don't even make enough on them to pay off the stupid credit cards i got in college i want to go back to college but i want to work too recently i had an interview with an airlines company i had phone interviews being a flight attendant could totally change my life i've never made over buck an hour in my lifetime and they get paid over but they have limited hours it would take me away from here but i wouldn't be able to go to school and i don't want to retire at as a flight attendant i know some people who have had really good jobs making good money but when the company closes down or they get terminated they have to start all over again with a degree i'd have a better chance i just don't know what to do and i look like a loser upside of being a flight attendant it is a fun job you get to travel to new places meet new people and fly for free now for the downside of the job it is a lot hard work passangers and other fas are not nice you work a lot of hours and the pay is really low for what you are actually doing i worked as a flight attendant and i was guaranteed flight hours a month my pay was an hour but i only get paid for flight time so if the flight is only hours you get paid for just that time i would work to hours days however because the flight time was only for a total of hours that is all i would get paid for for the first couple of years you will probably sit reserve which means you would be on call for hours a day and only get paid for of those hours i am not say that it is not a good job i love it i only left because i decided to go back to school to become a teacher if you want more info on being a flight attendant email me at txldybug aol com good luck The Amazing Race Social rule United Airlines Flight 93 Poker jargon Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Surveillance Married... with Children Craps Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Anderson Cooper 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Ocean's Twelve Unemployment Delta Air Lines Airline Internet fraud Avenue Q Kodocha Friends Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Air traffic controller Graduate school Humphrey Bogart Playoff Game show Sharon Tate Hyperinflation Monopoly (game) Ben Johnson (athlete) Wal-Mart 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Pitaten Wheel of Fortune Education in the United States Athenian democracy The Sims 2: University America Online Advance fee fraud Muslim ibn Aqeel Make money fast Eddie August Schneider Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye MMORPG Current teachings of Prem Rawat Apollo 8 Price discrimination Blonde on Blonde Student loan Little Britain Professional wrestling match types Capitalism Winning Streak Paragliding John Forsythe Cindy Sheehan Satchel Paige Ryanair Meat Loaf Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
