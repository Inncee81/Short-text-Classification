i'm a freshman in high school any advice ok i'm going to a huge high school they have gyms an auditorium complete with a balcony and a lunchroom that's half the size of my elementary school it's big i'm going to be in two unfamiliar classes this year chorus and japanese i'm really excited but school is in two days and i think the nervousness has kicked in open house is tonight but i don't think that'll help much i'm back on the bottom and proud i might add and that's always tough there's another problem though there's this guy he's had a crush on my for ever he wants me to call him every night i have a boyfriend he's annoying and when i call him all he talks about is tv blahh i don't know what to do he rides my bus and i'm going to be going to the same school with him help how do i get him to leave me alone being on bottom again is humbling but it's going to be a continuing theme throughout your life how you handle it is up to you make new friends get involved and enjoy all the new opportunities this huge new school has to offer you in two weeks you'll forget all about being nervous as for the guy problem tell him you have a boyfriend and it's not fair to him if you're calling some other guy all the time and don't call yes you will still see him and it's ok to be cordial and polite in public but make it clear to him that you want him to leave you alone it will be hard at first but eventually he'll adjust just be firm and be consistent just like when training a dog hehe The Ashlee Simpson Show Undergrads Social rule Can't Hardly Wait Friends EastEnders Recurring South Park characters Boston Public Shaggy dog story The Emancipation of Mimi 1957 World Series Piccolo Junior Saga Knots Landing American Pie (song) Kodocha Waylon Jennings Megan Griffin Little Britain The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Fleetwood Mac Humphrey Bogart Great Teacher Onizuka Meat Loaf Queen (band) Eric Bischoff Neighbours Big Brother (USA TV series) Memorial Stadium, Clemson Thermal power station Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Andrew Dice Clay Sandy Koufax Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Hulk Hogan Late Night with Conan O'Brien Extreme Programming NWo Hunter College High School Family Guy Azumanga Daioh Education in Japan AFI 100 Years series New York Giants Oasis (band) Education in the United States Welcome Back, Kotter Rod Stewart Springfield Elementary School W.
