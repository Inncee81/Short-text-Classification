if i know nothing about us history yet taking an honors us history class how can i please read before you comment the thing is my english teacher signed me up to honors american history she's always rambling about how good i am with essays and how i behave well see the thing is i grew up in a terrible school where teaching was not involve and now i'm currently in a new great school that teaches i passed english with an a so my english teacher put me in honors american history i believe it's but as good of a well behaved student i am i have several learning disabilities and i'm stress and nervous about going to honors did i mention i'm going to english honors as well so my regimen is to study until school begins aug th i'm in this great website www thehistorynet com i'm in the quiz section and taking notes and i will review them daily let's not forget i have other things to study such as math and science till school starts so where in this website or other should i begin to prepare myself i no so little about u s history please thank you i am sorry the correct website link should be historynet com and no i cannot change into a regular class history isn't that hard i was in honors history for a while in high school and i found it just had more emphasis on names and dates and places which is just more memorization if you can do well in english you can do well in history when i went to college i found that i had to learn american history all over again in high school history everyone was a hero everyone had good motives everything that happened in america was good in college we learned that historical figures didn't always act from the best motives just as they don't today it was a whole different look at history so how you learn history depends on how it's taught i don't know what they're teaching kids these days but if you read books on american history you'll find there are several views including different opinions on what is important what things influenced history etc the internet is a great resource i wish we had it when i was in school not just one website like historynet but you can google any person or event and get several different angles on it since you're already a good student you know that your teacher will be more pleased if you come up with your own view rather than just repeating whatever is in the book good luck i'm sure you'll do fine Education in the United States Homeschooling Education SAT Education in Taiwan A Course In Miracles Marshall McLuhan Education in Japan Aikido Graduate school Social psychology Education in the People's Republic of China Theory of conduct Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Romania Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat College The Standard Alexander Technique Columbia University No Child Left Behind Act Sydney Riot of 1879 Noam Chomsky Anti-intellectualism Martial art Milton H.
