nervous about school ok i'm taking an oral communications class and i'm really not a person who is comfortable to be infront of crowds or small classes but the main reason i'm nervous is because i'm really not the skinniest person in the world actually i'm pretty chunky i have a belly and i really care about what people think about me i just get so nervous that people think of me like that and getting in front of people so they have a clear view of my faults gets me nervous is there any way i can calm down can someone tell me what i can do to just forget how people percieve me trust me everyone no matter what their body type worries about how they look in front of a crowd when you make your speeches put some emotion into it work hard on your work if you seem like you know what you're talking about other people will notice too it won't be long before they're focusing more on what you're saying than what you're wearing if you want to be calmer before your speech try doing a few meditation exercises one of them is just sitting in a chair and allowing each body part to tense up close your eyes and just allow yourself to bunch up all your body parts do this in your class or the bathroom if you don't want other people to see when you are completely tense allow each body part to relax in the same way take deep breaths while you're doing this and your body should feel really relaxed and mellow when you're done good luck Social rule Anxiety Urinary incontinence Tai Chi Chuan Insomnia Theory of conduct Meditation Anger management Equine conformation Sento Strap-on dildo Humanist Movement Friends of the Western Buddhist Order The Ashlee Simpson Show Fecal incontinence Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Massage Lucid dreaming EastEnders Stuttering Dog training Insulin Transcendental meditation Zazen Shaggy dog story Capital punishment Milton H.
