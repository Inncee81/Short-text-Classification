what are some education programs i am wanting to get some sort of education that doesn't take terribly long to get something much shorter than getting a degree preferably that would allow me to make more in the work force i know that going to learn how to do hair takes about a year but thats too long and expensive as well would getting a commercial driving license be a good idea what would be some kind of short education program that would allow me to get a better paying job even getting an associated degree would take too long at lease two years i'm thinking months or less any field other than striping haha thanks how short do you want it to be remember the easier and shorter the qualifications are to get the more there will be with those qualifications the harder it will be to get jobs in that field and the lower wages will be simple supply and demand what are you good at what do you like doing answer these questions and it will help narrow down your choices get any job in your chosen field and study part time the qualifications may take years to but they will be worth it as you progress in your studies you should be able to get promotions and your work should help you with your studies don't sell yourself short also remember that god has a plan for your life he will give you wisdom to choose the best path for you just ask him Education in Portugal Microeconomics A-level Economics Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Romania Education in Australia Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Supply and demand Extreme Programming Master's degree Inflation Password Education The Apprentice 2 Socrates Lawyer Coercion Education reform Paralegal Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology Expert system Anthroposophy Nurse Medical school Labour economics Economic inequality You Don't Know Jack Law of value Efficiency wages Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Keynesian economics Affirmative action Principal-agent problem Software engineering Labor theory of value Copyright law of the United Kingdom Education in England Quizbowl Education in Finland Theodicy Good Times Education in Sweden Goodness and value theory Ra (board game) Physician GED Say's law Original sin Marius Education in the United States Rich Mullins Bologna process Supply-side economics Professor Public policy Hyperinflation Education in Hong Kong Redundant array of independent disks AmigaOS UCAS On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Quicksort Simone Weil Game programmer Teacher System/36 MP3 Economy of Russia Anchor Free will Social rule Industrial engineering BASIC programming language Land use forecasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mach kernel Deflation (economics) The Ashlee Simpson Show Community college Alcoholics Anonymous Predestination Apprenticeship Jewish principles of faith Church of Christ Canadian Senate Incarnations of Immortality Education in Malaysia Tax Architect Cooperative education Strap-on dildo
