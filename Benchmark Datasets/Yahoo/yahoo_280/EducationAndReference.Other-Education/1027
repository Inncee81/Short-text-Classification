does anybody have any tips me being a sophmore in highschool alright i just finished so hopefully i can be of some help for you your friends will change they will most likely get new friends because of their class schedules my advice try keeping those friends but you shouldn't have to work hard to keep the friends you love also try making friends not necessarily to replace them but to more or less keep you from feeling replaced do not procrastinate classes get harder especially if you are starting ap courses my advice stay organized and put school first i know it is hard to do but it gives you one less thing to worry about talk to your teachers and counselors teachers and counselors can be very helpful especially when college references come around my advice with teachers i'm not saying make time out of your day to have long conversations with them atleast greet them with counselors let them tell you if there are classes that you still need to take i still have to take health senior year and thats going to suck because i didnt know we had to take it no one takes health senior year at my school begin to look at what interests you sophmore year you may need to pick some things over others because there are not enough hours in the day my advice just do what you love and that makes the day go by shorter do an extracurricular activity do anything from a sport to a drama club it is a great way to make new friends that like what you like my advice don't let the amount of hours of practice scare you in the end it will be a valuable thing you will make new friends and colleges like people who participate in extracurricular activities don't let people keep you from the things you love who cares what people think if it makes you feel good my advice realize that these things make you feel good if people dont like it screw them i seriously hope this helps i know i wrote a lot but it felt good letting some things out that bothered me good luck with your school year this site will tell you what you can do sophomore year to help with college http www collegeboard com student plan action sophomores html Education in the United States Social rule Student Education in Romania Avenue Q Procrastination Hopkins School The Adventures of Pete & Pete Boston Public Jon Secada College admissions Yearbook Friends Hunter College High School Lynbrook High School Current teachings of Prem Rawat About a Boy Kodocha Singlish Secondary education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Weezer Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Great Teacher Onizuka Tai Chi Chuan Teacher Pitaten College Roomies from Hell!!!
