student using cell phone on school bus okay ive had a cellphone forever probably sense i was like or so i'm now and i have to ride the big yellow bus to school how fun and it's an half hour ride recently my bus driver has said that we are not allowed to call people on the bus or even text what is up with this i mean i do it anyways when shes not lookin it dosnt bother me much that she yells at me when i'm cought and threatens to 'write me up' it's just annoying that i was using my phone on the bus for years and all of a sudden i cant i talk to other people friends students who ride other buses ran by the same district they dont have a problem with using there phones is it illegal in nj for students to use their cell phones while on public school buses ok so i wrote this up a little quickly without going over it twice when i use my phone on the bus it's always on vibrate i always talk quietly and i never use inappropriate language i do not think it is illegal no she is in charge of the bus and can make the rules however ask to see the principle and tell him what the situation is tell him it is a long ride and you have always done it and you do not know how it is a problem and perhaps you are not understanding something and wonder if he could explain it to you it may be that she is just power tripping and by approaching it a mature lets get this resolved matter you will get to use it again Mobile phone The Adventures of Pete & Pete Social rule Short message service Octopus card School bus MetroCard Electrophysiology Public transport Bogot__ Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Contemporary culture of South Korea Japanese mobile phone culture GED Sin City Software engineering Bicycle lighting Transportation in Beijing Transportation of Los Angeles Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Articulated bus Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Global System for Mobile Communications Morse Code Vegeta Philosophy of language Gmail 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Garfield Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Pattaya The Catcher in the Rye Rosa Parks Poker jargon Fuel cell Charles Ives Desegregation busing Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Traumatic brain injury The Magic School Bus TriMet Pledge of Allegiance Big Brother (USA TV series) Brian Lenihan 24 (television) Mobile phone radiation and health Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Billboard (advertising) Driver's license U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Generation Y Azumanga Daioh University of Minnesota The Amazing Race Hybrid vehicle Hitchhiking Telephone directory Telephone numbering plan Zeno's paradoxes Telephone Chinglish Toyota Prius Bus rapid transit Spam (electronic) Bike lane debate Hard disk Perl Avenue Q Recurring South Park characters Action potential Citizens' band radio The Inside Tag Eurotrip Transactional analysis Battery (electricity) Censorship in Australia Montgomery Bus Boycott Bay Area Rapid Transit American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Cognitive science Philosophy of mathematics 9-1-1 French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools 21 July 2005 London bombings San Francisco Municipal Railway IPod Charter school British sitcom Computer bus Chuck Cunningham syndrome Futari wa Pretty Cure Hiawatha Line Surveillance University of Massachusetts Amherst Battery electric vehicle
