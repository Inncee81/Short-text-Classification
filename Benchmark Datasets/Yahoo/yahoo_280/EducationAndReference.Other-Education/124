do colleges notice freshman year grades well i am going into my sophmore year in high school and i am starting to think a little about college well my freshman year last year i did not try at all i started out with all a's and two b's but it went all down hill because i started worrying to much about what my social life and now about my school work well my question is do colleges take notice of the freshman year to much these next three years i am going to buckle down and get my very best grade but will this affect anything or no thanks colleges do look at freshman year grades however the first thing they will look at is your overall gpa if you apply yourself through the rest of high school you can pull up your overall gpa and demonstrate your overall ability then if asked about your freshman year grades you can explain that it took you awhile to figure things out in high school but that you got the hang of it and improved your improvement and overall gpa will make the difference for you good luck Student Grade (education) Education in Germany Law School Admissions Test Graduate school Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement Advanced Placement Program College admissions Chiropractic SAT Georgia Institute of Technology Belmont Abbey College Dazed and Confused (film) University of California, San Diego New Trier High School GED Secondary education in the United States The Sims 2: University High school University of Southern California Test (student assessment) Affirmative action Law school Stern School of Business Middle Tennessee State University Education in Canada Education in Sweden University of Connecticut Standardized testing Extreme Programming College Medical school Education in Singapore Johns Hopkins University Lynbrook High School University of Georgia The Citadel (Military College) Ateneo de Manila University Brown University University of Central Florida Harvard University Phillips Exeter Academy United States Academic Decathlon Pitaten American and British English differences Jevon Kearse Montgomery Blair High School Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Dr. Michael M.
