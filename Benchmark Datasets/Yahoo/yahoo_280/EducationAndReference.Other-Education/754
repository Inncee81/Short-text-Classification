tips on making a list to a teacher who is writing my college recommendation i'll admit that i'm not close enough to any of my teachers for them to write me an extremely good recommendation i do talk to some of them outside of the classroom but it's not like in the movies where we are friends although some of the people in my class are almost there if i made a short list of things to remind my teacher what type of a person student i am and well i'm not sure i'm just hoping you guys can help me out a bit what are some things i should include so my teacher can write a better rec any other tips and suggestions are also welcomed thanks i would always suggest picking an english teacher to write your recommendation in almost all cases they're the best writers around teachers are used to writing recommendation letters i'm sure the teacher you've talked to has written dozens for the most part they should know what to say already i'm sure giving the teacher a list highlighting your positive attributes wouldn't hurt but i don't think it will help too much basically just let your teacher write their letter they have a lot on their plates so don't bug them about it but do make sure you get it in time to send it off with your college applications good luck Theory of conduct Social rule Logo programming language The Adventures of Pete & Pete Visual Basic Teacher College admissions Python programming language PaX Columbine High School massacre Education in the People's Republic of China Avenue Q Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Bowing (social) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Graduate school XML Kodocha The Fairly OddParents RuneScape quests Aesthetic Realism Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Education in the United States Team Fortress Classic Friends Grade (education) Plame affair Education Treehouse of Horror V Education in Japan Oh My Goddess!
