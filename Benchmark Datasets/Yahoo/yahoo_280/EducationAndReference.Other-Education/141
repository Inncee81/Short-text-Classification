title for essay can anyone help me think of a clever title for my research paper on elementary education i need something a little more interesting than elementary education before any of you give me that as a title i haven't really done any research yet my professor insists that we think up a title before we actually get into writing the paper it's really difficult for me to do it that way we need more details give me your thesis statement what did you find in your research i think i am the greatest paper titler in the world you either need to know the slant you will apply to your research i am of the ilk that says you can find the answer your looking for no matter what and there is no such thing as objectivity but let's say you are by the book and do your research without any predilection as to your findings well in that case you need to write the paper before you title it if you already have an idea of what you will find then give me a thesis and i'll give you a title for instance if you found that elementary schools suck because of the lack of equal resources property tax funding here's a good title mortgaging their future a history of inequity you might replace mortgaging with red lining which is a practice real estate agents use to keep undesirables out of a given neighborhood but if you did this you'd have to include a digressive anecdote about that racist practice if you did a namby pamby feel good essay on inner city teachers making a difference you could give it this title armies of one a history of teaching against all odds but like i said more details ok update your instructor is either retarded or i am misunderstanding something no research paper should have a title before it's written because ideally you do the research and then come to an opinion it doesn't really work that way but teachers work in ideals what i think he wants is to find out what your topic is within elementary education so he can tell you if you are biting off more than you can chew or if youy are being lazy so what he really eants is your topic and probably doesn't give two turns about the aesthetic aspect of your title so think of a topic not a title then name your paper based on the topic you still have to have a topic elementary school education in general is too broad he can't expect you to do a research paper on its entire history get more detail from your instructor on what he wants i have offered two sample topics and titles above inequity in elementary schools sample thesis tax code maintains the racist status quo or profiles of individual elementary school teachers who succeeded in the classroom against all odds there are a million figures like this jaime a escalante is one they made a movie about him called stand and deliver this is a little off topic but a great source for you would be frank mccourt's teacher man it is filled with anecdotes about the teaching profession he taught elementary high school and college and is a fantastic story teller the truth is you shouldn't worry about a title until you have a topic at the very least if it really is a research paper on the entire history of elementary level education and that's your required topic you are screwed because that's a book length topic and the title is the least of your worries but here's a few anyway rearing intellect a history of elementary education or founding thought on elementary education or keystone lessons elementary pedagogy through the years or teachers usually start out with ideals but get run down by the system and end up resenting their students and giving up but it doesn't matter because most teachers are woefully under qualified and are paid like it and they are not held accountable because teacher certification evaluation is full of crap and standardized testing and no child left behind doesn't help because all it does is change the way teachers teach so they wind up just helping kids beat a test as opposed to learning anything useful assuming your topic is not chosen for you once you have your topic give your teacher a tentative title until you have a thesis and once you have a thesis which as far as your teacher should be concerned can only rightly be expected after you've done your research then put a final title on the thing your title is an introduction to your paper and subject a sample of what's coming inside what the tone will be and how it will handle its subject here are a bunch of topics in elementary education beside what i have already suggested dominance of women in teaching profession at elementary level the founding of the american public school system busing of students to integrate schools school vouchers standardized testing of grade school kids effects of no child left behind poor quaity of rural schools failing rural schools certification process for elemntary school teachers use arkansas during bill clinton's leadership as example teacher union and its effect on the quality of education elementary school curriculum book burning in elementary school curriculum in schools run by evangelicals i sincerely hope that something in there helped Education in Germany
