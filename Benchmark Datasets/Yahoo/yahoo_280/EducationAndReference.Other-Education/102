any mathematic or science facts all i want is some education if anybody is good at mathematics science post a response to find the vertex and roots of a quadratic equation all you need to know is how to complete the square fact the quadratic formula is overrated opinion Quadratic equation Cubic equation Polynomial Galois theory Quartic equation Complex number Square root Elementary algebra Mathematics Joseph Louis Lagrange Imaginary unit TeX Quadratic sieve Vedic mathematics Clifford algebra Golden ratio Newton's method Quintic equation Parabola Ordinary differential equation Ruler-and-compass construction Pythagorean theorem Leonhard Euler Root mean square Quadratic form Ruffini's rule Algebra Root-finding algorithm Catalan number Carl Friedrich Gauss Triangle Glossary of graph theory Constructible polygon Newton's identities Zero-knowledge proof Arthur Cayley Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Graph theory Archimedes Pell's equation Calculus Quaternion Number theory Conic section Numerical analysis Root of unity Julia set Logarithm RLC circuit Irrational number Matrix (mathematics) Group theory Continued fraction Function (mathematics) Linear regression Gaussian period Pascal's triangle Exponential function Timeline of mathematics Combinatorics Pi Split-complex number Optimization (mathematics) Vorlesungen __ber Zahlentheorie Group (mathematics) Logic Fibonacci number Many-worlds interpretation IP (complexity) Gravity Prime number Laws of Form Mathematical logic Standard deviation Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Henri Poincar__ G__del's incompleteness theorem Real number Regular polytope Geometry Modular form Trajectory XSL attack Ideal class group Graph (mathematics) Black-Scholes Planar graph Supersymmetry Atiyah___Singer index theorem Kurt G__del Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Linear least squares Pierre-Simon Laplace Augustus De Morgan Rabin cryptosystem Determinant Bayesian inference GED Hamiltonian path
