how do you learn proper grammar when you are i have struggled with grammar my entire life i was an excellent student and had a high gpa but i did poorly in english maybe it is just that i am a product of government schools i am very self conscious about it it is very hard on here because i get told a lot about how bad mine is i accept my faults how do you go about learning when you are my age i have adapted to slang and even southern slang more so i think i type better than i talk lol i just don't know what i should do or how to do it thank you it is a studied effort and a person is never to old to learn new things i think what you want to do is not used the slang words the choice is up to you and may come in handy when dealing with people in business or those on the internet i have a kind of rule of thumb i write as i speak it is who i am and if the slang you use is not racist or out right vulgar then i think that you should be true to yourself Slang LOL (Internet slang) English language Finnish language Shit English grammar Romanian language Profanity French language Esperanto as an international language Theory of conduct Hiberno-English American and British English differences Hearing impairment Avenue Q Manglish Hungarian language Illegal drug trade German language Hebrew language Spanish verbs African American Vernacular English Standard Mandarin Germish Grammar Alan Campbell (pastor) Register (linguistics) History of the English Bible Spanish language Russian language Japanese language Arabic alphabet Canadian slang Leet Singlish D'ni Sanskrit Grade (education) Meaning Transactional analysis Contract bridge Nicomachean Ethics Euphemism Anne Rice W.
