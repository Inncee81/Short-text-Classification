for those who majored in business did you find accounting tougher than calculus i managed a b in calculus but i have my financial accounting final tomorrow up studying i'm doing well it's just i feel it's tougher anyone think this class was a task ah a s in both semester of calculus took accounting and it was the hardest course i had ever taken it made me so upset that i wasn t getting it that i put so much effort in the class i got an a including extra credit but it was truly the toughest class and i earned the grade let me share with you why i think people like us have a problem with accounting remember in calculus the rd or th chapter that dealt with applications of derivatives with the word problems they were harder than anything we had done prior because it was a new way of doing things same goes for accounting it s a new and awkward way of doing math all those debits and credits on the left or right it s hard to memorize them and actually we shouldn t at some point it should simply click and then it becomes easy i think as math buffs we got shocked when we saw accounting is harder than expected we should deal with it as something simple and not over complicate it in our mind i hope that makes sense best wishes on your final Calculus Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theory of conduct Logic Manifold Bank Education in Romania Philosophy of language Education in the United States Process calculi Jumpstart 3rd Grade Social rule Natural deduction Model (economics) The nature of God in Western theology Jaime Escalante Mach kernel Curry-Howard HyperCard Money Science General relativity Password Microeconomics Mutual fund Propositional calculus Boston Public Secondary education in the United States Financial services Polynomial Physics Requirements analysis Combinatory logic Procrastination Archimedes Citigroup Advanced Placement Program Geometry Operator Situation calculus Education in the People's Republic of China Hopkins School The writing of Principia Mathematica Commodity markets Extreme Programming United Kingdom corporation tax Deconstruction Massachusetts Institute of Technology Graduate school Gottfried Leibniz Zeno's paradoxes Computer and video game genres IBM PC compatible Normal distribution Complexity classes P and NP Epistemology Doomsday argument Joe Clark Capitalism Integral Principal-agent problem Kwantlen University College Credit card Domain theory Strategic management Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Lebesgue integration Gender-neutral language Frame problem Ordinary differential equation Computer-supported collaboration Garbage collection (computer science) G__del's incompleteness theorem Computation The Apprentice 2 Divorce Standard deviation Utilitarianism Ashton-Tate Accountancy Education in Taiwan Fractional calculus Bond Monetary policy Ethics Knowledge representation Action (physics) Lambda calculus Ontology (computer science) Dog training Wayne Gretzky Tensor Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Calculus of variations Spice Girls Babe Ruth Vishnu sahasranama
