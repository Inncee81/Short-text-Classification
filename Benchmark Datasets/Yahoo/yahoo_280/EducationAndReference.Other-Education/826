what do you think is more interesting playing or reading explain your answer okay i'm an 'old' lady but i'm going to answer your question and you may be 'surprised' by my answer first i always have a book i'm reading as soon as i close one i put it onto my shelf and open another and start reading i was taught how to 'speed read' in the th grade and i love to be able to 'escape' this world through books i also love to 'play' and my husband and i actually 'plan' to go to 'fun places' to play on weekends since he must work during the week sometimes we go to a movie sometimes we go shopping and sometimes we just go to a park to sit and 'watch the boats go by' on the water we also like to go 'puddle jumping' yes we are 'old' but we do actually jump into puddles and we do it 'wherever there are good puddles and we often tempt others to 'jump in' too or just stand 'looking in wonder' at something or sometimes nothing just to see how many other people we can get to 'look' at what we are looking at and of course we play at home mostly 'computer games' i play wow with my husband and sometimes alone plus i have many other games word games tile matching games board games that i play as if they're 'work' to keep my brain 'active and functioning at a high level ' there's one other thing i 'do regularly' i come to y a to 'answer questions ' i'm a psychologist so many of the questions i answer from a 'professional standpoint' some i answer from something i 'did' in the past raising kids animals plants cleaning carpets professionally etc and some are like your question you may 'assume' that only 'other kids' will answer but i did and you may begin to 'realize' that no matter how 'old' you get things like 'reading' and 'playing' should be an 'important part' of your life no matter how 'old' you get because learning and doing keep you young so i may be but i'll always be 'going on ' Quizbowl Avenue Q $ale of the Century Extreme Programming Philosophy of language SAT Consciousness About a Boy Theory of conduct Yu-Gi-Oh!
