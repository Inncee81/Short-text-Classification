question about trading in a calculator i have a ti but i want the new pink one and we paid so much for the one i have now tht i cant just toss it aside i want to get the new one before school starts so i cant wait and sell it at school do any stores like staples or best buy have something like playdo's closet where i can trade my calculator in or sell it or something so id get some money back to put toward the new calc girl pick up the phone and call the store or just go there no one except the store people will know but i am sure if you did not buy it in there they wont take it so maybe you need to find a local store when school starts you actually sell it in school which is better Wal-Mart Bond Option Margin (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Bulk vending Tesco Internet fraud Mutual fund Gross domestic product Wheel of Fortune ITunes Music Store Money Commodore International Neighbours Best Buy Retailer Trade The Inside Stock Palm OS Trapped in the Closet Surveillance Animal Crossing Minor characters in Morrowind Supply and demand Currency Microeconomics Hewlett-Packard Asian financial crisis Illegal drug trade UK Singles Chart PE ratio RuneScape economy Los Angeles Kings Monopoly (game) Video game crash of 1983 Poker jargon Derivative (finance) Futures contract Annuity Capitalism Short selling Avenue Q Option style American individualist anarchism Craps Mad Money Revco Paramount Pictures Cable television Sears Holdings Corporation Security (finance) Taxicab Warren Buffett MapleStory Financial markets Prostitution Friends Gambling Black-Scholes Surplus product Supermarket Estoppel Topps Tag Dial M for Murder Finance TradeWars 2002 TLC GSM services Auction World Trade Center bombing The New School at West Heath Calculus Castle of the Winds Ocean's Twelve Mortgage Electronic commerce History of computing hardware Slot machine James Hanratty Back to the Future Part II Gold standard Enron Corporation Externality RISC Citigroup Confidence trick Dazed and Confused (film) Argos (retailer) Surplus value RuneScape locations Timeline of the Enron scandal Payphone CPU design CPU cache WWOR-TV Political economy
