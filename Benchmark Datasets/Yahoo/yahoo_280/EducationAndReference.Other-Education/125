is there anyway to get a good grade in alegebra i suck at alegebra and i want to get a good grade in it cuz my math grade always lowers my gpa especially the alegebra crap what embroi is saying is you have to study study study even if it's by yourself and only half an hour at a time study turn off the music and get a paper lots of it and a pencil write down the questions like a x b whatever and do each step one by one ya do the easy ones first and learn from that take notes in class every thing the teacher puts on the board you put in a notebook that's why it's called a notebook the only way to learn something whether it's a song a poem or a school subject is to memorize it by repitition do it over and over again algebra can 'almost' be fun once your brain knows how it's done and you will use it a lot as you grow older Grade (education) GED Education in the United States Mathematics SAT Education in Germany Murdock-Portal Elementary School United States Academic Decathlon National Certificate of Educational Achievement Marching band Education Graduate school IB Diploma Programme Craps Dyslexia Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Education in Taiwan Secondary education in France Education in Japan Homeschooling High school New York State Department of Education Advanced Placement Program Notebook A-level M.C.
