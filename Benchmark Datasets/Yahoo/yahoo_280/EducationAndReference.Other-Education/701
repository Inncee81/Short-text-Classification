what do you say in a reference letter about yourself i asked someone to write one for admissions into a nursing program and he asked that i write it and he will sign it it feels weird boasting about myself plus i'm not sure these are things he would say about me write your qualifications schooling gpa caring person important for a nursing program and your character also mention your experience even small jobs like cutting grass mention in what capacity this person knows you as a teacher employer etc it is not uncommon for someone to ask you to write your own reference it's less trouble for them and also they figure you cannot object to anything they say seriously you should feel flattered that this individual trusts you to this extent they probably want to be sure they do not leave out something that is one of your significant accomplishments i actually had a billion dollar corporation call me to ask what kind of worker an applicant was the individual had just finished college and had no major work experience but i could not believe they wanted to know how well he cut my grass i could tell them that he had taken care of my yard for four summers that he was very thorough and dependable always on time etc they said that was just what they wanted to know so don't overlook the little things that show your character in a favorable light you may want to look at some sites that will give you ideas for writing a recommendation http www naceweb org public reference htm http www salisbury edu careerservices facstaff writingreferenceletter html http www businessballs com referencesletterssamples htm s Graduate school World Wide Web Grade (education) Cross site scripting Law school Education in Portugal Uniform Resource Locator Education in the People's Republic of China Filename extension Affirmative action Economic inequality Paralegal Economy of the United States Law School Admissions Test HTML Education in the United States JavaServer Pages Wget Education in Germany Drama Patent Theory of conduct Social rule Software engineering Efficiency wages File format Common Unix Printing System Website Philosophy of language CPU cache Current teachings of Prem Rawat Infantilism Baseball Milton H.
