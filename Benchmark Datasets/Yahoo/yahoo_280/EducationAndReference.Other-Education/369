little brother issuses help my little brother is and is doing awful in school in a few weeks he starts his first year of high school i'm very worried about him and his studies i think that if he read a little more he would be better off or if he just paid attention and studied a little more i know one way to help is to be a god example and to help him when i can but next year i'm going to be five hours away in my first year of college what is a big sister to do please give me some advice so that i can help him and my parents whom i love but are worthless when it comes to some of his harder subjects like math it's great that you care so much for your brother you may want to talk honestly with him about your experiences in high school tell him some things that helped you to increase his reading maybe start a little book club with him choose books that you think he will enjoy you also read them so you can have discussions with him about the material you can do this via email or phone too when you are at college as for help with homework talk to your parents about your concerns many schools now offer workshops or tutorials in subjects like math and science for parents they are geared at giving parents the tools to help their children with homework have them look into that also do you have anyone at the high school that helped you like a counselor or teacher if so contact them and tell them about your brother ask them to check on periodically it doesn't hurt to have an adult looking out for him finally stay in touch with him let him know that you are only a phone call or email away if he needs someone to talk to Education in Romania Education in the People's Republic of China Shaggy dog story Education in the United States Education in Germany Education Kodocha Homeschooling The Catcher in the Rye Education in Japan Hunter College High School Saved by the Bell Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Domestic violence Gmail SAT Mathematics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer XML Infantilism Surveillance Theory of conduct Boston Public Bristol Grammar School Milton H.
