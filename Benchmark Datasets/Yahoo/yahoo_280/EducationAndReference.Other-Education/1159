c's and some d's throughout high school good college i have a high iq and i constantly told by my teachers i am extremely smart yet extremely lazy and unmotivated i really have been depressed this summer going into my senior year because i dont want to become a joke of a person i want to make my parents extremely proud i want to live and work in my place of love manhattan i want to be the best i can be because i know i am different than most people i just do not feel my grades reflect any hint of my wisdom nor my intelligence i recently took the sat and barely prepared infact i really didnt even prepare and got in the high 's my parents constantly ask me why i dont share my genius and i just shrug my shoulders and say i wish i knew i feel like i can be an amazing person a role model for a lot of people i want to get into a great public private school or atleast a suny such as geneseo or binghamton but i just do not know how i need to show them i am a step above other humans that i am not like the rest help i really believe that you can be all that you think you are but you need to do something to stop the drift now if i were you i would do two things get tested for a learning disability and see if you could be helped pharmacologically for depression you need to see a psychiatrist for an assessment i'm not saying get all drugged up but if you are really depressed you will get nowhere take it from someone who has been there a big reason why many people don't do well is that they are underchallenged and become unmotivated and it is a vicious cycle college may very well be the place where you shine if you have had c's and d's throughout high school you aren't going to get into the colleges you mention right now no matter what you do rather than going to a really bad year school go to a community college for two years and transfer to a place of your dreams if you want to you can go to a community college out of state so that you could live where you want and still move in the direction of your goals just find out what the best year college is and apply there Education in the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Asperger syndrome Gifted Pitaten Clinical depression Mental retardation Boston Public Intelligence quotient High school Homeschooling Motivation Social rule Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Friends The Fairly OddParents Education in Taiwan Education in Germany Theory of conduct Socrates Education in Romania The Death Gate Cycle SAT Saved by the Bell Kender Transactional analysis State University of New York Charter school Marilyn Monroe Ethics Education Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Miami-Dade County Public Schools Extreme Programming W.I.T.C.H.
