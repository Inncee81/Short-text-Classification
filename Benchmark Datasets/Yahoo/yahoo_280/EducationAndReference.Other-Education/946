how long does it take to learn piano grade for somebody who is a quick learner but has no knowledge of reading music one average how long would it take lessons are like for an hour and i would love to learn to grade but i am worried about the cost d thanks in advance i think the average is a grade a year that's if you have one half hour lesson a week and you take things gradually and build up from the basics including scales theory and everything obviously it involves quite a bit of practice too i had lessons minutes a week for years and although i didn't actually take any formal grades my teacher said i was at around a grade possibly working towards a when i stopped like everyone else has said you would just have to see how it goes if you really enjoy it and practice lots i don't see why you couldn't take a couple of grades within a few years good luck p s finding a cheaper teacher could sort out the money problem my lessons were only each that was only half an hour but it would probably be worth looking around maybe even consider half hour lessons cos if you put the practice and time in at home and that is what will lead to you getting better then you only need a teacher to show you how to do something so that you can put the work in at home to show them the finished piece next week if that makes any sense sorry i've rambled on a bit Music lesson Grade (education) Education in the United States Extreme Programming Education Sergei Prokofiev Education in Romania Second language acquisition Social rule Philosophical skepticism Graduate school Alexander Technique Lesson Propaedeutic value of Esperanto CPU design Education in the People's Republic of China Time Out of Mind Scientology beliefs and practices Erik Satie Current teachings of Prem Rawat Music Education in Hong Kong Humphrey Bogart Driver's license Piccolo Junior Saga GED Theory of conduct Carl Barks Solomon Keal Hogwarts Suzuki method 24 Hours of Le Mans No Child Left Behind Act The Fourth Way Ceroc Socrates Hey Jude Learning Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Milton H.
