im starting berkner high school and im kinda nervous do u have any tips for me im scared about not having lunch with my friends or getting lost stuff like that the berkner highh school in richardson is actually a very good school its huge it has alot of different people from different backgrounds and more than likely you'll like it if you are going to be a freshman dont worry about getting lost its pretty easy to find your way through berkner even though its a huge school as for the cafeteria you will find friends from middle school and trust me all the freshman actually everyone will be kind of nervous for lunch if they dont know where to sit i gurantee you that you can sit anywhere and no one will care but you'll find other people like you to sit with everyone else is nervous too so it really wont be a big deal my advice is dont go on the first day acting like you are all that because that will just make yourself look stupid say hi to anyone even if they look like ppl you dont usually hang with smile at everyone dont try to act cool or something you are not just be yourself p s everyone will get lost just make the best of it if you get lost dont freak out just kindly ask someone where to go they wont count tardies for the first wk if it really bugs you about getting lost come to school early like around and walk through to all your classes just make the best of every situation and meet new people you dont usually talk to try to be nice to everyone and you'll make new friends in no time good luck Shaggy dog story Kodocha Social rule RuneScape quests The Ashlee Simpson Show Singlish The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Lynbrook High School Father's Day (Doctor Who) AFI 100 Years series Columbine High School massacre Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Teen Girl Squad The Austere Academy 1957 World Series The Beach Boys Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Futari wa Pretty Cure Theory of conduct Cliff Richard Kim Possible The Smoking Room The Empty Child Steve Nash Relative clause Can't Hardly Wait RuneScape Mini-Games Poker jargon Spidey Super Stories Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Humphrey Bogart Recurring South Park characters Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Time Machine Minor characters in Morrowind Treehouse of Horror V The Lovely Bones Good Morning, Vietnam Heathers Therion (band) Undergrads Mid-levels Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Pitaten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Education in the United States Rose (Doctor Who) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bad Wolf Insomnia Extras (sitcom) Blood on the Tracks Rich Mullins Inception of Darwin's theory Witches (Discworld) Colony in Space The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear Great Teacher Onizuka Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Camp Lazlo Doug Beaches of Hong Kong Jesuit College Preparatory School Care Bears Mnemonic Full Metal Panic?
