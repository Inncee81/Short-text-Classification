i am a sophomore and i was wondering if my freshmen grades will affect me when i apply to college i am sophmore and durinf my freshmen year i got bad grades however during the next year i plan to get better grades will my freshmen grades make it harder for me to get a scholarship for college or even not allow me to get in to a good med school they will be considered but bad grades will not preclude you from consideration by colleges in fact if you work hard and pull your grades up these last three years you'll be more desirable to colleges admission officers like to see students who struggled in the beginning then greatly improved it shows that you work hard Student Education in the United States Graduate school Trinity College, Dublin Advanced Placement Program Duke University Brown University Grade (education) A-level College admissions Affirmative action Law School Admissions Test Yearbook Lynbrook High School Stuyvesant High School Secondary education in the United States Midshipman Medical school University of California, San Diego Education in Romania Harvard University Marlboro College High school New York University University of Michigan The Catholic University of America Johns Hopkins University Law school The Sims 2: University College of William and Mary SAT Numerus clausus The Citadel (Military College) Franklin W.
