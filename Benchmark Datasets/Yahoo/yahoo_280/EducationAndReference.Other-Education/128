i am looking for an insparational speaker for a black at the high school i attend any suggestions i don't think i willhave very much financial backing but if it can be arranged with someone worth while i am willing to try to raise the funds hmm looks like it might be in usa wish i could help you because that's what i do in uk maybe in future when i set up a webcast but i got an idea for you how about instead of a motivational speaker find a company that is very successful so you can take them to that company to meet the ceo and also the other workers in that company you can do such a thing once a month this gets them out but most importantly see the bigger picture you're taking them to the world they will meet oneday they will also be able to chat ask questions to the employees too this also enables them to see the diverse choices they have and maybe some will see what they really want to do in life and when someone finds out what they really want to do then you can't stop them they are buzzing but if i was in your city i would have done it for free for schools i never charge because i always wanted to help youths because success is about preparing i never knew what that meant till i became adult due to looking after myself i experienced the consequences for some years until i found a mentor or he found me good luck Unemployment Capital accumulation Economics Infantilism Pixar Alcoholics Anonymous GED Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Capitalism Treehouse of Horror V Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Health insurance Education in the People's Republic of China Charles Goodyear Corporate governance Plame affair Speaker of the British House of Commons Pension Education in England Electronic Arts Swami Vivekananda Socrates Chinese language Simone Weil Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Inflation Donald Rumsfeld EastEnders Investment bank Press Your Luck Pitaten Enron Corporation Principal-agent problem New York-New Jersey English Katelyn Faber Wal-Mart Kender Anarchism and capitalism Poker jargon Efficiency wages Music radio Homeschooling Economy of Sri Lanka Meaning of life The Dalek Invasion of Earth Incentive National Kidney Foundation Singapore Warren Buffett Education in Germany The Sims Pet Sounds Morgan Stanley Nintendo God Emperor of Dune Education in Portugal Virginian Railway Workplace democracy Freeters America Online Graduate school Corporation Evan Mecham British House of Commons One Tree Hill (TV series) Productive and unproductive labour Microsoft Emotions (album) Diving Microeconomics Rick Santorum Stock Life insurance Celtic Tiger Separation of church and state Royal Assent Therion (band) Theodicy Strategic management Insurance Philosophy of language Jon Secada Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Avenue Q Cultural Revolution George Galloway Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Divine grace Singapore gay equality movement Citigroup Criticism of libertarianism Parliament of the United Kingdom Samuel Goldwyn Child sexuality Escape from New York Sydney Riot of 1879 Winning Streak PLATO Sarbanes-Oxley Act
