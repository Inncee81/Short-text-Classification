how do you think spoon's new album 'ga ga ga ga ga' compare to their album 'gimme fiction' i think their new album is actually just as good if not better than 'gimme fiction' seems less commercial more substantial but thats probably because all their old music ended up in commercials lol i still think kill the moonlight and gimme fiction are better albums but ga ga ga ga has really impressed me since i heard in live a couple times the album is a real grower and as always a very fine album from a very talented band the new album is sparse in musical style but some of the lyrics are incredible in don t you evah and black like me The Cure ABBA Me First & the Gimme Gimmes Lynyrd Skynyrd Spoon (band) The Ashlee Simpson Show The Marshall Mathers LP The Blues Brothers The Basement Tapes Cover version E-Rotic Tina Turner Quarashi Trance music Herbie Hancock Jefferson Airplane The Waterboys Tony Bennett 10cc The Rutles Black Eyed Peas Blur Jennifer Lopez Van Halen The Isley Brothers Stairway to Heaven Pet Sounds Ozzy Osbourne Kraftwerk Metallica Red Hot Chili Peppers Elton John Frank Zappa Roxette Guns N' Roses Jethro Tull (band) Iggy Pop Van Morrison Prince (artist) Concept album The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle Kylie Minogue R.E.M.
