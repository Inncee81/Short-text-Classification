iv got the baby blues any advice iv been with my bf n a half years he has kids already hes im i know he doesnt want any more kids as hes told me plenty of time the women hes had kids with have fkd off aferwards and hes either not seen the kids the the case of his youngest for a year might not be his child or the mothers have not been interested two eldest for years mother didnt see them eldest is deffo not his biologically i thought id be ok with it but i feel really down and kinda want a child with my bf will this go away and any have any ideas if its just me he doesnt want to have one with or its just coz of the past i ask him but all i get out of him is i just don't he has the same oppinion on marriage and i just wanna know if any else has had this any other men felt this way then please reply too i would like both sides of the story thank you x dee ann he was the one that braught the two eldest up for years whilst there mother fkd off and he braught the youngest up on his own untill her mum decided to move away and marry another bloke so he was more than just a sperm doner he's definitely scared and he has every right to be his track record involving women and kids is terrible and not necessarily his doing i don't think his decision has anything to do with you and i'm not one to bring age into a relationship but when you were still in school and he had kids by the time he was that's alot for a person of his age to go through i'm and i'm only on my first child and unfortunately for you he's associating marriage children with negativity to be truthfully honest i don't think there is anything you can do to change his mind a relationship is supposed to be about compromise and if he's not willing to budge or at least talk about his preferences your relationship is going nowhere and fast and i'm speaking from personal experience on that one you have to know what you want out of life and to set time frames and goals for yourself you don't want to wake up years from now and realize your entire youth was a waste good luck dear About a Boy Little Britain Friends Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Milton H.
