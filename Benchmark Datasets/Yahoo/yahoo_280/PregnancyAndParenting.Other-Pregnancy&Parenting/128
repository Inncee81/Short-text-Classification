baby shower i m helping plan my baby shower and i have a few things that i would like others opinions on i would like a little advice from some mothers mothers to be who have had baby showers or some of you who have given baby showers what would be an ideal number of people to invite to a baby shower the location where i m having my baby shower is a nice size when should i have a baby shower i was thinking about having my shower on oct th i will be wks at this time is that pushing it a little too close to my due date should i have it a week or two earlier what s a good time for the shower to start i was thinking about pm should i do it at little earlier or later than that invite as many people as you have the space for a lot even those with good intentions will end up not showing up so don't be afraid to go crazy with the invites weeks is cutting it close too close first off you're going to be huge and miserable second that doesn't leave you hardly any time to wash everything and get everything ready third that doesn't leave any time for you to buy what you still need or even take back the stuff that you got that you don't need the cleaning and preparing of the nursery then figuring out what you still need then writing out those thank you letters etc it all takes energy that you just won't have at weeks i would say around weeks would be ideal but hey you know you best i would say a little earlier just because pm is smack in the middle of the day i would say around noonish or pm what's most important is that you just do what you want to do it's all about you that's the point so just whatever you're most comfortable with is what needs to be done o congrats Social rule Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hey Jude Breastfeeding The Ashlee Simpson Show Charmed Kodocha The McGuire Sisters Neighbours Phoebe Buffay's songs Beatles for Sale The Emancipation of Mimi Knots Landing Friends The Contender (television series) The Catcher in the Rye Milton H.
