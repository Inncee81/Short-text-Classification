stuffed animal arrangement my son has acquired a mass collection of lovely stuffed animals ranging in sizes anywhere from pillow sized to hamster sized they are all gifts from special people and i would like to have them out for him to use but i dont want them to take up a ton of space i need them to stay relatively organized and easy to move clean but i am not interested in using the traditional animal nets that hang from the corner of the ceiling and the chains with clips to hang the animals from are tacky any new unconventional ideas points will be issued to best answer thank you i use grib cubbies you connect them together to make a cubby shelf and use little plastic bins for small toys it keeps everything off the floor but where they can get to it and you can make it as large or small as you want or another way of doing it is get plastic cube containers like milk crates spray paint them different colors and connect and stack them together Hamster Plastic Christmas tree My Little Pony Vermicompost Dairy Tofu Kitchen Pet skunk Traditional animation Regular polytope Comanche Japanese tea ceremony Strap-on dildo Seismic retrofit Wilton House Floppy disk Library Mattress Calvin and Hobbes Knife Gramophone record G.I.
