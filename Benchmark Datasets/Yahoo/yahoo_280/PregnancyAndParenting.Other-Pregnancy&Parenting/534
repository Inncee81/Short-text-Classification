why do people who can't afford one child decide to more than one also do some women have children just because they are bored and need a hobby what about when it gets to the awkward age then what baby's get adopted right away but not older children it seems like people want the early years but not other ones remember baby chicks are cute too but after a while not so cute and you think this is just a poor persons plight how many rich people have children who run amok in their teens and early 's plenty yes babies are cute but any woman who has had one knows they are a lot of work and responsibility if you can't take on the responsibility then you shouldn't have any children i'm not talking about people who work here parents have worked and raised kids for hundreds of years i'm talking about the ones who have kids then pawn them off to boarding schools or nannies or just don't take the time to spend time with them if you have a child it should be because you want to have one not for monitary gain and not just because you are a teenage girl who wants to have sex so badly that you forget about things like birth control and condoms emotionally a teenager is no more ready to be a mother then she is to be an executive at microsoft lately i've seen a horrible trend in families even the best of families the kids are lugged to soccer baseball karate dance gymnastics and dropped off by parents who probably don't even know the name of their kids coaches you hand these kids over to strangers every single day when all they really need is a bit of time with you look at kids like brittany spears and linsey lohan and paris hilton all overly priviledged kids at the moment some born into it some it was thrust upon them at an early age but they are too young to deal with the responsibility of it all and their lives are a mess that is the same thing that happens to people who have children when they aren't ready to have them kids don't come with instruction manuals but if they did the first sentence in that manual would be spend time with your children play with them participate with them be there for them work can wait your boss can wait your children should be your biggest priority right up there next to your spouse you work your butts off supposedly for your kids but when it's all said and done you hardly even know your kids and that is one of the biggest reasons kids are having kids they are searching for someone to love them someone they can love and they think a baby of their own who they would not treat like their parents treated them is the ticket i truly believe there would be a lot fewer teenage girls getting pregnant if their parents took the time to know them don't just drop them off go watch go cheer them on go be there for them the reward you get later will be well worth the effort EastEnders Friends Social rule Britney Spears Adolescence Abortion debate Kodocha About a Boy Marriage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents Little Britain Spice Girls Sex and the City W.I.T.C.H.
