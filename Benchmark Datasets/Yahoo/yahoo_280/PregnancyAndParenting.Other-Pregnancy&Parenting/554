how to cope with anxiety of going back to work i have been a stay at home mom with my daughter for the last months but certain circumstances have placed great strain on our finances and we my husband and i have decided that i should go back to work i tried to find part time work but considering my lack of experience i wasn't able to find anything that would make the expense of child care worth while so i have a full time job that starts next week am to pm we see this as only temporary maybe for a year at most but i am so anxious about it i can't sleep at night i am clinging to my daughter in these few remaining days and i'm pretty emotional i found a good day care i know she'll be well cared for mostly it's my own selfishness that's causing my distress i just love to be with her she's the first thing in my life that has made me truly unconditionally happy maybe i am co dependent on my child but aren't all moms the decision to go back to work has already been made mostly i'm looking for advice words of support to get me through the transition maybe this is also due to only child syndrome maybe i'm just overly doteful upon my first and only child there are probably no words that will help you sleep at night but kids that go to child care turn out just fine think of the positives for example the extra income you will have you will also get time away from your child so she can grow and socialise with other kids and you will appreciate your time together all the more when you have it i have a month old and am also grappling with the decision to go back to work when he is one and my maternity leave ends if your decision is made then just be happy knowing that what your doing is what you need to do right now your daughter will love you as you will always be her mom thats not to say tears will not be shed between now and then good luck mom cheer up its not forever EastEnders Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Narcissism Kodocha Divorce Social rule Breastfeeding Laura Schlessinger Happiness Childbirth Urinary incontinence History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Infantilism Unemployment Shaggy dog story Hypoglycemia About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Transsexuality Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass Care Bears The Contender (television series) Fathers' rights Dead Like Me Prostate cancer The Adventures of Pete & Pete Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Death Gate Cycle The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John the Baptist Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Charmed Stress (medicine) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Fairly OddParents Days of our Lives Traumatic brain injury Rent (musical) Clinical depression Series finale Blankets (graphic novel) Mattress Vegeta Miss Saigon Out-of-body experience 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Critic Kim Possible Aphrodite Asperger syndrome Knots Landing Thai royal and noble titles Procrastination Terri Schiavo The Catcher in the Rye Michael Garibaldi Soap opera Alena Chronic fatigue syndrome $ale of the Century Sleeping Murder Hikikomori Carl Barks Goodness and value theory George VI of the United Kingdom I Want to Hold Your Hand Eric Cartman The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Negima Cliff Richard Appeasement Jon Secada The Marshall Mathers LP Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Marriage Satchel Paige Lorelai Gilmore Abortion Insomnia Stomach cancer Into the West (miniseries) Traumatic incident reduction Economic inequality Friends Characters in the Smurfs Cindy Sheehan Hollyoaks Marie Antoinette Dawson's Creek Marilyn Monroe Anxiety The Subtle Knife Kender
