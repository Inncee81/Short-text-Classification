is your current life really over when you have a baby i seem to be thinking this is the case which is putting me off having a baby just yet my husband is and very keen to start trying i'm am we enjoy a very relaxed life and often see friends and have fun nights out will all this be over when we have a child or will we be able to keep going out from time to time and still enjoy the things we do now at the moment i feel prepared for a baby to completely take over my life and everything i currently do will be over but is this really the case my husband is telling me its not but i'm not so sure it depends upon who you are some parents don't feel comfortable bringing their child with them places while they are young with my first we did just that we took her with us whether we we're visiting friends going to eat or attending a party when they're young the can sleep through anything and almost always fall asleep in the car seat we just made sure at friends we had a quiet place to put her when she grew out of car seat we brought our pack n play with us we did this regularly until she was about mos then stopped doing so much after that i warn you however with the first this can be done anymore and it doesn't really work well some people would find my methods a bit unusual but i've seen young babies and toddlers living with their moms and or dads on dead tour living in a van roving around country which i wouldn't do but it provides a good idea of how flexible children are at a young age Kodocha About a Boy Friends The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cindy Sheehan Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Knots Landing Grandview, U.S.A.
