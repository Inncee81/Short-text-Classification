breastfeeding question jmy babyis weeks old now and i have no clue where the time has gone already so anyhow for those who have breastfed had your baby thrown up after nursing maybe a couple of times thru out the day he does now when my other kids were babies they did but they were also bottle fed and i thought maybe it was from them drinking too much any idea's of why he is doing this is it from drinking too much at once should i burp him half way thru feeding him whats the best thing for sore or cracked nipples it seems like half of the time i can get him latched on right not sure why we can't get it all the time but any help would be great thanks my best advice would be to contact someone from la leche league i did when i was first breastfeeding and they totally helped the baby could be drinking too much or just getting too much milk too fast you could try to make him stop and burp good luck with keeping him calm while you do that maybe try feeding him a little more frequently so he won't be such a piggy when he eats natural lanolin for the cracked nipples also don't dry your nipples after baby eats rub some of your milk into them and let them air dry it will get better soon good luck and congrats on the new baby Breastfeeding Nipple piercing Infant Nipple Baby bottle Mastitis Breast Breast pump Lanolin Burping Milk Bart chalkboard gags Dairy Infant formula Prolactin The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Childbirth The Amazing Race Nestl__ Social rule Trailer Park Boys Urinary incontinence Little Britain Elephant Textile manufacturing Platypus Stomach cancer Knots Landing Guinea pig Cuisine of the Philippines Drawn Together Vampire Domestic goat International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Hiberno-English Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fecal incontinence Oxytocin The Fast Show Humphrey Bogart Jaundice The Tracey Ullman Show shorts FoxTrot Bong Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brassiere The Super Milk-chan Show The Adventures of Pete & Pete Breast milk Masturbation Milkshake Infantilism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chocolate Singlish Cocaine Toilet humour Shark Teen Girl Squad Marathon (sport) Luck Red Hot Chili Peppers Alcoholics Anonymous Double the Fist Domestic rabbit Internal ballistics Ron and Fez Cat Press Your Luck House Mouse Hamster Earless seal Mammary gland Chicken Charmed Ken Jennings Prolactinoma Nestl__ boycott Fasting About a Boy Moe Szyslak Pet skunk Situation comedy Customs and etiquette of Japan 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Teat Soft drink Fiddler on the Roof Ramadan Premature birth Protein-energy malnutrition Soy milk Ron Weasley The Apprentice 2 Botulism Neighbours Numerology Insomnia
