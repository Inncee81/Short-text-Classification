is it everybody's right to have children i know this is a very touchy issue so i'll try and tread carefully if someone finds out that biologically they can't have children they feel they've had their basic human 'right' to reproduce taken away from them is that the case do you think or should they just accept that it's not a right to have children and if it's not meant to be then they should accept that no matter how difficult that is and no matter how hard it is to see chavs popping out kids all over with different mothers fathers for example i didn't actually say that i agreed or disagreed i was just asking i personally don't agree with you i think that if someone can't have children biologically then perhaps the lord made it that way so that wonderful couple can adopt a baby that needs good parents Adoption Abortion debate Family Infant baptism Polyamory Marriage Fathers' rights Infantilism Theory of conduct Contract Science Intelligent design Who is a Jew?
