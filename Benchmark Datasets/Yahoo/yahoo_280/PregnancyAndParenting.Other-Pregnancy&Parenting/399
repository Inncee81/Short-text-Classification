what would you do if your mother in law didnt show much interest in your kids i just don't understand it my mother in law does not show much interested in being around her grandchildren at least my kids anyway the other ones live out of state so when they come to visit all of the sudden she is grandma of the year and my kids see her more the weeks her other grandchildren are in than they did for the previous months we see her about once a month and w e live mile away from her my son cries to spend the night with her and she makes up some excuse he is and has never spent the night with grandma and she may babysit for me once every months for a dr appt she is too busy i used to tell myself she is old and doesn't have the energy but she recently got a huge house dog that sleeps with her and demands lots of attention she even has to bring it in our backyard everyday to run since she has a tiny backyard w no fence she usually doesn't even knock on the door to say hello to the kids thats the new reason he cant spend the night he is scared of dogs and she cant put the dog in the cage b c it barks to get out i have to try to smooth it over b c i dont want my son think his grandma don't want to be around him what shoud i do if anything my mother lives hours away they only have one aunt anywhere near us kids need that relationship but i know i cant force her i just don't know what to do and it upsets me so bad i know taking care of kids is much more than taking care of a dog i don't want her to take care of my kids i just want them to have a relationship with her i dont understand why she wouldnt want that my kids are missing out i remember sitting on the porch w my grandma for an hour just talking and she cant so much as eat lunch with us how about this i had a miscarriage and then a very unstable pregnancy where i needed her to look after my daughter she came up and said i didn't have anything better to do my miracle son is now and she is yet to see him nor seen my other child in that time she only lives hour away and at times drives right by our town Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Garfield EastEnders The Lovely Bones The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Smoking Room The Fairly OddParents The Brady Bunch The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Neighbours About a Boy The Critic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Hundred Years of Solitude Laura Schlessinger Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Maison Ikkoku Malcolm in the Middle Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Friends Social rule Lisa's First Word Billboard Hot 100 Dean Koontz Time Out of Mind RuneScape quests Milton H.
