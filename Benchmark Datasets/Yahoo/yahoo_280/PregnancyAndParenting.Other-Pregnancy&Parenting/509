me and my fiance are looking for something special for each one of our children we are pregnant with our first and are looking for ideas on designating each child we have with something for his family his mom picked a song for each kid for my family my mom picked bible verses we want something different we were thinking of designating them with an animal i e bear for strength eagle for freedom or wisdom etc we are very outdoorsy people does anyone like this idea or have a better idea thanks for your thoughts so far a little confusion though this is the first child so this is a tradition we would start in feb when i am due we don't have any others yet i appreciate the star idea but feel it is so commercialized i figure this way each time they see one of these animals it will be like their special moment wi mom didn't realize we had narrow minded people here today a commitment is not in a piece of paper but good for you if that is what you put your faith in guess you didn't read the question thouroughly when i wrote fiance i love this idea it's something special that you can have to symbolize that specific child i did something similar an animal for my boys and a flower for my girls nature is a great inspiration good luck wow people are neg you do not have to be married to give a child loving parents get out of your hole people i just wanted to include in my post that i chose a mythical animal for my son kinda a twist on the animal totem and although not as original as the boys flowers are a classical symbol for women my parents always gave me yellow pink edged roses on my birthday and special occasions About a Boy The Fairly OddParents The Emancipation of Mimi Kurt Cobain Fantastic Four EastEnders Care Bears The Catcher in the Rye Bible Ten Commandments The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy She Loves You Kodocha The Human Stain Milton H.
