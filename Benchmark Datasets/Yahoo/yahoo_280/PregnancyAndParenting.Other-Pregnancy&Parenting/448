a woman at my son's school is a big gossiper how would you handle this situation i don't trust her intentions our boys only had a few play dates i met her when we chaperoned a field trip she seemed harmless the more i spoke to her the more she revealed details about other parent even teachers private matters on a few occasions after school when picking up my son she would holler my name said she had to speak to me her conversations would be did you know so and so dad is bald are you serious you stopped me for that or did you know our sons teacher is in love with her fiancees relative i wouldn't feed into her conversations said i had to go on one occasion i witnessed her drilling a little boy who was over her home about their family i knew this was only to get a scoop she even approached me to tell me out of concern yeah right that our sons teacher her discussed my son his issues that is where she crossed the line i informed her not to gossip about my son reported the teacher to principal board of ed she now calls to see if our kids can play how do i shut her down i know this woman has a complex the need to be everyone's so called friend talk behind their backs i know that i am no different to her most likely gossips about my family i don't disclose much but general stuff but im sure she'll make something up as far as our children go i feel they can be friends but at school i don't need women like her in my life we have enough going on than to deal with a little girl who thinks she's in high school i'm going to tell her that my son can't go but how much should i reveal about her behavior it's a shame that she has to behave that way but i refuse to let my family become a victim to her stupidity she is one of those woman who feel the need to have all the attention possible i'm an adult who knows that her behavior is wrong i just feel sorry for all those fools who befriend her don't know what she is doing behind their back i see thru her and want nothing to do with it so what would you say i don't want to be catty at all you did the right thing the next time she calls tell her no that they cannot play unless her son comes to your house to do so this will keep her from drilling your son and it will also show her she is not going to be able to do to you what she has done to others if you said something to her before tell her that is the reason you are not comfortable with your child being around her tell her you are too old for all of the drama and you do not want your children to experience it either just flat out tell her plain and simple she had no problem telling you things you should do her the same it is sad that the kids have to suffer bc of immature parents though i would suggest letting them play if the other boy comes to your house or something similar so that they will not think they are being punished for her actions Plame affair Infantilism Shaggy dog story Friends Springfield Elementary School The Catcher in the Rye About a Boy The Fairly OddParents Boston Public Domestic violence The Adventures of Pete & Pete 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Transactional analysis Social rule Hikikomori Cindy Sheehan Plame affair timeline Mojave people Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Joke Kodocha Avenue Q Sin City Laura Schlessinger The Life and Times of Juniper Lee One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory Homer Simpson Beavis and Butt-head Transsexuality Garfield Milton H.
