i am starting to feel like everything is my fault my fiance made a comment about hating working nights and i feel really bad i am starting to feel like everything is my fault and everything is going wrong i am the one that bugged him about kids and wanted to have kids and when our daughter was born we were okay for a little while but had to switch to one working day and one working night to be able to care for her all day because we can no longer afford a babysitter he refused to let me go nights and he went to overnights said he will be fine now i am pregnant again and i feel like everything just keeps going wrong and i don't know what to do is this just hormones or something else i just cry at night and i have tried to talk to him but i don't know how i love him so much and i don't want him to blame me and i don't think he does i think i am the only one blaming me we had talked about the fact that i felt we rushed into kids a little to early and it was my fault and he said he wanted kids too and not all my fault i love my daughter so much and i would change anything for the world maybe i just need to talk it out or something i just don't know how i just feel awful abortion was never an option just no something i am capable of doing beside i am weeks pregnant too late for that even if i did think of it but i can't i would kill myself first this is going to be our last child but even if by some mistake i get pregnant again i would discuss adoption with my fiance about that child i don't think i can handle anymore then two child and we are currently fighting for more visitation with his two sons so that will already have four kids in my house sometimes two of my own is plenty he just wants to go work on cars so bad instead of working for wal mart but because of the babysitting issue and his refusal to let me go overnight i feel i am holding him back from what he really wants i may have no clue where i want to work but he does well i am going to go curl up and bed and try to get some sleep maybe that will help like you all say thanks for the advice and i look forward to more hey relax you hormones hun you're bound to be feeling like this kids ain't easy and we all learn that the hard way you will get through this you're a tough cookie o chin up hun i know exactly how you feel o take care x Knots Landing EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Ranma __ characters Laura Schlessinger Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Tupac Shakur Big Brother UK series 6 AFI 100 Years series Abortion debate Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye The Death Gate Cycle The Human Stain Phoebe Halliwell Hey Jude Kodocha Bon Jovi Breath of Fire III Kurt Cobain Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pregnancy Friends Transsexuality One Life to Live The Beatles discography Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding The Amazing Race About a Boy History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Infidels The Ashlee Simpson Show Sydney Riot of 1879 Boston Public Stewie Griffin Day care The Contender (television series) John Lennon Another World (TV series) Ron and Fez Time Out of Mind Cliff Richard Sharon Tate The Critic Frankie Laine The Amber Spyglass Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Transactional analysis Days of our Lives W.I.T.C.H.
