do to medical circumstance my daughter will be an only child i had siblings and so did my husband so im worried about her being all alone if you are an only child please let me know what it is like for you im very concerened about it but we cant afford to adopt it is so expensive i am an only child and i'm now when i was little i played outside with neighborhood kids and i went to day care with lots of other kids because my parents both worked i would also play by myself a lot i had lots of imaginary friends when i was young so be prepared when she starts talking to herself when she's playing alone she's actually talking to imaginary playmates one thing i might add is that i wish now that my parents had encouraged me to be more outgoing and to do things like dance or music the earlier kids start the better and it's another great socializing opportunity for an only child you worry that she will be lonely because you know what it was like to have siblings but think about it she doesn't know the difference if you can have pets where you live maybe consider getting something she can help take care of when she's old enough as long as you love her and set aside time each day to play with her she will be fine my parents and i had a great time together my mom and i would play beauty parlor and my dad i and would play steamroller where i'd lay on the bed and he'd roll back and forth across the bed crushing me but he didn't hurt me because the bed was soft and squishy good luck The Fairly OddParents About a Boy Kodocha Social rule Pitaten The Critic Shaggy dog story Our Gang Adoption Timmy Turner Family EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy College Roomies from Hell!!!
