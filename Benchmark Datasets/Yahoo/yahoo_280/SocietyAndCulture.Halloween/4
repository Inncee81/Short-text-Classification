whose ready for halloween i sure the heck am i know it's weird and all but i prepare for the holiday year round oh yeah i'm like you i take stock of what went well and what could be improved and then i start planning for halloween on november i am proud to say that i live in the best dressed house on the block every halloween i try to balance the effects between truly macabre displays and lighthearted elements as i don't want to frighten away all the wee ones trick or treating as my display has grown each year i've begun setting up earlier and earlier in the season once more this year i plan to start placing fall figures near the house on the autumn solstice which includes placing three scarecrows about a dozen pumpkins several artificial crows cornstalks and hay bales in front of the house i will begin building my actual halloween display on october it usually takes me a couple of full hour days to set up the essentials but i'm adding elements to my display until october here are some of things that people can expect from me this year i'm going to place three or four large inflatables around the front yard again to draw the attention of passing motorists as i live adjacent to a busy thoroughfare the homer i use as my avatar is one of the figures i've also got a vampire bart sitting atop a stack of jack o' lanterns and a huge jack o' lantern with a witches hat i'm still undecided now whether i will use my inflatable spider this year the biggest transformation will be turning the front yard into a cemetery again using several expensive and very realistic looking tombstones that i've acquired over the years i try to add at least one new tombstone each halloween i've got two great life size figures that i always place near the front door one is a very realistic mummy and the other is a gjenganger i've always created horror tables for the people coming up to the front door and this year will be no exception i usually decorate one of them with hundreds and i mean hundreds of realistic spiders and insects crawling everywhere including some gigantic ones i also place boiling cauldrons disintegrating hearts and brains percolating blood fountains maggots an alien autopsy and life size reptiles on or about the table this year i will have at least three horror tables i'm planning on setting up my glow in the dark tent again this year so that my guests will have to pass through it to reach the front door i'll lay out my ouija board for people to play perhaps somebody will accept the challenge this time so far no one has i will build an even bigger jack o' lantern wall this halloween it grows larger each year last year i displayed over jack o' lanterns this year i plan to add at least more i will add to the three skeletons and two ghouls that i hang from the trees i want to modify the two ghosts i've set up to roam the yard i will certainly place more crows and ravens on the haystacks and tombstones i've already bought more torches and lanterns to help guide my guests to the front entrance of the house i always decorate the large spruce tree with halloween lights it's my halloween tree but this year i'm going with leds instead i have already placed eerie faces on the other deciduous trees in the yard and i'm going to add two more this year they great thing about the tree faces is that i can leave them up year round i'm going to march out more than one bloody foot trail for people to follow this year in years past i've tracked out but one set of blood footprints from the house to the front door i'll lay out paper jack o' lantern luminaries along the sidewalk again i'm also going to place more skulls on posts this year i had about a dozen last year and i'd like to triple the number this halloween i haven't decided whether i'll encircle the yard again with crime tape there's so much more i'm planning but i don't have room to tell you here finally i will give out gobs of candy and trinkets including skull and body parts key chains and skeleton key rings i have spent literally thousands of dollars on my ever growing halloween display over the years and i expect to spend thousands on it again this year trick or treat happy
