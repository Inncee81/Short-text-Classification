good halloween or theater costumes for halloween this year a friend of mine is throwing a masked ball i want to find a really authentic looking elizabethan gown and am having trouble finding one i'm not worried about cost and i don't want it to look cheap like a halloween costume from a retail store hope you might know a good website or store preferably website thanks try ebay or post this question in the entertainment section here on answrs some of the pros may know where the best places are to go i would think a vintage shop might be good tell them you are looking for a formal period gown if they cant help you they may be able to steer you in the right direction also try contacting some local small theaters in your area they may have pieces that you can borrow try rental dress shops too another option is a high school or a good local seamstress this will probably be easier to find locally versus online i think a good seamstress may be your best bet and you will be able to have a dress in a color that is good on you get a great gown and a good petticoat and you will be all set i hope this helps you have a happy halloween Gaia Online Halloween Professional wrestling match types Prom Evening gown Retailer Society for Creative Anachronism Neopets City of Heroes Glen Jacobs Barbie Victorian fashion Theatre Academic dress New York's Village Halloween Parade Animal Crossing Shopping mall Halloween (film) Shau Kei Wan Undergarment Grand Forks, North Dakota Carnival Theater (structure) CPU cache Tesco Academia Crinoline Catwoman Ron and Fez RuneScape economy Lord Chancellor White wedding Halloweentown Barrister IPod Volleyball MAME Mardi Gras Michael Myers (Halloween) UK Singles Chart Bicycle lighting Bulk vending Costume Black Dollar store Black tie Petticoat Supermarket Laserdisc The Legend of Zelda series characters Visit of King George IV to Scotland Phish Blockbuster Video RuneScape quests Internet fraud Minstrel show Live 8 Sari Spider-Man Greenville, North Carolina Clothing Alnwick (district) Poker jargon Suit (clothes) Hash table Happy Tree Friends The Star Wars Holiday Special Aloha shirt Homestar Runner Academic dress of Oxford University Nintendo Entertainment System Spidey Super Stories New Orleans Mardi Gras The Nightmare Before Christmas Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers Bret Hart Shopping cart Day of the Dead Homewood, Illinois Clown Sewing Spaceward, Ho!
