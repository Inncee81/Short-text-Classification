i am having trouble finding a job i have good qualifications and go to interviews but come back with nothing what am i doing wrong i think i may have poor social skills for getting an interview i've been told that i interview well so i will let you know the things that i do prior to going to an interview one thing is to try and research the job that you are applying to know a few things about the company and its history try to predict questions before they are asked if you can once you go on a few interviews typically a lot of companies even in different industries ask the same type of questions ex what is one difficult situation that you've been in on a previous job and how did you cope with it or resolve the situation ' the key is to try and relate your answer to how it could resolve an issue that might arise at the company you are applying for if possible thats why it is kind of important to research and imagine what it would be like to work for the company you are applying to the usual things like being aware of your posture hygiene making eye contact with your interviewer s another tip is to have an awesome resume it is worth the investment to go to bestbuy or office depot and buy a cheap dollar resume maker program that will help you format and organize your resume i personally have four or five different resumes that i use to apply for jobs in different areas like clerical manageral professional and so on a lot of those programs even makes suggestions based on if you have experience or no experience in the area in which you are applying for try writing a descent cover letter that goes into detail about your work history and skills that will impress your interviewer try to answer every question that is asked of you on occasion i have even made up a answer or too just so that i have answered the question its not recommended to make up an answer unless you will remember what you said previously if you get a follow up question later on also when answering questions try not to say uhhh uhhh or have too long of a period of silence if i'm asked a question and i do not have an immediate answer after about seconds of silence i make something up especially when asked a situational question which a lot of them are rediculous at times before i got my degree i switched jobs at lot to work with my school schedule but also made sure that it was the same or more pay that the previous job i've also had a lot of experience interviewing people and going through panel interviews were more than one person is interviewing you at once these things seem to help me in getting a job a couple of years ago when applying for a operator job before i graduated college i was one of eight people to get a job out of applicants and these are the things that i use to help me during the interviewing process i hope this helps good luck Social rule Call centre Quizbowl Plame affair Software engineering Autism Graduate school Expert system Economic inequality Theory of conduct Jeff Gannon Ethics GED Education in the People's Republic of China Scientology beliefs and practices Anderson Cooper Consensus decision-making Goodness and value theory Species Computer A Course In Miracles Life insurance Religion Neuro-linguistic programming Killian documents Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Scientific method Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Economics SCO-Linux controversies Minimum wage Milton H.
