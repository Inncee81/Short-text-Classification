degrading stuff what's a housewife isn't it degrading is it bad to think that a woman is supposed to cook and clean you can only be degraded if you feel degraded people can think i'm ugly all day long but nobody can make me look ugly unless i feel ugly a housewife is woman whose main occupation is to take care of the home the reason that some oppose this is because there has been and still is a belief that this is the only occupation women are capable of seeing it as a natural job for women feminists argue that this is a job that can be held by either gender and that a woman should have the opportunity to choose an outside career if so she wishes also that housekeeping is the duty of both men and women now i will not bring up the extremist views within feminism as they may be loud but few there is nothing wrong with being a housewife i want to have several kids and don't want a nanny to raise my children i have a great career but i'm planning to take time off to stay at home and spend time with my children when that day comes i expect my husband to do the same depending on what his job allows children need a set of parents so it is my belief that they will need to spend time at home with a father as much as with a mother i as a woman want the law and society to support this egalitarian notion and for instance give men and women the same amount of time off for a child the us is behind many other developed countries such as sweden france or england where you get almost as much paternity leave as you do maternity leave if a woman chooses that she likes to cook and clean for the rest of her life that's fine too martha stewart is a successful businesswoman who made a fortune out of the art and she is not degrading Homemaker Gender role Gender-neutral language Fathers' rights Masculism Economic inequality Abortion debate Marriage Theory of conduct Conscription Divorce Family name Transsexuality Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Sexual orientation God and gender Freeters Ten Commandments Civil rights Incest Ethics Domestic violence Feminists for Life Fruits Basket Women in the Victorian era About a Boy Matriarchy Patriarchy Feminist movement Same-sex marriage Religious Society of Friends Paternalism Goodness and value theory Roe v.
