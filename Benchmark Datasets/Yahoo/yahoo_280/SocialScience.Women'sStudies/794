why should i feel sorry for women in abusive relationships they can leave anytime if i'm in a relationship with a woman and she starts acting stupid or mouthing off i disappear why should i stick around i'm the dominant man your the woman if you can't accept that arrangement then we have nothing else to talk about and i would expect any woman who is unhappy with me to leave as well don't waste my time if she decides to stay i don't feel bad about her misery its her own fault basically i'm tired of the victimization of women they're not helpless little kids i agree that their is too much victimization in women but typically women in these conditions aren't emotionally capable of escaping even if they do have some where to go i think it is much more complicated than get out this solution is very logical however the women in most of these situations are not capable of thinking logically as a result of the abuse also abusive men or women tend to pick out weak people because they know it will be harder for a weak person to escape than one who is strong mentally speaking Social rule Rape Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Domestic violence Divorce Narcissism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Pedophilia Post-traumatic stress disorder Anger management Boston Public Infantilism Transactional analysis Scientology beliefs and practices Anorexia nervosa Procrastination Theodicy Clinical depression EastEnders Friends Human Fathers' rights Coercion Digital circuit Samurai Deeper Kyo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Homophobia Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Child sexual abuse The nature of God in Western theology Pitaten Obsessive-compulsive disorder Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Marriage Sin City Sadism and masochism Mach kernel Laura Schlessinger Customs and etiquette of Japan Abortion Asperger syndrome Equine conformation Borderline personality disorder Mojave people Gender role Scenes from a Memory Left-handed Ranma __ characters Traumatic incident reduction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Journey (band) Traumatic brain injury Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Polyamory Domination & submission (BDSM) Happiness Polygamy Electrophysiology Existence of God Dissociative identity disorder Human sexual behavior Ex-gay Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The Death Gate Cycle The Shining (film) Drowning Married... with Children Sant Thakar Singh A Course In Miracles The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trafficking in human beings Shit Philosophy of language Singlish Naruto jutsu Hearing impairment Cyprus dispute 2000 Australian Grand Prix Taxi Driver Predestination Pip (South Park episode) Fiddler on the Roof Object-oriented programming Sigmund Freud About a Boy Utilitarianism Atheism Inhibited sexual desire Schizophrenia Autism rights movement Economic inequality The Human Stain Autism Survivor: Palau
