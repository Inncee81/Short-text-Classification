gender envy ok i have a logical question this is not geared towards a certain age nor gender does gender envy exist is this what triggers homosexuals well let me start with females i've heard the term 'vaginal envy' float around a bit is this real are males really jealous of female definitions i can't agree to being jealous of a vagina but i can be jealous of the values and sometimes 'special' treatment society gives women for their little smooth spot a woman can indeed get special favors for exchange of her vagina its called whoring and i don't agree with it for example i've seen this its a long waiting line a chick winks her eyes and licks her lips at the guy monitoring the line before i know it she is at the front what the f ck and i've heard 'penis envy' since i'm a male i wouldn't know what a woman would have to be jealous of a guy's tool perhaps someone can elaborate on this 'gender envy' does this trigger gays is it real can someone please speak more on this homosexuality is based on who you're attracted to not what you're envious of or jealous of otherwise our sexual orientation could be changing quite a bit there's some old psychological theories about envying the other gender's sexual parts but they were pretty stupid i think i'm a psych major and i thought some of freud's theories were idiotic plus they were theories nothing has been proven but yes as long as there's been gender differences each has thought the other one had it made and they were getting the short end of the stick women who are good looking mind you get ahead in line men get more pay one thing i do envy of people in other cultures that aren't violent like ours i would love to be able to walk around the block in the middle of the night and not have to think twice about it today both men and women in the us have to be careful there's no place like home Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Orgasm Homophobia Transsexuality Transgender Domestic violence Gay Gender History of intersex surgery Bisexuality Biology and sexual orientation Homosexuality and transgender Human Sexual intercourse Sexual differentiation Anal sex Heteronormativity Sex Homosexuality and Christianity Narcissism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality Effeminacy Joke Gender-neutral language Reparative therapy Same-sex marriage Strap-on dildo Sigmund Freud Gender identity John Money Humphrey Bogart History of sex Ex-gay Recurring South Park characters Group sex Physical attractiveness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral sex Sexual revolution Sexism Condom Vagina Human sexuality Homosexuality in Japan Masculism Gay rights Feminism Lesbian Rape Social rule Psychology Vulva Laura Schlessinger LGBT Heterosexuality Arthur Schopenhauer Queer theory Puberty Electra complex Religion and sexual orientation Intersex surgery Intersexuality Carl Jung Herbert Garrison Pornographic movie Sexual attraction Male prostitute Nudity Paraphilia Friendship Penis Coming out Ten Commandments Homosexuality and Judaism Sex toy Democracy Child sexuality Autogynephilia Girl Asexuality American Psycho Gr__fenberg spot Physical intimacy Sex-positive feminism Euphemism Jealousy Hentai
