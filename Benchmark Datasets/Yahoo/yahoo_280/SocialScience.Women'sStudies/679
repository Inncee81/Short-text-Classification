gender equality where to go from here there's been alot said in this section with both men and women talking about how each gender is still looking for equality and better rights if there has been a lack of so how do each of us begin with working towards solving some of the issues what would be your first action towards making a difference and which issue would you work on first i'm disappointed in a few of the answers particularly the first one and kendrick's and cassius the first one because while humour is ok to say something like that is not helping anything at all just creating a greater divide between genders kendrick and cassius please don't tar all women with the same brush not all women believe in superiority it's the biggest crock of crap i ever heard and alot of us do listen to a mans point of view when it comes to helping men have better rights such as in divorces etc if in any doubt please read my previous q on violence against men nowhere but down nah just kidding i'd like to see parenting change to be honest i've heard a lot of unusual based on my experiences things about some families that just don't make sense to me i would like to see better care of children by both the mother and father yes i am assuming a heterosexual pairing because it is typical and fundamental i have enough experience with what a working parent can do for his her children that the idea of a father not contributing to work and raising children doesn't hold water i won't begin to comment on a woman who abandons neglects her child because the idea sickens me so in short people should raise their children better if we did that and instilled concepts of equality in the home we wouldn't need to worry about more than half of the issues we have today but that's a preventive measure that would actually take time to take effect so we might as well throw it by the wayside people aren't typically interested in time consuming commitments they're interested in quick fixes and the now Divorce Transsexuality Masculism Fathers' rights Domestic violence Feminism Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Abortion debate Economic inequality Same-sex marriage Extreme Programming Social rule Same-sex marriage in Canada Gender role Laura Schlessinger Adoption Infantilism Theodicy Homosexuality and Christianity Feminist movement Hillary Rodham Clinton Mary Wollstonecraft Philosophical skepticism Supply and demand The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of space and time James Dobson Transactional analysis Human sexual behavior Religious Society of Friends Philosophy of language Equal Protection Clause Civil rights Polygamy Software engineering Reparative therapy Homophobia Second language acquisition Child custody Cross-dressing Grammatical gender Fathers' rights movement in the UK Liberalism Same-sex marriage in the United States Property (ownership right) Goodness and value theory Gay rights About a Boy Animal rights God and gender Democracy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Predestination Lawrence v.
