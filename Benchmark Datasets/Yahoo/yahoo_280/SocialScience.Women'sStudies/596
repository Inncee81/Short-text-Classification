what is right about this ohio bill abortion law gives fathers a say but opponents blast bill as 'extreme' as written the ohio bill would ban women from seeking an abortion without written consent from the father of the fetus in cases where the identity of the father is unknown women would be required to submit a list of possible fathers the physician would be forced to conduct a paternity test from the provided list and then seek paternal permission to abort simply put no father means no abortion in addition women would be required to present a police report in order to prove a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest with the proposal men would be guaranteed that voice under penalty of law first time violators would by tried for abortion fraud a first degree misdemeanor the same would be the case for men who falsely claim to be fathers and for medical workers who knowingly perform an abortion without paternal consent http www recordpub com news article what is right about this bill what if you didn't want to file a rape or incest report with the police wow one of you thinks if a woman is raped and is too afraid to go to the police she deserves to have the rapists child because she is afraid so the woman is suppose to be punished twice for being raped whew harsh very harsh hope someone who care about isn't raped and afraid no sympathy from you eh and the same poster thinks women should have their children taken away from them since they shouldn't be raised by a whore hmm just who would be eligible to raise the child if you made both men and women adhere to your standards how many couples are going to be found who will be eligible to adopt would they both have to be virgins to adopt can they each have had one partner and be allowed to adopt who decides what is a whore or whoremonger i see a lot of statements blaming the woman for having unprotected sex what about the man that had unprotected sex with her where is his responsibility why aren't they being vilified for creating this fetus too if what you say is correct i would not expect this bill to ever pass if it did it would almost certainly never go into effect under the current case law while parental consent is required for minors the requirement for parental consent is based on the general rule that minors are unable to give informed consent to any medical procedure for an adult woman it is permitted to impose requirements designed to assure that her consent to an abortion is an informed consent it is not permitted to give another person a veto over the decision to have an abortion if this bill were enacted it would put justice kennedy on the spot and to a lesser extent chief justice roberts and justice alito justice kennedy has said that it is unconstitutional to impose a substantial burden on a woman having an abortion this bill looks like a substantial burden to me chief justice roberts and justice alito promised the senate that they did not have any agenda on this issue this bill would put the continued viability of roe v wade dead set at the heart of the case Planned Parenthood v.
