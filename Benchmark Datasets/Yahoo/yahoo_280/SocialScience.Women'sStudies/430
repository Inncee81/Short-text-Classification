where are all the female truck drivers i've seen maybe in my lifetime what am i missing about this line of work that repels women so much apparently olny of the trucking workforce is female still i don't get it some answers are good here though thanks guys i drove a truck for years during that time trucks became much easier to drive to the point that it is more like driving a pickup than an actual truck i assume you mean wheelers modern tractors have power steering air ride suspension air conditioning satellite tvs microwaves bunk beds in huge sleeping quarters as opposed to the coffin like previous versions of 'sleepers' refrigerators and other creature comforts that before were completely unavailable breakdowns including flat tires are handled by mobile mechanics today where previously they required the driver to have mechanical ability and tools in short driving a truck has become so easy even a woman can do it currently in the us women compromise about of the total in canada it is about why such low percentages because women can't make their delivery appointments due to constantly stopping to ask directions just kidding of course truck driving is a lonely life many if not most spend from weeks to months on the road living in the truck showers laundry food and sleep are done in truck stops with people that are strangers although satellite and wi fi connections as well as cell phones have done wonders to ease the aloneness of truck driving it is not one for those who crave attention from or daily interaction with loved ones this is just one of many careers that pay well but are disdained by women who would rather work in cleaner safer and more structured jobs devoting less time to their work then complain about how much money men make because they will do the dirty and dangerous time intensive jobs Truck Semi-trailer Car handling Rail terminology Sport utility vehicle Manual transmission Bicycle Autonomous building Tank Pickup truck Four wheel drive Hybrid vehicle Sin City Ernie Irvan Motorcycle Rear wheel drive Filling station Tire Craftsman Truck Series Driver's license Volkswagen Type 2 Travel trailer Chevrolet Corvair Grand Theft Auto (game) Tractor C__ile Ferate Rom__ne School bus Mattress Mobile phone Social rule Toyota Prius Solar power satellite The Human Stain Microwave oven Equine conformation Mach kernel Economic inequality Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Radio controlled car The Amazing Race Shaggy dog story Ford F-Series Mobile phone radiation and health Speed limit Solar car Initial D Passenger car Hitchhiking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ford Ranger EV Energy development Toyota Land Cruiser Automobile Cruising (maritime) United Parcel Service Light rail Kitchen Skinny Dip Billboard (advertising) Gran Turismo (game) Auto rickshaw E85 Dodge Charger Carburetor Formula One regulations Sleeping car Traffic light Wayne Corporation Capitalism Outpost 2 Refrigerator car Skateboarding trick The Contender (television series) Citizens' band radio Air conditioning Car safety Formula One cars Van (road vehicle) NASCAR Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kill Bill Battery electric vehicle Autobahn Public transport General Motors C/K Trucks Breastfeeding Paragliding Knight Rider Avenue Q Suspension (vehicle) Fuel efficiency Childbirth Canadian Pacific Railway The Death Gate Cycle Diode Kimi R__ikk__nen Inflation
