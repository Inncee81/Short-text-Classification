why do women like to throw around the idea that men are intimidated by certain types of women i hear it all the time men are intimidated by strong women men are intimidated by attractive women men are intimidated by independent women etc etc etc honestly why do women like to throw this around if i walk around with a gun drawn i can brag that yeah people are intimidated by me because i have a gun so what does that make me does that make me special or important or interesting nope my whole point here is so what if you intimidate men it doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things many of these women who have to constantly berate the point that they are too strong too attractive too successful and too educated that men are intimidated it's no coincidence that many of these women are without a man and are single and lonely and yes surveys have shown that these so called proffessional women have a harder time having a man or keeping a man than women who simply don't feel the need to try to outdo their men how often do these very same women exercise introspection and realize that perhaps men aren't intimidated by their alleged traits and perhaps these men may simply be turned off by an overbearing arrogant domineering and demonstrative woman as one responder said many of these women who have to continuously berate this point are not strong women but are actually weak women any woman that has to constantly tell a man she's strong is an insecure weak woman that is unsure of herself my woman is a strong woman i make more money than her and have a higher education than her but that doesn't make me stronger unlike the so called strong women i don't feel the need to chastize her and rub in her face that i make more money and i attend a prestigous university she's content and secure with her self is extremely responsible intelligent and has a great deal of prowess and it shows through her actions not her words therefore she is strong Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Domestic violence Poker jargon Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City David Hume Jiddu Krishnamurti Atheism Blackjack Dead Like Me The nature of God in Western theology Simone Weil Blonde on Blonde Columbine High School massacre Karen Horney God Emperor of Dune Aerial (dance move) Guns N' Roses Asperger syndrome Undergrads Jam (TV series) Rape Public-key cryptography Sharon Tate Katelyn Faber The Smoking Room Kim Possible Hiberno-English Professional wrestling slang Calvin and Hobbes Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Noam Chomsky Emotions (album) Effeminacy Eye contact Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Tonality Dragon Booster Strap-on dildo Empress L__ Zhi American football strategy Plame affair Knots Landing The O.C.
