is it only okay for a woman to be topless when she's breastfeeding if then just following up on a thread regarding whether women should be able to go topless if they should not is it okay when they are breastfeeding why is it that women's breast are so highly sexualized when their purpose is to feed infants fyi other than the cultural connotations given to women's breasts they serve no purpose other than feeding infants they have become sexualized over time the question is why why women's and not men's when there are nerve endings sensitivities for both my question is about the purpose of breasts not the cultural sexual associations and the purpose is for breast feeding you know there are people who lobby and find breastfeeding in public defensive and want it banned i think the reality of it is the taboo religious beliefs that are still controlling culture laws and people's mindset anything that can be sexual will be made sexual even as innocent as feeding a child and made a big deal out of some will even push to make it illegal nasty or dirty sensuality has little meaning it's all about objectification of the body associating sexuality with nastiness and sex with guilt pretty unfortunate Nudity Breastfeeding Human sexual behavior Fertility awareness Pornography Pedophilia Oral sex Medical analysis of circumcision Sexual orientation Abortion debate Feminism Rape Obscenity Indecent exposure Sexual revolution Child sexuality Gay Incest Transsexuality Religion and sexuality Infant History of sex Video game controversy Sex and the City Child pornography Paraphilia Homosexuality Motion picture rating system Reparative therapy Nipple Domestic violence Pregnancy AIDS Nudism Woman Childlove movement Sexual intercourse Birth control Milk Breast milk Breast cancer Marriage Sexual attraction Puberty Child sexual abuse 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Gender role Infant formula Sexual objectification Childbirth Satanic ritual abuse Orgasm Sex education Intersex surgery Human sexuality Sexual abstinence Zoophilia Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Nestl__ boycott Androgen insensitivity syndrome A Course In Miracles Breast pump Hentai Bondage (BDSM) Penis Social rule Undergarment Fat fetishism Abortion Homophobia Physical intimacy Self-harm Kibbutz Anal sex Pornographic movie Eugenics Adoption Topfree equality Female genital cutting Israeli Arab Education in the United States Sex Human penis size North American Man/Boy Love Association Co-sleeping Mahram Roe v.
