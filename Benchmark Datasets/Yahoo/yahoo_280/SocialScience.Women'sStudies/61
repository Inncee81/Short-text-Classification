how many women here disagree with feminism i'm personally against it and believe in humanism because mens rights are violated also hence men die sooner all i will say is that i for one have never asked to have my bra burned it has always irritated me that a group of women got together and changed the world for everyone i think that women should have rights of course but the ripples of the early feminists have generated a society where a woman can hardly stay home to raise her kids most households need two incomes debt is higher people live beyond their means kids are running rampant and no longer have other neighborhood kids to play tag with unless it is online virtual tag etc etc etc i could go on and on i never asked for it and i think the world was a better place altogether when women wore skirts i am a mom i have to work my kids are in day care i work to pay day care its a rotten circle rebuttal for the person under me i do not imply that real estate has gone up as a result of women asserting themselves i only state that one drop in a pond can cause a wave at the shore and yes there are a variety of factors this being one of them i do not like the fact that we as a society have a hard time saving money and just buying a car or a house or anything else and financing is a must now as are two income families no feminists didn't drive the prices up themselves but the hounds who watched it happen as all of these women running out and insisting that they need the jobs men have demand is up prices are up lifestyles are up and i didn't ask for any of it myself that is only my opinion i personally believe that i was born about years late i should be a 's mom because i believe more in the ideals of the times as a whole i know every era has its rough spots but it's just how i feel i also feel that the person who commented about me is exactly right in the statement that all women should be who and what they want to be that includes me i only state that the movement has generated a new age from the one before it and i preferred the way life was before that time yes women did work just as hard as men did back then at the home i actually have a job that i really love i make decent money i am divorced and i teach on the side because i enjoy it i am only saying that it would be nice to have the option of not wanting to work if as you say let women do what they want then why don't you let me have my opinion i just liked the way family life was before when women were around to raise their kids i actually do like working i enjoy adult company at work i could stand on a soapbox and state my beliefs for you if you wish but i believe in not beating others up for what they believe and i wish they would respect the same as me i am a secure happy confident woman who manages to balance my work my two kids my handicapped mother and a household very well i am happy in my life because i choose to be and it has nothing to do with any man believe me i only believe in a lot of things for society as a whole and you are right there are a lot more factors than just feminists but nobody has asked those questions yet we are talking about feminists and when i address that question i address the women who stand on boxes that practically try to erase the male sex not strong confident women who choose their own paths in life respect me and i'll respect you by the way i will be voting for hilary and for the right reasons not just because she is a woman and so am i Abortion debate Theory of conduct Transsexuality Gender role Humphrey Bogart Feminist movement Microeconomics Women in Islam Pitaten Economic inequality Knots Landing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inflation Feminism Sexual orientation Avenue Q Civil rights Plame affair Meaning of life Laura Schlessinger American individualist anarchism Woman Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Gold standard Transgender Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gender-neutral language EastEnders Fathers' rights History of women in the United States Same-sex marriage History of intersex surgery Domestic violence Supply and demand Infantilism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Masculism Estoppel One Tree Hill (TV series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rosa Parks Human sexual behavior Rick Santorum Deflation (economics) Generation X Hyperinflation Contract Fahrenheit 9/11 High-heeled shoe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Strap-on dildo Keynesian economics U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Polyamory Sharon Tate Tag Homemaker The Jam Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Ann Coulter The Apprentice 2 Same-sex marriage in Canada Economics Grandview, U.S.A.
