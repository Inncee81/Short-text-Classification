can you prove to me that women are logical instead of dating nice men who they can actually benefit from dating they often date jerks losers and 'bad boys' who give them stress and heartache i haven't addressed this before but i'm thinking this 'bad boy' thing must be true since it is the most common generalization about women its so common it is almost ambarrassing yeah and all men are helpless children it's the most common generalization so it must be true right it's not that we like bad boys it's that so called nice guys aren't the very few truly nice kind thoughtful guys i've met never had a problem getting laid but there were plenty of guys who thought they were nice who were really passive aggressive secret jerks it's not nice to make the woman make all the decisions and then mope when things don't go your way it's not nice or sensitive to whine about how you've been hurt without taking any responsibility for yourself it's not nice to become friends with a woman never give her any hint that you want to be anything more and then get all p ssy when she doesn't fall into bed with you it's also not nice to ignore the nice girls in favor of b tches who are hot and will never look at any guy who isn't rich a brad pitt lookalike the owner of a harley but then blame of the population because you keep going after the b tchy girls jeez The Fairly OddParents Ranma __ characters Transactional analysis Social rule Friends Humphrey Bogart Philosophical skepticism Phoebe Buffay's songs The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pip (South Park episode) Avenue Q The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Undergrads Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man The Inside Ron and Fez Madonna (entertainer) George Costanza Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism About a Boy Kodocha Extreme Programming Kyle Broflovski Minor characters in Seinfeld The Shining (film) Sex and the City AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Eric Cartman Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Procrastination The Catcher in the Rye Doug Goodness and value theory Bon Jovi Meaning of life Fruits Basket Future-Drama The Smoking Room Usher (entertainer) The Apprentice 2 Pok__mon Live! 50 First Dates Pitaten Teen Girl Squad W.I.T.C.H.
