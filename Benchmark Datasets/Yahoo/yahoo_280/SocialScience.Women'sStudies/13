is it really fair to say that men couldn't possibly stand the pain of childbirth if they were to go through it wouldn't they just step up to the pain because it had to be done the same as women do i'm going to copy and paste my answer from a similar past thread men may not be able to give birth but plenty of men have endured other probably even more traumatic experiences who do you think the vast majority of soldiers and warriors throughout human history have been men but of course getting an arm hacked off your face whacked with a spiked mace bullets to the gut your flesh ripped up by shrapnel or your skin burned with mustard gas is nothing compared to the pain and trauma of pregnancy and birth right whenever i hear this argument that giving birth requires some kind of special resilience that only woman can have i feel like slapping the people who say it for their stupidity go talk to the men who fought in the trenches of wwi or survived the bataan death march and tell them how they couldn't possibly take the strain of pregnancy Childbirth Trench warfare Pregnancy Abortion Post-traumatic stress disorder Psoriasis Miscarriage Darth Vader Human Simone Weil Adoption Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Circumcision Human sexual behavior Side Characters (Xenosaga) EastEnders Clothing Medicine Goodness and value theory Comanche Left-handed Unreal Fecal incontinence Magneto (comics) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bataan Breech birth Reincarnation Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) World War I Sin City Torture Tank Obstetrics Birth control Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Chemical warfare Spina bifida Free trade Doom enemies Sexual dysfunction Transsexuality Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Blood (computer game) Condom Urinary incontinence Ammunition Tank classification Romulus and Remus Professional wrestling match types Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Wolfrider Poker jargon Irish Guards Nazi human experimentation Carpal tunnel syndrome Earring Terminal ballistics Doctor (Doctor Who) Hand grenade Naruto jutsu Aortic dissection Major League Baseball television contracts Sant Mat Hera Equine conformation Crucifixion Smallpox Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Invisibles Masturbation Double bass Kain (Legacy of Kain) Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Cytomegalovirus Total war Pok__mon Abilities Theory of conduct Hearing impairment Wolverine (comics) Rape Dragons (Pern) Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle RuneScape quests Tool (band) Vampire Non-lethal force K' Coeliac disease Pre- and perinatal psychology
