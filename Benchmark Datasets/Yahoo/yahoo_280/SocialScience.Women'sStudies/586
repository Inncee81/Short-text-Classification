an y feminists who support porn visual erotica many people think porn sexuality and feminism can't go hand in hand i'm a feminist who likes porn for my own gratification turn ons and it serves as a good warm up with a significant other i don't watch porn to to give in to a man's needs or to put women down i do it because it's my choice i enjoy my sexuality and i feel that porn visual erotica isn't only for men after all feminism is originally about choice and defying gender expectations why should i live up the stereotype that women shouldn't look at porn or be sexual and why should i believe that women are surrendering to men in the sex industry hello we females have sex and get naked because we like it get over it as long as nobody is being forced or harmed i'm okay with women choosing to enter the sex industry in a way porn actresses and strippers are in a position of power and are exerting control over male viewers jhmsi i'm with you that i like visual stimuli i'm not into reading romantic stories to sexually turn me on like how women are stereotyped to be romance is definitely sweet but porn not the disgusting out there kind is fun also well simone i go to strip clubs with my boyfriend lol i'm not bisexual but i enjoy it for some reason strippers say they enjoy giving lap dances to couples and they pay more attention to the girl kris j yes the cons of porn are the beauty ideals but i personally was rational enough to not let that affect me amateur porn erotica features normal looking girls many have medium to small breasts i agree with you i'm a feminist and an iconoclast and a libertine and an atheist and a liberal and an omnisexual and so much more too and i find visual stimulation simply wonderful now that could be because of my voyeuristic tendencies but i just find pornography sexually satisfying of course i personally love the hardcore yaoi stuff the most but hey that's pretty obvious given my avatar i'm just one of those people who derives pleasure from visual physical sex as well as personal fantasies that's just how i am and other girls can go oh making love is so much more meaningful than just having casual sex and watching porn is nasty all they want but i prefer to not be a hypocrite Gender role Pornography Striptease Bondage (BDSM) Sadism and masochism Pedophilia Hentai Pornographic movie Group sex Child pornography Bisexuality Human sexuality Transsexuality Sexual orientation Pornography in Japan Lesbian Gay slang Feminism Infantilism Nudity Bish__jo game Gender Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Masturbation Sex in science fiction Oral sex Sexual revolution Pornographic actor Zoophilia Prostitution Homosexuality History of sex Little Britain Paraphilia John Holmes (actor) Child sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Friends Gender-neutral language BDSM Sex and the City Erotica AVN Awards Slash fiction Transgender Strap-on dildo Biology and sexual orientation Madonna (entertainer) Homosexuality and Christianity Fan fiction Homophobia Boogie Nights Orgasm Motion picture rating system Sexual attraction Domestic violence God and gender Sento Anal sex Annabel Chong Andrea Dworkin Drag queen Anime Polyamory Homosexuality and transgender Gay pornography Effeminacy Media and ethnicity Pornography addiction Love Religion and sexuality Great Teacher Onizuka LaVeyan Satanism Sexuality in Christian demonology Avenue Q Sinfest Casual relationship Physical attractiveness The Country Wife Humphrey Bogart Serial killer Gay Cardcaptor Sakura The 120 Days of Sodom History of intersex surgery Sex toy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcissism Sexism Women in Islam Feminist movement Sin City Sex
