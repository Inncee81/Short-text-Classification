do girls judge their friends' boyfriends as much as guys judge their friends' girlfriends i feel like a lot of guys at least younger ones will date pretty girls who they don't get along very well with simply because they are afraid of what their friends would think if they dated a plain girl based on her personality and they are afraid of how she will reflect on them i was wondering if girls have similar feelings of doubt in that situation are they paranoid about dating a guy who isn't exceptionally good looking because they're afraid of what their friends will say also will girls typically lie and say they liked a friend's boyfriend even if they weren't a fan just an fyi by younger i meant under yes women care about how they are perceived among their friends just like men are when i was younger and had lower self esteem i started liking this guy who wasn't the cutest i never brought him out in public because i was afraid of losing status among my peers even though i was really into him i think women feel more pressure than men in some cases just think about how much we do things to show off to other women you won't see this with a woman who is confident though because she has chosen friends who are of substance and as confident as her so they will see what she sees in the guy too depends on the friendship unless i have valid reasons for disliking a guy my friend is dating disrespectful etc i respect her personal decision and accept the guy without questioning anything after all she's the one dating him not me Social rule Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Transsexuality Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Ranma __ characters Kodocha George Costanza About a Boy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Smoking Room Megan Griffin Kim Possible Big Brother (USA TV series) Religious Society of Friends Avenue Q Sex and the City Cliff Richard Otaku Infantilism EastEnders Mary Jane Watson Knots Landing Theodicy Friendship Pok__mon Live!
