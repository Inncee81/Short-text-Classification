why can't the women have an intelligent discussion about gender relations here one women posted that most of the men here are trolls who cannot have an intelligent discussion from what i see this is false unless the definition of troll is someone who doesn't agree with you and isn't afraid to say it the reason we can't have an intelligent discussion here is because a lot of women don't like to here opinions they don't agree with at least most of the men here give logical intelligent arguments that really make sense if you think about it the women just say i'm right and your wrong and if you can't see that i'm right you're a stupid woman hater also i'm aware that some answers are somewhat offensive but to me 'offensive' is just another way of saying not sugar coated to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside although women could make intelligent arguments i wouldn't doubt that but more often than not they're easily affected or agitated by the person whose viewpoints are different from theirs this phenomena has neverthless further lowered the intelligent level of the discussions by the most of the woman here and sometimes i got irritated by some typical answerings of stating that i've seen many women or men who don't do such such things or don't react in such and such manners if you happened to state your questions or opinions asking why do some women do this or that or have reacted in such and such a manner wasn't it annoying who'd know of that kinda statement honest or not or how to verify it wouldn't that it's so cunning and shrewd way of answering questions so if you'd like to talk about the issues of intelligent discussions here mike you could get certain responses that are intelligent but if you asked a question that seemed to have puzzled you to the women here in a most polite normal manner chances are you couldn't get the most honest direct answers either while some of the responses from the women side really represented the hatred of men and trying to hide the very truth of women's secrets women would answer the questions in a more indirect way as to protect their true motivations behind the facade Theory of conduct Logic Internet troll Theodicy Social rule Philosophical skepticism Epistemology God Emperor of Dune Agnosticism Downing Street memo Philosophy of language Goodness and value theory Atheism William A.
