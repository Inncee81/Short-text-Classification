do women really crave sex as much as men read the whole question please because men who crave sex are not that picky when it comes to good looks guys are even sexually attracted to girls of below average looks why do you think so many teenage guys fantasize about their friends' moms there is this woman in my martial arts class she is somewhat chubby and she looks like she is in her early or mid s but i think she is so hot she has pretty eyes and the way she looks at me is just sexy girls on the other hand always focus on a guy's negative features that is why they are only attracted to a really small percentage of guys so is it really fair to say that women crave sex as much as men do and don't start going on about how you have have a boyfriend who is of below average looks but you think he's hot because that's only because you have feeling for him i'm talking about guys you think are sexually attractive saja you are missing my point and you are completely misunderstanding me i am anything but shallow and i am not perverted i never said women in their s who are a bit chubby would not be hot i am saying that they are hot and a lot of guys probably agree but women do not find men in their s who are slightly chubby attractive even if they have pretty eyes and no i do not have a narrow minded opinion of what is attractive your answer fails automatically just for saying that as i've said before i find all kinds of women attractive there are very few women i don't find attractive and i actually don't know many women who don't have a narrow minded definiteion of attractiveness most women even admit they only find of guys attractive and no i don't care what some stupid movie has to say because what i'm saying is based on reality and as for the whole 'leave her alone' crap what the hell makes you think i'm harassing her she doesn't even know i think she's hot i never said anything about wanting to have sex with her actually it's pretty inappropriate for someone her age to be having sex with someone my age but you probably disagree because any guy you'd be interested in doing is probably around my age and just to let you know you're probably times shallower than i am most women are i am not the least bit shallow and when did i say i consider her below my standards i guarantee she considers me below her standards why the hell would she wanna hook up with me women only wanna hook up with the really hot guys which i am not as you can see you've completely misjudged me and you must feel really stupid right now maybe next time you'll think before you post a completely rude and insulting answer without even understanding the question women are individuals you have to get to know us one by one to discover if we crave sex as much as men oh and by the way men are individuals too not all men crave sex equally below average looks according to whom do you really believe everyone has the same opinion of what constitutes below average looks or above average looks people are individuals and their opinions of beauty are individual why would somewhat chubby early to mid s with pretty eyes not be hot are only women who look like barbie dolls hot hmmm girls like boys yourself included often have a very narrow media influenced opinion of what constitutes attractiveness this tends to expand and change as girls and boys mature please leave the woman in your martial arts class alone she is there to do martial arts not to serve your fantasies she deserves someone far less shallow than you who obviously only want to have sex with her on the other hand maybe it would do you good to be used by her maybe she just wants a quick hookup with you and otherwise considers you to be below her standards reality check time argh rent the movie shallow hal and take notes Human sexual behavior Social rule Little Britain Barbie Spice Girls Theory of conduct Abortion debate The Ashlee Simpson Show Zoophilia Kodocha Cliff Richard Child sexual abuse Milton H.
