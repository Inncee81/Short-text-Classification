if men could fall pregnant and wanted to keep the child when you didn't want to have any children yet ladies what would you do support your partner as best as you can financially and emotionally leave the man to deal with it on his own push for an abortion other explain what if the man didn't want the child at all and decided to terminate the pregnancy what would you do a support the mans decision after all it's his body b you really want the child and would try to convince the man not to abort c other if the situation with pregnancy was reversed would women be completely comfortable with men having the final say in what happens quote 'women should have no say in the matter our bodies our choice ' ok but the baby takes two people to create it and when a woman becomes pregnant men want to have a say in what happens as well with the child which imo is wise to be able work issues out together but if men were only concerned about 'their bodies' then that's only taking a backwards view don't you think gldjns no i haven't been wronged by a man in this situation and i'm trying to stress that with the issue of pregnancy alot of men in real life are left out of having any say at all with what happens to their child as well i don't believe for a moment that just because it's a womans body that what she says is rule it may be the womans body but the child belongs to both man and woman and there should be more thought and compromise on this issue so i turn the tables and ask women what they think about whether they should have a say or not when alot of women don't believe a man should have any say at all wow great question i myself am months pregnant and in an interesting situation because the father left my baby and i because he's irresponsible so to look at the reversal role is actually quite amusing to me and i think a brilliant way to look at things knowing what type of person i am i would personally support my partner as best i could and if he decided to abort i would give him my reasons for supporting the abortion or convincing him why we should keep the baby based on our situation at the time i do think either male or female if she's going to have an abortion with very limited exceptions to this rule both parties have a right to know if abortion is a factor so supporting the man's decision without serious acknowledgement and consideration of both parties' view and input would not happen with me but that's just my opinion you get a star Roe v.
