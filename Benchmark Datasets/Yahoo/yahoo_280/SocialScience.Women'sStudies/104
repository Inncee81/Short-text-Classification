why do women become highly successful and then complain that they can't find a good man i don't get why women ignore traditional roles become highly powerful independent educated and finanically successful and then complain that they can't find a good man or a man up to that standard because men are intimidated by successful women or they don't messure up to the same level of success just because women have started outshining men that doesn't change the fact that most men want a women who is below them in one way or another this is something that will never change men are not going to change what they like just because women no longer want to be in the roles men have always found attractive men are not intimidated by powerful or successful women just turned off and not interested no decent man wants to be with an alpha woman don't believe me how many men are pounding down the door to date oprah then ask who whats to date eva logoria you women know what your getting into every step of the way so why act surprised when men look the other way actually real men are turned on by successful powerful independent women lol like you would have any clue what being a 'real man' is as a woman it is impossible for you to know what being a 'real man' is therefore you cannot judge when someone is a 'real man' is or not what a glaring logical fallacy sure these women have a great resume to impress the corporate world and perhaps herself but honestly what normal hard working devoted man would want such a narrowly ambitious woman as a wife given this it broaches the question of what type of mother she would actually be one who challenges men on their traditional grounds and who despises her traditional role while mimicking male accomplishments but anyway for the record men don't give a sh t about a woman's career or financial status women seem to delude themselves into thinking that men size women up on the same basis they size us men up on by the time these career women become successful educated and highly powerful they're most likely in their 's w their looks fading and their biological clock ticking down why would a man want to start a family w a woman of that age men prefer younger women it's a biological trait men are predisposed to healthy fertile women such women are indicative of producing healthy offspring which is why in a real world application you won't see many men starting a family w a woman in her s etc further having children w women whose ovaries are running out at that age has an increased risk of birth defects another reason why men avoid such women or any woman irrespective of her career status for that matter also combine this with the fact that 'career' women raise their standards too high they like most women choose to 'marry up' thing is given their degree of success it will be much much more difficult to find the right man that suits their criteria on a side note studies have shown that successful women who do actually 'marry down' eventually become discontent w the marriage and thus they initiate the divorce primary reason being that they prefer a man of higher status than them they prefer him to be the breadwinner seemingly finally men choose to avoid these career women b c they would much rather prefer a young woman to have their kids and take care of them in other words they want a wife who has traditional values they don't want some career driven women who would most likely stick their kids in a daycare centre having them raised by some strangers and who also places her career above you understand this your career is irrelevant all these excuses these insecure women have are rubbish men are 'intimidated' by 'strong independant and successful' women etc the real reason is b c men are turned off by you hence why they avoid you b tches end Divorce Abortion debate Biology and sexual orientation Infantilism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Theory of conduct Emperor of Japan Economic inequality Polyamory Atheism Intelligent design Microeconomics Puberty Homosexuality and transgender Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Tai Chi Chuan Human height Friends Intelligence quotient Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Same-sex marriage Gender-neutral language Sexual orientation Logic Rape Education in Japan Domestic violence Appeal Species Adoption Democracy Single Transferable Vote Physical attractiveness Asperger syndrome Marriage Transsexuality Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Gender role Family Obesity Intersexuality Psoriasis Incest The Smoking Room Married... with Children Arguments for and against drug prohibition Mathematics Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Sexual abstinence Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theodicy Extreme Programming Goodness and value theory Paradox EastEnders Religion and sexuality Woman History of British nationality law Redundant array of independent disks Tocopherol Fight Club Annuity W.
