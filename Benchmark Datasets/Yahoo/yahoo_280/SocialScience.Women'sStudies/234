why do women try to act like men are unattractive and not sexy while many men state that they love women are attracted to women etc why do women think or pretend to think that men are unattractive is it foolish pride on women's part to hate to admit they find men attractive on one response to another question one woman said she only finds of men to be sexy is that true why do women hate admitting that they're attracted to the opposite sex my theory it seems like a lot of women try to act like men are unattractive i think this has something to do with a power move by many women as women want to hold the upper hand and the position of power regarding sex attraction so they act like most guys are disgusting and unattractive to many of these women suggesting that a man is sexy or gorgeous is a means of submission to the opposite sex men on the other hand do not care about this power ploy as they find it trivial and readily state that many of these women are hot and attractive here's the other question http answers yahoo com question index ylt anue ocwysp e mtojng cyxgt qid aaxvtme moxie slacker you seem annoyed and upset perhaps because i told the truth and struck a nerve instead of making personal attacks against me like a child how about addressing the issue instead i'm a random dude online and you're a random chick online your point i'm not talking about all women being interested in men i'm talking about so called heterosexual women that hate to admit they find men attractive moxie it's safe to say that you fit the description in my question as you are also an arrogant narcissit that feels insecure about stating she finds men attractive you mad lol let me also state the premise men like to feel desired just about as much as women many women fail at the ability to make her man feel desirable truth men continuously go on about hot women and women enjoy this attention despite the fact that many women pretend this attention is unwanted she likes to feel desired delicious wow the first truthful and honest post on this question so far as far as men being called players and studs when having sex with many women whereas a woman is seen as a s lut and a ho for doing the same well that is something i want to go in to later perhaps a different question however i will say that this notion is fair why for one with all of the perks and advantages a woman gets in the dating sex scene why do women want to keep all of their perks yet want to even out the few perks men get is that unfair the reason why men are congratulated and admired when they have sex with many women is that men are the ones that have to work hardest for the sex have to almost always initiate conversation and make the first move this is a lot of pressure put on the men a woman that wants sex is guaranteed to get sex and she doesn't have to work hard for it other than drop a few hints since it's so much harder for a man to get sex it's only fair moxie slacker why would i not like you i don't even know you this is the first time i've ever seen your screen name and you're already saying i have something against you i think you put way too much importance on yourself as far as you being a s lut well that was tmi on your part since i never asked but alas that description of you is not at all surprising also no one said anything about whether you're smart or not the fact that you have to announce such a thing speaks volumes of your own insecurity i have no problem with women just the misandry from women that goes on yes i was going to respond because i always respond when false accusations about me are made i stand up to lies and libel that's just who i am well this is the thing as you can see a ton of women do find men sexy and attractive and find men good looking physically but while many can rationalize this and can actually think with their brains recognize and make sense of their own sexual attraction to men some can't or rationalize their attraction too well and basically say what society has conditioned them to feel especially since so much ads and everything has to do with beauty and women beautifying that some women internalize this and feel they are the most attractive sex and men are machines or something but not realizing men and women are yin and yang men weren't supposed to look pretty like women yet that should not take away from their physical attractiveness just men are good looking in the masculine way just like women in their feminine way men look good as men women look good as women you are not supposed to compare apples to oranges and because both have attractive features that are unique to each other and thus probably i would assume the sexual attraction because other wise this judgment could be coming from one's definition but everyone can have a billion point of views or definition therefore it is not concrete and nothing more than little definitions without substance yet what is concrete is the stimulation attraction or lust visually physically that i would believe to imply the true meaning and that would be just for straight sexes but bisexuals whom more attracted to one sex in this way than the other i mean there's more to this but i'll stop now but i have chatted with women like this before like the lovely delicious stated with their feelings and after my analyzing of all these meanings and breaking things down intellectually many of the women wrote back to me like this oh wow very good points i never saw it like that before thanks oh wow very good or that's an interesting topic or perspective to bring up which after seeing it and expecting that this would make sense or should be automatically known it made me just scratch my head and realize societal condition does affect people and some women so much that they just say or think what things are supposedly are and i think to myself did these women ever step back for a second and realize truly what they are saying and the meaning behind it because it quite contradicts many things as their natural responses are concerned especially when asking numerous questions strategically i makes think like how does she not know this or is unaware of this i mean it's not rocket science just basic stuff pretty much yet she does not know how to explain or rationalize her attraction and another thing when i am speaking of this i am not talking about arousal or being attracted because of the physical i realize women generally aren't as visual sexually as men and that stuff but what i am talking about is just talking about is good looking recognition or perhaps sexual admiration which some women will fight so hard to not admit that they check guys from time to time or even a little discreet ogling obviously guys look more as the horny sex we are but women do too even if it's sparingly they have so with that said and done it can just be annoying when some women act this way or in denial because like i said it's human nature to look or admire even for women and i would assume if they are attracted to men or more so the admiration is different between when looking at an attractive man compared to an attractive woman i would assume the admiration to be sexual or more sexual while just comparison for women but don't worry it's more to do with societal conditioning for some women than them not finding men good looking or sexy etc and as i have said a good amount of women don't deny the attractiveness of men or actually think for their own and not of what is construed of society Similarities between the
