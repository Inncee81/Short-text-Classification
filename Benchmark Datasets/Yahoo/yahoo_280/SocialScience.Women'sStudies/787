how do you feel about self righteousness it's a perfectly legitimate to feel strongly about and argue one's viewpoint however it's quite another to dogmatically say that if one is not a feminist that means that they definitely do approve of women being sexually harassed abused being second class citizens of not being of equal worth as men etc etc not only are these statements untrue they belie a self righteousness usually only associated with persons who refuse to even consider any facts that might call their dogma into question what do you think about statements and insinuations like these mollypop i hope that is the case but this has been stated or insinuated countless times here david i don't name names or anymore post links that single people out but it has been said in so many words many times the point has been made perfectly clear david see maddocks answer maddocks thank you you've made my point right her first let me be clear i ain't no fem nothin there is not a single thing fem about me not a feminist feminine female none of that secondly your statement is that if a person believes the above statements about women not being abused etc they must be a feminist therefore if they are not a feminist they must not believe those things anyone else that is wondering what i am talking about this is an insinuation however others have made the same statements even more clearly david see the third answer here david as i said i will not name names or post links but there have been plenty of people who have said that right here not sure why you haven't seen these postings maybe you don't want to the answerer here said softly that if one believes in equality etc that makes one a feminist i disagree of course however if her preposition is true what if you are not a feminist do you really not see this or are you choosing to ignore it hallousness what's wrong with an actual defintion i assumed that a reader did not know what self righteous means they could look it up themselves in seconds how can you reasonably select one synonym rather than a definition and run with the synonym that does not apply in this context once you picked the synonym that you like but does not fit into this context i stopped reading david just noticed a better example please see hallousd's answer below that states it even more clearly here a feminist stating that if you are not a feminist you do not believe in equality etc david which of your statements is true i ve never come across of feminist who said that or yes i have seen the odd feminist say if you're not a feminist you don't believe in equality i have not changed my argument but you have secondly my statements are simply based on the many feminists here who have stated the above just like hallousd below not a preconception his hers is a fine example of what plenty of what many feminists right here in this forum have stated and this aint got nothin to with patriarchy matriarchy or any other feminist inspired archy jargon this sort of self righteousness is hate speech and insulting to the of the world that do not consider themselves feminists i am not anything that ends in ist and i will never be described as anything starting with fem despite loving and being loved by many many dozens of females bijou i like answers some of the people are nice and i don t mind a nice healthy debate it is boring to discuss topics with people with whom you already completely agree what is there to be learned from that i stumbled onto this forum and got stuck here out of my curiosity about what people who call themselves feminists really think are you saying that the people who claim to be feminists here are not it is also a place where others gather so there is also some perspective though the huge number of silly questions is an annoyance david you're right i have no idea what you are talking about self righteous adj piously sure of one's own righteousness am heritage dict nd coll ed it's not about hypocrisy per se but about certainty one who never questions his or her own ethical assumptions is prone to self righteousness questioning the conventional assumptions of our day might involve questioning whether non violence is an adequate ethical principle one might question whether damage to the soul isn't just as bad as physical damage and one might question whether the ambiguity in the definitions of violence aren't fatal to its relaibility as an ethical principle violence n physical force exerted for the purpose of violating damaging or abusing violent adj marked by or resulting from great physical force or rough action both from am her nd coll ed the former is ethically charged while the latter is morally neutral some feminists and some others have played fast and loose with the definitions of violence expanding it to include not only any application of physical force generally whether great or not but also to include any behavior that may be said to induce a feeling of fear with no qualification for paranoia or other emotional self indulgence of a sort analogous to a nursed grudge secondary anxiety or depression etc derrida included judging and name calling as metaphysical violence harrassment is a similarly abused term non self righteous people are open minded enough to know that human fallibility demands the toleration of difficult discussions of ethical fundamentals without immediately questioning the motives or integrity of those who disagree with them in other times violence was considered bad only when it was unjust violence but moral absolutism and categorical condemnation of physical force has come to many corners of feminism not only as regards the fundamentals but also to more practical ethical issues the reason for bringing this up isn't to attack non violence but to present a repugnant take on fundamentals to show how hard it is to tolerate the questioning of assumptions in my experience only a small minority of feminists are willing to question their assumptions the rest piously sure of themselves are to some degree self righteous one point missed above is that if one is an anti feminist then one is assumed to be anti woman as if the ideology cluster that is feminism is identical with women's interests this denigration isn't as clear if one is simply a non feminist feminism is nominally concerned with equality but feminists define their own criteria of power and conveniently omit the powers of the sort that men have complained about for centuries manipulative powers in emotional and sexual matters emotional manipulation does get discussed as the chief manifestation of girl's bullying but only insofar as it affects other girls to define feminism as a concern with equality is a very generous bit of defining but the actions of feminists on the ground speak louder than dictionaries on this point one should consider the difference of the kind of lexical term that holds between self righteousness and feminism feminism refers to a movement whose actions define its members more than any stipulations while self righteousness refers to a specific sort of unpleasant behavior whose definition is uncontroversial but whose predication of any particular person might be and equality may be at bottom a mathematical concept but it can be applied or not to myriad dimensions of human affairs and these applications can be fair or unfair one could say that there ought to be equal numbers of women in jail as men as fairly as feminists say that women ought to take home as much money as men without their having to work as many hours as long at the same job or in equally risky jobs there is plenty of reason to at least question whether feminism is manifestly about equality or fairness but in criticising feminism one is often met with accusations of one's being anti woman or trying to justify the oppression of women and then there's the matter of whether feminism really does serve women's best interests millions of women don't think so
