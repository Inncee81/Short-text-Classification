why is it that i only get turned on by women well like in in photographs or movies if i look at a photo of a naked man i sometimes get grossed out but if its a woman or a woman and a man or even two women it turns me on why is this i know im not a what your thinking i love men but this is weird i think it's because men look vulnurable when their naked i just dont like it delicious sure you obviously didn't read the question not by and actually man standing infront of me but a man trying to be sexy grosses me out women are beautiful and sensual creatures so it's normal to find them attractive even if you're completely straight don't read too much into it or over analyze it even if you messed around with another woman you wouldn't necessarily have to be lesbian or bi one's sexual orientation isn't only based on what turns them on in order for you to be gay you have to have the ability to fall in love with a woman there is nothing wrong with appreciating other women's beauties and being heterosexual Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Friends Ex-gay Homosexuality Heterosexuality Bisexuality Religion and sexual orientation Biology and sexual orientation Homophobia Homosexuality and transgender LGBT Homosexuality and Judaism Gay Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage Nudity Lesbian Pedophilia Gay rights Gay slang Transgender Gender role Choice and sexual orientation Sexual attraction Reparative therapy Sexual revolution Pornographic movie Feminism Heteronormativity Coming out Male prostitute Humphrey Bogart Transwoman Transsexuality Little Britain Social rule Katie Holmes Homosexuality in China Zoophilia Homosexuality and Neopaganism Laura Schlessinger Pederasty Homosexuality in Japan Germaine Greer Effeminacy Don't ask, don't tell Shaggy dog story Married... with Children Terminology of homosexuality The Smoking Room Depictions of lesbian sex in pornography Will & Grace Outing Sh__nen-ai Sex and the City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Yoko Ono Anal sex Demographics of sexual orientation Anglican views of homosexuality "Weird Al" Yankovic Theodicy Time Out of Mind Pornography Sharon Stone Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Group sex Marriage The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) God Emperor of Dune Anti-gay slogan Andrea Dworkin Queer as Folk (U.S.) Homosexuality and medical science Madonna (entertainer) Jayne Mansfield Stewie Griffin Asperger syndrome Same-sex marriage in the United States Age of consent Louise Brooks Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Physical attractiveness Marilyn Monroe Philosophical skepticism William Shakespeare Sex symbol Gay rights timeline Same-sex marriage in Canada Gay village Orgy Simone Weil Age disparity in sexual relationships Sex education Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Gay pride Pornographic actor
