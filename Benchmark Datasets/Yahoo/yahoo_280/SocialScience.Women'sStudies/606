do very attractive women end up with the worst men in the end lets face it very attractive women get so much attention that they often have no relationship skills they often have a twisted idea of what a good man is and often ignore quality men and chase lower quality men so they spend their prime between age and chasing and dating toxic men and by the time their looks fade and they realize what a quality man is they are often too damaged to be a quality partner so i think the average looking women actually have it best they get quality men and have normal egos which lead to better personality and social skills then their highly attractive counterparts the only reason i didn't like dating unattractive guys is because they have such a low self esteem and not to mention they get cocky if you date them and next thing you know they think that you are so fortunate to be dating them poor thing i date one once and i dumped him i don't like arrogant males and he was becoming so arrogant but good looking males on the other hand have always treated me like a princess so not all females end up with worst in the end the same must be for the men Physical attractiveness Human height Rei Ayanami Humphrey Bogart Asperger syndrome Anal sex Transgender Sub-Zero Laserdisc Interracial couple Dilbert Asian fetish Sexual attraction Friends Little Britain Gender role Social rule Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Baldness Gay slang Summa Theologiae Ranma __ characters Age of consent Plame affair EastEnders Samurai Deeper Kyo Daredevil Sexual orientation Angel (vampire) Something Positive Poker jargon Sin City Charmed Theodicy Harem anime Kim Possible Conscription About a Boy Microeconomics Garfield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an George Costanza Fighting Spirit Economic inequality Bisexuality Dragons (Pern) Seinfeld Homosexuality and transgender Urinary incontinence Ephebophilia Pride and Prejudice Infantilism Team Fortress Classic Swingout Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Spider-Man 2 Homophobia Child sexual abuse Final Fantasy XI Sigmund Freud Drawn Together Hearing impairment Xiaolin Showdown Memento (film) Domestic violence Fable (video game) Sheepshead The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Age disparity in sexual relationships Feminism History of sex Supergirl Characters in the Smurfs Woman Calvin and Hobbes Internet troll Leadership Fancy Crane Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Folic acid Guan Yu Galactic Civilizations Microcredit Self-esteem Autism Boston Public Days of our Lives Heteronormativity Hey Jude New Testament Ayra (Fire Emblem) Archie Comics The Fairly OddParents The Legend of Zelda series characters Maison Ikkoku Norway national football team Buffy Summers
