if a misandrist can be a feminist why can't a misogynist be one too please read this before answering there seems to be quite a few misandrists within the feminist movement whether it is in real life or on the internet such as y a but whatever the case those misandrist feminists are almost always defended by fellow feminists and sometimes even admired by them now feminist isn't female exclusive a man can be just as much a feminist as a woman since a feminist is according to dictionary com someone who advocates gender equality so since both men and women can be feminists and misandrists are supported by other feminists why can't a misogynist also be a feminist i am asking this since a ''supposed'' misogynist is calling himself a feminist but feminists are denying his label if you deny misandrists are supported by other feminists please do not answer the question as you are still in denial thank you ''seduction is often difficult to distinguish from rape in seduction the rapist often bothers to buy a bottle of wine '' andrea dworkin no matter what context you put this in it won't matter she believes sex is rape feel free to put it in a context where it will be alright here put this in context too ''only when manhood is dead and it will perish when ravaged femininity no longer sustains it only then will we know what it is to be free '' thanks good point absolutely no reason there are plenty of misandrist feminists and they justify it somehow so there's definitely no reason a misogynist can't be one as well Feminism Andrea Dworkin Civil rights Feminist movement Misogyny Abortion debate Masculism Gender Gender-neutral language Gender role History of feminism Woman Susan McClary Misandry Fathers' rights Domestic violence Theory of conduct Homosexuality and transgender God and gender Anarchism Theodicy Human sexual behavior Women in Islam American individualist anarchism National Organization for Women Pornography Catharine MacKinnon Bernard Williams Philosophy of language Radical feminism Gender identity Deconstruction Same-sex marriage Suffrage Two Treatises of Government Same-sex marriage in Canada Prostitution Sexual orientation Ronald Dworkin Serial killer Ethics Second-wave feminism Bisexuality Penis envy Transgender Postmodernism History of women in the United States Feminists for Life Holocaust denial Biblical inerrancy Atheism Homophobia Goodness and value theory Transfeminism Sexism Artemisia Gentileschi Legal aspects of transsexualism The Handmaid's Tale History of intersex surgery Roman Catholic Church Pedophilia Bell hooks Islam as a political movement Ruth Bader Ginsburg Infantilism Asian fetish Grimke Sisters Religion Sola fide Comfort women Friedrich Nietzsche Merit Arthur Schopenhauer Left-Right politics Spanish pronouns Butch and femme Homosexuality Epistemology Female genital cutting Feminist theology Social rule Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Discrimination Resurrection of Jesus Orgasm Age of consent Patriarchy Non-aggression principle Objectivist philosophy Thealogy Animal rights Church of Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Free will Germaine Greer
