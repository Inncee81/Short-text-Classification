what's up with women who say they're heterosexual but say that the male anatomy is not attractive they say their straight not even bi but then say that male sexuality anatomy is a turn off or not as much of a turn on as the female anatomy if you call yourself straight but are not into your lovers body wouldnt you be better off to just masturbate is this why people have sex with the lights out im talking about women who say theyre straight but do not find the male body sexy were not talking about any certain parts here just the naked male body in general how can you say youre straight but be more turned on by the female anatomy have i seen a pair of testicals yeah girl i love them cannot for the life of me understand how people don't see the male anatomy as absolutley gorgeous every inch of it actually lycra spandex this particular q of mine was inspired by a poster named nanni earlier today she claims to be straight finds females hot and men gross your answer was fabulous ahh mojo changed her name hello simone i posed a similar question a few days ago delicious i'm assuming my question inspired you to write this question http answers yahoo com question index ylt ap os kvhsv b l wd qwvsy ix qid aatvyyp anyhow i think a lot of these women are too proud to admit they're turned on by male features and the male anatomy plus society tells women that thinking erotic thoughts especially erotic thoughts about a man is something to be shunned upon women often feel guilty if they find they're having erotic thoughts about a man's penis sounds silly to me then there's that social stigma that women are slutty if they associate with sex liking sex and seeking sex i wish women were as sexually free as men men openly admit they love vaginas breasts her butt etc another part of the reason why some straight women state that the male anatomy is unattractive while the female anatomy is attractive is due to the socialized conditioning of putting women on a beauty pedestal due to a male dominated society any form of appreciating the male anatomy is linked to being gay which is taboo among male heterosexuals to be gay is a direct attack on a heterosexual male's manhood in order to counter this notion male dominated society makes the male form seem silly undesirable irrelevant and to be ignored as a result not only do men believe this inclination but heterosexual women start to believe this about the male anatomy as well who's to say soft feminine curves are better than the strong masculine chisled body you can't it's apples and oranges both are attractive and can should be appreciated in their own particular ways even though the ads billboards music videos strip clubs and television featuring beautiful women is directed towards men many women as a result of this male centric media orgy have been conditioned brainwashed into believing that only the female figure is beautiful as well there was a time period when artists like michaelangelo and leonardo di vinci would draw or sculpt the male figure in this day and age it is much rare to see heterosexual male or female artists paint the male form we are told that the male form is unattractive and to be ignored i as a heterosexual male am secure enough to admit that the male form is appreciative i was on the swim team and wore tight spandex jammer shorts picture http www swimming cz images fsiijammer xl jpg and i must've lost count on how many women i caught oogling my package others told me later that they caught some women in the crowd looking at my rear side in these shorts if men wore tight pants with their bulges outlined women would stare just like men stare at breasts and women are always wearing tight tops for this reason the difference would be that the women would readily deny that they were staring don't believe me watch this video where they do an experiment with several women at a restaurant and the waiter is wearing tight spandex pants with a fake penis placed in his pants http www youtube com watch v drrf utfste then watch the lady at the end of the video that says that was so disgusting this is what i'm talking about women readily denying it in the video she was mesmerized and fascinated while staring at his penis and was looking hot and bothered and lost her concentration women are so full of s hit and are such hypocritical liars it's incredible just admit you love staring at penis just as much as men have no problem stating that they love staring at breasts the only woman being honest was the older woman that took off her coat because she said the displayed penis was getting her hot and she was holding her chest because her heart was fluttering she also said she was enjoying the sight how many women will get mad at me now that i've told the
