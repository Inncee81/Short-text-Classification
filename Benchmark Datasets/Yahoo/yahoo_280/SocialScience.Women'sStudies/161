what do these kind of questions have to do with gender and women s studies google is a great tool if we don t know what something means it easy to search i just go to the categories where i want to read to learn something new or where i can answer because it is an area that i know why this section has little to do with the academic subject yes there is free speech but hey this is just too exaggerated guys would u rather be naked unable to talk stranded on the planet of the apes or be married to allegra should neurotic single women with yappy dogs they cant controll be destroyed by lethal injection why do women whom go to jail always turn out sleeping with a woman i mean they cant hold off for a man do the women around here make better men then the men do can the great alpha feminists please teach us what is a back passage if feminists don't want kids why don't they just get tubal litigation and shut up etc in the last four pages of the questions are like this i don t even open these questions but still i have to read the title unless i close my eyes on the other hand good questions or funny questions get deleted enlighten me please ok there is a lot of hate for women ok express your hate but could people post sometimes something more interesting or is it impossible i know there are people that post interesting questions but each day they are fewer and fewer as people leave because there is no real debate here and i know i will get insulted i don't care fraxinus yes it seems i need good long vacations from here too fresh air and positive vives gosh i sound so new age lol happy bullet what about us women that are interest in human rights and not in talks about cosmetics dresses or relationship gossips there are men also that are not interested in talking about cars but other social issues i am interested in gender and women's studies it is not my degree but it interests me i believe in human rights men and women but not in denigrating either sex perhaps that is why i don't shut up when i feel there are too many offensive questions and before you say it trolls like la rose that attacks men also infuriate me it is just that those questions are posted more seldom in comparison i was thinking the other day that after have been here for a couple of months i am more feminist than before because of all the attacking questions answers i am sure i am not the only one ironic isn't it the majority of stupid questions in gender and women's studies look like the work of immature stupid individuals on the other hand the sick crazy questions look like the work of sociopaths and psychopaths i totally disagree with the suggestion that stupid and or sick hateful people will go away if ignored you're underestimating the sickness and hatred of these people abusive questioners and answerers are relentless like any ruthless bullies and won't be stopped until they are relentlessly pursued and permanently banished if you look at the history of feminist anti racist anti homophobic and political progressive web sites discussion boards and blogs the organizers have been forced to take extreme measures to ensure the safety of people who wanted to participate without being barraged by psychotic messages and abused by the mentally unstable that love to flourish in an anonymous public domain yahoo users will never get rid of these people by using simplistic methods of just ignore them they'll go away these sick people will not go away unless ruthlessly tracked and banned by the yahoo organizers like the sick people here who relentlessly pursue users who dare to stand up to them yahoo answers will only stay the same with varying levels of hatred and abuse depending on the energy level of the sociopaths yahoo users can do absolutely nothing to change this situation yahoo has allowed the crazies to take over large portions of answers my time is going to be more and more limited so i'm going to participate in a monitored feminist web site where i can have intelligent conversations with varying degrees of disagreement without having to listen to a barrage of hate directed at women people of color glba's or anyone else who gets
