why do so many people think that citing exceptions refutes a generalization by definition a generalization predicts exceptions for instance the generalization men are taller than women knows that all men are not taller than all women no doubt this generalization is easily accepted because height is not really considered a virtue it seems that people say stop generalizing in order to avoid something they find uncomfortable but if a general statement is uncomfortable that doesn't stop it being true i'm talking about truth in the statistical sense of course logically the only thing that matters about a generalization is its accuracy not its implications but it seems that many people base their reasoning on what they hope is true and therefore resort to such fallacies to dismiss arguments they don't like so this is two questions really why do people think that calling a statement a generalization disproves that statement and why do people think that a generalization is disproved once exceptions are shown something awesome you may have whatever feelings you want to have you're making the fallacy i referred to earlier your argument is based on consequence rather than truth object of its ire everything you have said is irrelevant to what i said can't you see that or are you being deliberately obstructive i'm talking about how people think they can disprove a generalization by showing exceptions or by simply shouting generalization from your failure to address the question s asked how often you changed your answer and its incorrectness and length i'm guessing your the latest version of lekmich can you keep an account for longer than a minute of course your identity doesn't mean anything to the discussion i'm simply curious are you a lunatic or just a piss taker i'm sure you're a nutter but i don't deny that your online persona could be an elaborate joke it's called the rule of the exception flaw in critical thinking for example despite statistically lowering fatalities seat belt usage is frequently dismissed with the rule of exception but my aunt's neighbor's son in law once was thrown out of his car that burned and if he had been wearing his seat belt he would have died therefore based on that one exception or the minority statistical proportion seat belts are unsafe there is no further point in trying to explain the basis of odds with people who have not advanced beyond this unsophisticated stage of cognition as a nurse i wasted probably years of my life in total time tying to educate people who could not understand the flaw in exceptionary rationale Atheism Philosophy of language Epistemology Scientific method Philosophy of science Plame affair G__del's incompleteness theorem Intelligent design Internet troll Logical fallacy Goodness and value theory Existence of God Abortion debate Fallacy Resurrection of Jesus Philosophy of mathematics Presuppositional apologetics Utilitarianism Free will Theory Theodicy Economics Biblical inerrancy Ethics Philosophical skepticism Deconstruction Agnosticism Meaning of life Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Vacuous truth Doomsday argument Religion Ad hominem Strong atheism Contract Ontological argument Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an English grammar Bayesian inference Conspiracy theory Creationist cosmologies Artificial consciousness David Hume Causality Pseudoscience Fundamentalism Karl Popper Begging the question Augustus De Morgan Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Evolutionary creationism Phaedo Two Dogmas of Empiricism Traumatic incident reduction The nature of God in Western theology Paradox Philosophy of space and time Extreme Programming Gender-neutral language Reality Intelligent design movement Bertrand Russell A Course In Miracles Creationism Microeconomics Determinism Socrates Democracy Truth Faith and rationality Critical thinking Objectivist philosophy Peter Singer Cosmological argument George Edward Moore Critique of Pure Reason Coercion Abiogenesis Naturalistic fallacy Human Many-worlds interpretation Supernatural GED Sexual orientation Transcendental argument for the existence of God Psychology Soul Bah__'__ Faith and Science Complexity classes P and NP
