lads are these actions worth spoiling your life with sexual harrassement when we work in the office whats the point of looking and admiring a nicely dressed female or talking to her is it worth losing your credibility and job molestation there are plenty of women who would sleep for a night for some money or a dinner then why the hell this unprotected sex in todays society the male stands to lose more than a female as the system is geared to protect and crucify the guy so why my dear lads do you think they are really that important that you should go ahead destroy your life is this because young males need to be educated about the biased legal system and their need to fend for themselves in this gender biased society edit keith boyo you in some ways remind me of my myself i appreciate and respect your answer keith but you must understabd there is a lot of misuse of these situations by the opposite sex because of ignorance educate ones self is hard to do if one dose not realize it to begin with hence young and dumb do we need to educate young men yes should we educate them to thank that women have it all set up to fry us at a whim no we should educate them with good morals and to be more responsible to treat ladies with respect and to watch out for the bad because there is bad as well as good far as sexual harassment in the work place well again educate them to treat the ladies with respect and not to partake in sexual play talk or the like at work or in school or in any public domain but to say such play for the bed room and with the right girl women they are in a relationship with no i do understand man in search of answers and these laws can and have been used to fry guys just because the women didn't like him or some thing other that was not a real true case to but these laws are here and they are now in place so we have to understand that it is not wroth it and to be careful the way to do that is to educate are sons so that it slowly but surly can be turned i say that because then more will stand up to one who is wrongly accusing and perhaps then the laws will change to find that in fact it dose go both ways Avenue Q Theory of conduct Sex Human sexual behavior EastEnders Pedophilia Gender role Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Sexual orientation K' Child sexual abuse One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual harassment Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Gender identity Human sexuality Friends Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Transgender Feminism Sex and the City Homophobia Equal Protection Clause Discordianism Abortion debate Age of consent About a Boy Rape Plame affair Domestic violence Nicomachean Ethics Ex-gay Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
