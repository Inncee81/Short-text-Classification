if marriage has been such an oppressive burden to women in the past why do modern women still get married or are these claims of oppression merely posturing to obtain leverage and surprise more privilege in their marriages it's really people like you that feed misandrists' hate straight from the feminist's playbook if a misogynist hates it's because he's a bad man but if a misandrist hates it's because some bad man drove her to it a variation on woman good man bad lol just answer the question spare me your holier than thou attitude marriage is not oppressive in the past it wasn't oppressive but allowed women to have the freedom to be provided for i believe it was more oppressive to men because they were expected to provide for their families and expected to work hard earn enough for the family and keep the job to keep the life of their family going however it women were also looked down upon for not getting married many years ago about that in its self was oppressive but marriage was and still is only as oppressive as a woman and her husband allow it to be Marriage Feminism Gender role Misandry Feminist movement Andrea Dworkin Same-sex marriage in Canada Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage Divorce Gender-neutral language Sharia Masculism Germaine Greer Sex-positive feminism Sexual orientation Simone Weil Women in Islam Alignment (role-playing games) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Woman Babylonian law Christian view of marriage Nation of Islam Sola fide Nancy Witcher Astor One Tree Hill (TV series) Polygamy History of women in the United States John Cassavetes Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Incarnations of Immortality Eastern Orthodox Church 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Homophobia Culture of the United States Clergy Sexism Grunge music Tai Chi Chuan Yoko Ono Mahatma Gandhi Jews as a chosen people Bertrand Russell Anarchism Christian views of women History of feminism Holy Orders Fruits Basket Democracy Jennifer Lopez Iago Escape from New York Hillary Rodham Clinton Family Human Human position Marxist feminism Oppression Nikah Mut'ah Richard Allen (reverend) Scientology beliefs and practices Homemaker Non-aggression principle Grimke Sisters Mail-order bride Kitsch Theory of conduct Origin belief Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Affirmative action Shaggy dog story Peter Griffin Another World (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Knots Landing Arab-Israeli conflict Legal aspects of transsexualism Osama bin Laden Queer Friends The Pilgrim's Progress Israeli Arab Merit Norway national football team American individualist anarchism High-heeled shoe Plural marriage Islamic view of marriage Leviathan (book) Mojave people Anne Boleyn Rastafari movement Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Handmaid's Tale Freeters Unemployment
