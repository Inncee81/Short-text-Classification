do you think we have to begin to think more globaly in terms of questions answers what i mean about this is that it seems that answerers come from very different backgrounds and cultures of course this creates friction would it be helpful to have a little bit more information about the background of each of us perhaps we would become more human here if i say this is because a friend of mine died today it makes me think all of us can go away in a second and we are wasting so much time with hate perhaps if we know a little bit of each other is easier to have tolerance before this question gets deleted again i want to be clear that this topic is oriented towards trying to understand the hatred from bothe genders in this place i'm not sure that i agree with your inference of friction attributed to the convergence of diverse cultural backgrounds in yahoo answers offering more information on individuals answering questions has no bearing on the answer when in fact the objective is to answer the question regardless of any cultural background i don't see much time devoted to hate in yahoo answers and truthfully there are more answers that might be satirical in nature and border on sarcasm but the highest percentage of answers are those that come from serious people trying to help others who for whatever reason have a need if you are referring entirely on gender issues it is quite evident that we live in a world that has seen the highest levels of divorce and family breakup it would be understandable that some women and some men have veered towards disdain for the opposite sex instead of learning from their bad experiences and focusing on more positive thoughts without stereotyping a total gender based on their own maligned images yahoo answers has at times become a battle ground for political religious cultural and sexual issues but we have to keep in mind that in a forum such as this the right to free speech and free expression is what makes it all work people can feel free to say whatever they want within the parameters of yahoo answers conduct policies without the fear of retribution by others within the forum giving out cultural information might lead to further hateful and harassing statements does the death of your friend have any relevance to your statements Sexual orientation Homophobia Reparative therapy Homosexuality and Christianity Hate speech Gender identity Philosophy of language Gender role Transsexuality Feminism Ethics Freedom of speech Socrates Zoophilia Same-sex marriage Expert system David Hume Theory of conduct Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Globalization Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sex Human The nature of God in Western theology Internet troll Bisexuality Gay rights Logic Social psychology Political correctness Domestic violence Gender-neutral language Masculism Cultural relativism Reality Opposition to cults and new religious movements Democracy Civil rights Infantilism Ex-gay Past teachings of Prem Rawat Cult Transgender Bayesian inference Polyamory Economic inequality Scientology beliefs and practices Homosexuality and transgender Religion The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Religion and sexuality Goodness and value theory Philosophy Human sexuality English grammar Franz Boas Abortion debate Philosophy of mathematics God Second language acquisition William A.
