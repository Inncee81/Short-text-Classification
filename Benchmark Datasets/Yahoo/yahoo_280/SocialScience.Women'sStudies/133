can this be diagnosed as some kind of sign alright i work in the electronics department at a wal mart and a girl that i know works at the service desk now often times i am called up to the service desk to check returns and verify them as returnable or not based soully on my personal opinion but recently this girl has started talking to me more smiling as i walk by and saying hi but one thing really caught my attention one time when i was behind the service desk she came up beside me as i was writing out a defection slip which verifies that the item is defective and not only nudges but actually momentarily pressed her left breast against my shoulder for about a whole second and a half then asked what i was doing in a sort of cute way so now im wondering was it just an accident or did it mean something im not asking if i should date her or not that comes later im asking if this is some kind of sign so theres no possible way that a woman would do that on accident and you work at wal mart maybe she is just trying to set you up for sexual harassment invite your co workers out for a bowling night or something make sure she knows that you will be there if she shows up great slowly take it from there just remember you guys work together and rumors fly quickly respect yourselves and you'll keep your job but dating in the workplace is never a good idea The Shining (film) Wal-Mart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
