reverse logic please answer why do people say if you don't like something you are in denial is it therefore impossible to dislike something and if you don't like something how should you express it without being being apart of it for example people who don't like gay's are accused of having denial issues with their sexuality how is that possible or even true if someone doesn't like pedophiles does that mean they secretly want to have sex with children if someone questions why women are a certain way for example some one asked why aren't women funny should the response be that this person is threatened by women how is does inquiry into an observation put one into the observation ad hominem attacks instead of answering the question the character of the person asking the question is attacked just something i notice about the responses on these boards always curious why they are answered as such stephanie lol i love it perfect kate yea i thought the question was dumb too but i felt it was from ignorance rather than insecurity first of all you have to make sure the statement is not based on a faulty premise i could make this statement man and woman makes child therefore might make for an interesting debate but why waste thought energy either the premise is valid or it isn't if it's valid then you have a base for discussion if the premise is not valid it's nonsense at least from your perspective read carefully you can't make sense out of non sense it's not reverse logic it's ill logic let it go Philosophy of language Pedophilia Theodicy Sexual orientation Philosophical skepticism Epistemology Logic Meaning of life Atheism Deconstruction Ad hominem Transcendental argument for the existence of God A Course In Miracles Avenue Q G__del's incompleteness theorem Ontological argument Same-sex marriage Logical fallacy Internet troll Abortion debate Goodness and value theory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reality Criticism of Mormonism Plame affair Falsifiability Objectivist philosophy Logical argument Dissociative identity disorder Theory of conduct Intelligent design Presuppositional apologetics Social rule Causality Socrates Aesthetic Realism Free will Reparative therapy Ex-gay Contradiction Vacuous truth Intelligent design movement Paradox Augustus De Morgan Ethics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Infant baptism Homosexuality and transgender Creation-evolution controversy Human sexual behavior Scientific method Feminism Existence of God David Hume Fallacy Biblical inerrancy Simone Weil Zoophilia Human Agnosticism Philosophy of mathematics Model (economics) Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Law of value Sex education 2004 U.S. presidential election recounts and legal challenges Where Mathematics Comes From Philosophy Joke Slashdot subculture Postmodernism Childlove movement Criticism of libertarianism Determinism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) John Titor Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Transsexuality Adjoint functors Rick Santorum Cultural relativism Arthur Schopenhauer Little Britain William A.
