why don't western feminists speak out against the treatment of women in islam i live in a city with a growing muslim population i saw a woman covered head to toe in a burqa she sat hunched over on a bench she radiated no aura of confidence happiness or approachability she basically looked like chatel there for the whims and orders of her husband why do feminists ignore this blantant display of male chauvenism sexism my take western feminists are predominantly left wing and in general are infatuated with third world culture and religions and thus support multiculturalism to criticize muslims is to criticize multiculturalism indirectly moreover many are infatuated with islam because it is strongly anti american their infatuation with islam and multiculturalism is stronger than their will to point out islamic oppression of women the only thing women have to control men is their looks if you burqa them they lose their most valuable asset against men it's all about control not feminism when you think about it realistically i know my last paragraph can be interpreted as a mean thing to say i didn't mean to be insulting just try to image life in the desert in th century ad not much political correctness or women's lib going on men basically called all the shots so they put burqas on the women to demoralize them and control them i know it's not pleasant but it's just the way it is and this mentality persists even today in many muslim countries plenty of feminists speak out about the treatment of women in afghanistan and iraq and other parts of the world where women are treated unfairly whether the women happen to be in a muslim society or not gender inequality occurs worldwide in christian societies like the us as well the media just doesn't bother to report on any of it urge your senators to co sponsor the afghan women's empowerment act of http www democracyinaction org dia organizationsorg feministmajority campaign jsp campaign key t template dwt a voice for the voiceless a ms conversation with dr sima simar today she heads the afghan independent human rights commission and her longtime advocacy for human and women s rights continues to upset fundamentalists while drawing admiration from feminists worldwide http www msmagazine com winter avoiceforthevoiceless asp the talibanization of iraq under mounting repression courageous women fight for their rights and their lives is this how the u s brought freedom to the country http www msmagazine com spring taliban asp afghan radio owner and reporter killed zakia zaki the owner and manager of peace radio and a headmaster of a girls' school in parwan province was shot dead inside her home early this morning http feminist org news newsbyte uswirestory asp id how afghan captivity shaped my feminism by phyllis chesler middle east quarterly winter http www meforum org article help afghan women http www helpafghanwomen com u s feminists voice post taliban concerns http www womenforafghanwomen org press enews html the media could care less what feminists do you can't assume because you haven't heard about it that activists aren't busy dealing with problems in the us and worldwide Women in Islam Feminism Taliban Afghanistan U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Masculism Islam as a political movement French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Domestic violence Feminist movement Civil rights Left-wing politics Guantanamo Bay Animal rights Media and ethnicity Jew Human rights Status of religious freedom in Afghanistan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus War on Terrorism Fundamentalism Council on American-Islamic Relations Theory of conduct Political correctness Christian right Liberalism Gender role Gender-neutral language Multiculturalism Yusuf al-Qaradawi Abortion debate Hillary Rodham Clinton Postmodernism Polygamy Female genital cutting The Handmaid's Tale Burqa History of Afghanistan Divorce Atheism Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Rais massacre Worldwide green parties Dhimmi Ted Kennedy Pakistan Sharia New anti-Semitism Human rights in the United States God and gender Post-September 11 anti-war movement Hijab Camp Delta Islam in France Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Terrorism Arab-Israeli conflict Nation of Islam Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Liberal Democrats (UK) Ex-gay Islamist terrorism Cindy Sheehan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Dissociative identity disorder Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Fathers' rights Democratic Party (United States) Zbigniew Brzezinski Militant Islam George Galloway September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Religion and sexual orientation Freedom House Mahatma Gandhi Humphrey Bogart Jewish exodus from Arab lands History of intersex surgery Feminists for Life Religion Philosophy of language Al-Qaeda Pashtun Conservatism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual orientation Gulf War Radical feminism
