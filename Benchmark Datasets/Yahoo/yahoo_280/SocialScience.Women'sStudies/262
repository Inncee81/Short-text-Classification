how many feminists equate their philosophies with egalitarians i ask this because the very wording seems to be a trigger of anxiety for many feminist has become a demonized word egalitarian floats the same belief system yet triggers no fear happy bullet does not give a chance for any woman to offer philosophical discussion with any hope of intelligent feedback he sadly chooses to head butt blindly happy you are no better than the extreme feminists you ardently complain about object an adopted philosophy opens doors in the mind and does not necessarily mean that mind is blinded to individual thought a socialist movement was not the goal of my question equality is a belief what you ask it is a general question i see no need to nitpick it this question is philosophical what do you want to hear if i were to complain about equality it would be on an intellectual level many men assume i am a gold digger and quite stupid i am a blond it is different for all specifics are truly not relevent all humans should be treated according to what they give to the world attitude productivity effort the body shell should never be a deciding factor in what a person's worth is that is my point and goal now you are nitpicking the question wants to provoke thought and discussion i feel i have achieved this discussion is a powerful inspiration and i am happy with that as enough am i to start a coup in the white house when i am older and much wiser absolutely but it will be over other issues lol it's interesting that rebel never said anything about equality until a certain virus butted its her head in the entire point of this question is that feminism has an image problem the outsiders looking in see it as a movement characterized by misandry communism and other things this is not at all true but that doesn't matter it also doesn't matter how those stereotypes started even though we all know the answer to that what matters is the fact that feminism has this image switching to the term egalitarian in general public discourse would certainly soften the blow a self identified feminist could once they establish rapport with their audience go on from there to explain what feminism is really about by equating it to egalitarianism most feminists that would call themselves humanists egalitarians tend to honestly admit that feminism has a lot of garbage in its history and rightly want to contribute to the solution instead of to the problem there are of course feminists who see no problem with the image of feminism they are quite simply deluded and tend to be the feminists who don't reason very well with skeptics and could probably care less if they educated another person about the ideals and truths of feminism thank you to those of you feminists who do not act in this manner i will add that i do not particularly agree with the term egalitarian because of its connotations but do identify as a humanist particularly one following the general spirit of this declaration http en wikipedia org wiki a secular humanist declaration Epistemology Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Ethics Theodicy A Course In Miracles Objectivist philosophy Atheism Abortion debate Determinism Intelligent design Anarchism Intelligent design movement Philosophical skepticism Reality Deconstruction Theology Human Religion Civil rights The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Property (ownership right) Psychology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meme Biology and sexual orientation Libertarianism David Hume G__del's incompleteness theorem Libertarian socialism Nihilism Simone Weil American individualist anarchism Left-wing politics Postmodernism Infantilism Gender role Extreme Programming Cult Microeconomics God Altruism Slander and libel Soul Person S__ren Kierkegaard New Testament Rudolf Hermann Lotze Occam's Razor Discordianism Supernatural Cultural relativism Philosophy of mathematics Feminist movement Autism Idealism Friedrich Schleiermacher Homophobia Scientific method Socrates Ideology Political economy Economic inequality Coercion Liberalism Logic Masculism Social rule Fundamentalism Religious Society of Friends Internet troll Universal pragmatics Social justice American Conservatism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transsexuality Anthroposophy Fathers' rights Moral relativism Sigmund Freud God and gender Human nature Karl Popper Philosophy of science Evil Conservatism
