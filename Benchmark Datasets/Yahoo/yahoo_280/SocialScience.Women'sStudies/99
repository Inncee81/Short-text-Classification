random question didn't post the first time i asked so if it posts twice i'm sorry i was just reading the answers to one of the questions below me and i read numerous people answering your rack to the question complete with other various sexual references it got me thinking about a million different things for one do guys actually say things like this in real life or do they only say it when they're hiding behind a computer screen especially when they don't even have pictures of themselves posted up do guys attempt to compliment girls like this i can't picture it working also would you ever actually meet someone in person that you started talking to on yahoo answers or even just online in general seems weird to me then again i didnt think people actually used dating websites either but apparently a lot of people do curious to see your thoughts great question i believe the comment was posted about me in an answer and it made me think about the exact same thing comments as such don't warrant a response so i never give it any attention when it goes on in this forum nobody can objectify you unless you feel objectified and i don't so i get my entertainment out of it and keep it moving people become courageous when they can hide behind a computer so no these comments are not as common in a face to face interaction where they usually put their best foot forward to impress you The Apprentice 2 Social rule Plame affair Theory of conduct Milton H.
