describe the woman who pops into your head when someone says unwed single mother how many kids would you assume she has what does she look like did she go to school does she work is she a contributing member of society i totally agree that is doesnt have anything to do with being a contributing member or society however stigmas are places on certain character types such as this and i was just curious as to know what those stigmas may be might i add i completely agree with your perspective as an unwed pregnant single mother when i hear that phrase i do not get a physical picture of anyone in particular in my head however i do get an emotional and psychological picture i see someone who has their work cut out for them someone who will be swimming upstream fighting for stability and having to work harder than most just to make ends meet i see someone who will struggle with many things including being stereotyped and someone who will likely not find time to pursue her own dreams until well into mid life or later i get a sense of sadness and empathy and anger toward a system that allows men to so easily forgo their responsibility toward their own offspring your question sounds so prejudicial to me i hope i'm wrong i'm sorry to say it sounds like you are asking for a stereotyped answer the truth is many single unwed mothers don't fit the stereotype they work hard harder than most they love their children their kids being their whole purpose for living they aren't always drop outs and many even go back to school to get a higher college education many work and are contributing members of society it's true that many may find themselves starting out on welfare because they have no other means to support their family at first but most do not continue on welfare for any longer than it takes to become stable and working stereotypes hurt people they hurt society they affect the help that people get when they need it how many times have we heard about social programs medical programs and financial aid programs being cut back just because some rich politicians decided that those who need these programs don't really need them or are abusing them those who do abuse these systems are not the majority yet the stereotypes insure that all will be adversely affected and the children will then suffer the most Divorce Infantilism Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule Hearing impairment Domestic violence Adoption Love Gender role Autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Autism rights movement Empathy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meaning of life Transsexuality Childfree Unemployment Religious Society of Friends Friends Extreme Programming Boston Public Goodness and value theory Social psychology Education in the People's Republic of China Pitaten Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alcoholism Abortion debate Drug abuse Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis Evil Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rape Human sexual behavior Plame affair Asperger syndrome Homophobia Schizophrenia Nicomachean Ethics Themes in Blade Runner Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Objectivist philosophy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Zoophilia Social Security (United States) Jon Secada Good Times Capitalism Altruism Clinical depression Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Avenue Q Male prostitute The Marshall Mathers LP EastEnders Economic inequality Laura Schlessinger Borderline personality disorder Bisexuality Biology and sexual orientation One Tree Hill (TV series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Teenage pregnancy Confessor (Sword of Truth) Baldness Traumatic brain injury Joke The Death Gate Cycle Epistemology Sexual abstinence Children of God Rick Santorum Kodocha Stuttering Democracy A Course In Miracles Arguments for and against drug prohibition Life insurance 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Enneagram Economics Charles Darwin's illness Traumatic incident reduction Social welfare Psychology Anarchism and society Antisocial personality disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Empire Burlesque
