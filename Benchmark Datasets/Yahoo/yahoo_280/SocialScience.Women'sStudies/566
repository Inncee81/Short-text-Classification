in what ways are women more stronger than men i have heard of some comments from friends that girls are stronger than boys can t figure out in what ways surely there must be a very wide range of studies for that men are more stronger than women physically but not necessarily mentally women tend to be more emotionally stable and secure in that way as for career wise this is very complicated because it depends on the individual possibly men are more career minded than women but it s an ongoing observation when you talk about males and females genders just let me clarify one thing and make it clear with what you actually mean the way you act according to your gender is infact a direct result of the variable levels of sex hormones in your body for a normal male there would be high levels of testesterone ensuring he maintains his masculinity because the gender code is xy for all males there is an amount of oestrogen present also for a normal female the gender code being xx means that there is a high level of oestrogen and no testesterone these hormones influence the way we all act and in this very world which has so many complicated different issues which have to be assessed inorder to fully determine who s stronger between the two genders you cannot expect to find an accurate result in the end the point is it has to be assessed on an individual case study preferably between a couple living together sometimes women can be weaker than men in the emotional side but most of the time it is the opposite the same applies for career men are mostly business minded women are less in a minority of cases it is just the opposite my point made here both men and women have equal abilities even if they do not necessarily have to be the same in each case so physically stronger are men and emotionally stronger are women just to keep matters as simple as possible Gender role Sexual orientation Transsexuality Biology and sexual orientation Sexual differentiation Homosexuality and transgender Gender-neutral language Gender identity Androgen insensitivity syndrome History of intersex surgery Pedophilia Sex Transgender Turner syndrome Economic inequality Infantilism Gender Intelligence quotient Homosexuality Sexual attraction Puberty Intersexuality Gender identity disorder Sex assignment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) ELO rating system Sex and intelligence Prostate cancer Consensus decision-making Heteronormativity Autism Effeminacy Domestic violence Human Divorce Twin Breastfeeding Age of consent Homophobia Addiction Reparative therapy Abortion debate CPU cache Ethics Hormone replacement therapy Orgasm Intersex surgery Legal aspects of transsexualism Microeconomics Abortion Asperger syndrome Child sexual abuse Second language acquisition Social psychology Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scientology beliefs and practices Child sexuality Asian fetish Causality Leadership Bisexuality Gay Determinism Bulgarian language Affirmative action Social rule Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Man God and gender Nutrition Capitalism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Cognitive science Physical attractiveness John Money Mathematics Zoophilia Species English grammar Labour economics Fathers' rights Carl Jung Aikido Psychology Urinary incontinence Homosexuality and Christianity Salic law Obsessive-compulsive disorder Normal distribution Philosophy of science Rape Quantum mechanics
