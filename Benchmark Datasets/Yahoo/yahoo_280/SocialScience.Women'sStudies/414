why do women continue to act like they're the ones that have to look perfect to be considered attractive there is absolutely no doubt that women have it easy compared to men all kind of women of all ages are considered attractive by men the percentages of women most men find attractive are really high compared to the percentages of men women find attractive if you don't believe me look my questions about this and who do you think should be more worried about aging women in their s and s are considered very attractive even by guys in their teens and s you're always hearing about guys fantasizing about their teachers and theirs friends' moms girls in their teens and early s never look at guys over and women in general find more guys under sexy than guys over women only think they have to look like supermodels to be attractive the truth is guys have different preferences and even the average and below average girls are considered hot by a lot of guys a woman's idea of an unconventionally attractive guy she finds hot is a cute guy rather than a handsome guy or a guy with cool hair rather than a guy with a sexy body most guys are not considered attractive by any women while most women are considered attractive by guys correction d d when we men get older we don't start looking at younger girls i'm and i'm already almost as interested in older women late s and s than girls my age most men find women in their s much sexier than teen girls it is you women who only want attention from guys in their teens and early s and find most guys over to be ugly and yes despite the fact the you grow much faster then men there are plenty of guys in their teeens and s who find women over really sexy yet there is almost no girls in their teens and s who find guys over sexy it's becoming a media phenomena that is spiraling out of control imo the advertisements products tv internet mag's and culture have us women chasing our tails on being en vogue not only does it have us chasing our tails but we're so preoccupied by it that we forget to look at men so men then become complacent with their appearance because they don't get told that's not working for you by anyone so they are fashion disasters this works for the young men but becomes problematic and disasterious for the older man who's lost track of time even the man who's married and settled finds himself over weight out of fashion and socially unacceptable some wives will make efforts to fix him while other wives find it comforting to secure their men with this bad fashion to divert adultry with this later strategy the woman's often letting her spouses health go for security in turn this can also backfire by allowing her to get sloppy too then this spirals into two people with little or no fashion sense trying to get out of their rut Social rule Sexual attraction Friends Sexual orientation Physical attractiveness Humphrey Bogart Human height Transsexuality Marilyn Monroe Teen Girl Squad Undergarment Avenue Q Pedophilia Gender role Stewie Griffin Madonna (entertainer) Internet phenomenon Age disparity in sexual relationships Marriage Adolescence Milton H.
