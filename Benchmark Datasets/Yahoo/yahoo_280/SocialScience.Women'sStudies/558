why are men so intimidated by feminist i thought it was strange there were posts in the women gender section with males posting homosexually satiated references towards women or hate posts call me crazy but i thought this would be a positive forum for women exchanging women gender issues when i realized it was the word feminism that was scaring them into feeling like they need to attack i actually forgot this word and its context even existed but do consider myself just a normal strong willed woman like thousands of other heterosexual women in this world that also discern society steadily growing more into a womans world with the role reversals and more women being head of their households and holding more and more powers of position in society its buts its funny to watch some of these guys wishing it was still 's and whine and cry about it definitely other peoples garbage and not mine but its still fun to watch the fear lol well the truth obviosly hurts because all the answers im getting are from men who sound hurt and insulted theres no intelligent arguements well a couple but not many i'll admit i have lost my interests up to probably the th comment but i will say that man in search of answers if i ever was to have children or a male child i would raise him like my mother did my brother and thats to be a confident male self assured and not easily intimadated by what peole do and say thats a self esteem problem and nothing more my male child better not be soooo emotional and worried enough to log into a womens gender issue forum and looking for issues to waste time attacking women on if you ask me we're all feminine in this section whoever posts here lol really in order for you to be annoyed you have to feel some form of intimidation or else you wouldnt feel the need to fight back people fight out of fear theres no other origination that stems from that then fear if it wasnt that big of an issue to you for you to feel intimidated you wouldn't even have a thought on it or be annoyed people dont waste time on the petty things in life they put their energies on big ones in otherwords the state of women today and where we're going is totally intimidating the weaker species amoung us the normal strong men dont even think about feminists they're too busy handling their business and co collaberating with women to make things work out just right like bill clinton and hundreds of other polticians and males that know its about homogeneity and confomance and not about whining and complaining and you're right dan a the one thing that women couldn't possibly do better than men is engulf the world in war and violence we need a craphole clean up quick with brains running things instead of nothing but ego even though it would take a total or majority xx chromosome takeover in the whitehouse for that to happen so dont anybody hold their breath on that one and troll feminists and lifes feeble worried men both share the same charactertistic fear thats why they're made for each other and spend so much time time fighting some men are intimidated by my looks and actions but that is the key word some Gender role Biology and sexual orientation Domestic violence Homophobia Gender-neutral language Feminism Social rule Shaggy dog story Transsexuality Homosexuality and transgender Fathers' rights W.I.T.C.H.
