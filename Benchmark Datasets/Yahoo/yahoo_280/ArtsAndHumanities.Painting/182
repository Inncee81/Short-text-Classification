any ideas of what kind of paint and background to start painting on for beginners i use to paint on wood blocks for the fun of it about or yrs ago it was a big passion and release for me but since getting married and having a kid have not had the time i want to get back into it and don't know where to start i was thinking of trying some watercolors but is that more for an advanced painter please any tips would be great thanks i just took a begining abstract painting class and used acrylic paint on bristol board it was much easier than water color in my opinion but the two have very different feels acrylic is bold and steady while water color soft and free its all a matter of preference also bristol and acrylics are fairly cheep acrylics are about a jar brisol about for or so sheets which are big and you can cut them go to an art store and ask around ussually they're more than happy to help my favorites are local art supply stores they're always so nice utrecht and michaels are chain stores which are ussually well stocked and abundant hope this helps happy painting Paint Plastic Watercolor painting Acrylic paint Manicure Wood Anchor Traditional animation Painting Michel Henry Polymethyl methacrylate Wassily Kandinsky Mattress Pastel Japanese painting Lilo & Stitch Hamster Bong Wood carving Textile manufacturing Paper marbling Epoxy Abstraction Dinghy Stanton Macdonald-Wright 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Emancipation of Mimi Artemisia Gentileschi Diego Vel__zquez E.
