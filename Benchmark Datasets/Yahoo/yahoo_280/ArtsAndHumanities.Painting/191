what is the going rate for decorative sign painting i recently painted a large outdoor sign for a family friend's business and am wondering what the going rate to charge is the sign is about feet by feet pretty detailed and the job took about hours to complete do i charge hourly or by the job either way how much for a family friend thanks it's so much better to work these things out before you agree to do the work because there are so many factors that determine the price you'll ask and also because as you may very well learn before this is over many people do not think artists have the right to ask for money they think the words thank you are sufficient payment just look at the questions that come in here every day draw me this paint me that i need a logo i need a really good portrait of myself i need someone to change this in photoshop for my myspace page i need a custom tattoo design whaddya mean i should pay omg since when is art about profit you people are so greedy i hope this isn't going to ruin your friendship it has the potential if you can't come to terms ansyway assuming you are delighted with the end result and your friend is delighted with the end result here is what i would do take a photo of the sign and then go to a couple of printers signmakers in your area ask what it would cost roughly if you wanted to have a sign like that made that will give you an idea of the competitor's pricing take that figure and deduct a significant amount for your friendship how much is up to you ask for the amount left over be sure and give them an invoice it's a business expense and deductible Insurance Microeconomics Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Wal-Mart Gross domestic product Tax Minimum wage Surplus value Supply and demand Inflation Xerox Flat tax Price discrimination Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Credit card Taxation in the United States Labour economics Intellectual property Public good Hyperinflation Monopoly Strategic management FairTax Law of value 401(k) Islamic banking Electronic commerce Social Security (United States) Tariff Sears Holdings Corporation Keynesian economics Micropayment Anarchism and capitalism The Apprentice 2 Corporate finance Poker jargon Externality Value added tax Economic inequality Capital accumulation Mutual fund Kyoto Protocol Annuity Economic rent Bond Internet fraud Progressive tax Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) Mail fraud Profit PE ratio Apple Computer Arbitrage American individualist anarchism Welfare economics Citigroup Rational pricing Monetary policy Salary London Underground Leonardo da Vinci Illegal drug trade Art Income Vincent van Gogh Salvador Dal__ Prices of production DisneySpeak Trademark Ra (board game) Student loan Bank Mortgage Transformation problem Privatization Physical attractiveness Gold standard Pricing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Socrates Predatory lending Technocratic movement Otakon EFTPOS Infantilism United States Postal Service Circuit design Henry H.
