i have a hive of honey bees under my roof i know that killing honey bees is illegal under state law but i mean this is the third time they've chosen my house to build their home in and its really getting annoying i've paid hundreds the past few times to get an exterminator and i really cant afford it anymore how can i get rid of these bees they've been there slightly less than a month now whatever you do don't spray the hive with anything listen to the first two and get hold of your local bee keeper most not all bee keepers will remove a hive for no charge my local bee keeper does and he said that it is a win win because he gets a new hive and the problem is resolved besides it's not that it's illegal to kill honey bees it's that they are disappearing at alarming rates and they are our primary pollinators harming them in any way is not good where anyone or thing is concerned good luck Diseases of the honeybee Africanized bee Beekeeping Beehive (beekeeping) Honeybee Pollinator decline Bee Langstroth hive Honey Pollination Top-bar hive Apple Worker bee Brood (honeybee) Pollination management Pesticide toxicity to bees Gaucho (insecticide) Queen bee Futurama (TV series - season 5) Western honeybee Carpenter bee Bee learning and communication Conker's Bad Fur Day Ecology Pollinator Pesticide misuse Bumblebee Supercedure Billboard Hot 100 Buckfast bee Pheromone (honey bee) Aes Sedai Beekeeping leading practices The Fairly OddParents Timon and Pumbaa Agriculture Atlanta Braves Piccolo Junior Saga Xenomorph Drone (bee) Grigori Rasputin Illegal drug trade Abortion debate Natural Selection (computer game) Lord Chancellor Piping queen Varroa destructor Beeswax Ultima Online Livestock Aliens vs. Predator 2 Bee Gees Cheating in Counter-Strike Zerg Animal communication Urinary incontinence Animal Crossing Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) John Sheppard (Stargate) Ragwort Dodge Charger Kosher foods Shaggy dog story Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Satchel Paige Alberta Automatic number plate recognition Polyamory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Organic farming Rich Mullins FairTax Arguments for and against drug prohibition Phoebe Halliwell Domestic violence Wraith (Stargate) Fruit tree pollination Menstrual cup Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Neopets 2003 California recall Honeyguide Murder Betting (poker) Orion (mythology) Squash (fruit) Fire fighting Pitaten Wild Honey Rapeseed Democratic Party (United States) Tom Petty W.I.T.C.H.
