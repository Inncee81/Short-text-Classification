how much should i sell all this for on craigslist photo below note the dresser has a broken bottom right drawer i'll include the tv as a bonus http s photobucket com albums bb pris sweet action view current room jpg http s photobucket com albums bb pris sweet action view current dresser jpg i'm not expecting to get a lot for this but a general idea would be great serious answer only please because these pieces are 'painted' and the paint is 'mottled' you will not get as much for them and with the 'broken drawer' you will get even less for the 'whole set' i'd say you could try a price of for everything and if you want to 'get rid' of the tv you should sell it 'separately' a tv as a 'bonus' may seem 'good' but what if it doesn't 'work' as well as a new one or the person already had good tvs of better quality they'd basically be 'asked to haul away your trash' to get your 'old painted' furniture put pictures on craig's list without that tv and if your stuff doesn't sell in two weeks add 'or best offer' and put it online for another two weeks Wheel of Fortune Leica Animal Crossing Upholstery Theory of conduct Microeconomics Xbox 360 Quizbowl Extreme Programming Ra (board game) Economics Great Teacher Onizuka Supply and demand Television We Belong Together PlayStation 2 Avril Lavigne Red Hot Chili Peppers Homestar Runner Representational State Transfer PlayStation Portable The Chemical Brothers The Emancipation of Mimi Gross domestic product HTTP cookie De Lorean DMC-12 Oasis (band) Neopets Big Brother UK series 6 C__line Dion Atari 8-bit family Mid-levels Hey Jude Tori Amos Roxette The Star Wars Holiday Special Furniture $ale of the Century Real Love (song) Windows Vista ITV Shaggy dog story Sampling (music) JPEG JavaServer Pages Wireless Application Protocol Make money fast Hamster Oxford English Dictionary Francis Bacon (painter) Digital photography Password AmigaOS Gramophone record Little Britain Internet fraud Xbox Halliburton SpongeBob SquarePants Hidden track Craigslist Japanese tea ceremony Blood on the Tracks Bread Textile manufacturing Cable television Gmail Google The Price Is Right MSN Messenger Anchor Plasma display Tea Political economy Electronic commerce Weezer Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Classified information Blonde on Blonde Garth Brooks Drill bit Life insurance International Phonetic Alphabet Themes in Blade Runner Integrated Services Digital Network RuneScape cheats Resident Evil (video game) Billboard Hot 100 The Ashlee Simpson Show Common Unix Printing System ITunes Music Store Most Wanted (Hilary Duff album) Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Google Maps George Harrison Screenplay Blackjack Web traffic Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
