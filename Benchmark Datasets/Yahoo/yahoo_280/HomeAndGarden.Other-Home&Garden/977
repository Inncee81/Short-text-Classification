why oh why do private tennants treat our houses which such disrespect because they have no rights beyond their lousy months tennancy the law is a chocolate starfish for them you can not expect someone to care for a house they have months security in after years in my rented house i have come to the conclusion i will end up being remembered as one of those dreaded tennants he can keep the lino we have put into the bathroom and kitchen at our own expense the roof leaks but i really don't need another dodgy builder like the one that supposedly fixed the electric in my daughter's room i never challenged him on that one it wasn't worth the aggro at the time one of the sockets works now anyway if we had a decent tennancy we could put our own laminate in and put some fresh paint on the walls but a tennancy that gives us months you got to be joking so the next time you ask yourself the question as to why private tennants seemingly don't care for the places they live in would you care if you had months security oh do comment i feel so much better now that is of my chest crazymental you're joking aren't you only ever had one decent landlord in years of living in the uk i'm repatriating in january the law in my home country allows for a minimuum contract of years year contracts are available too if both parties deide they get on enough the social housing waiting lists are long in my country but it's peanuts compared to the chance i have of getting subsidized rent in the uk sue j very much in england i have a verbal agrreement i don't do agencies they charge me for the privelege of keeping them in a job get real im very confused do you own the house they are living in or do you rent somehere im lost well if you dont like the standards of living in this country then go back to your own for god sake im sick of people moaning about the state on the uks housing if you dont like it uou know what you can do Health insurance Social rule Monopoly (game) Leasehold estate Plame affair Babylonian law Estoppel The Young Ones (TV series) Wal-Mart Kitchen Chatsworth House Property (ownership right) Marriage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ocean's Twelve Microeconomics Insurance Mortgage Saturday Night Live Theory of conduct Fecal incontinence American individualist anarchism Poker jargon Publicly funded medicine Assignment (law) Public good British National Party Country house AMD Euphemism Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Oasis (band) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gross domestic product Trade union Time Out of Mind House Bruce Johnson Avenue Q Contract National Kidney Foundation Singapore Arguments for and against drug prohibition Charles Peace Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Joke Little Britain Knots Landing Health care in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Rental agreement Public-key cryptography Alois Hitler Jennifer Lopez Construction Upholstery Paul Is Dead Housing cooperative Unemployment National Electrical Code (US) Karl Rove Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ron and Fez Capital punishment Slashdot subculture Bill Maher Smoking ban Warrior (World of Warcraft) Paul Martin Harlem Public policy Identity theft Who Shot Mr. Burns?
