for a wats load what is the solar equip do i need for my home we have some questions and need your advice the following loads are supposed to be installed in house aircondition btu unit w water pump unit w fan unit w lighting led light unit w tv unit w dvd player unit w washing machine unit w refrigerater unit w total w ok are you going off grid or grid tie with battery backup or are you just going grid tie only if you are going off grid you just told us what size of an inverter you are needing but that is is you would need a watt inverter so how long are this items going to be running or the total power usage for one day that will give you the information needed to size the battery bank get the total for hours and divide it by the battery voltage and it will give you the amp hours you require then double it because you don't want to run your batteries below discharge a grid tie only system you might only need an watt inverter because it is feeding power back into the grid any time the sun is up but you are not running all that stuff all the time when it goes over what the inverter can handle it will get the extra power from the grid best if you just read the links on this how to page it will give you a very good ideal of what it is all about and how to go about picking your your system http www oynot com solar info html Solar power Solar cell Solar panel Battery (electricity) Electrical generator Thermal power station Hybrid vehicle Renewable energy Electric power transmission Transformer Air conditioning Wind turbine Hydrogen economy Three-phase electric power Autonomous building 2003 North America blackout Fossil fuel power plant Wind power Energy development Incandescent light bulb Grid energy storage Fuel cell Toyota Prius Baseball Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Apollo Guidance Computer Circuit design Battery electric vehicle Energy storage Electric motor Electricity meter Horsepower Laptop Vacuum tube Bicycle lighting HyperText Transfer Protocol Inverter (electrical) Alternating current World Wide Web Split phase Movie projector Power station Geomagnetic storm CPU cache Spacecraft propulsion Solar power satellite Domain Name System Overhead lines Hybrid Synergy Drive Redundant array of independent disks Power (physics) Capacitor Mouse (computing) Oscilloscope Federal Standard 1037C USB flash drive Power supply Floppy disk 1957 World Series XML Loudspeaker Welding power supply Electrodeless lamp Apollo Command/Service Module Cruising (maritime) Future energy development Switched-mode power supply Operational amplifier Jet engine Tesla coil Web server Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Electrical wiring Digital circuit Internal ballistics X10 (industry standard) Power outage DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Carburetor Guitar Light-emitting diode Roman numerals Character encodings in HTML Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Daylight saving time Sewage treatment Mattress Ocean thermal energy conversion Atari 8-bit family Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Transistor
