how is a recycled home better than building a brand new one there's a company in the city i live in that takes pre existing homes and move them onto empty lots these homes would otherwise be destroyed where they would take at least years recycling into our environment in a negative way polluting the atmosphere and everything else the problem i'm having is that i need to think of why a recycled home is better than building one from scratch or moving into one through real estate without sounding like i'm miss america or something some of the older building materials and craftsmanship are superior to today's each individual house differs perhaps you might find the architecture or the footprint layout of the house appealing also i would investigate the cost a recycled home might be significantly cheaper than new Waste management Plastic Recycling Gramophone record Hydrogen economy Suburb Microeconomics Computer Alcohol fuel Incineration Nuclear power Architecture Capitalism Energy development Ship-Submarine recycling program Straw-bale construction Future energy development Pacific, Missouri Sewage treatment Haloalkane Light pollution Hydrogen vehicle Personal rapid transit Externality Cosmic dust Urban planning Welding Timber framing Product Lifecycle Management Laserdisc City Solar power Pollution McMansion Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Nuclear power phase-out E-waste Space habitat Orillia, Ontario SimCity 4 Organic farming Real estate economics Stars!
