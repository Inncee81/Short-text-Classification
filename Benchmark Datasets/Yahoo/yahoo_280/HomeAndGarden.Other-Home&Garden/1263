flea problem please help about a week ago i woke my month old son to find that he was covered in bites i later found out that these are flea bites my flat is now crawling with fleas to say its disgusting is an understatment i dont own any pets and i have worked out that the fleas are coming from the hallway in my block of flats this is all carpeted so im told its a haven for fleas basically my question is do you think i have any right asking my landlord to pay for the contractors to de flea my home in the last week i have spent a fortune of flea products nothing seems to be working i dont feel that i should be paying to sort out this problem as its down to my neighbours pets anyone agree or am i way out of line your landlord should definitely pay for your flea problem if it is coming from your apartment hallway then that is pretty disgusting and there will never be anything you can do to fix it i had a flea problem and you have to basically disinfect and de flea everything and anything that could have been exposed to fleas it only takes fleas to reproduce literally thousands you have to get rid of the adult fleas and the larvae eggs its a week process a pain in the ass and very expensive you should not have to foot the bill also please note that even though you get rid of the fleas in your apartment you'll likely still continue to get fleas unless your landlord rips out the carpet and or disinfects the hallway i'm telling you there is nothing worse than fleas and you've got a pricey road ahead of you if you don't get your landlord to take responsibility for poorly managing that aspect of his property when i had fleas i took care of it myself and then i found out my apartment complex management sent pest control for free to clean up the mess if it gets in one person's apartment it will likely get in many many other people's apartments so it is in their best interest to squash the problem as soon as possible in my case my dog brought it in in your case the problem didnt originate in your flat you are an innocent bystander and your son is at risk of more and more flea bites yuck good luck Capitol Records Ubykh language Atomic Kitten Insider trading Recreational vehicle The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear Hussar Barley Umm Khultum bint Ali Steak n Shake USS William B.
