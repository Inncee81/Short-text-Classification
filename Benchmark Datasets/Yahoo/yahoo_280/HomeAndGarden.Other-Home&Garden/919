just curious is it possible to live like this how do you live in poverty a good way without being too much of a leech there are people that dont have jobs never use power have very little money or none at all barely have anything and are quite happy with it often thei'll have a bed a couch and a woodstove that they found in the dumpster and cleaned it up to rid of all bad germs etc these people also get food from the food banks or they grow their own food to not become a full blown leech they keep the value of everything very minimal and they dont consume as much is it possible to live like this forever yes it is my granny lived with almost nothing and even when she did have something she gave it to someone else who she thought needed it more but then again she was born in and was an irish immigrant and lived through the depression had bro and sis and picked cotton for some years she died in a happy happy woman with nothing monetary in her possession except her house she grew her garden rank goat milk and didn't believe in central a c and heating was done by an old wood cook stove yea its crazy to think that someone could be so happy to live that way but it happens if the whole world lived like that it wouldn't be going to hell Stove Kitchen Inflation Portable stove Ayyavazhi mythology Married... with Children RuneScape quests Patrick Star Knots Landing Milk Money Economy of the United States Gold standard The Catcher in the Rye EastEnders Great Depression Coffee Economy of Pakistan Pitaten Commodity markets Babe Ruth Deflation (economics) Economy of Africa Phoebe Buffay's songs Dead Like Me Satan 613 mitzvot Cookware and bakeware Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 1957 World Series One Tree Hill (TV series) Food Dairy Tears for Fears The Amber Spyglass W.I.T.C.H.
