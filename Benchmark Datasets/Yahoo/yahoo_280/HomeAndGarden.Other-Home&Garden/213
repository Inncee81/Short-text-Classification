what kind of spider is this i live in western canada and on our back deck today we found a big spider it was similar to the ones we referred to as crab spiders that we had every year but this one was brown with light brown spots and it left brown splotches spider poop under it's web i looked it up and couldn't kind much and discovered that crab spiders actually don't spin webs so what kind was this it was brown with splotches of light brown on it and it had a huge sac on it's back connected to its body it spun a big web and was up near the roof on our house close to the door so someone is going to kill it so it doesn't get in our house or something any ideas if the web has a kind of zigzag stitch then it is a common brown orb weaver which is harmless and beneficial for the garden orb weavers are garden spiders and have no interest in moving into your home so there is no reason to kill it they are not poisonous and their bite is not that bad besides they'd rather run like hell then be anywhere near a human just get a stick and remove the web and it will likely relocate to a more secluded location does this look like your guy http images search yahoo com search images view back http a f fimages search yahoo com fsearch fimages fp dorb bweavers ei dutf js d ni d fr dyfp t b d w h imgurl static flickr com f f e f d m jpg rurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fjohncarney f f size kb name e f d jpg p orb weavers type jpeg no tt oid ee a cf b ef fusr johncarney tit taste of things to come hurl http a f fwww flickr com fphotos fjohncarney f ei utf src p Spider Combine (Half-Life 2) London JPEG St Andrew's Cross spider Flickr Brown recluse spider HyperText Transfer Protocol Textile manufacturing Shen Gong Wu Uniform Resource Locator Hobo spider Common Unix Printing System Widow spider Blood (computer game) Snooker Tarantula Doom enemies Cross site scripting Butterfly Website Search engine optimization Web traffic Representational State Transfer Professional wrestling throws HTTP cookie World Wide Web Unreal Naruto jutsu Time travel Web crawler Digital photography Minor Harry Potter Beasts Spider-Man PlayStation Portable Piccolo Junior Saga Web server Computer virus Theory of conduct Web browser RuneScape quests HTML element Recluse spider Toilet humour Araneomorphae Fishing Mario series enemies Incarnations of Immortality The Legend of Zelda series enemies Textile manufacturing terminology Resident Evil (video game) World Series Bridge Bon Jovi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Google Maps Australian venomous funnel-web spider Bob and George Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Venom (comics) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Creatures in Bionicle Static (superhero) Meat Loaf Pitaten Wiki EastEnders Aerial (dance move) Spot the Dog Humphrey Bogart Baltimore Orioles Eye Linyphiidae Software agent Skateboarding trick Sega Dreamcast Common house spider StarCraft Episode VI The Haunted Mansion (film) GunBound Professional wrestling holds Mushroom hunting Web page Freenet Futurama (TV series - season 4) HyperCard Futurama Kyle Broflovski Mid-levels Ecco the Dolphin Patent Color
