mattress topper feather bed topper under over sheets how do they stay on i feel so dumb asking this i'm looking at mattress toppers bed toppers not the foam ones but the feather ones i'm planning on buying one but are they suppose to lay ontop of your fitted sheet do i put them under the fitted sheet how do they stay in place if you lay directly on them with no sheet over the topper do you wash them or dry clean them often they look fluffy and comfy but i'm obviously not grasping the concept my feather bed is under the fitted sheet and i use an extra deep mattress cover on top of that to keep it in place they also sell garters that you can use to attach the mattress cover to the corners to prevent shifting i use a duvet cover on my feather topper which keeps it cleaner and prevents allergens i dry clean mine about twice a year because it really doesn't get body oils dirt etc on it because it is protected i do fluff it up occasionally in the dryer on high heat Mattress Bed (furniture) Upholstery Bedbug Textile manufacturing Feather Christmas tree Changeroom Sudden infant death syndrome Waterbed Massage Clothing Plastic Vacuum mattress Pillow Professional wrestling holds Drill bit Casting Dairy Coir Washing machine Sento Wound Cookware and bakeware Desert Glossary of American football Hemp First aid Flax Urticaria Diving suit M16 (rifle) Undergarment Soap Casualty lifting Hat Tire Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Equine conformation Fire extinguisher Boat building Kimberly-Clark Corporation Allergy Basement Fan (implement) Vacuum cleaner Berth Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Acne The Isley Brothers Wok Daylight saving time Fecal incontinence Nuclear power Carburetor Dishwasher Sailing Coal Japanese toilet Dry cleaning Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Naval mine Pickup truck Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Dialysis Kirby Corporation Capercaillie Futon Blood Simple Glossary of firefighting equipment The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Sesshomaru Car washing techniques Wound healing phases Natural gas Killing Joke Social rule View camera Eczema Andes Peat Hard disk Haloalkane Knife Laws of cricket Vermicompost Psoriasis Tofu Coffin Space Shuttle external tank Order of the Garter Leather Lake House dust mite Blankets (graphic novel) Welding International response to Hurricane Katrina
