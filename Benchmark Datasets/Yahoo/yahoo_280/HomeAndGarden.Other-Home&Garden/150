question for farmers we have a farmers field in our back yard with alfalfa growing the farmer cut it down and the very next day or the day after came with his tractor and a small machine hooked up to it the machine picked up the cut alfalfa and spit it behind it into a big cart with a top on it i'm just wondering what he's doing because he's cut the alfalfa three times this year and not once did he bail any of it for hay also i thought usually they have to let it sit for at least a few days then flip it over to totally dry it out what do you think i don't know for sure but he is probably sending his alfalfa to a processing facility to make feed or feed ingredient such as rabbit pellets or alfalfa meal for use as a feed ingredient or soil amendment other possibilities include mulch form garden or orchard composting high in nitrogen or other pharmaceutical uses Alfalfa Hay Organic farming Agriculture Dairy Agricultural machinery Vermicompost Chicken Farmer Fertilizer Peanut Food Tobacco Weed control Mulch Sugar beet Sorghum Ice cream Organic gardening Comfrey Organic horticulture Clover Tractor Permaculture Composting toilet Organic certification Hemp Domestic rabbit Coffee Sewage treatment Rapeseed Irrigation Earthworm Alcohol fuel Dairy farming Guinea pig Battles of Lexington and Concord Bonsai Food and Drug Administration Soil life Waste management Maize The Time Machine Flax Genetically modified food Cigarette Lawn mower Silage Cotton Suplex Textile manufacturing Bulldozer Fruit tree propagation Fabaceae Tofu Sugarcane Agriculture in the United States Nuclear fuel cycle Sharecropping Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Organic food Livestock Aerial (dance move) Prosopis cineraria Soil Deforestation Cereal Carbon dioxide Tea Nitrogen Soybean Roundup Casting Houseplant Sushi Soil pH Wheat Cuisine of Brazil Local food Jute Combine harvester Bread Banana New York Jets Ham Ammonia Shifting cultivation Professional wrestling throws New Morning Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Beer Cuisine of Laos Roman eating and drinking Pulse (legume) Biodynamic agriculture Christmas tree Desert Sprouting
