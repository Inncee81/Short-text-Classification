planting a tree a few questions i know the basics about planting a tree but i do have a few questions the tree is a red maple in a gallon pot and it's about feet tall how long can i keep it in the pot before i plant it do i need to do any pruning how far from a driveway should i plant it so that it will get maximum water for the roots but not damage the cement driveway any other hints or suggestions are welcomed i'm in zone thank you the tree can remain in the pot for a good while if it was approximately feet when you purchased it otherwise if it has grown considerably since you've had it you should consider transplanting it you're supposed to prune bushes after transplanting but not trees i would plant the tree a significant distance from the driveway since the roots will one day become very large and may just push up the driveway however it there is very little other foliage or trees in the area the tree shouldn't have to compete for water soil and nutrients having said that i would plant the tree at least feet from the cement at this time of the year i would wait until autumn before i ransplant the reason is because sap in trees will eventually draw down into the root system in the fall this will result in less root shock for the tree after transplanting the tree you should water it regularly perhaps even watering the tree twice per day for the first week then daily for another two weeks this will allow the tiny root hairs to establish themselves and create a strong watering sytem for years to come it would also be beneficial to the tree if you were to buy some of those miracle grow spikes and hammer one into the ground just outside the perimeter of the root system of the tree you can estimate this by figuring the height of the tree aprx feet then figure about a foot ring around the base of the tree this is what the root system should initially aspire to reach then it will root out in several directions good luck as your tree grows to produce a beautiful yard speciman Bamboo Bonsai Fruit tree propagation Pruning fruit trees Cannabis cultivation Garden Strawberry Hydroponics Hurricane Rita Tree Weed control Sequoia 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Root Wood Coffee Eucalyptus Auxin Geothermal areas of Yellowstone European Beech 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Vegetation Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Flowering plant Liriodendron Olive Coast Douglas-fir Pachypodium Carbon dioxide sink Desert Opportunity rover Soil pH Old growth forest Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Grafting Campfire Venus Flytrap Glossary of wildland fire terms Plant Portland cement GunBound Hippeastrum Logging Apple Peanut Tamarix Maple Poker jargon Apical dominance Carnivorous plant Acorn RuneScape skills Irrigation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Deforestation Yosemite National Park Aerial root Tobacco Soil life Toxicodendron Dundas Square Professional wrestling throws Chernobyl accident Computer chess Coconut Solar system Normal distribution Atlanta metropolitan area Florida Keys Black pepper Hydrangea Rainforest Apricot Tag Tsunami Professional wrestling holds Hemp Tide Christmas tree Fire fighting Domain Name System Peach Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Caliche Dog agility Teapot Seismic retrofit Hurricane Frances Orchidaceae Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wisteria Prospect Park (Brooklyn) Pine Pinophyta
