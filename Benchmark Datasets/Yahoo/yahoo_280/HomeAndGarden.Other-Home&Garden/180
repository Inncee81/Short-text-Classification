refuse collection is there a way to get rid of polystyrene i've bought a few items over the last couple of weeks that as usual come packaged in polystyrene beads boards and those potato chip things there is only a collection once per fortnight days and only one bin trash can to you ppl in the usa so the only way to get around it is either to drive miles to the recycling center or dump as we called it in the old days or fly tip i'm not keen on the first option because it's a mile round trip every time and i'm not going to leave it on the side of the road either is there some way to melt it i don't mean burn it but surely there's some way to compact it down but before you say trash compactor the cheapest i've seen is nearly for something i would only need to use no more than once a month i understand you are not in the united states i know that polystyrene in the us is not manufactured with chlorofluorocarbons but i'm not sure about your location shredding burning or melting polystyrene that contains chlorofluorocarbons can release harmful toxins into your air a conservative answer can you store the packing materials until your rubbish pickup thank you for not considering leaving on the roadside some companies are beginning to use cornstarch packing materials these will melt when they come into contact with water good for them Polystyrene Recycling Plastic Dustbin Garbage truck Haloalkane Printed circuit board Gramophone record Floppy disk Waste Casting Dumpster diving Soldering Animal Crossing Boy Scouts of America Donovan PlayStation 2 STS-62 Teller-Ulam design Thermal power station Pebble bed reactor Air pollution Incineration German grammar Nuclear weapon design Solar power United Parcel Service USB flash drive Vermicompost Pickup truck Betting (poker) Backpacking (wilderness) United States Postal Service Bong Toyota Prius Potato chips Nuclear meltdown Dairy Cigarette Solar cell 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Ammunition Sewage treatment Powder metallurgy Plutonium Surface-mount technology Road Poker jargon Radio controlled airplane Wheel of Fortune DVD The Amazing Race Model aircraft Items in the Metroid series Nintendo Steel ZX Spectrum Glass Sega Saturn MAME Opportunity rover William A.
