does anyone how to clean a easy set pool i recently purchased an east set up pool the kind where you blow up the ring and then fill the rest up with water a foot pool in diameter and deep we have well water and it got nasty very fast i was wondering if anyone knew what chemicals i need to use to clean it and keep it that way and possibly a website where i could get it at a reasonable price my husband got a pool pump hose and fitted it on the intake valve opening make sure you hold it underwater to get all the air out before turning on the filter pump then he gets in the pool and vacuums the bottom of the pool it works great then you probably will have to wash or change your filter we have a pool test kit and check it every day for chlorine and ph we usually put cups of chlorine in every day if needed and when it's hot you need to put in algaecide or when you see what looks like dust on the bottom of the pool someone needs to check it everyday so if you go away you have to get a neighbour or friend to do it walmart carries pool supplies Bong Brewery Vacuum cleaner Glossary of firefighting equipment Siphon Carburetor Scuba set Thermal power station Swimming pool Diving regulator Solar power Diving Rebreather Fountain Two-stroke cycle Coffee Frogman Hydraulic machinery Use of poison gas in World War I Water supply Motor oil Sea-Monkey Water purification Diving cylinder Electrophysiology Glossary of firefighting terms Water Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Swimming Fossil fuel power plant Diesel engine Dairy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Glossary of wildland fire terms Novelty (locomotive) Dry cleaning Strap-on dildo Four-stroke cycle Tire Chlorine Fire hydrant E85 Dialysis Incandescent light bulb Pump Textile manufacturing Body piercing Internal ballistics Circulatory system Water polo Jet engine Dishwasher Turbocharger Marine aquarium Steam engine Autonomous building Nuclear fallout Dundas Square Diving suit Naval mine Space shuttle main engine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fume hood Bathing Acne Hard disk International response to Hurricane Katrina Borehole Haloalkane Drip irrigation Mattress Personal flotation device Ocean thermal energy conversion Snorkel Samovar Sento Poker jargon Fire fighting USS S-5 (SS-110) M16 (rifle) Irrigation Equine conformation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Aerial refueling Diver rescue Energy development Dredge Billiards Plastic Automatic transmission Cavitation Flush toilet Thermostat Menstrual cup Filling station String theory
