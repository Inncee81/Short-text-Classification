why is there an anode rod in water heaters a couple of days ago my dad removed the anode rod or stink rod as we call it because our water smelled so bad that we could'nt drink it w o feeling sick it smelled like rotten eggs and made the water taste like it too well we had only had the heater in for two months but when we pulled out the rod it was so black and gross looking it looked like it had been there for years my questions are why are the rods used what is it made out of my dad has been wondering about these very questions also does it hurt to remove the anode our old heater never had one as far as we know and it lasted yrs and the water tasted great it's probably made out of zinc and it's what they call in the shipping industry a sacrificial anode when you have a combination of metals say iron and copper in a water environment the difference in the number of electron atoms in the two metals actually causes a very small electric current to flow when this current flows it causes a corrosion called galvanic corrosion between the dissimilar metals so a piece of zinc is installed which then corrodes instead of the copper or iron parts that's why it's called a sacrificial anode because you sacrifice a useless zinc part instead of allowing the useful other metal parts to corrode Corrosion Anode Cathodic protection Aluminium Zinc Rust Welding Vacuum tube Soldering Sulfur Galvanization Metallurgy Steel Titanium Copper Motor oil Brazing Tin Hard water Electrode Sterling silver Lead Sulfuric acid Metal Cookware and bakeware Ozone Silicon Transition metal Magnetism Hydrogen sulfide Chromium Ammonia Diode Copper extraction Heat Hydrochloric acid Fuel cell Bong Lithium Electricity Battery (electricity) Cathode Electroplating Samovar Chlorine Ceramics X-ray Gold Platinum Mercury (element) Water purification Arc welding Mercury arc valve Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Gas metal arc welding Indium Textile manufacturing Volt Solder Semiconductor Thermostat Light-emitting diode Zirconium Furnace Acetic acid Transformer Sewage treatment Nuclear power Bronze Nuclear weapon design Hydrogen Nickel Thermal power station Gallium Fossil fuel power plant Magnesium Solar cell Barium Al-Razi Beryllium Pressurized water reactor Water (molecule) X-ray tube Tenjiku shogi Thallium Spark plug Stainless steel M16 (rifle) Electrical wiring Sulfide
