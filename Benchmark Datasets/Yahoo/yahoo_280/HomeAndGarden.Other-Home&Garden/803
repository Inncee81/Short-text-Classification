in my garden i have a low spot that is giving me some problems when it rains the water puddles and my corn is falling over i also have a tomato plant and the leaves sit in the water and they die i thought about just filling it with dirt but was concerned that covering the bottom of the plants might hurt them will they grow more or will this injure them the tomatoes are very healthy and i do not want to lose them i thought about transplanting them but am concerned actually i think they will be okay if you raise the dirt level corn tends to lift out anyhow i don't know about yours but i can see the roots on mine as for tomatoes the proper way to plant them when they are young is to remove all the leaves except the top and bury all the rest of the plant tomatoes will root all along the buried stem so i don't see why raising the soil would cause too much of a problem if they were any other plant or woody perennial then i would say no to raising the soil level but i think corn and tomatoes would be okay with it be aware though that this is just speculation i've never had to do this myself so i can't say for certainty the one thing i can say for certain is that i wouldn't transplant them good luck Tomato Flowering plant Plant Desert Comfrey Weed control Bamboo Irrigation Agriculture Maize Herbicide Carnivorous plant Hamster Honey fungus Hippeastrum Houseplant Deforestation Garden Strawberry Perennial plant Hemp Physiological plant disorders Soil pH Bonsai Soil Beet Green Revolution Sorghum Elis Prefecture Pansy Hop (plant) Tree Orchidaceae Soil life Plant stem Environmental concerns with electricity generation Textile manufacturing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rice Erosion Wetland Desertification Rainforest Creeping Charlie Potato Drainage Gooseberry Bong Sugar beet Auxin Gypsy moth Lake District Kudzu Simone Weil Greenhouse Photosynthesis Flax Cannabis cultivation Erie Canal Black pepper Fancy rat Pachypodium Banksia Logging Theory of conduct Human cloning Japanese tea ceremony Nuclear power Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chernobyl accident Oregano Eutrophication The Suffering (game) Moss Leaf Boston Bruins Motorcycle Oat Wood Peruvian cuisine Vegetative reproduction Satchel Paige Wheat Genetically modified food Hangi Iris (plant) Pachypodium habitats Tea Ethylene Acorn Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Vermicompost Growing degree day Alfalfa Great Depression Mulch Death Valley National Park
