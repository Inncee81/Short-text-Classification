gross inground pool help we have a small inground pool it has been uncovered since last summer i guess we cleaned out a tremendous amount of leaves and slime we have poured algecide in it repeatedly we cannot drain it b c it is or years old the installer said it would ruin the liner to drain it problem is even with the algecide we could never see the bottom of the pool to tell if we had gotten all the gunk we finally shut off the pump b c we felt like we were pouring money down the drain any ideas hi rachael have you had your filter checked it might need to be cleaned or replaced our pool guy told us that a pool doesn't really need anything but a good filter to keep it clean not even chlorine we of course still use chlorine because our filter's not that good but it was an interesting point to make or maybe your pump isn't pumping water through the filter as efficiently as it needs to in order to keep up with the algal growth we had an algal bloom last summer that was nasty i remember throwing tons of algaecide at it with seemingly no effects eventually we broke down and rehired the pool maintenance man we'd let go of just to save some a few months before and he had the pool looking good in a couple of weeks he started with getting the filter back in tip top condition and kept at it with algaecide and high chlorine levels good luck Motor oil Sewage treatment Eutrophication Heinkel He 100 E85 Diving Ozone depletion Thermal power station Water purification Algal bloom Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ozone hole Dry cleaning Dialysis Air conditioning Fountain Lake Lake Burley Griffin Piccolo Junior Saga Bong Drainage Chlorine Wind turbine Siphon Sea ice Autonomous building Water supply Loudspeaker Houseplant Poker jargon Home repair Hydrogen economy Coffee Swimming Dundas Square Flat tax Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Textile manufacturing Ozone layer Solar power Full Metal Panic?
