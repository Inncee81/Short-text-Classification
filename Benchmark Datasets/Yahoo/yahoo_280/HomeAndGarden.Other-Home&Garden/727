how to save my money plant i have a problem with my money plant we used to water the pot twice a week later we bought a water sprayer two or three weeks back and started spraying the whole plant its leaves turned all of a sudden yellow we maintain a temperature of in our ac room it do not get more light as much as through a open window it is far from the window but not too far sometimes i turn on the light so that it can get enough light but i dont know whether it is neccesary or not it used to be twice more than as it is shown in the photograph i want to know why it is happening to her and how to water her and to take care of her thank you very much sonu is the ac blowing directly on the plant s or even in the general direction if so then think about this when you get out of the shower and are still wet damp are you not colder than when you are dry if the ac is hitting you my theory is this keep in mind this is just an educated guess you're plant like any living thing has addapted to it's environment granted that shit can grow almost anywhere any sudden changes can be catastrophic it doesn't have the means to heat or cool itself and it's roots are the most fragile part typically they are underground and the ground heats and cools very slowly being in a n enclosed pot above ground dramatically lowers the ammount of time the roots temp changes also keep in mind that even if you have the thermostat and any ac that doesn't blow continuously has a thermostat set at degrees if you live anywhere where the ave temp outside is more than degrees warmer than the ac unit is set on then it must work double time tomaintain a steady temp it does this one of ways by adjustingtemp up and down periodically or by blowing a slightly cooler temp than what the actual thermostat reads to cool a larger space quicker b shutting off you do the math if it's degrees outside then you're ac must blow about degrees for the first portion of the time that it's on just to cool the room structure back down to degrees if it blew at degrees even then it would have to stay on costantly i can tell you more if i had a make and model of the ac but i figure that combined with the new watering system could very likely have put the plant plants into shock resulting in the discoloration and wilting of the leaves if you're realy worried about the plant then i would suggest first doing as mr obvious suggests and repotting but don't rush it the plant is already in shock and that could kill it give it a few days to settle and make sure that the soil is the same temp all the way through before you uproot it i trust that you know your orrigional soil mixture stick with it remix b you pull roots and let it reach the same temp as the orrigiona soil b you transfer you may want to iincrease the abount of carbon you plant intakes very slightly until this procedure is done and periodically afterwards it will give it a little boost and help the odds a smaller plant producing a heavier yield i highly suggest a growbox made of wood plywood or plexiglass wrapped with three layers inside and outside and all overlappingeach other and sealed as well as possible of industrial strength clear plastic you can buy rolls of it at lowe's or most hardware stores instead of that fiberglass shit that always comes to mind when people talk about insulation you're doing this for three main reasons insullation pest parasite control if the plastic is new and in a roll then it is steril and a less likely habitat for mold and mites also you can see any mold growing onthe walls better with clear plastic and it will draw less heat than black ties in with all that plastic does wonders trapping the smell it won't be but hell nothing realy is with that huh keep in mind the ideal height and width if the plant when you build it you do not want it touching the side and you dont want to scorch the plant with the light which should be mounted to the top of the box you can run a hose like a drier hose from the ac to your box just make sure if you do you seal it well also make sure you put it close to the top on one of the sides cool air drops hot air rises which balances thus nuetralizing the majority of the damage that the light or the ac would do to a plant by themselves and you may want to find a smaller cheap ac to strip the thermostat out lengthen its wires to fit inside the box even with the center of the plant mounted on the opposite side of the box as your ac hose that way it feels what the plant feels it has less to cool so it can get it to temp without freezing your baby out and finally you want to water late at night or early in the morning when it is cooler and the ac isn't coming on as ofter it would probably be beneficial to raise the temp by degrees just b you water which will also increase the humidity level in the box making for a more favorable habitat Carburetor Explosive material Plastic Casting Spark plug Textile manufacturing
