should i trust weedman i am a weedman customer who uses the natural treatment for weeds i have a relatively good lawn and live on a small crescent about homes with a ravine behind it i don't have any trees around my home at all the weedman guy called and told me that because of the june bugs in the air there are eggs on my lawn that will turn into grubs in the next week unless i treat it he made it sound like was calling all the customers on my street we are the only ones and they were all going to get theirs treated they never left me a note as they usually do although the guy on the phone said they did i told them to send back their technician to show me the eggs before i pay them their he said that if he did he'd need a microscope to see them i don't know how weedman works but it sure sounds like they are looking to reach a quota of some sort by scaring their customers into treatments anyone have advice on what to do could they really be telling the truth they seem to have an answer for everything and are hard to trust anyone know exactly how grubs germinate i am out all the time in the evenings and have seen no june bugs at all i live in canada he said they couldn't use a microscope but if we waited and didn't take the treatment we'd have a big surprise they could treat it later but then i'd have to resod my whole lawn which costs lots of money if you do have grubs you will know in a couple months the grass will start turning yellow or brown in spots you can still treat for them after the yellow spots appear so i would wait and see what happens to the lawn most people don't know they have them until they see spots and call someone to come and check it out Ocean's Twelve The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Social rule Chatsworth House Stomach cancer Poker jargon GSM services The Amazing Race Lawn Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Surveillance Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Mad Money Piccolo Junior Saga Ben Johnson (athlete) The Apprentice 2 She Loves You Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Health insurance Year of the Spider Eric Bischoff Good Times Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Prostate cancer Hall & Oates GunBound The Pet Sounds Sessions The Empty Child Plame affair Biological pest control Wal-Mart E-mail spam Live 8 Treehouse of Horror V Tick The Beatles discography Full Metal Panic?
