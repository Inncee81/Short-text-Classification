how do you get stains off dishes we have well water and i get black stains on my dishes is it safe to soak them in bleach water or will that even work i have a year old so i need something safe if you don't want to use chemicals try a magic eraser it make takes some elbow grease but they do a good job taking off water stains if the magic eraser doesn't completely work you can use the works spray bathroom cleaner in a green bottle if the dish isn't porous then soak and wash a couple times in regular dish soap to remove any residues i find that if you don't let your dishes sit in well water without dish soap for long periods of time you won't get the black stains you may still get rust though if you have iron in the water Houseplant Flower Hippeastrum Alfalfa Leaf Begonia Bong Bladderwort Comfrey Orchidaceae Asteraceae Jute Biological pest control Algal bloom Physiological plant disorders Hydroponics Basil Wisteria Flowering plant Textile manufacturing Sunflower Kitchen Vermicompost Carnivorous plant Soil pH Garden Strawberry Monarda Tea Bud California Poppy Cactus Stinging nettle Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cannabis (drug) Eutrophication Rose Kudzu Japanese tea ceremony Atlanta metropolitan area Olive Flax Hop (plant) Ship Perennial plant Drill bit Carbon dioxide sink Espresso Caryophyllaceae Lake Phalaenopsis Oxeye daisy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Goldenrod Somerset Levels Poker jargon Agave Irrigation Clinker (boat building) Cannabis cultivation Bamboo Weed control Pansy Lettuce Aquaculture Ethylene Wood Grafting 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Tofu Nepenthes Drainage Century plant Pachypodium brevicaule Elis Prefecture Gaillardia Bougainvillea Gardenia Monofloral honey Absinth Wormwood Stud poker Biodynamic agriculture Plant Aloe Ficus elastica Camellia sinensis Naruto jutsu Iris (plant) Pollination Omaha hold 'em Watermelon Oregon-grape Potomac River Forsythia Air conditioning Ragweed Pinophyta Water (molecule) Fertilizer
