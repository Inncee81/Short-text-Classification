staining cement i just had a new cement step put in front of the existing cement slab by my front door the cement slab of course has been there for years i have cleaned it with a cement cleaner off and on so it does not look dirty the new stop however is very white in comparison how can i stain the step and what color or colors do i use hope someone can give me some advice thanks there are masonry stains you can buy that will not only stain the concrete but also seal them to protect them from corrosion my husband and i recently stained our poured concrete pool patio with a product called transeal wb that we ordered through a local masonry supply store we had about five or six colors to choose from we had a problem similar to yours portions of the patio which had been poured many years ago had been pulled up at some point and the new sections didn't match in color you apply the stain with a regular paint roller it's really easy the most important thing is to make sure that you put on three coats the first stains the concrete the second helps the colors match and the third seals it tight the only problem you might run into is that you only have a small space to stain and the product we bought came in a five gallon drum enough to do our entire patio look in the phone book for masonry supplies and ask if they sell smaller amounts or even samples the company that made the product we used was called umaco but there are probably others good luck Seismic retrofit Drill bit Reinforced concrete Concrete CPU cache Textile manufacturing Masonry Lionel Corporation Dam Pottery Mattress Poker jargon Brewery Paint Topps Eifel Aqueduct Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Digital photography Bong Microeconomics Anchor Knife Monopoly (game) Stucco Heinkel He 100 Glass Fire extinguisher Sheaf (mathematics) Pavement (material) Sento Casting Dodge Charger M16 (rifle) Portland cement Marching band Diving Staining (biology) Dry cleaning Quicksort Bulk vending Nintendo Entertainment System Debugging Motor oil Building material Central processing unit Internal ballistics Surveillance Tag Wind turbine Dairy Compiler optimization Professional wrestling slang Wayne Corporation Shroud of Turin Soldering Sears Holdings Corporation The Amazing Race Carburetor Christmas tree Amateur telescope making Gram staining Color blindness Panama Canal Locks Welding Supply and demand Hard disk Toyota Prius Fire fighting Kitchen Expert system Dundas Square M60 machine gun Roller hockey Tesco Black IPod Color Drug test Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Handloading Mach kernel Agarose gel electrophoresis Home repair Paintball De Lorean DMC-12 Japanese tea ceremony Patent 2000 Australian Grand Prix Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Rail transport in Ireland Stained glass Corrosion Sundial Condom New Coke Winning Streak Capitalism
