sourceing a musty odor hey everyone i have a frustrating musty odor that appears in my room on random occasions the room itself is very clean i clean it fully once a week and regulary de clutter yet a musty odor is often noticable inside it its an attic room and it has one roof window which i try to open for atleast hours each day nothing i do seems to work and im starting to think that there must be a source of the smell i dont think its mold as there is nothing visible on any of the surfaces fitting the profile of what mold looks like there is a small old fashioned windcatching vent on one of the walls too as i said the room is clean but it still smells musty quite often it comes and goes realy but i simply cant source the smell because it just seems to be everywhere in the room any suggestions as to what the cause might be also if the room smells musty does that mean that the smell will cling to my clothes or should i not need to worry about that thanks stephen i recently removed the carpet as i am getting wooden flooring soon but the musty odor was present long before i took the carpet up is there a vent that goes down to the basement of the house chances are that there is and that is where your smell is coming from have you tried getting into the windcatching vent that you said is there and seeing what is 'inside' of it maybe something got in and could not get out at one point and time gross but very possible good luck Basement Cannabis cultivation Shoe Buckingham Palace Xanadu House Carpet Sento Bungalow Kitchen Japanese toilet Animal Crossing Diseases of the honeybee Casting Japanese tea ceremony Toxic mold M16 (rifle) Bong Vacuum cleaner Sulfur Combine (Half-Life 2) Windcatcher HVAC Changeroom Stairway The Visitation McMansion Ice Domestic water system Roomba Dymaxion house Timber framing Vermicompost Tofu Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
