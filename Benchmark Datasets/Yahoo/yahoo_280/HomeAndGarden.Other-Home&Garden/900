pitcher filters faucet filters or just plain old bottled water which works best on a budget i'm not looking to get into a debate of whether or not tap water in the us is safe or not please don't reply to tell me the water is ok i live in central pa and they're switching their water systems from using chlorine which i wasn't thrilled about to begin with to chloramine now all i drink is tap water and because of the medicine i'm on i drink a lot of it we're also looking into having children and it would be an extremely high risk pregnancy so it's really important to me to have out all excess chemicals as much as possible heck i'm more worried about the chemicals than the bacteria now thanks to the water company however we're also on a budget what's the cheapest effective way to filter water the kind that attaches to a faucet the pitcher type or is my best bet to stick with bottled water for drinking instead of playing with filters if you're going to be drinking lots of water then i'd go with the filter you attach to the faucet it works great and they don't cost an arm and a leg i have the brita the pitcher filters work ok but it's a pain having to refill the pitcher all the time and then wait for it to filter through so you can drink it the very best filters are usually the under the sink type but they also cost the most Water purification Sewage treatment Bottled water Coffee Water Siphon Swimming Ammonia Chlorination Chlorine Beer Brewery Ozone Sodium hypochlorite Sento Mosquito Swimming pool Breastfeeding Water supply Tap (valve) Ty Cobb Diving Marine aquarium Pitcher Tooth enamel Autonomous building Cruising (maritime) Fountain Baseball Tap water Intravenous therapy Disinfection Yerba mate Reverse osmosis Energy development Naval mine Cholera Fish farming Acetic acid Bong Asthma Plastic Hydrochloric acid Caffeine Ultraviolet Hydrogen peroxide Carnivorous plant Welding Customs and etiquette of Japan Decompression sickness Alcoholic beverage Drink Dry cleaning Incandescent light bulb Survival skills E85 Fume hood Nolan Ryan Cocaine Allergy Urine MTBE Pneumonia Body piercing Tea Ozone depletion Childbirth Escherichia coli O157:H7 Shaggy dog story Silver Low-pass filter Haloalkane Electronic filter Cider Chemical warfare Hard water Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ethernet Birth control Bleach Piccolo Junior Saga Depleted uranium Food and Drug Administration Humphrey Bogart Psoriasis Rum Cigarette Dioxin High-voltage direct current Sterilization (microbiology) Ozone hole Tobacco smoking Hydrogen economy Polychlorinated biphenyl Dairy Acupuncture 1,4-dichlorobenzene Gas mask Factory farming Water pollution
