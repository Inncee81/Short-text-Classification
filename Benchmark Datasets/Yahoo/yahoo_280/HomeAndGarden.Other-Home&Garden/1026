what difference does solar panelling make to bills we have gone to look at an eco home which has solar panels on the roof we have been told it will reduce heating and hot water bills but does anyone know how by how much the estimates i have for uk are approximately of your hot water costs heating is very little because even though bright sunshine is not requires for solar energy cloud cover would prevent enough heat being generated to pump round a heating system unless you cover a very large area of roof there would be very little benefit on heating Solar power Solar panel Solar collector Solar cell Renewable energy Solar system Passive solar Solar variation Sun Energy development Autonomous building Air conditioning Roof Urban heat island Spacecraft propulsion Stirling engine Heat Ocean thermal energy conversion Global warming Alternative fuel Welding Nuclear power Saturn HVAC Fuel cell Glossary of firefighting terms Mitigation of global warming Hydrogen economy Planet Vacuum tube Greenhouse effect Solar thermal energy Planetary habitability Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Colonization of the Moon Fossil fuel power plant Steam engine Solar sail Central heating Internal ballistics Power station Future energy development Solar power satellite Sunlight Water heater Star Trek planet classifications Geodesic dome Solar radiation Space manufacturing Wind turbine Geothermal power Corona Energy Water Biodiesel Furnace Temperature Incandescent light bulb Geyser Ionizing radiation Water (molecule) Thermostat Fusion power Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Vacuum Neutrino Transformer Fuel injection Climate change Renewable energy development Plasma (physics) Thermal power station Brewery Pebble bed reactor Electricity generation Pressurized water reactor Distributed generation Terraforming Hybrid vehicle Lightning Powder metallurgy Swimming pool Water purification E85 Straw-bale construction Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Aurora (astronomy) Items in the Metroid series Stellar evolution Dyson sphere Convection Hydrogen Hubble Space Telescope Optical fiber Heat pump Kitchen
