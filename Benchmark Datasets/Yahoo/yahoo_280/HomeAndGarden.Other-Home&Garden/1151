how to divide rent with roomates and rooms just moved into my gf's apt and her current rent for the smaller room and public bathroom is the person in the master bedroom is paying i honestly think this isn't fair at all but i can live with it the only thing that i can't agree on is that the person in the master bedroom which has a walk in closet and private bathroom wants a discount on the rent bc i'm there now her offer was for her rent and for our rent i've gone as far as measuring our the sq ft of each bedroom and divided the of the total sq ft i don't want to be fickle about things like that but since she raised the issue and wanted a discount i had to look into it i came up with some figures and it shocked me when i found out that the master bedroom should cost to be exact and for the small room with public bathroom i offered to take the master with my gf for i would even go up to just to be fair and for the small room and she doesn't want it am i being unfair oh yea just to mention the master is clearly bigger than the regular room the master has square feet including bathroom and the regular room is square feet including bathroom also the master bedroom is guaranteed a parking spot while the occupants in the regular room have only parking spot we do live in la so parking is an issue also total rent is and her bf always comes over hes been basically living with her for months my gf never said anything about rent with them bu as soon as i moved in they wanted a way split is that fair to split ways but we get the smaller room and the other roommate get the master with the private bathroom and walk in closet lets see where can i start the masterbedroom person's boyfriend lives at home but he basically lives at the apt not to mention my gfcould've asked to split rent in a way fashion for the other roomates bf but didnt also while i wasnt there utilities were basically split in half between my gf and the master bedroom occupant but we need to take into account that the roommates bf was over all the time the funny thing about all this is how the masterbedroom roommate always had people on the lease and the other is just the bf and my gf prior to me going over didnt have a way split the roommate wants that now since i'm in i really dont understand the logic the masterbedroom roomate is saying one more thing her argument is about communal area and what she wrote to me confused me understood communal area is not about how much stuff you have in it its the usage of the area itself agreed i didnt know what she meant so i just said no i dont get it i think the person in the master bedroom is being ridiculous but if you guys can't even agree on rent then maybe you shouldn't be living together Friends Avenue Q The Brady Bunch Vista Way Gross domestic product Anarchism and capitalism Property tax The Commons Dormitory Chatham Square NorthBridge Apartment Complex Euphemism Goodness and value theory Rent (musical) Little Britain Bathroom Economics Insurance The nature of God in Western theology Glossary of partner dance terms Capitalism Japanese toilet Buckingham Palace McMansion Property (ownership right) Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe FairTax Social rule National Kidney Foundation Singapore 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sin City Microeconomics Bedroom Cyprus dispute Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Flat tax Shaggy dog story EastEnders Money Redundant array of independent disks Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Satchel Paige The Apprentice 2 The Silence of the Lambs Big Brother (USA TV series) Contract Emergency preparedness Infant baptism Life insurance Estoppel Cheating in poker Electrophysiology Extreme Programming Swingout Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Centrelink The Catcher in the Rye Kender Public policy U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Garfield Wilton House Surplus value The Class Menagerie Philip J.
