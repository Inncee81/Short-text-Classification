crackling sound in wall what could it be my roommate and i just noticed this crackling sound in the wall of my bathroom his frist reaction was that it's water although at times when you hit the wall it stops for a second this made us believe it could be bugs we live in california which means there are termites eveywhere but the sound doesn't really sound like termites any suggestions on what else it could be could be many things but i'm going to say that it sounds like mice i bought a very old home and we had mice i remember hearing a sound similar to that at bed time and in my kitchen cupboard Kitchen Onomatopoeia Cheating in Counter-Strike Bugs Bunny English plural Avenue Q The Golden Age of Hollywood animation USS Tunny (SS-282) The Shining (film) Grammatical aspect Non-native pronunciations of English Episodes of Lost (Season 2) House Hiberno-English The Brady Bunch Spidey Super Stories Hogwarts Floor Directory The Star Wars Holiday Special Time Out of Mind Salad Fingers Sampling (music) The Wall GunZ The Duel IBM PC compatible Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Snap, Crackle and Pop Banjo-Kazooie Pok__mon Live!
