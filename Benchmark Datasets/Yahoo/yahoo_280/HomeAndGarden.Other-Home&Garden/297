how can i get rid of weeds called cats ears from my lawn i was curious on what exactly cats ears on a lawn were i had never heard of that name before first search and i found this cats ear for a weed this has an enormous variety of names used to describe itself false dandelion flatweed hairy cat's ear hairy wild lettuce etc are just some of them whatever you decide to call it it still remains a weed this is so common that most gardeners would have found it in their lawn at some stage cat's ears large flat leaves lie flat on the ground smothering everything that it covers it acts as a natural soil solariser but unfortunately kills your lawn instead of the weeds there are two ways to address this type of weed obviously the first method is to eradicate them either manually or by using a spot glyphosate on the centre of the weed the second method is to actually keep them in your lawn but continually mow them the reason for this is that cat's ear has an amazingly long taproot that can bring many nutrients to the surface and actually help your lawn grow healthier however this second method is a gamble if you don't mow them well enough they can continue to grow and eventually take over i would recommend allowing them to grow for a few regular mowing periods and then treat them Weed control Weed Dandelion Lawn Comfrey Agriculture Lettuce Catsear Hydroponics Lawn mower Leaf Kudzu Irrigation Organic farming Roundup Anchor Maize Gypsy moth Ragweed Herbicide Organic gardening Guinea pig Sewage treatment Biological pest control Organic food Genetically modified food Tennis Tobacco Carnivorous plant Gooseberry Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sugar beet Offer and acceptance Burial Masanobu Fukuoka Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Burdock Tick Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Ragwort Poker jargon Gardening Creeping Charlie Gray Wolf Biodynamic agriculture Cat Wetland Nepeta Green roof Glyphosate Domestic rabbit Fish farming Vegetation Horseshoe Skateboarding trick Hemp Deforestation Cheetah Dog Chatsworth House Mulch Hay Compost Carpal tunnel syndrome Alaga__sia Clover Pansy Rice Moss Stereoscopy Tetrapod Turnip (brassica rapa) New Zealand English Infantilism Sonchus Bonsai Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Combine harvester Rail tracks Cancer Livestock Cannabis cultivation Root Monster Rancher monsters Stinging nettle Soil pH Green Revolution Filigree Plough Chlorophyta Tomato Dairy Feral cat Digitaria Illegal drug trade Xeriscaping Rainforest
