anyone please answer on building a new home we are completely stuck with friends and bias answers does this make sense ok we want to build this modular before u say anything these are not average ones we have done research even went to the plant walkthrough models neway they offer a sq ft ranch w full basment where all we need to do is sheetrock its done a full walk up attic blown out so its like another floor a venetian spa bathroom that is ' ' georgeous a kitchen that is ' ' absolutely beautiful w all appliances included even microwave laundry washer dryer everything even the damn curtains come w the house however they want for this yet im seeing sq ft houses sale not new but for less than this not as nice of things but definitely way more space are we naive in thinking that its still worth it pay more smaller get what we want or since its a modular it should not be that much money i know most people are bias when it comes to this but look for ureself on pleasant valley modular what do you think advice please sq ft houses include the basment in the sq footage because its finished so no its not impossible because i can give you realty sites with new contructions that have them at the first thing to consider is the location that is the most important thing in real estate buy in the best location you can afford the next thing would be to compare homes in your area that have the same amenities as the modular home and are comparable in size you may find that you are not getting such a great deal you can opt to buy a larger home in a great location and invest the money in putting the amenities into it i e the venetian spa you also need to consider financing many traditional lenders shy away from manufactured homes so you may find yourself taking out a personal property loan rather than a real property loan i don't think you will have many options in this type of loan so you may pay more for it talk to your mortgage broker manufactured homes can tend to decrease in value if they are not immaculately maintained the shortage of traditional financing for used manufactured homes often reduces demand for resale of course this can vary greatly according to your local real estate market talk to your realtor the final thing to consider is how soon do you want to sell the home it might take you longer to sell due to people shying away from modular homes and the lack of mortgage options when my husband and i were looking for a home we saw a beautiful modular home i didn't even know is was modular the realtor immediately said to us that she needed to disclose that it was modular the way she said it made my husband and i think there was a bad stigma attached to those type of homes we opted for a more traditional home finally i would consider the motives of your friends and if you find they are only looking out for your best interest then i would listen to them good luck in your search for the perfect home Real estate broker Mobile home Donald Trump Insurance Capitalism Stock Microeconomics Student loan Citigroup Predatory lending Life insurance Deflation (economics) Security (finance) Japanese toilet Bond Mutual fund Real estate FairTax Finance Debt Illegal drug trade Government National Mortgage Association Great Depression Capital accumulation IBM PC compatible Title insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Taxation in the United States Social rule Supply and demand Kitchen Privatization Islamic banking Monopoly (game) Gross domestic product Financial markets Warren Buffett History of the United States (1918-1945) Free trade Real estate bubble Property tax Law of value Economy of Russia Tesco Bank Ford Motor Company Tax Chatsworth House Wayne Corporation Bretton Woods system Gold standard MMORPG Federal National Mortgage Association Harlem Economics Interest Concurrent estate Annual percentage rate Derivative (finance) Money Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monetary policy CPU cache Microcredit Mergers and acquisitions Economy of the United States Property (ownership right) Temasek Holdings Berkshire Hathaway Anarchism and capitalism Personal finance Option Mathematics Construction Wells Fargo Economy of India Annuity Divorce Betting (poker) EastEnders Infantilism Mortgage-backed security Real estate economics Solar power Business Unemployment Basement Savings and loan association 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Intellectual property Poker jargon Theory of conduct RISC
