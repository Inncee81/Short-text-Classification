concerning tomato growing i am getting quite a few tomatoes that are still hanging on the vine with the bottoms rotting i am growing them in a gallon container there are plants in there and one plant seems to be doing better than the other but that aside both have been yeilding not all some bad fruit anyone have any ideas these are plum tomatoes but i don't think that would matter much thanks for the input what you are experiencing is called blossom end rot yank those tomatoes off the vine and toss them in the garbage in spite of what some people might try and tell you know one knows to a certainty as to what causes ber nor do they have an absolute cure for it ber most often appears in the early part of the season and just disappears as the season progresses the thought is that ber may be caused by stress and that stress can be caused by wild variations in the availability of water try keeping your container from drying out and then flooding it tomatoes prefer damp soil at all times container gardening is more difficult than regular gardening due to the finite amount of soil and the fact that the soil will dry out much faster than if the plants were in the ground so you need to monitor them closely if you cannot feel cool moist soil when you stick your index finger into the soil then it needs watering you will hear all kinds of suggestions regarding calcium deficiencies causing ber but there is no proof of that adding tums or crushed egg shells to the soil is just a waste of time but if it makes you feel good then go for it Tomato Hamster Textile manufacturing Cannabis cultivation Jute Flax Physiological plant disorders Campfire Houseplant Tobacco Comfrey Coffee Desert Microeconomics Ecology Hemp Soil pH Carbon dioxide sink Effects of global warming Bonsai Eutrophication Olive Gooseberry Deforestation Vermicompost Organic food Carbon dioxide Agriculture Global warming and agriculture Fruit Earthworm Apple Yosemite National Park Potato Vanilla Japanese tea ceremony Casting Pansy Compost Vegetarianism Unemployment Greenhouse Banana Lake Acorn Food preservation Dairy Tea Gardening Cocaine Sorghum Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Common bean Climate of the United Kingdom Soil life Renewable energy Dry cleaning Simone Weil Thermal power station Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fast bowling Dam Decomposition Garlic Soils retrogression and degradation Snake Glass I Ching divination Irrigation Cellular automaton Chili con carne Biodiversity Genetically modified food Nuclear power Baldness Cuisine of Denmark Peanut Weed control Color Vitamin C Organic farming Wood Great Lakes Geology of the Moon Wine Permaculture Plum Diaper Merit Peach
