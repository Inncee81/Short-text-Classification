how much would you pay a housekeeper i live in idaho where the cost of living is really low i have a sf house how much would you pay a cleaning lady that's not licensed insured taking it all home to clean the house it would take about hours i usually pick every up so that the actually cleaning could be gotten to oh of the rooms are not acutally used every day lvg room dngroom bonus room thx for your answers 'cause this gal came to my house knowing enough english to ask for hr i thought she was out of her mind i was thinking in the range of hr and she only gave me the jobs she has as references and those people are california transplants who did tell me they felt they were paying too much but i guess they have money to burn licensed bonded work here is hr any more input in appreciated hello i live in arizona however i was a housekeeper for years first make sure that she has references i have known many who have had housekeepers come in and to thier dismay were stolen from be careful of those who are not licensed i did clean homes without a license when i started up however these folks knew where i lived had my driver's license number and i provided proof that i was who i said i was and bills with my address that matched my license as a rule of thumb i charged by the hour on the first cleaning i charged per hour the first cleaning will always be a little more work if the home was a disaster when i came back i charged the same rate however lets say that it took me hours to clean your home after my first cleaning and i came back and the home was not a disaster i then charged per hour it is important to know that a good housekeeper will charge a rate worth her time i would check around and find out what established professional housekeepers charge i e marry maids etc then take to off of thier rates and you will have a fair idea of what to pay an unlicensed houskeeper now if your housekeeper comes with great references and you have checked her references don't expect that she will accept less than what she says she charges a good unlicensed housekeeper will usually charge about to less than commercial housekeeping businesses do that is a fair rate for someone who is experienced and has outstanding references sammi Driver's license Life insurance Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Social rule Mutual fund Good Times Bond Automatic number plate recognition Inflation Credit card Health insurance Hillary Rodham Clinton Mortgage Blackjack CPU cache Ocean's Twelve FairTax Open access National Kidney Foundation Singapore Tip Value added tax Warren Buffett Internet fraud Baseball Identity theft Great house The Apprentice 2 Labour economics MP3 Education in the United States Triage Bank Nursing home Theory of conduct Taxicab Housekeeper (servant) Predatory lending Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Economics Labor theory of value Milton H.
