now i have to do all the house work what shall i do for all these years my mom has done all the house work alone but now she's going to be gone for a month i need to take care of the whole house myself i'm not used to doing all these house chores and i'm not familiar with it at all i know i need to water the plants feed the goldfish change the tank wash dishes cook for dinner vacuum laundry but what else am i missing give me suggestions the important thing is to do the most necessary things so that the plants and goldfish don't die the dishes don't stand long enough to draw ants or worse and you don't run out of clean laundry that's the way the rest of us get by just decide on your priorities you can minimize dishes and cooking if you get takeout part of the time and maybe use paper plates and plastic utensils scrub out any stains on your laundry before you put it in so they don't get set in and i just have to ask why has your mother been doing everything until now without your help i hope this gives you a sense of appreciation for the unpaid work she's been doing for you Kitchen Dishwashing Dishwasher Chopsticks Cruising (maritime) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Calvin and Hobbes Laundry detergent Kosher foods Goldfish Textile manufacturing Brewery Solar power Washing machine Customs and etiquette of Japan Cookware and bakeware Chinese cuisine Roman eating and drinking Bong Foodborne illness Dairy Milton H.
