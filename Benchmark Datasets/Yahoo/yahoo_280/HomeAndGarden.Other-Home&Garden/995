what qualifies as a weed what makes a weed a weed we currently have a beautiful yellow flowerdy plant on a long stalk growing in our yard but my mom told me it is a weed are weeds necessarily bad if this plant is so pretty then what's wrong with it why does it have to be called a weed great question the answer in gardening circles is that a weed is a plant in the wrong place however that doesn't make it a bad plant if it's invasive and taking over your whole yard then that isn't good but many plants that are called weeds are quite pretty or nice to look at frequently plants will spring up in someone's yard that came from seeds from someone else's garden and got there by being dropped by birds or stuck to the coat of a visiting animal and are called volunteers they will look out of place because they weren't planted on purpose but that is not a reason to get rid of them if you like the plant take milkweed for instance some people just chop it down because they don't know that the flowers provide nectar for the monarch and queen butterflies it also is the plant that they lay their eggs on so that the tiny caterpillars have a ready food source when they hatch when they kill the plant they often kill the tiny creatures that would have one day become beautiful butterflies so i hope this helps you understand that just because a plant looks out of place that isn't necessarily a bad thing Biological pest control Theory of conduct Weed Hemp Weed control Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Asclepias Rapeseed Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Flowering plant Flower Garlic Butterfly Ragwort Agriculture Gooseberry Chicken Insect Goodness and value theory Caterpillar 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bladderwort Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Kudzu Jute Great Teacher Onizuka Pysanka Pansy Compost Monarch butterfly Maize Textile manufacturing Ranma __ characters Botany Biblical inerrancy Cannabis (drug) The Amber Spyglass Capercaillie Gypsy moth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kender Fruit Organic farming My Little Pony YuYu Hakusho Tomato Animal The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Monster Rancher monsters Ant Theodicy Social rule Snowball (Animal Farm) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Animal Crossing Rocko's Modern Life Homestar Runner RuneScape skills Sorghum Dandelion Illegal drug trade Comfrey Conker's Bad Fur Day Simone Weil Cindy Sheehan Boom Town (Doctor Who) Sexual reproduction Species Genetically modified food Intelligent design Coming of Age (TNG episode) Phoebe Halliwell Escape from New York Tobacco The Tale of Genji Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Homer Simpson Puni Puni Poemy Moth Orchidaceae Bee Mandrake (plant) Burdock Agricultural machinery Philosophy of language Tufted Vetch Shaggy dog story Blood (computer game) Bamboo Invasive species Gardening
