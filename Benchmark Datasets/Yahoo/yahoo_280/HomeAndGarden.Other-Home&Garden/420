how can i keep my neighbor from kicking his soccer ball into my flowers we have really nice next door neighbors our son plays with their son and we've really had no problems with them as neighbors however lately they have been playing soccer in their side yard and they repeatedly kick their soccer balls into my flower beds i've asked them to please be careful because we've put a great deal of time and money into them they are very apologetic and always say that they are sorry but the next time that they have friends over they do the exact same thing again financially we can't afford a fence right now and i'd rather lose all of my flowers than call the police about something like this any suggestions would be appreciated i'm sorry i wasn't really clear on my question it isn't the son kicking the ball into my flowers it's the father and his friends talk to the parents for certain if it happens again you might tell the kids you're keeping the ball for now and when the parents come over later to retrieve the ball and they will you can show them the damage the children have caused either the parents will be chagrined or mad that you kept the ball and if they are mad then you know where you stand you then have the option of moving the plants elsewhere or buying one of those inexpensive wire garden fences that can be pushed into the ground Football (soccer) Shaggy dog story Electrophysiology Rugby union positions Field hockey Glossary of American football American football Sport Poker jargon Avenue Q Wrigley Field Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Critic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Knots Landing Rugby union Penalty kick (football) Milton H.
