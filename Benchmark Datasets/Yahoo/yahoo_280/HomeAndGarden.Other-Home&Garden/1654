does anyone know how to clean off resin plastic lawn chairs our chairs are a dark khaki colour but when people sit on them white dust comes off on their clothes i have tried a pressure washer but the dust problem remains i was wondering if their is a chemical solution or some kind of special cleaner which might do a better job it's the oxidation that makes the white dust the only thing you might do is try the krylon plastic paint in clear that should work like a sealer after you have cleaned the chairs off good Pine Spruce Conifer cones Head Pinophyta Red Spruce Leaf Baldness Comanche Giant Sequoia Limber Pine Bamboo Whitebark Pine Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Christmas tree European Black Pine Scots Pine Coast Douglas-fir Pok__mon Colosseum Blue Pine Loblolly Pine Appalachian Mountains Blue Spruce Eastern White Pine The Legend of Zelda series enemies Mohawk hairstyle Campfire Sitka Spruce Norway Spruce Red Squirrel Haircut Stone Pine Pine nut Haleakala National Park Hat Pinaceae Charge (heraldry) Lodgepole Pine Bonus Stage Howard Hughes Spruce Budworm Tree Yellow GunBound RuneScape quests Guqin Lawn mower Longleaf Pine Lightning Wig (hair) Araucaria heterophylla Codename: Kids Next Door Chewing gum Atlanta metropolitan area Headgear Red Pine Camp Lazlo Veil 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Douglas Squirrel White Spruce Engelmann Spruce Black Spruce Happy Tree Friends Pinyon pine Jack Pine Pitch Pine Wood Sugar Pine Yosemite National Park Spotted Nutcracker Araucaria Blue Ridge Parkway Rubber Crop circle Shampoo Tarantula Korean Pine Eye Buckingham Palace Great Basin Bristlecone Pine Bristlecone pine Christmas worldwide Nord-Norge Battle of Lone Pine Turkish Pine Torrey Pine Turpentine Pollen Dreadlocks Gypsy moth Pine Barrens (New Jersey) Spruce Knob George Burns Siberian Pine Logging Ed, Edd n Eddy Beret Penn State Golf Courses Textile manufacturing terminology
