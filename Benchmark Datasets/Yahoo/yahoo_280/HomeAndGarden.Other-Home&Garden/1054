rubber tree plant help i just bought a rubber tree plant today it is about almost a metre high im wondering when i should water it and if it needs plant food fertilizer etc i have it right beside the backyard window but there is some shade for it what should i know about the plant is there a site i can goto that will give me detailed information about the plant thank you all let it dry out to a soil depth of about to inch between watering most people dont water their plants deep enough so give it a generous soaking it will die if you dont let the soil dry out and over water it from root rot the leave will fall off and it will be a real mess clean the leaves using just water or they will become damaged the leaf pores need to be open and not clogged with dust dont use anything like milk or mayo or whatever fool thing people suggest a healthy leaf is more important than a shiney leaf rubber tree plants can get sunburned so dont expose them to really hot sun not even through the window it should be in an east window not a southern exposure unless they are protected by a sheer curtain do not put them outside in the sun over the summer many people want a tropical feel to their patios and make this mistake if you are planting it outdoors it should have an east exposure and semi shade the same as indoors as it grows you will have to continue to transplant it to a bigger pot but not too much bigger it seems to like being root bound they should be fertilized in the spring and in the fall check for webs periodically and if you see any treat for spider mites Houseplant Bonsai Hippeastrum Gypsy moth Wood Garden Strawberry Tea Tillandsia Coconut Leaf Black pepper Plant Textile manufacturing Desert Carnivorous plant Apple Sugar beet Sunlight Deforestation Cannabis cultivation Pine European Beech Desertification Hemp Yosemite National Park Orchidaceae Hamster Organic farming Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physiological plant disorders Pachypodium Dairy Ultraviolet Comfrey Caatinga Peach Basil Irrigation Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Hydroponics Flowering plant Jute Devonian Wheat Swimming pool Alfalfa Soil life Pachypodium habitats Bamboo Begonia Olive Prosopis cineraria Logging Biological pest control Weed control Drainage RuneScape quests Sento Fruit tree propagation Cotton plant Arable land Carbon dioxide Organic food Florida Keys Leather Compost Christmas tree Biodiversity Gardening Elis Prefecture Opportunity rover Flax Rooibos Solar power Chernobyl accident Fancy rat Cyanide Ionizing radiation The Amber Spyglass Atlanta metropolitan area Diving suit Pinophyta Vegetation Banksia Old growth forest Allergy Tattoo Wisteria Illegal drug trade Rice Upholstery Ecology of Hong Kong
