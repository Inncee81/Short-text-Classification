if i spray weed killer all over my garden you see it's covered in weeds and undergrowth i've tried pulling them up but the stinging nettles have long roots that have networked all over the garden below the surface the only way i can figure it can be sorted would be with weed killer however if i spray will it affect the soil and if i wish to lay grass seed will that be affected by the chemicals what about the frogs etc will it kill them and if at a later date i wish to grow veg etc will the soil be safe to grow stuff in you could use a systemic weedkiller it works by killing the roots of the weeds trouble is it takes a couple of weeks to work but it leaves the soil good for replanting Weed control Herbicide Weed Hemp Biodynamic agriculture Biological pest control Comfrey Agriculture Illegal drug trade Irrigation Tillage Fruit tree propagation Stinging nettle Flax Mulch Garden Strawberry Ragweed Deforestation Masanobu Fukuoka Pansy Organic farming Compost Kudzu Carnivorous plant Nettle Organic gardening Alfalfa Hay fever Hydroponics Creeping Charlie Anchor Sugar beet Cannabis (drug) Green Revolution Bamboo Gypsy moth Wetland Rapeseed Plough Cannabis cultivation Root Glyphosate Rice Agricultural machinery Tobacco Sewage treatment Honey fungus Leaf Genetically modified food Soil pH Minor Harry Potter Beasts Earthworm Dune Turnip (brassica rapa) Mosquito Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Septic tank Flowering plant No-dig gardening Roundup Apple Hamster Blood (computer game) Lawn Drooping Brome Coast Douglas-fir Vermicompost Sin City Mandrake (plant) Ragwort Bonsai Yarrow Harrow Garlic DDT Pollinator decline Soil Green manure Nepeta Wildfire Plant Ginkgo Malaria Pesticide Cortaderia selloana Houseplant Cuscuta Oat Breastfeeding Zuiderzee Works Maize Organic food Fennel Rumex Absinth Wormwood Broom (shrub) Organic horticulture Iris (plant)
