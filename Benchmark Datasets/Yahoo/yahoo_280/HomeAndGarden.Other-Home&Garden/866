energy consumption someone once told me that the fuller a fridge is the lower the energy consumption is this true sure an empty fridge when opened will loose almost all of the cool air inside it however if there are objects with a higher specific heat capacity than air ie food they will not be warmed significantly by brief openings of the door this means that when the door is closed again the air and the food will return to a thermal equilibrium that is much lower than had there been no food there therefore the fridge compressor will have to do less work to return the fridge to the right temperature Refrigerator Solar power Fire fighting Ocean thermal energy conversion Turbofan Heat Turbojet Temperature Jet engine Nuclear power Spacecraft propulsion SR-71 Blackbird Future energy development Thermodynamics Renewable energy Insulation Energy Gas turbine Air conditioning Entropy Gas compressor Supercharger Turbocharger Axial compressor Pebble bed reactor Explosive material Internal combustion engine Water (molecule) Nuclear fusion Wind power Helium Autonomous building Nuclear thermal rocket Urban heat island Wind Circuit breaker Peltier-Seebeck effect Water vapor MOSFET Diesel engine Thermodynamic equilibrium Sun Stirling engine Humidity Phase (matter) Brazing Toyota Prius Thermoregulation Hydrogen economy Heat sink Heat capacity Warm-blooded Vacuum Heat pump Energy development Fusion power Nuclear reactor Microwave oven Gibbs free energy Evaporation Hydropower Greenhouse effect Climate change Power station Biodiesel Steam engine Geothermal exchange heat pump Transformer Temperature inversion Hydrogen HVAC Welding Ford Ranger EV Meaning Tesla coil Glass Bleed air Hot air balloon Milk Fuel injection Wind chill Carbon dioxide Swamp cooler Motor oil Thermal energy Standard enthalpy change of fusion Water Environmental concerns with electricity generation Capitalism Diffusion Door Pratt & Whitney J58 Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics Thunderstorm Alcohol fuel Brewery Climate of the United Kingdom Ceramics Action potential Severe weather terminology (United States)
