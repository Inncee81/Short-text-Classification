does a nice garden put value on your house my husband and i have put a lot of effort into our garden this year when we bourt our house last year it was a bit worse for worst and have spent a lot of time and money on it will this put value on it as a real estate agent i must say good for you yes planting gardens shrubs trees can really add value to the home you should choose several evergreens so you will have green year round plant perennials so it will not be a life long chore and expense every year annuals are great in beds and containers but try to focus more on perinnals and evergreen i have my clients plant flowers in containers by the front entrance by the way do not neglect your front door it says a lot about what is going on inside the home if it is a wood door be sure to add fresh stain as needed if it is painted be sure it is a color that flows with the exterior a red front door is always catching to the eye that is of course if it works well with the exterior color don't forget about the hardware on the door either it should be fresh and clean in appearance goodluck planting Japanese tea ceremony Plant Chatsworth House Wilton House Perennial plant Rose Hamster Grace Cossington Smith McMansion Mid-levels Australian War Memorial Flowering plant Avenue Q Bladderwort Linux Sage In-N-Out Burger Dairy Dodge Charger Social rule Christmas tree White House 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sento Wood carving Brewery Wassily Kandinsky Palace of Westminster Buckingham Palace Beverly Hills, California Carlton Gardens, Melbourne Pachypodium baronii Gardening Nintendo 64 Paint Upholstery Xanadu House Tomato Fire fighting Abbey Hellebore Atari 8-bit family W.I.T.C.H.
