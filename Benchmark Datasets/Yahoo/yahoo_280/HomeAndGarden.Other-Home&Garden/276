windmill pool took my money and refuses to complete my pool how can i get them to pay court judgement i contracted w windmill pool back in may of a year and months later they still haven't complete my pool i've fully paid windmill but i'm getting notices from subcontractors that they didn't get pay by windmill what a nightmare a shady general contractor can be tough to collect against they structure the company as a shell possesing no assets so there's no real property to seize lein you can get a lein against their bank accounts but then they just open a new account or even a new corporation it's possible for an attorney to go after the personal assets of the corporate principals but this will easily run several thousand dollars in legal fees still your first step is to talk to an attorney but be prepared for bad news depending on the size of the judgement and how slippery windmill pools is it just may not be worth pursuing unfortunately that's not the end of your headaches by paying the general contractor in full before completion of work you're double y screwed if windmill pools didn't pay their subcontractors the subs can file a workman's lein against your home and hold you liable for the work they did even though you've already paid the windmill pools again talk to an attorney there are specific time limits on when a workmans lein must be filed your best bet here is that the subs missed a key filing deadline otherwise you'll be paying for the work twice the big lesson to take away from this never pay any contractor in full in advance and only work with licensed and insured bonded contractors a legitimate contractor will carry a bond or insurance which protects you from both unpaid subs and any injuries that occur on the jobsite otherwise you're also on the hook for any work injuries insist on seeing a copy of their bond insurance and call to verify that it's current and valid also always use a payment schedule with payments tied to construction mile stones e g excavation framing and rough plumbing plaster and deck equipment and final plumbing final building inspection sign off typically these correlate to points in the building inspection process and you only pay when the building inspector has signed off on that stage of construction Insurance Mortgage Life insurance Construction Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Poker jargon Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bond United States Postal Service Taxation in the United States Corporation Money Estoppel Copyright Trademark Tax Credit card Enron Corporation Lawyer SCO-Linux controversies Annuity ITV Microeconomics Wal-Mart 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bank fraud Mechanics lien Plame affair Schabir Shaik Trial Warren Buffett Contract Bank Trade union Bank of China (Hong Kong) Attorney at Law Divorce Finance Security (finance) Probation officer Spyware Government debt Patent Workers' compensation Gold standard Copyleft Institutional fund management Surety bond Octopus card Bechtel Corporation Temasek Holdings Hedge fund Crew Exploration Vehicle Auto insurance Child support Notary public Same-sex marriage in the United States Capitalism Tennessee State Constitution Betting (poker) Software patent debate FairTax Wind turbine Blackjack Nuclear proliferation Appeal Economy of Russia Variable universal life insurance Medical prescription Unemployment Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Gambling Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Halliburton 2003 California recall Commodity markets E-mail spam OpenDocument Internet fraud Tort reform Trust (Law) non-USA Real estate broker Citigroup Health insurance Mergers and acquisitions George W.
