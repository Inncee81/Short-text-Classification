do you know about growing tomatoes i've been left house sitting for my parents and they grow a hell of a lot of tomatoes problem is i know nothing about them at all can anybody give me picking tips like what colour should they be and how long should i leave them to ripen on the windowsill thanks depending on what variety they are usually when they turn red that is the time to pick and eat them some varieties turn a lemon yellow and these will not turn red rule of thumb is when they begin to lose their firmness and just beginning to turn soft then it's time to pick them i prefer to eat and pick them when they begin to turn a pink in color and are still firm and depending on where you live if there is a danger of frost coming on throw some covering on them that will keep them going for a while when the frost gets too heavy pick all that's left and store them in a cool dry place that will not be affected by frost and they will ripen on their own and you will have tomato's long after the frosts have killed all other vegetation and the snow is on the ground good picking and have a good harvest Apple Potato Common bean Tofu Mango Loganberry Tobacco Banana Coffea arabica Ketchup Fancy rat Carnivorous plant Cuisine of Denmark Color Cheese Date Palm Peruvian cuisine Hamster Citrus Domestic rabbit Cuisine of Brazil Gatorade Peanut Textile manufacturing Maize Butter Durian Wheat Hemp Beet Leaf Basil Japanese cuisine Billiards Peach Cuisine of the Philippines Comanche Capercaillie Mario series enemies Mushroom hunting Fire hydrant Sugar beet Garden Strawberry Frost Coffea Snow Jute Sea-buckthorn Vegetarianism Organic food Acorn Physiological plant disorders Breakfast Fruit Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Bubble Bobble Cat Cannabis cultivation Aerial (dance move) Japanese tea ceremony Sundial Wine Food storage Mario Dairy Professional wrestling holds Chili con carne Pine Green Revolution Pikmin The Invisibles Knife Barley In-N-Out Burger Plantain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Traffic light Hamburger Alfalfa Avocado Weather lore Chicken Mattress Squash (fruit) Guinea pig Therion (band) Snooker Illegal drug trade Chocolate Sub-Zero Jean Grey Sin City BZFlag Cuisine of Africa Pasta Curry Mountaineering
