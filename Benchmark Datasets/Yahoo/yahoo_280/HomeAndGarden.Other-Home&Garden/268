is it bad ro run centrl a c everyday we just bought a new american standard seer air conditioner and we always keep it set around and never really turn it off it does cycle so its not continously running but i was wondering if by runnning it a lot would it wear it out faster it's just bad for the environment i usually wait until after pm to run mine so that so many won't be running at same time continuously running will wear it out faster too but if it's new then i wouldn't let that worry you it's generally storage time that is the most damaging to the machine components themselves is it a clean environment is it level running it shouldn't matter unless it's already old and needs maintenance or recharged Hard disk Toyota Prius Energy development Central processing unit Bicycle lighting Deflation (economics) Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache Stars!
