remedies for keeping flies away any remedies for keeping flies away i often like to keep the door non sliding to my balcony open the only thing is there is no screen so i hung up a lace curtain that looks pretty and keeps a lot out of the apt but when the wind blows the flies can get in and then i cannot get them out are there any remedies that you know of to keep them away i heard that in portugal they keep plastic bags filled with water up by windows and doorways to keep them at bay and it supposedly works anyone have experience with that i am open to most anything last year i lived in the same complex and only had cluster flies they like to cluster and hang out on windows they were easy to take care of i just vacuumed them up with my handheld vacuum and released them outside the water is a good idea flies are attracted to moisture this is sad but true you know when on tv you see articles on starving people and they show video you see flies all over the people's faces mouths and eyes the flies are attracted to the mouth and eyes because it is the last place with moisture the only problem with putting the bag of water out is that you should refresh it daily or you will be creating a mosquito labor and delivery room in that bag you can also hang a few sprigs of fresh mint at the door or put a large mint plant there that is what we always kept on the picnic table when i was a kid to keep them away Bong Vacuum cleaner Vacuum G-Man (Half-Life) Columbine High School massacre Professional wrestling match types Plastic The Phantom Manor Time Out of Mind Carnivorous plant Door Textile manufacturing Nepeta Carburetor Little Britain Bubble Bobble Houseplant Explosive material Skateboarding trick Mosquito Angling Salad Fingers Tea Sento STS-59 Buckingham Palace Mid-levels Comanche Vacuum tube The Star Wars Holiday Special Cathode ray tube Death Valley National Park USS Wasp (CV-7) Wood carving Tobacco Mattress Hash table Kitchen Coffee Conspiracy (TNG episode) Hay In-N-Out Burger Upholstery Floppy disk The Amber Spyglass About a Boy Stereoscopy Characters in the Smurfs The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Shoe Fire fighting The Parting of the Ways Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paragliding Dairy The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Sims 2 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Flax Cessna T-37 Blood (computer game) Mercury Atlas 6 Real Love (song) Water (molecule) Desert Las Vegas metropolitan area Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Tofu Dial M for Murder Energy development Teletubbies StarCraft: Uprising Grace Cossington Smith Suicide methods Luminiferous aether Hydroponics Fossil fuel power plant Ecco the Dolphin Max Payne Weather lore Home repair Smoke-screen Social rule Apollo Command/Service Module The Brady Bunch Cannabis cultivation YuYu Hakusho B-47 Stratojet Xanadu House Domestic rabbit Alcoholics Anonymous Jute Sonic the Hedgehog Passenger car Silent Night, Deadly Night Colonization of the Moon Bagpipes Customs and etiquette of Japan Glossary of firefighting equipment
