may the fading blooms on a healthy phalaenopsis orchid plant be removed by or not until all have faded mmm the blooms should just fall off one by one until all you are left is the branch which they grew on the orchid you should have the branch cut but leave buds on that branch usually there are a few buds closer to the plant on the branch and the plant will send more blooms from the buds there if it feels like the branch can be trimmed when it becomes yellow and brittle signifying the plant has recovered all of it's nutrients from it so then you can safely cut the branch off Orchidaceae Phalaenopsis Dendrobium Bud Pruning fruit trees Bonsai Vanda Illegal drug trade Physiological plant disorders Leaf Olive Flowering plant Pansy Cymbidium Auxin Eutrophication Cypripedium Darwin from Orchids to Variation Nutrient Root Wisteria Peanut Eucalyptus Pachypodium brevicaule Weed control Bamboo Carnivorous plant Sunflower Logging Pollination Hippeastrum Apical dominance Apricot Comfrey Pine Aloe Bladderwort Cannabis cultivation Gypsy moth Sassafras Oat Chronic fatigue syndrome Gooseberry Perfume Jute Perennial plant DNA repair Stamen Johannes Jacobus Smith Vanilla Apple Houseplant Pachypodium bicolor Lawn mower Alkane Prunus Carbon dioxide sink Rice Pinophyta Steel Chlorophyta Phragmipedium Grafting Tulip Budding Glastonbury Abbey Tea Laelia Pachypodium ambongense Ginger Titan arum Fruit tree propagation Nepenthes Peach Date Palm Monofloral honey Rose Hydroponics Dactylorhiza Sugarcane European Beech Sewage treatment Cocaine Pollinator decline Potato Sabre Wulf Green roof KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1994 Elodea Minor characters in Bloom County Ivysaur Hen and chicks Fertilizer Wall Street (movie) Pachypodium key to species Jellyfish Biological pest control Sugar beet Fish farming
