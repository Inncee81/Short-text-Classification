i have canna plants i bought these for the first time this spring they have been left in the pots and have bloomed and rebloomed i need to know what is meant by dead heading also i have found small pods that are fully of small black seeds can these be harvested and replanted in the spring if so how do i go about keeping them over the winter do they need to be dried out i could just put them in a jar but i think thry would mold the plants i bought were very expensive so if i could use these seeds that would be great if they are usable then how do i start them indoors next spring thanks for all answers dead heading is cutting off the exhausted blooms the pods are filled with seeds harvest them just before they 'pop' you can do that by putting a small paper bag over the pod after the flower is done put a twisty or a rubber band on the bag to hold it and catch the seeds do not dead head until the pod pops check the in the bag every two or three days the paper bag will allow air to circulate and if you take it off once in a while it will not mold when the pod does pop keep the seeds in a pie pan saucer unused ash tray one thing good you can use it for or anything flat with a small lip when the seeds have been in there for a week or so they should be dried enough to put them in a white envelope and label it species and date good luck Cannabis cultivation Common bean Peanut Flax Pea Comfrey Tea Illegal drug trade Textile manufacturing Kudzu Weed control Hamster Wood Maize Stratification (botany) Black pepper Hemp Flowering plant Hippeastrum Alfalfa Casting American Black Bear Wheat Garden Strawberry Jute Sugarcane Vanilla Fancy rat Carnivorous plant Hydroponics Tobacco Bean Flower Wisteria Ham Bladderwort Bamboo Hay Mushroom hunting Sunflower Christmas tree Bonsai Eucalyptus Blood (computer game) Japanese tea ceremony Clover Mattress Tulip Floppy disk Olive Begonia Diseases of the honeybee Dill Sugar beet Customs and etiquette of Japan Apple Apricot Plastic Ecco the Dolphin Fujian tea ceremony Campfire Pachypodium brevicaule Upholstery Pinophyta Diving cylinder Japanese funeral Daylily The Amber Spyglass Tlingit Barley Bong Pine Pysanka Banksia Coffee Chinese tallow Tofu Air pollution Billboard Hot 100 Dairy The Ashes Rambutan Death Valley National Park Futurama (TV series - season 2) Plant I Ching divination Pachypodium bicolor Orchidaceae Ocean's Twelve Coffea arabica CPU cache Idli Biblical inerrancy Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Spinach
