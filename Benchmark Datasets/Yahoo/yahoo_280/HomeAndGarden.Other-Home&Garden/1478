alright there's a bat flying around my apartment any suggestions on how to get rid of it and no i'm not in there right now this is the second time in a year this has happened i live in a very old section of the city and tenants in this building leave their large windows wide open so they just fly in which i don't do i didn't think a bat could crawl in to my place underneath the door but i witnessed one doing exactly that firsthand i'm petrified of these things but i would like to avoid calling an exterminator if at all possible does anyone have any ideas on how to get rid of this thing myself is there anything they are attracted to that i could use to lure it out of my place and into the hallway any ideas will be greatly appreciated jay ball i had to stop by the office so i'm posting this from work and if the bat is looking for young blood it could do better than what's coursing through my year old veins the blood bank is right down the street though i did get a chuckle from your response thanks thanks so much for all of your answers usually bats will not bother you if you don't bother them it's when he changes into dracula is the time to worry when that happens he's just after some young blood and look on the bright side you'll have immortality or when you notice the transformation run don't walk to the nearest blood bank he'll have a field day there and you'll have plenty of time to get home and lock up all the doors and windows hold on is this a joke how did you post this if not at home Dairy Coffee Cruising (maritime) Solar power Autonomous building Hamster Wheel of Fortune Renewable energy Dishwasher Sport utility vehicle Kitchen Billboard Hot 100 Poker jargon Thermostat Personal finance Wood fuel Carbon dioxide Fire fighting Cat Tofu Sento Vacuum tube Fancy rat Furnace Tattoo Friends Hydrogen economy Tea Energy development Internal ballistics Wind turbine Heat EastEnders Fecal incontinence Cannabis cultivation Bond Textile manufacturing Credit card Welding Betting (poker) Charles Ponzi Personal rapid transit Characters in the Smurfs MapleStory Spark plug Warren Buffett Transformer Jet engine Sears Holdings Corporation Monetary policy Insurance Hybrid vehicle Thermal power station Climate change Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tire Car handling Urban heat island Bong Instant coffee Fuel cell Solar panel Doug Illegal drug trade Japanese tea ceremony Elis Prefecture Bread Breakfast Genericized trademark Treasury security HVAC Marine aquarium Ramen Electronic commerce Neopets Cuisine of Denmark Swimming pool Energy Air conditioning Diesel engine Refrigerator Procter & Gamble Houseplant Social Security debate (United States) Hot air balloon Explosive material Water FairTax
