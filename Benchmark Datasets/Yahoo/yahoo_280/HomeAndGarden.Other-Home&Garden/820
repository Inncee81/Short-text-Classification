how to make my room cooler i'm living off campus for the first time and the family i'm living with has a very old home the room i'm staying in has two windows side by side it is a full length window but not the nice kind the old not classic beautiful kind there people do not update their home at all i have a window air conditioner in right now but because its a full length window its all the way at the bottom near the floor the side of the house that i'm on gets little to no breeze of any kind so my room is always hot and stuffy when i run the air conditioner for mins the bottom of the room cools down but since my bed is very elevated to my chest i'm hot whenever i'm laying on it which is a lot considering the bed acts as a couch too i've tried turning the knob that diverts the air from the air conditioner in different directions but nothing that will reach upwards is there anything i could buy or make cheaply that could divert the air upwards so the whole room can stay cool thanks first get some m window covers the plastic kind that seal widows off make sure the blinds are always down too then buy a cheap box fan and set it at an angle under the a c unit to blow the air towards you this will help more than a 'diverter' because the better circulation will make it seem cooler in the room than it really is good luck Solar power Poker jargon Basement Professional wrestling throws Equine conformation Thermal power station Brewery Seismic retrofit Bong Convection HVAC Fan (implement) Mattress Fast bowling Customs and etiquette of Japan Hot air balloon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Naval mine Monsoon Climate of the United Kingdom Swamp cooler Betting (poker) Professional wrestling holds Stairway Glossary of firefighting equipment GunBound Harmonica Motor oil Passenger car McMansion Sento Furnace Glossary of nautical terms Japanese tea ceremony Engine cooling Autonomous building The Ersatz Elevator Plastic Anchor Milton H.
