what would be a good price to charge for raking a lawn becasue i was thinking of raking lawns for some money this fall they are standard size neighborhood lawns what to charge for front only back only or front and back i would bring my own garbage bags and rake for the leaves also what would be a good price for gardening this would be like watering flowers weeding gardens etc you should figure out how long you think it will take you to do the area and then multiply it by what you want to make i would say around an hour since it will probably be cash then add in the cost of any materials you need like the leaf bags you need those in most towns not just garbage bags and that will give you the price after the first one or two you will get a feel for how long it will take and be able to adjust your price accordingly for gardening i would figure out a price per square foot of gardens that the person has so you roughly measure all their gardens and figure out the area and then charge by that so if it was a vegetable garden feet long by feet deep that's square feet you could maybe charge something like cents a square foot or for weeding and go up or down from there depending on how many weeds there are the bottom line is that the market will set your prices for you that means if they are too high you won't have any business if they are too low you'll have too much business to handle and you'll be able to raise the prices to get to a manageable level the best way to learn is to do a few jobs and then see how it goes if people start spreading the word and you get lots of work raise your hourly rate a little if no one's hiring you drop it down good luck Poker jargon Inflation Microeconomics Wal-Mart Gross domestic product Illegal drug trade Labor theory of value Keynesian economics Mattress Labour economics Lawn Bond Deflation (economics) Chopper (motorcycle) Tax PE ratio Brewery Glossary of wildland fire terms Tennis Free trade Sears Holdings Corporation Chair View camera Euro Monopoly (game) Economy of Russia Anchor Monetary policy Ra (board game) Japanese tea ceremony Microsoft Solar cell Unemployment Mutual fund Warren Buffett Oscilloscope Minimum wage Tesco United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Bong FairTax Urban sprawl Petroleum Economics Value added tax Comfrey United States dollar Australian War Memorial E85 Gold standard Professional wrestling attacks Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Capital controversy Economic inequality Natural monopoly Wall Street Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Explosive material Monopoly Drill bit Hot air balloon Dog agility Contredanse Price discrimination Cost accounting Stairway Equine conformation $ale of the Century Rebreather The Apprentice 2 Tariff Gravity Just In Time Productive and unproductive labour IPod Car handling Surplus value Soil pH Ryanair New Deal Irrigation Gasoline Corporate finance Vegetation Caddy Hydroponics Organic food Mount Pinatubo London Congestion Charge Indian Railways
