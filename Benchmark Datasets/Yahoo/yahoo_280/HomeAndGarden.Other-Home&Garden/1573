what is the best option for swimming pool safety swimming pool covers nets or fences it really is best to use several layers of protection locking gates fences covers pool alarms are all important but it's best to have a backup in case one fails gates not latching power failures kids being able to climb fences etc most places these days call for fencing around the pool anyway so i would probably go with the one that would stop a child or pets from getting into the pool altogether a safety cover fences can be climbed over and alarms can fail and they dont go off until something has already happened but a properly installed safety cover will be able to stop anything from going into the pool at all they're probably the most expensive and the most time consuming to take on and off but that's what i'd recommend if you're going for the most peace of mind Floristry Charlotte, North Carolina Bulk vending Target Corporation Sears Holdings Corporation Cooperative Extreme Programming Shopping mall Wal-Mart Chinatowns in North America Microeconomics Indianapolis, Indiana Flower Supermarket Urban sprawl Retailer W.
