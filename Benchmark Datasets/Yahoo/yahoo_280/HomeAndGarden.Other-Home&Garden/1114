japanese beetles i have green bean plants in my garden with japanese beetles all over them they are eating the leaves completely off are there any natural remedies to get rid of the little pests what can i do to get rid of them before they ruin my plants least toxic japanese beetle controls there aren t many natural controls for adult japanese beetles birds aren t partial to them and although some predatory wasps and flies have been imported their population isn t large enough yet to control the japanese beetle problem the most effective natural control is to go into your garden with a jar of soapy water and knock the beetles into it japanese beetles feed in groups starting at the top of plants so it s actually pretty easy to fill a jar with them insecticidal soap will kill adult japanese beetles is sprayed directly on the beetle it does not have any residual effect meaning that beetles that aren t sprayed directly won t be harmed a word of caution about the pheromone beetle traps they will attract beetles but you ll probably wind up with more beetles coming into your yard than you would have without the trap the original intention of the traps was to track when and how many japanese beetles were in the area not as a means of eradication finally if you have repeated intense infestations you should check your soil in late summer to see if you have a large grub population lift a sq ft section of turf if there are more than a dozen grubs in this small area consider treating your lawn with some type of grub control however not every garden that has a japanese beetle problem is associated with a lawn full of grubs the beetles can hatch in your neighbors lawn and find your tasty garden with very little effort more toxic controls to be used with caution there are several insecticides labeled for use on adult japanese beetles including bayer advanced garden multi insect killer concentrate carbaryl sevin neem extracts orthene ortho bug b gon garden landscape insect killer concentrate orthene turf tree ornamental insecticide spectracide bug stop multi purpose insect control concentrate spectracide triazicide soil turf insect killer concentrate these sprays will kill on contact and also have some residual effect keep in mind that these sprays will kill more than just the japanese beetles so use them only for extreme infestations and again japanese beetles are only a pest for a little over a month so don t over react always read and follow label directions when using any pesticide Mosquito Organic farming Pesticide Insecticide Carnivorous plant DDT Lawn Pesticide toxicity to bees Spider Organic horticulture Weed control Pollinator decline Cockchafer Herbicide Gaucho (insecticide) Bedbug Ant Ladybird Red imported fire ant Irrigation Agriculture Coffee Invasive species in Australia Apple Malaria Chicken Green Revolution Rapeseed Desert locust Pesticide poisoning Hydroponics Organic food Pest control Sewage treatment Zerg Gooseberry Thermal power station Hamster Acorn Honeybee Tobacco Deadly nightshade Vermicompost Weed Colorado potato beetle Neem Cycad Anopheles Cochineal Stag beetle Tick Garden Strawberry Golf Theory of conduct Venus Flytrap Essential oil Japanese beetle Shotgun Banksia Fauna of Australia Waste management Air pollution Gardening Naruto jutsu Spruce Budworm Carbon dioxide Bagworm moth Biodynamic agriculture Quake III Arena Chagas disease Codename: Kids Next Door Lumber Alkane Glossary of wildland fire terms Hedgehog Xeriscaping Eutrophication Central Park Sulfur Scale insect Fire extinguisher Bark beetle Organic gardening Blood (computer game) Sexual dimorphism Blood II: The Chosen Food and Drug Administration
