help bird of paradise despair i live in florida my huband bought me a beautiful bird of paradise plant this past mother's day this plant was purchased at a flower shop supposedly facing a southern exposure i placed it in my house in a ceiling to floor window facing north i'm not a plant novice so this one has me perplexed it has started to decline and it seems that everything i'm reading regarding their care is controversial should they be watered deeply and allowed to dry out or should they be kept moist should they have bright light or full sun i've since moved it outside in some sun but the leaves are now starting to curl bird of paradise are very awsome plants they can get very tall and have giant leaves so i suggest having it outside in partial shade to part sun in a warm area if you are going to have it in a pot make sure it is a very big one because the roots are big and grow fast because the plant does get very big and keep the soil well moist i have some and i water them every day in the afternoon until the soil gets nice and soaked the leaves are doing very good too Houseplant Carnivorous plant Garden Strawberry Hippeastrum Tobacco Orchidaceae Leaf Begonia Black pepper Cannabis cultivation Bonsai Solar power Tea Sunflower Pysanka Tillandsia Banksia Japanese tea ceremony Gooseberry Hydroponics Climate of the United Kingdom Flax Textile manufacturing European Beech Chicken Desert Wildfire Bamboo Passive solar Wetland Tree Florida Keys Las Vegas metropolitan area Sento Venus Flytrap Pachypodium Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Date Palm Apple Comfrey Stratification (botany) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Hamster Deadly nightshade Smilax Earthworm Monarda Thermoregulation $ale of the Century Sorghum Opportunity rover Peanut Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Lighting Sunlight Carbon dioxide Muir Woods National Monument Jute Pinophyta Absinth Wormwood Ficus elastica Weed control Weather lore Phalaenopsis Pachypodium habitats Pine Hemp Nuclear power Grand Teton National Park Sequoia Pachypodium ambongense Brugmansia Australasia ecozone Comanche Prosopis cineraria Caatinga Coffee Irrigation Giant Sequoia Wayne Corporation Sugar beet The Time Machine Cycad Soil Photosynthesis Vermicompost Flowering plant Plant Wheat Carbon dioxide sink Peach Simone Weil Ogasawara Islands Sun Seismic retrofit Liriodendron New Zealand flax Platypus Olive
