can houseflies enter your home through house plants my mother died weeks ago i brought home all the plants from her funeral days ago today when i got home there were at least a dozen house flies in my window the only thing different is the introduction of the house plants i did repot a spider plant a few days ago but it went from one pot to a brand new pot so i doubt that is it it makes me wonder where the heck they came from and the only thing i can think of is the plants from what i hear the gestation period for flies hatching is days so it appears to me maybe eggs were laid in one of the plants since i only got them days ago this could be why i haven't seen any before i like the plants and don't really want to get rid of them if this is my problem is there any way to make sure there is are no live eggs in the plants so i don't see any new flies i want to avoid any new flies thanks flies can lay their eggs in the soil of the plants Housefly Beetle Bonsai Sexual reproduction Houseplant Gypsy moth Kakapo Egg (biology) Shark Chicken Biological pest control Egg (food) Frog Blonde on Blonde Insect Pregnancy Aphid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Flowering plant Minor Harry Potter Beasts The chicken or the egg Sharon Tate Miscarriage Rosa Parks Hamster The Amber Spyglass The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy I Want to Hold Your Hand Cockroach Ovum Platypus Spider Earth Earthworm Head louse Social rule Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Conker's Bad Fur Day The Fens Weed control Theory of conduct Capercaillie Saturniidae Pea Fly Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Origin belief Leo Frank Plant Ocean's Twelve Devonian Syphon Filter Red imported fire ant Ladybird Geology of the Grand Canyon area Sleeping Murder Blow-fly Pysanka Vegetarianism Bart the Mother Eggerland series Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Anopheles Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Jumpstart 3rd Grade W.
