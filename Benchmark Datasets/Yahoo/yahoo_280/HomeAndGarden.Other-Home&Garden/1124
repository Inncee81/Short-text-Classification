what can i use to kill ants i've had those ants a few times over the years it always seems no matter how clean you keep your kitchen or elsewhere they still seem to come but i've been able to safely get rid of them for years at a time by doing the following old time remedy i also suspect this would be a good solution for outdoor ants as well just so long it wasn't raining during the few days of treatment get a cheap bottle of boric acid powder a very mild and safe form of ant control you can get at places like home depot and lowes in the pest control section next to the gardening supplies also get a small container of mint jelly from the grocery store i found it at albertsons grocery store mix two tablespoons boric acid powder per ounces of mint apple jelly take a thin piece of cardboard or a doubled over piece of paper and tape it firmly against part of the surface such as a counter directly over the pathway the ants are using and make thin rows of the boric acid jelly solution on it with enough space between the rows for the ants to get between so that as many of the ants have access to the edges of the jelly as possible some will get stuck in the jelly but many will take bits of this stuff back to their nest and feed it to the rest of the colony and queen you may have to replace the paper or cardboard with fresh jelly daily for or days and then they'll be gone for good by the way you may actually see more ants in the first hours after you first put the boric acid jelly out but then it tapers down quickly during the nd day because they begin dying as they take the stuff back to their colony the way the stuff works is that it dehydrates them from the inside out Diseases of the honeybee Boric acid Bread Dairy Ant Drill bit Plastic Water Milk Internal ballistics Breastfeeding Gramophone record Gypsy moth Mattress Cochineal Hard disk Coffee Candidiasis Bulk vending Food preservation SimAnt Tea Apple CPU cache Plastic bag Floppy disk Cookware and bakeware Japanese tea ceremony Cocaine Cell (biology) Fancy rat Sulfuric acid Medical prescription Boron Poker jargon Bee Origin of life Energy development Flax Carbon dioxide Soil pH Domestic rabbit Caffeine Olive oil Titanium Chopsticks Atari 8-bit family M16 (rifle) Protein-energy malnutrition Cremation Psoriasis LSD Bong Wal-Mart Water (molecule) Heinkel He 100 Redundant array of independent disks Strap-on dildo Thermal power station Menstrual cup Nitrocellulose Seismic retrofit Tooth Illegal drug trade Acid Ammonia Mouth ulcer Water purification Christmas tree Brewery Boy's surface Red imported fire ant Turquoise Commodore 64 Bedbug Alcohol fuel Glass Tofu Diving suit Handloading Welding Vinegar Doughnut Printed circuit board Beehive (beekeeping) Canadian dollar Irrigation
