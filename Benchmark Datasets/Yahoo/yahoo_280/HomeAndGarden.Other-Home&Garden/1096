why does my shower water turn cold when a toilet is flushed i can be taking a nice relaxing shower and bam someone flushes a toilet in another bathroom and the hot water vanishishes it stays cold until the toilet tank is refilled about a minute or two why does the toilet need my hot water it's a cold water device i've been in other showers at other's houses and the water becomes scolding when a toilet is flush that to me makes more sense because the toilet is drawing away cold water for itself leaving nothing but hot but that's not the case in my house why one of two reasons inside your shower are two safety devices a low pressure device that detects water pressure so that the heater cannot be on with no water inside the tank an anti scalding device switches off the heater if the temperature goes too high stopping you getting scalded when the toilet is flushed the cistern is lower than your shower so the water finds it easier to come out of the lower outlet reducing the water pressure significantly device cuts in as water flows into your toilet cistern there is less water to go through your shower slowing the flow means less water is in contact with the heater but for a longer time thus raising the temperature beyond the safe limit device hope that explains it lock the bathroom doors b taking a shower andy Flush toilet Japanese toilet Autonomous building Thermal power station Siphon Fire fighting Brewery Toilet Plumbing fixture Toilet paper Diode Sewage treatment Sento Solar power Bathroom Naval mine Fossil fuel power plant Menstrual cup Furnace Sauna Rebreather Steam engine Carburetor Washroom HVAC Heat Diving regulator Poker jargon Jet engine Circuit breaker Diesel engine Cold fusion Residual-current device Urinal Fecal incontinence Basement Cruising (maritime) Drowning Vacuum tube Apollo 13 Spacecraft propulsion Glossary of firefighting equipment Urination Rail terminology Temperature Urinary incontinence Bathing Water heater Coffee Items in the Metroid series Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carbon dioxide Nuclear fusion Water Welding Avalanche Internal ballistics Redundant array of independent disks Solar panel Firearm Portable stove Neutrino Vacuum Hot air balloon Toyota Prius Bong STS-62 Iowa class battleship Hypertension Casting Glossary of firefighting terms Sin City Swimming pool Hyperthermia Severe weather terminology (United States) Turbocharger Water (molecule) Yerba mate Soldering Air conditioning Suicide methods Transistor Sailing Land mine Energy development Toilet humour Peltier-Seebeck effect CPU cache Radioisotope thermoelectric generator
