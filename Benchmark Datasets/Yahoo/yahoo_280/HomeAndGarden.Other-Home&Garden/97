why do cfl's take about half a second to turn on but normal bulbs are instant on every single cfl that i own that is watts or under is not instant on the package claims that it is instant on but it is not why is this i own two watt bulbs and one of them is instant on i'm really puzzled because i thought that if one of the watts was instant on then the both should be most of my bulbs are the same brand ge but three bulbs are from sylvania please explain thanks most of the new cfl's are almost instant on they work by emmission of free electrons which colide with mercury molecules that in turn emit ultra violet photons the ultra violet photons colide with the fluorescent powder which coats the inside of the tube when this collision occurrs visible light is emmitted it takes a very small amount for this process to start incadescent bulbs on the other hand have a filament which heats to white hot and emmits visible light this takes much less time than the cfl the trade off is less cost with cfl's and less heat produced incadence bulbs use over of the electricity to produce heat good luck Incandescent light bulb Fluorescent lamp Compact fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Vacuum tube Headlight Ultraviolet Light Diode Electrodeless lamp Laser X-ray Lighting Mercury-vapor lamp Temperature Vacuum Bicycle lighting Heat Spectroscopy Sun Solar cell Transformer Electromagnetic spectrum Lightning Mercury (element) X-ray tube Mercury arc valve Photometry (optics) Neutrino Ionizing radiation Titanium Phosphorus Photoelectric effect Hydrogen Quantum mechanics Stage lighting Aurora (astronomy) Speed of light Aluminium Circuit design Electromagnetic spectroscopy Tungsten Crookes radiometer Electrophysiology Spacecraft propulsion Gamma ray burst Coffee Chemoluminescence Mass spectrometry Color Planetary nebula Phosphorescence Cold cathode Traffic light Electronic amplifier Electrical element Quantum dot Carbon dioxide Gamma ray Instant coffee Rayleigh scattering Solar power Beryllium Spectral line Solar panel Transistor Laser diode Corrosion Microwave oven Big Bang Brewery Biophoton Double-slit experiment Color temperature Spark gap Nuclear fission Uranium Corona discharge Explosive material Internal ballistics Normal distribution Sulfur Comet Future energy development Thermal power station Joseph Swan Cathode Black hole H II region Air conditioning Carbon
