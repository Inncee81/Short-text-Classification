has anyone installed an above ground pool i want to put a deck around an above ground pool and i dont want to place the pool until i figure out the layout are there deck and poolinstallers who do it all for you best answer so far but i just dont want to set it up and find that the placement is awkward to build around or that it will cost more in materials because of unecessary wastage of lumber due to poor planning you are doing it wrong once the pool is installed design your deck the pool itself will open you up to more ideas the installers don't do decks unless one of them do it on the side Elevator West Side Highway Yu-Gi-Oh!
