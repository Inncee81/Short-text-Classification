how do you treat hard water for use in a hot tub i have a very hard time getting the water right in my hot tub the ph is high and the water turns rusty after so many chemicals are poured in the hot tub is for people and i think holds gallons but am not sure because it was here when i bought the house i really want to use it often but can not figure out this water situation we too moved into a home that all ready had a hot tub in it i found the best thing is to have your water tested most hot tub places will do this for free you just have to go in and get a test kit from them the test it for free so you will buy the products they recommend but remember you don't have to once you know what your water needs shop around some times they have the best deals some times they don't ask about buying in larger containers like five gallon buckets of chlorine these are usually much cheaper and last longer if you don't know of a hot tub place in your area look in the yellow pages or on line Dishwasher Swimming pool Bong Hot tub Casting Homebrewing Hard water Sento Hydrogen peroxide Plastic Sauna Chlorine Dairy Textile manufacturing Dishwashing Marine aquarium Fire extinguisher Top-bar hive Grog Survival skills Billboard Hot 100 Pebble bed reactor Titanium Tattoo Coffee Jackass: The Movie Brewery Motor oil Hydrogen economy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Water (molecule) Solar power Biodiesel Water purification Bathing Spacecraft propulsion Milk Penske Racing Diving Stirling engine Fossil fuel power plant Gay bathhouse Microeconomics Yerba mate Concrete Sea-Monkey Bottled water Agar plate Sears Holdings Corporation Sewage treatment IBM PC compatible The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Treehouse of Horror VII Have I Got News For You Illegal drug trade Glossary of wildland fire terms Toyota Prius E85 Onsen Polypropylene A Tale of a Tub Philosophy of space and time Menstrual cup Volcano Maple syrup Wood pulp United States Postal Service Urban beach Haloalkane Fire fighting Ozone layer Car handling Cruising (maritime) Sulfuric acid Anne Murray Radon Fixed-wing aircraft Airport Cold fusion Ice cream Menstrual cycle Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Steel Punt (boat) Alcohol fuel Ammonia Wine making Chronic fatigue syndrome Disinfection Zuiderzee Works Theory of conduct Sugar substitute Firefighter Hot rod Incineration Pottery Pile Internal ballistics 1,4-dichlorobenzene
