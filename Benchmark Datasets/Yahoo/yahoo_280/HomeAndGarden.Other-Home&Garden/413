can an electric stove emit carbon monoxide hello our neighbor who lives right downstairs has an electric stove one night he started cooking something on the stove but then forgot about it and went to bed several hours later around am in the morning we wake up with a horrible smell and some smoke in our apartment the fire department arrived shortly afterwards and forced their way into our neighbors' apartment downstairs and sure enough it was filled up with smoke as well even though he somehow did not wake up we have a pregnant family member so we are a bit concerned about co poisoning my question is could cookware forgotten on an electric stove emit carbon monoxide in general what produces carbon monoxide will any fire have a byproduct of co and does co tend to move up because it is lighter than air and finally any ideas how much of an exposure to co starts to become a problem for a fetus thank you the previous answers have addressed the co occurrence fairly well co is produced by the combustion rapid oxidation of any substance smoke contains co when temperatures are equal co is heavier than the atmosphere and will seek the lowest level however under fire conditions co will rise with the smoke and other heated gases if you had smoke in your apartment you had co as well as far as your pregnant family member or any of you co exposure is cumulative that is the longer you are exposed the greater the risk short term exposure to low levels of co less than ppm is considered non hazardous the higher the concentration and the longer the exposure the higher the risk becomes your primary considerations for health should be were any symptoms present headaches flushing of the skin red color flu like symptoms what was the term of exposure what was the concentration of co that the person received co binds the hemoglobin and displaces oxygen co is difficult to displace allowing oxygen to re enter the blood stream if any symptoms are or were present please see your doctor Tobacco smoking Decompression sickness Explosive material Air pollution Hydrogen Hydrogen sulfide Hemoglobin Carburetor Carbon monoxide Welding Alcohol fuel Oxygen Hydrogen economy Cyanide Benzene Internal combustion engine Pulmonary alveolus Alkane Carbon monoxide poisoning Sewage treatment Gasoline Ozone depletion Coal Fire fighting Gas metal arc welding Rebreather Haloalkane Plutonium Combustion Ammonia Glossary of firefighting terms Fire Phosphorus Coffee Titanium Incandescent light bulb Ozone hole Helium Nuclear power Technetium Aspartame Methanol Biofuel Beryllium Pebble bed reactor Methamphetamine Radon Malaria Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Mercury (element) Nitrous oxide Fire extinguisher Chlorine Uranium Diesel engine Sun Pneumonia Automobile emissions control Water (molecule) Poison Sauna Smoke-screen Suicide methods Breathing gas Renewable energy Energy development Thermal power station Cannabis (drug) Thimerosal Corrosion Miscarriage Formaldehyde Sulfur Oxy-fuel welding and cutting First aid Ultraviolet Dioxin Jet engine Asthma Acetic acid Alcohol Gasification E85 Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Arc welding Psoriasis Stove Earth's atmosphere Traumatic brain injury
