how can i squirrel proof my existing bird feeders i have two bird feeders that suction onto the windows of my second floor apartment recently at least one squirrel has discovered them i saw one climbing up the side of the house house has wood not vinyl siding to get at the feeders and it proceeded to knock them to the ground i didn't think squirrels could ever get to the feeders what can i do well that is the question of the century d squirrels are just too clever in finding a way in i don't think it's possible my advice is to use foods that squirrels might simply consider unworthy of such herculean efforts in my yard a lot of safflower seed is provided to the great satisfaction of cardinals chickadees titmice and other species that winter in the area but to less favorable reviews from the local squirrel population niger thistle is a food of choice for the local goldfinches and others of their kind while the squirrels disdain it completely suet cakes left out for the nuthatches and woodpeckers are rarely molested by my squirrels although what the crows do to these is another matter on the large platform that is especially intended for mourning doves and house finches a mixture of white millet seed and others is served which seems to raise little interest from the squirrels in the neighborhood Garbage truck Dustbin Dumpster diving Landfill Jackass: The Movie Debris Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Equine conformation Textile manufacturing Trash of the Titans Wood fuel Wood Shoe Christmas tree Airbag Animal Crossing Glossary of climbing terms Back to the Future Illegal drug trade Skinny Dip The Contender (television series) Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling match types Canasta Biff Tannen The Star Wars Holiday Special Stephen King Rigging Truck Knots Landing Hay Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City EastEnders Archery Kitesurfing Skateboard Collyer brothers Happy Tree Friends White trash USS West Virginia (BB-48) Shotgun Piccolo Junior Saga Deforestation Waste Snow removal Hubert H.
