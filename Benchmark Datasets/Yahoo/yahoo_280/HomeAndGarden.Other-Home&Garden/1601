any help with a hard to get at hornets nest they've managed to paper a nest onto the joints up underneath our deck i have no means of getting to them other than unscrewing and removing the deck planks but i think that if i do this they'll come out at me any thoughts solutions the local exterminator basically wanted our first born as payment so forget that help this can be dangerous but i have done it before and i never got stung however be careful if you decide to do this first do this at night when it is really dark get rubber gloves duct tape a stick ' or so with a nail with its head cut off on one end two cans of wasp hornet nest destroyer they sell those cans that shoot stream and a mosquito net dress in several layers of cloths sweaters pants and socks tape the ends of the gloves to the wrists of the sweater tape the cuffs of your pants to your socks and make sure the headnet covers your head and neck and is secure second make everything dark if possible around your area and make sure all open windows in your home are closed third get two powerful flashlights place them at a distance away from the area and you about ft or away and aim them at the area pf the nest then unscrew the deckplates if this disturbs the hornets they should go for the light source and you can safely retreat if there seems to be no activity proceed if you manage to get the deck plates up and you see the nest give the nest a quick poke with the nail end of the stick and immediately start to spray where you poked the hole give it a good soaking with a wasp hornet nest spray don't stop until you empty the whole can into the poked hole when the can is empty leave the area for mins so the poison takes effect leave the flashlights alone and come back see if there are any hornets around the flashlights there may be a few around the lights if there are none just listen if you hear a hum then you know the nest is quite active if you don't hear a hum the hornets are mostly dead you make need to give the nest hole another soaking thats why i recommend two cans good luck and be careful p s you dont want to spray into the hole where they enter exit because of the inside structure of the nest thats why you poke the hole and shoot the can into the hole Hosta Flower Bamboo Kudzu Comfrey Plant Philipp Franz von Siebold Fruit tree propagation Typha Banksia Grafting Orchidaceae Alfalfa Flowering plant Garden Strawberry Trichome Auxin Pollination Monarda Carnivorous plant Vanilla Agavaceae Pinophyta Pachypodium bicolor Tobacco Alder Pollen Pachypodium baronii Bee Apple Perfume Jute Wood carving Pachypodium brevicaule Pachypodium ambongense Kiwifruit Deforestation Wisteria Fruit Hemp Biological pest control Peanut Eucalyptus Coffea arabica Hop (plant) Honey Flax Magnolia Iris (plant) Blackberry Dandelion Burdock Begonia Smilax Super Mario Bros.
