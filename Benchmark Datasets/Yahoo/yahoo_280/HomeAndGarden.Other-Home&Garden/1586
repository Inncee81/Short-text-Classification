wanting to add kitchen bar drain to finished basement i am in the planning and layout stage of finishing my basement the basement is roughed in for a bathroom and i am going to put in a full bath in and i am also wanting to put in a seperate bar kitchen area in a seperate part of the basement away from the bathroom i will be installing a kitchen sink with drain and supply lines in the bar kitchen can i vent this bar kitchen sink through the vent stack that is going to be venting the same drain lines in the bathroom i know that i will have to run quite a bit of vent line to meet this since it is going to be far away from the source is this the easiest way to vent the kitchen bar sink i wonder if this is code compliant thanks there is a limit on how far you can run the pipe for the vent depending on how you configure your floor plan you may have to use a stooter vent under the sink this type vent is very inexpensive and simple to install lowes home depot stock them Greenhouse Cucumber Pollination Tomato Weed Agriculture Hydroponics Larry the Cucumber Market gardening Genetically modified food Organic food Agriculture in Hong Kong Basil Weed control Pollinator decline Gardening Uneconomic growth Biological pest control Luther Burbank Ketchup Darwin from Orchids to Variation Solar variation Pickling Deforestation History of ecology Gyros VeggieTales Mandrake (plant) Carnivorous plant Kyoto Protocol Global cooling Greenhouse gas Climate change Salad Fish farming Isle of Wight River Clyde Global warming and agriculture Carbon dioxide sink Permaculture Science fiction Growing degree day Greenhouse effect Carbon dioxide Chatsworth House Russian cuisine Pollinator Stack (computing) Varda, Greece Gazpacho Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Greece Lois Hole Gush Katif Hamster Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University History of Church End Finchley Garlic Cuisine of the Philippines Harry Blackmun Hot dog Sea cucumber The Crystal Palace Henry W.
