will a slightly bent key still work in a lock my key to my building's front door stopped working it still works in the back door though and no one else seems to be having trouble with the front door so i doubt it's a problem with the lock it's a double cut key cut on both sides and i noticed that it's slightly bent could the slight bend account for this problem if so how does one go about straightening the key without breaking it my landlord's a pain to deal with so i'd rather try to fix it myself if i can i can't make a duplicate key or it least it says i can't if you dont have any tools take it to a key shop and explain the problem they can flatten it and touch it up with a wire wheel have an extra made while your there if you have a vise try putting the key between two blocks of wood and squeeze if you only have a hammer and a block of wood lay the key on the wood and tap it flat cant be bent too bad if it fits in the other door good luck Flush toilet Siphon Japanese toilet Plumbing fixture Urinal Toilet humour Sewage treatment Sewage collection and disposal Sewer Toilet Menstrual cup Domestic water system Autonomous building Toilet paper Greywater Rice pudding Dennis Nilsen Campsite Thomas Crapper Composting toilet Toilet-related injury Swimming pool Pit toilet Septic tank Sea-Monkey Jennings Randolph Lake Coriolis effect Russian joke The Great Stink Cold Stone Creamery Water supply Squat toilet Kennington Park Bong Mad Money Washroom Sea water Water Anacostia River River Thames Basement Kitchen Oreo Tap water Maple syrup Nutmeg Futurama (TV series - season 2) Reclaimed water Cat 1,4-dichlorobenzene Tampon Urban legend Carburetor Flatulence RuneScape Mini-Games Preston, Minnesota Hard water Super Bowl Coconut crab Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Urinary incontinence Conker's Bad Fur Day Thermal power station Rebreather Fenway Park Alaskan Bush Great Flood of 1993 Home repair The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Oddworld Water polo Drainage Hydrogen sulfide Turkish Van Futurama (TV series - season 1) Easter Island Duke Nukem 3D Gowanus Canal Ester Doughnut Salad Fingers Fried dough foods Confectionery Married... with Children Dice Western Cape Province Cuisine of the Philippines Norman Rockwell Smoke test Tarantula Homer Simpson Air pollution Smoking pipe Anchor Overberg District Municipality, Western Cape Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape Central Karoo District Municipality, Western Cape Laingsburg Municipality, Western Cape Cape Winelands District Municipality, Western Cape Atlanta, Georgia
