has anyone made their own headboard for their bed today i went to look for a new bed but i couldn't find any that i liked i thought about making my own headboard has anyone ever made one i haven't but i've seen a few cool ideas you can get an old fancy panel wooden door and turn it sideways finished anyway you like or you can cut a piece of partical board or plywood to any shape you like and upholster it you can buy a few full length mirrors and space them behind your bed on the wall and if you have a scrap yard in your area you might get lucky and be able to find an old iron headboard i have my bed centered right under a window and have my curtains draped and pulled back and a nice valance it looks nice and a real cheap fix good luck Shaggy dog story Strap-on dildo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Otello Babe Ruth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Russian joke I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue The Amber Spyglass The Ashlee Simpson Show Spy Kids Characters of Naruto Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Metal Slug 3 Futurama (TV series - season 5) Parachuting Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In RuneScape quests Fritz Leiber Social rule Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Jon Secada Dan Rather Friends Doctor Octopus Tenali Ramakrishna Slug Major League Baseball television contracts Horse tack Hide and Q (TNG episode) Frankie Laine Steve Allen Singlish Mamoru Chiba Headache The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Joke Chinese New Year Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Naruto (manga) Pitaten Lou Gehrig Climbing equipment Mojave people Time Out of Mind Weekend at Burnsie's Magical DoReMi Doctor Wily Azumanga Daioh Missy Elliott Little Britain The nature of God in Western theology Avenue Q Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Lodge Committee Phil of the Future It's All Gone Pete Tong Futurama (TV series - season 4) Combine (Half-Life 2) Happy Tree Friends Salad Fingers Jeopardy!
