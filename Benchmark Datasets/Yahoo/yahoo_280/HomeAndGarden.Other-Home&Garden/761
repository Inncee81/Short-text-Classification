we are looking at a house the house isgoing for and it is appraised for it is ac of land and has a stock pond with a small pier like walk bed bath prefab home sits on a slab it is not a mobile home it also has a tack room and another work building car garage horse stables big trees awesome schools does anyone think this is a good price and does the owner have to sell it for the appraised price how can we get the owner to go down on the price when sellers put a price on their homes they sometimes forget two things one is what the appraised value is and the other is what someone will actually pay i just recently went through the home buying process and had a seller tell me that my offer wasn't good enough and her home was worth much more my response was that her home was only worth what someone was willing to pay and i wasn't willing to pay her asking price it has been three months since i looked at that house and it is still on the market and she reduced her price to what i offered three months ago what it boils down to is finding out what houses in that area are actually selling for and compare that to the asking price and the appraisal then go from there my guess is the owner has a deluded sense of what the market will bare and you would be wise to look elsewhere by the way your realtor can get you that information Supply and demand Microeconomics Real estate broker Capitalism Stock Short selling Mortgage Real estate appraisal Shaggy dog story Stock market Economics Auction Commodity Insurance Monopoly (game) Surplus value The Market for Lemons Option Enron Corporation Donald Trump Arbitrage Sento Nuclear power Price discrimination Hyperinflation Dodge Charger Illegal drug trade London Congestion Charge Call option Real estate bubble Housing cooperative Chatsworth House Day trading Warren Buffett Temasek Holdings Bond Monopoly Financial markets Great Depression Property tax Fair market value Futures contract Tax Google Capital accumulation Labor theory of value Wheel of Fortune Powel Crosley Jr. Ford Motor Company Law of value Option style Wal-Mart Inventory Sears Holdings Corporation Technical analysis Economy of Russia Whitton, London Gold as an investment Put option PE ratio Gross domestic product RKO Pictures Berkshire Hathaway Kitchen Real estate economics Estoppel American individualist anarchism Adverse selection Public transport Scale model Satchel Paige Atari 8-bit family Carlsbad, California Corporate governance Labor-power Gold standard Warranty Philatelic investment RuneScape locations Inflation McMansion IBM PC compatible Ownership Derivative (finance) Filling station NeXT Best Buy Make money fast Anarchism and capitalism Common Agricultural Policy Margin (finance) Online auction business model ITunes Music Store Economic rent Acorn Computers Boston and Lowell Railroad Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Dairy
