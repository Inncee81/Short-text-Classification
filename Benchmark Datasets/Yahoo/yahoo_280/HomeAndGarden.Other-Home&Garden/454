i have this sewing machine it's really old to my knowledge it still works but i havent tried to use it as it is greek to me to a collector or avid sewer would it be worth anything i'm going to put it in a yard sale how much should i ask for it stop before you put it in a yard sale do your research look on the sewing machine and find out the name of the maker it is usually on the long horizontal portion of the machine look also for an identifying number for instance right now i'm looking at a green machine from the 's up on the long horizontal portion it says bernina favorit and on the pillar of the machine that's the part that acts just like a support pillar on a building it says so i know it is a bernina i'd do a google on bernina i'd turn up numerous listings for bernina maybe a few for checking those listings i'd learn a bit about how desirable it is to a collector then i might go to ebay and look for the same but specify completed auctions in the search don't think you can get an ebay price at a yard sale because those ebay sales are mostly salesmanship with lots of pictures and increasingly professional text but you can avoid selling a machine for and finding out later after you find out the price do your best to maximize the appeal of your machine by cleaning it at least clean the outside the safest way i've found to do this without harming the decals decals are the decorations you find on the machine in some circumstances is by using baby oil on a soft cloth put the baby oil on the cloth rub the machine lightly then move to a dry portion of the cloth and rub again this will clean and give it a nice shine and smell then consider photographing it and selling it on your local craig's list again don't expect ebay prices just present it as best you can with photos and some of the information you learned in your google search you were taking notes right specify that the seller has to pick it up that way you can avoid the hazards that await the person who packs a sewing machine for shipment and doesn't know what they're doing they'll arrive money will cross palms and the machine and whatever came with it will go off to the new owner Google Upholstery Textile manufacturing Bulk vending Amazon.com Autograph Microeconomics Surveillance Live 8 Illegal drug trade Philatelic investment Mattress Clothing Windows XP Auction Tattoo Network effect Characters in the Smurfs Supply and demand Sewing machine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Contract Slide rule Coffee Coin collecting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swimming ROM image Comanche Toyota Prius Shaggy dog story Chrono Trigger Oil-for-Food Programme Tax Thermal power station Expert system Sewing New York City Subway Lionel Corporation Monopoly Donald Trump Electronic commerce Web crawler Bookbinding Arbitrage Violin USS Tunny (SS-282) Drill bit Mozilla Firefox Dodge Charger The Star Wars Holiday Special Online auction business model Tofu Technical analysis Gmail Social rule Short selling Jute Hemp IBM PC compatible Airport IPod Insurance Gramophone record Atari 8-bit family Password Web traffic Copyleft CPU design Book collecting Photography United States dollar Monopoly (game) Friends Pet skunk US and Canadian license plates Economics O.
