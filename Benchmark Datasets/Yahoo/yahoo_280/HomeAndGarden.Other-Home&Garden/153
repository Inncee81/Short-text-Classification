i need a heavy washing machine removed from a flat i'm two storeys up and we have no lift it has to go down the stairs the council will only remove it from outside it is very heavy any ideas im in cheshire unfortunately washing machines are heavy because of the concrete blocks they have inside in order to stabilise them you are going to need a couple of strong men but depending on how handy you are you could dismantle the concrete blocks most machines have two screws at the back top of the lid undo these make sure you're not plugged in of course and slide the lid backwards you'll need a spanner to undo the blocks you'll see them on top this should lighten the load considerably and won't take long to do best of luck Screw Upholstery Textile manufacturing Seismic retrofit Crane (machine) Equine conformation Tire Ammunition Volleyball Washing machine Casting Drill bit Anchor Skateboarding trick Rail tracks Siegfried Line Bong NASCAR B-24 Liberator Mark I (tank) Enigma machine Casualty lifting Heinkel He 100 Pump-action Nuclear weapon design Elevator Iowa class battleship Tank Japanese tea ceremony Car handling Revolver Wind turbine Messerschmitt Bf 109 Terran (StarCraft) Trench warfare Boat building Zippo Weight training USB flash drive BS 1363 Professional wrestling throws Floyd Rose Sail-plan Lathe Concrete Radio masts and towers Fujian tea ceremony Basement Air-raid shelter Menstrual cup Rail terminology Floppy disk Oxyacetylene T-64 Mattress Krag-J__rgensen Banjo-Tooie Internal ballistics Glossary of climbing terms Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Vise (tool) Table tennis Transformer Suplex Drawing Aerial (dance move) Sugar beet Sundial Final Fantasy Legend III Spark plug Capacitor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Strap-on dildo Hydraulic machinery Glossary of American football Motor oil Compiler optimization Happy Tree Friends Israeli West Bank barrier Bristol Grammar School Mechanical advantage Thermal power station Wave power Artillery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Backgammon Lighting Cheating in poker Glossary of firefighting equipment B-47 Stratojet Flax Swingout Archimedes' screw Ship Crucible TGV Universal Serial Bus AK-74 Time travel
