does a property seller have to disclose subsidence we have recently found that there has previously been subsidence damage to our property the seller didnt tell us about this at the time of purchase and they answered a question on the sellers forms which asked if there was any other infromation that they thought we should know about as 'no' do we have grounds to take action against them and if so what could we claim in damages thanks if subsidence has been properly dealt with usually by underpinning then it shouldn't be a problem in the future in fact in the part of london i live in there is subsidence of some sort in almost every street ours is being dealt with by the insurance company and the estate agent says that it will actually add value to the house having it done as everyone in these parts will suffer from it at one time or another on the other hand if your seller knew there was subsidence didn't do anything about it and failed to give you this information that's pretty poor behaviour really and you may well have some legal redress you really need to take advice from a solicitor but don't despair about the subsidence in itself it usually sounds worse than it actually is Microeconomics Plame affair Contract Theory of conduct Real estate broker SCO-Linux controversies Scientology beliefs and practices Ethics Supply and demand Property (ownership right) Divorce Appeal Criticism of libertarianism Title insurance Expert system Tax Health insurance Free trade The nature of God in Western theology Scots law Public good Slander and libel Intellectual property Epistemology Democracy Downing Street memo Externality Intelligent design Shaggy dog story Capitalism Life insurance Free will Solicitor Agency (law) Digital rights management Pretty Good Privacy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Conveyancing Estoppel Psychology Firefighter Contract theory Land reform New Deal MMORPG Risk management Theodicy Citigroup Civil rights ITunes Music Store Coercion Plame affair timeline Credit card Stock Edward Gibbon Wakefield Babylonian law Short selling Social rule Torture Lawyer History of the United States (1918-1945) Avenue Q 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sharon Tate Software patent debate Poker jargon Price discrimination Trade union Economy of Russia Internet fraud Publishing Monopoly (game) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Extreme Programming Philosophy of business Standing (law) Major League Baseball television contracts Islamic banking Warranty Inter-American Court of Human Rights Technical analysis FairTax Year 2000 problem Real estate Primitive accumulation of capital Simone Weil God Emperor of Dune M16 (rifle) State Gold as an investment Copyright Anti-globalization Same-sex marriage Final Fantasy XI Brian Close Negligence Classified information
