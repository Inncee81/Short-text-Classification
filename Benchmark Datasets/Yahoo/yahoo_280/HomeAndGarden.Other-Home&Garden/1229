does ironing make an autograph stay in longer i had a tote bag autographed by a lead singer and my friend told me that ironing where he signed would make it last longer he used a sharpie to do it if that makes any difference does anyone know if this is true or any other way to make it stay in i would avoid repeated ironings i think once would be enough to set the permanent ink avoid washing the bag and the signature should last longer than the bag itself Halitosis Poker jargon Hydrogen sulfide Acid mine drainage Water purification Homeostasis Blackjack Sulfide Sewage treatment Tire Copper extraction Corrosion Water (molecule) Metallurgy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydrochloric acid Mineral Craps Rebreather Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Environmental concerns with electricity generation Health maintenance organization Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dialysis Zinc Health insurance Gasoline Sewer Thermal power station Decompression sickness Manitoba Hydro Hypoglycemia Draw poker 24 Hours of Le Mans Tooth Game programming British Rail Autonomous building Ulcerative colitis Fire extinguisher Mercury (element) Contract bridge Cookware and bakeware Stainless steel Natural monopoly NASDAQ Solar power Steel Guilty Gear Ozone Arguments for and against drug prohibition Toyota Prius Hard water Silver Overhead lines Home repair Hydrogen peroxide Hong Kong International Airport Trimipramine Heavy water Rust Rail transport in Great Britain Sulfur Furnace Industrial wastewater treatment Loudspeaker Vitamin D Diabetes mellitus Psoriasis Hamster Protein-energy malnutrition TGV Lithium salt CityRail Uninterruptible power supply Nurse Items in the Metroid series Hearts (game) Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Natural gas United Kingdom corporation tax Semiconductor Phosphoric acid Canadian National Railway Drug addiction Aluminium Canasta BNSF Railway 2003 North America blackout Beatmania IIDX Betting (poker) Hemoglobin Shipwreck Private branch exchange Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piquet CPU cache Acne Phase (matter) Water
