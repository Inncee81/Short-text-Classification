remove scratches from a soft leather chair we have a lovely quality soft leather armchair in the office yesterday our kittens were behaving like terrorists and went on a run around using the chair as a climbing frame my husband has gone bananas there are many small scratches to the surface of the leather no tears but just like needles have been scratched over the surface in places and very fine surface rips that although aren't too deep they show and my husband is really sad it is a very special chair of his and i wondered if anyone has any knowledge of how to remove the scratches fine sandpaper and wax maybe there is a great new product on the market called easy colour which has been developed for precisely this problem you can buy it from ltt in a colour to suit your suite it is a wipe on product which will fill in the scratches and replace the colour it is very easy to use car colours and pigments as in other repair kits may be the wrong type of product depending on what type of leather you have http www lttsolutions net leather repair consultants to the furniture and cleaning industries Leather Upholstery Gramophone record Strap-on dildo Pottery Casting Woodworking Welding Japanese tea ceremony Radio controlled airplane Textile manufacturing terminology Tire Knife Drill bit Drawing Chair Lionel Corporation Cross-country skiing Gilding Shoe Clothing De Lorean DMC-12 Radio controlled car Cat Turquoise Airsoft Warez RuneScape quests Scale model Tattoo Thermal power station Bulk vending Color Tooth Brewery Hydrochloric acid Disc brake Printmaking Hard disk Diamond Arcade cabinet Floppy disk Volleyball Billiards Violin Bong Movie projector Wood carving Energy development Nintendo Entertainment System Pastel Illegal drug trade Glacier Motorcycle Motor oil Cotton Tofu O scale Menstrual cup Diseases of the honeybee Fishing Dairy Oscilloscope Jute Top-bar hive Doctor (Doctor Who) Hamster Intravenous therapy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Agriculture Graffiti Inkjet printer Glass Beretta 92F/FS Amateur telescope making M4 Sherman Car washing techniques Land Rover (Series/Defender) Equine conformation Compact disc Material properties of diamond Carburetor Trademark View camera Berkshire Hathaway Aluminium Common Unix Printing System Diamond simulant Timpani Frogman Manicure Naval mine Seismic retrofit Internet protocol suite Shaggy dog story Tanning
