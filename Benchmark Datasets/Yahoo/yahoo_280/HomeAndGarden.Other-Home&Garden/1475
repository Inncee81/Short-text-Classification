pool keeps turning green how can i prevent this okay here's the situation it was clear first then we dumped algecide gallon to keep clear but then it keeps turning green so this morning we put shock treatment in it container lbs but we all kind of know it's still going to be green we use really hard water if that has anything to do with it the last time it turned green we dumped the pool out let it dry to kill the algae then filled it up again it's an ongoing routine with us why does it keep turning green and how do we prevent it shock treatment is chlorine it just keeps going green have you checked your pool filter if you use filter cartridges you may need to replace those on a more frequent basis or if your pump uses sand you will have to replace that several times it is a pain but well worth it shock the pool per the instructions vacuum once you get the dead algae on the bottom and promptly replace the filtration device filter or sand we had this happen a few years ago it was literally a sick color of pea green and discovered that the sand in the pool pump was not filtering it all out because it was literally green in there too we had to repeat the process several times our problem was that in process of remodelling the house some of the shingles from the previous roof had fallen into the pool and they happened to have algae growing on them what a mess hope that this helps Town gas Kerosene lamp CF-18 Hornet Coal Supernova Petroleum USS Thresher (SS-200) Indian Air Force Gas mantle Royal Australian Air Force Firearm Seismic retrofit Fire dancing Hornet Guinness Hand grenade Portable stove Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Tuff F-14 Tomcat Treblinka extermination camp Stellar evolution Motor oil Worms weapons and tools Ultraviolet Chemical warfare Zanpakut__ Artillery Land mine Sewage treatment Items in the Metroid series Space disaster Rocket Admiral Nakhimov (ship) Cell (biology) Noob Saibot Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Carburetor Iditarod Casting Glass F-4 Phantom II Domestic AC power plugs and sockets USS Washington (BB-56) Samus Aran Breath of Fire (video game) Syphon Filter USS Enterprise (CV-6) USS Yorktown (CV-5) Vampire Blood Simple Optical fiber BS 1363 Firework Drill bit The Time Machine F/A-18 Hornet Internal ballistics Shell (projectile) Lantern The Subtle Knife Ozone depletion Circuit breaker Vacuum tube Origin of life Wire Otello Hindenburg disaster RMS Lusitania Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ice core Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Naruto jutsu Torpedo Gypsy moth Oplan Bojinka Battle of Shiloh Open cluster Balloon (aircraft) F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Fused quartz Kerosene Fighter aircraft Massive compact halo object Ozone hole Gas tungsten arc welding Battle of Ap Bac Sandworm (Dune) B61 nuclear bomb Air traffic control Oxy-fuel welding and cutting World War I USS South Dakota (BB-57) Rammstein Operation Chastise Airport Ant Comanche
