i want to build a small cheap and relatively earth friendly home do you know the best way for me to do this i don't have much knowledge or experience in terms of building i am used to being in the office more than construction i would appreciate any non judgemental input if the environment impacts the effectiveness or suitability i live in temperate southeast u s hi trey first get out of the office and look check out every building site every home even every barn or garage check out the areas that you might like to build which suburb which state what are the necessities of the building is it freezing cold for months of the year or is it in the middle of the desert with deg c days and deg c nights start making lists of what you require in a small home bedroom bedrooms bathroom list all of your requirements also keep a check on what you actually like from designs and floorplans to building materials to wall and window styles everything how much maintenance do you want to do in the future minimal maintenance is usually brick whereas mudbrick or strawbale require a reasonable amount of maintenance to keep them up to scratch if you want to owner build start getting some experience every time you see someone building anything ask if you can help this will also allow you to evaluate your skills that would help you decide if you can or actually want to build it yourself go to your local library and borrow every book you can on architecture building self sufficency environmentally friendly building as you read more and evaluate your own skills you may well find your tastes change surf the net there is an absolutly incredible amount of info there more than enough to get you started if you live in an area i am in australia and there isnt anywhere the building code doesnt cover where your building code doesnt need to be followed or you dont need approval there is enough info on the net to get you started and well and truly finished if you want to use recycled materials find somewhere to start storing them be really critical of what you buy there really isnt any point in collecting beautiful doors if you only need build something small start with a dog kennel give it away if you dont have a dog if you enjoy it great if you hate it and dont finish then maybe owner building isnt for you i should clarify that here owner building doesnt have to mean doing everything yourself you can still contract out all of the work it just means that you are not paying for someone else to organise the work being done check out some of the kit home web sites there is some fantastic small homes available you dont have to order one but its great to be able to see what the floor plan actually looks like in reality there is some big difference in what is called small given you lack of experience in building i would imagine the task is daunting but there is a load of help out there there is also many places that offer hands on training many books and websites offer a wealth of practical information much is written in basic terms check out secondhand book shops you may find some really helpful stuff start saving money you will need it in bucketloads small homes dont have to cost a lot but they still cost dont let your inexperience put you off there is no reason why enthusiasm ingenuity and self belief can not see you thru good luck jo Information Services Procurement Library Construction Solar power Computer Product Lifecycle Management Wealth Lighting Straw-bale construction Extreme Programming Windows 2000 CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Betting (poker) Insurance Kitchen Visual Basic MMORPG Gross domestic product Microeconomics Contract Life insurance Neopets Nuclear power Animal Crossing Science CPU design Capitalism Hamster Library (computer science) Information Technology Infrastructure Library Dog agility Craps The Amazing Race McMansion Business continuity planning Economics Perl Political economy Inflation MapleStory RISC RuneScape quests Elevator Library Daylight saving time Wind turbine BASIC programming language Timber framing Legal research Python programming language American individualist anarchism C programming language Loudspeaker Radio controlled airplane National Kidney Foundation Singapore Enterprise content management Lisp programming language Java programming language Forth programming language Energy development Cable television Domain Name System David Hume Requirements analysis Organic farming Subroutine Credit card Computer virus Gramophone record Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Dairy Architecture Open access Embedded system Emacs Bicycle lighting Glossary of firefighting terms Octopus card Fire fighting M16 (rifle) Capital accumulation Law of value Microsoft .NET Book Explosive material
