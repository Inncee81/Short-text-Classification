what's wrong with my steam cleaner i have a bissell steam cleaner that i bought a few months ago it sprays down water and cleaning fluid and sucks it up out of the carpet well all of a sudden the sprayer isn't working the cleaner still sucks up spill messes but it doesn't spray water or cleaning fluid on top of it i can't seem to find my owner's manual anywhere any suggestions what could be wrong the sprayer hose could be clogged or check the nozzles there the water squirts out it could be clogged you can use a needle to make sure they are not clogged the same thing happpen to mine and the nozzles where the water came out were clogged and a needle did the trick Columbine High School massacre Big Brother UK series 6 Pok__mon Live!
