how much is it to run electricity to a new house i would like to know how much it would be to run electricity about ' from the road to a house running a wire that far to make a amp service that is what most houses are would have to be huge because of what is called voltage drop you should really have the power company come out they should be able to move the line further down so you can build your service actually what comes off your house from the top of your weatherhead to the power pole is not even your responsibility anyway i am sure if you call the power company they will tell you the same thing Overhead lines Resistor Operational amplifier Electricity Three-phase electric power TGV Switch Electric motor Electricity meter Electricity distribution Circuit design Overhead powerline Voltage drop Action potential Magnetic field Thermostat Magnet Electrical generator Third rail Transformer Single-phase electric power Volt Electricity pylon Electric power High-voltage direct current RLC circuit Lineman (occupation) Instrument amplifier Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Liquid crystal display Welding power supply Split phase Ampere War of Currents Electrical wiring (UK) Solar cell Spark gap Circuit breaker Railway electrification system Metro-North Railroad C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Tesla coil Electric guitar Electric power transmission Electrical wiring Microsoft Game Studios Passenger rail terminology Tram Light rail Electrical resistance Direct current Northeast Corridor High-speed rail High-voltage hazards Transmission line Electrician Telephone tapping Electrophysiology Impedance matching Vacuum tube Washington streetcars Incandescent light bulb X10 (industry standard) Rail transport Alternating current CMOS Light switch Decibel Manitoba Hydro Hall effect Galvanometer Electrical element Electronic amplifier Battery (electricity) Distribution board Power line communication San Francisco cable car system Trolleybus Rail transport modelling Fuse (electrical) Ground (electricity) Toronto Streetcar System Diode Impedance Voltmeter Particle accelerator Transmitter Piezoelectricity Linear particle accelerator Power (physics) Gas metal arc welding Telegraphy Relay Transistor Low-pass filter Capacitor Welding Peltier-Seebeck effect Conductor (material)
