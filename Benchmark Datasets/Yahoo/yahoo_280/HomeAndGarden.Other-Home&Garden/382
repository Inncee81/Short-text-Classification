is it possible normal for an air conditioner to make the smoke alarm go off i was just watching tv and the smoke alarms went off in my house when one goes on they all go on and i checked the stove and everything else but nothing was on except the air conditioner which i turned off none of the doors were open the ac was on nor were any windows i just want to know if it's possible for the ac to heat up enough for it to provoke the smoke alarms not unless the a c is blowing smoke out of the vents i've never heard of humidity causing a smoke alarm to go off besides when the a c is on it reduces the humidity not makes more i don't know what caused the alarm to go off but if it's a multifunction alarm it could be warning you of something else besides a fire like a gas leak but if it doesn't go off again then that's probably not the case good luck Fire fighting Burglar alarm Hot air balloon Fire alarm control panel Glossary of firefighting terms HVAC Air conditioning Kitchen Glossary of firefighting equipment USS Tunny (SS-282) Carburetor Tank Thermal power station Urinary incontinence Rebreather Firefighter Carbon dioxide Bong Portable stove Autonomous building Humidity Microwave oven Stove Daylight saving time Severe weather terminology (United States) Smoke detector Air pollution Mercury Atlas 6 Airbag Alarm Colony in Space Flashover Blood Simple Battles of Lexington and Concord Fossil fuel power plant Causality Explosive material Tire SS Yarmouth Castle Three Mile Island USS Trigger (SS-237) STS-51-L Furnace Out of Gas Wood fuel Solar power Futurama (TV series - season 5) Insulation Relative humidity Chernobyl accident National Weather Service Wok Nuclear reactor Syphon Filter Hand grenade Engine cooling Mount St. Helens Fire alarm Oxyacetylene Oxy-fuel welding and cutting USS Wahoo (SS-238) E85 Hindenburg disaster Residual-current device Welding Fire Cheating in Counter-Strike Houseplant Nuclear explosion 2003 North America blackout Heat Volcano Ventilation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Asthma Common cold Apollo 8 Swamp cooler Jet engine Door Fume hood Ionizing radiation Mercedes-Benz A-Class Conspiracy (TNG episode) Knight Rider B-47 Stratojet 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Cigarette Smoking Man The Shining (film) Barbecue 7 July 2005 London bombings Pebble bed reactor Diving regulator Spark plug PaX Chevrolet Corvair Shell (projectile) Elevator Plame affair
