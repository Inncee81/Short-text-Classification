which one costs less central air or window units i live in a small apartment right now the central is not working should i ask them to fix it or get window units central air is less expensive than a window unit air conditioners are all the same basically what is expensive is how often the air in your apartment goes above a certain temperature that you set your thermostat at when you set your central air to the temp you want and leave it alone it will only come on when when the temp gets higher than what you want otherwise it stays off a window unit for the most part is turned on and does not have a thermostat to set therefore it will continue to blast cold air until you get up and turn it off it could be snowing outside and it would be on if you wanted it to so the cost is turning the unit on and off several times each time you turn it on there is a power drain and your bill shoots up so but leaving your central air on all the time it actually cost less than flipping the switch on a window unit and making it work hard to make you cool after coming home to a hot apartment the same is true with florescent lights it is cheaper to leave them on then to turn them off and on all day long the other thing is that you cannot force cold air by that i mean you cannot force cold air from one room to another around a corner that in itself is a problem with a window air conditioner if you put it in your living room the bedroom could be hot whereas a central air unit is blowing through the air duct system of your apartment and cold air is being distributed into each room individually Thermostat Solar power Temperature Air conditioning Thermal power station Autonomous building Pebble bed reactor Furnace Climate of the United Kingdom Transformer Rail tracks Electrical wiring Stirling engine Apollo 13 Bicycle brake systems Wind power Carburetor Car handling Engine cooling GunZ The Duel Dodge Neon Hot air balloon Fossil fuel power plant Professional wrestling throws Lighting Fire fighting Sento Digital circuit Turbojet Thermoregulation Wind turbine Digital photography Heat Jet engine Bi-metal Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sauna Apartment Severe weather terminology (United States) Items in the Metroid series Solar cell Central processing unit Fuel injection Aquarium Weather lore Diesel engine Window MOSFET Vacuum Personal rapid transit Steel Axial compressor System/36 Control system E85 Mutual fund Windows 2000 Betting (poker) Modem Spacecraft propulsion Bong Common cold Deep lake water cooling Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Kitchen Mitsubishi 3000GT Syphon Filter Carbon dioxide Wrigley Field Canadian and American health care systems compared Space shuttle main engine Wilton House Windows XP Floppy disk Transistor CPU design Negative feedback Renewable energy Motor oil Ocean thermal energy conversion Energy development Turbocharger Hydrogen economy Ice P-38 Lightning History of Microsoft Windows Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Passive solar The Day After Tomorrow Mouse (computing) Mercury Atlas 6 Year of the Spider Scramjet Sin City IBM PC compatible Thread (computer science) Advance Wars: Dual Strike
