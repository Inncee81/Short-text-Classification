a few of my house plants recently became infected with little flies does anyone know how to get rid of these i would prefer to do it naturally but am not opposed to using chemicals if i need to i really don't want to get rid of my plants i've had some for years so any advice would be helpful thanks these are most likely fruit flies and once you've got them they're hard to get rid of they like moist and sweet things you will often find them in drains and plants because there is a fairly constant source of water they also hang out in your garbage soda cans apple cores and other foods are sure to attract them the only sure way to get rid of them is a bug bomb other than that always keep your garbage in a covered bin put stoppers in all your drains wipe off all excess water drops from your sink counter tops and showers don't keep pet water in the house keep your potted plants outside until the problem is gone i have tried dozens of natural home remedies but none have worked we get them every summer and end up having to do rounds of bug bombs to get rid of them Hamster Vermicompost Waste management Carnivorous plant Coffee Dustbin Bread Toilet paper Kitchen Cannabis cultivation Soft drink Water purification Robot Master Donald Rumsfeld Water Garbage (band) Poker jargon Brown Bear Mosquito Plumbing fixture Tooth Banana Year 2000 problem Hydroponics RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Gooseberry Tea Biological pest control Houseplant Debris Fancy rat Dilbert Acetic acid Homer Simpson Bong Gypsy moth Spyware Sewage treatment Food preservation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Deforestation Drainage Solar power Garbage truck Potato Plastic Thermal power station Tomato Ice cream Nuclear power Energy development Mouse (computing) Objective-C Photosynthesis Ultima Online Garden Strawberry P-47 Thunderbolt Domestication American Black Bear Foodborne illness Protoss Toronto Autonomous building U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Tofu SimCity 4 Cat P-38 Lightning Tick Kakapo Oplan Bojinka Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heinkel He 112 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Flowering plant Slayers Ocean thermal energy conversion Fishing Beer Spam (electronic) Lisp programming language Pesticide Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Apple Uranium A Bug's Life Swimming Rum Mozilla Firefox IPod Flood geology Planet of the Daleks The Dalek Invasion of Earth Venus Flytrap Vinegar
