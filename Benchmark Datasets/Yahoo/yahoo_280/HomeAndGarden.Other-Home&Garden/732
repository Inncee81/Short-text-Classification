are refrigerators dangerous to put on carpet my wife and i recently bought a home with an upstairs carraige room that we've turned into a rec room we'd like to put in a refrigerator to store beer and pop but the room is carpeted i'd prefer not to rip out the carpet and install tile linoleum but i'm wondering if there are any safety hazards involved with a refrigerator on carpeting can anybody help me out nope its not a problem crazy enough my kitchen had carpeting in it commercial carpeting and never had a problem in the years we allowed it to remain suggestion tho why not try one of those heavy plastic office sheets that you use for under your desk chair with computers if its a real concern for you good luck meg Kitchen Refrigerator Carpet Basement Haloalkane Surveillance The Brady Bunch Chair The Shining (film) Bread Dairy Animal Crossing Vacuum cleaner PLATO The Inside Linoleum Brewery Aladdin (1992 film) Berkshire Hathaway Ammonia The Star Wars Holiday Special Best Buy Milk Plastic Stairway In-N-Out Burger Foodborne illness Monopoly (game) Home improvement Public domain Asbestos Betting (poker) Video game music Family Guy Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
