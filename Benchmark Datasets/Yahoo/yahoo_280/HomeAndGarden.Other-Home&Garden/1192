why do my new pvc sprinkler pipe sections keep cracking i had a small leak in the metal pipes at the sprinkler valves the plumber repaired the leak by replacing that valve with pvc pipe a week later one of the replaced sections had a small crack that also leaked only when that valve was running the plumber replaced it days ago today when i got home from work there was a huge crack in the other pvc pipe he'd replaced and the water was gushing onto my lawn even though the sprinklers weren't even running at the time it looked like it hadn't been gushing for too long as my lawn wasn't flooded yet i was able to turn off the water to that valve set i've left a message for the plumber to have him back out to fix it but why does this keep happening and what can i do to prevent it should i have him replace it with copper rather than pvc pipes i can't afford to pay another plumber to come out to fix this when the work should be warrantied i hope someone has some good advice add' info my water company was out about a month ago to test my pressure it is psi at the exterior faucet about when i run water in the house at the same time rep says i have good normal pressure for our area but probably narrow pipes because they are old galvanized steel so i don't think the water pressure is the problem it sounds like the pvc fitting that is being screwed on is a female adapter pvc female threaded fittings do not have the best strength if this is the case use a metal preferably brass female thread x female thread coupler and a pvc male adapter it will be much stronger Irrigation Domestic water system Hydraulic machinery Glossary of firefighting equipment Screw Seismic retrofit Trombone Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water supply Novelty (locomotive) Siphon Tap (valve) Thermal power station Rail terminology Drill bit Spark plug Welding Hydrochloric acid Bong Roof Diving cylinder Fire hydrant Casting Diving regulator Flush toilet Diving suit Brazing Containment building Elevator Thermostat Dodge Neon Atari 8-bit family Rigging Oxyacetylene Plastic Electrical wiring Fire Sprinkler Sleeve valve Rebreather Cartridge (firearms) Steam (content delivery) Three Mile Island Urinary incontinence Gramophone record Motorcycle Downing Street memo Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Pioneer Zephyr Pipe organ Dairy Rail tracks Propeller Borehole Carbon dioxide 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mattress USS Tunny (SS-282) Newcomen steam engine Harp Second Battle of the Atlantic Glossary of climbing terms Firefighter Corrosion Heart valve Sento Internal ballistics Electronic organ Heat Suppressor Glossary of firefighting terms Floodgate Knife USS S-38 (SS-143) Heinkel He 112 Poker jargon Naval mine Hurricane Rita Aortic valve stenosis Violin Fire extinguisher Jet engine Aluminium Steel Ammonia Plame affair Bagpipes Equine conformation Coppersmith Cray-1 Rifle
