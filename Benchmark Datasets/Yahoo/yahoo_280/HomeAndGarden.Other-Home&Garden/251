i seem to have a spider problem what can i use to get rid of them i would not of put this here if i was did not want to get rid of them on the whole i am an animal lover but don't like spiders crawling on me when i am trying to sleep so unless you have a respond son how to kill them don't send and reply thank you i personally think spiders are very helpful the keep all the other bugs away i live in northern california close to the sacramento river and spiders are at an abundance spraying for spiders will not work because they just walk across the area that you sprayed i tried spraying a water bleach mixture but this only effects the current spiders and not future spiders from coming in so personally i just deal with it and accept them like i said they keep all the other bugs away so they do serve somewhat of a purpose Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Robert A.
