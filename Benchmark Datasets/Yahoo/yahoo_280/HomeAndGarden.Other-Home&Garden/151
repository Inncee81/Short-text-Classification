how do i take care of a moth there was a huge moth in my cousins house and we caught it we were going to let it go in the morning and it laid eggs in the container so i took the top off and i put it outside but the eggs and moth are still in it and the moth won't leave it so what should i do find out what kind of moth it is and then find out the food source for it's larva if you caught it at your cousins and it laid eggs in the cage then chances are the host plant is in your cousin's yard or somewhere near by anyhow after you've identified the moth and the host plant just leave the open cage next to the host plant so the caterpillars will have food when they emerge i wouldn't try to move the eggs because they may get damaged Gypsy moth Bagworm moth Diseases of the honeybee Moth Biological pest control Caterpillar Emperor Gum Moth Beetle Butterfly Insect Bogong Moth Peppered moth ecology Luna Moth Saturniidae Ragwort Gooseberry Egg (biology) November Moth Spider Fancy rat Spruce Budworm SimAnt Emperor Moth Forest tent caterpillar Plume moth Silkworm Shark Tick Paper wasp Hamster Egg (food) Ant Chicken Hawk moth Ichneumon wasp Lepidoptera Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Geometer moth Cochineal Apple Queen bee Anopheles Hop (plant) Flea Bacillus thuringiensis Peppered moth Hummingbird Turnip Moth Eucalyptus Veganism Ghost Moth Hemp Elm Nettle Hepialidae Livestock Kakapo Pollinator decline Chrysanthemum Megachilidae Cuisine of Malaysia Heart and Club Agriculture Noctuidae Breath of Fire III Common Cuckoo Salmon Cabbage Moth Miller (moth) Dot Moth Big Brother (USA TV series) Acacia Microwave oven Mosquito Professional wrestling match types Grasshopper Fish farming Phorid fly The Ark in Space Ivy Acorn Rocky Mountain spotted fever History of aerial topdressing in New Zealand Schistosomiasis Trapping Poker jargon Ocean's Twelve Breakfast Mottled Umber WABC (AM) Hazing Sea-buckthorn Brown Bear Ric Flair Difference between a butterfly and a moth Double-striped Pug Polychrotidae Fauna of Australia
