question about keys and locks can you get a key to open locks sorry if this is a stupid question but i know absolutely nothing about keys and locks recently moved into a flat and we each have one normal sized key which opens the main front door into the building which contains flats and also the front door into our flat we were worried that might mean that all the tenants of the building must have the same key which opens the main door and all the doors to the flats but my friend told me when she was in university halls she had a larger than normal key which opened the door to her building with ppl as well as her room but that only her key could open the door to her room so is it possible that my key opens this main door and only the door of my flat we don't know the neighbours well enough to ask them about this havent really heard seen them about and i don't wanna just go up and try sticking my key in their door yes it is everyone would have like a 'skeleton key' which would open the main door and then that same key would only work for one other door yours Japanese toilet Towel Paper Menstrual cup Married... with Children Menstrual cycle Toilet paper Fecal incontinence Bathroom Paper towel Durian Pomegranate RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diaper Washing machine Blood Simple E-6 process Toilet Hand washing Organic peroxide Sento Relative clause Brush Hazing Tattoo Campbell, California The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Bidet Sauna Hamster Drainage Foodborne illness Textile manufacturing Banjo-Kazooie Wood pulp Washroom Saw (film) Gilding Ragging The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Palindrome Dishwasher Euphemism Ron Weasley Ayyavazhi mythology Genericized trademark Coffea Dymaxion house Feet washing Ragtime Flags of the Confederate States of America Linen Avocado Bloody Stupid Johnson Upholstery Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Dormitory Weaving Car washing techniques Coral Tampon Kitchen Manicure RuneScape Mini-Games Pervertible Baptism The Invisibles Today I am A Clown Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laci Peterson Twinworld Rainforest The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening characters Megabat Midway College House Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Salah Karma in Hinduism Hanscom Air Force Base Collecting fossils Hindenburg disaster Towel Day Babe Ruth Toad the Wet Sprocket Johnny Appleseed Linseed oil Seven and the Ragged Tiger Ron and Fez Hydrogen peroxide Douglas Adams Sermon on the Mount Common cold Coriander Montclair State University Villains in Power Rangers: Wild Force Petrified Forest National Park
