is it better to leave my home air conditioner on all day at a constant temperature or to vary the temperature i had a new thermostat installed and it allows me to set several different time blocks during the day to specific temperatures as an example i can have the house at degrees from am to am and then at degrees from am to pm and then back at from pm to pm and so on my fiance thinks that it is more energy effecient to leave the house at a constant temperature all day so the the air conditioner does not have to work as hard to cool down the house between temperature changes i think it is a waste to cool the house all day long when we are not at home and that recooling the house once in the evening takes less energy than maintaining the same temperature all day any thoughts on who is right there are lots of websites that say the same thing use the thermostat like it is made to save energy all day when noone is home here is what con ed has to say about it http www coned com customercentral energysavingtips asp don't cool rooms that aren't occupied open windows on breezy days instead of turning the air conditioner on make sure your air conditioner is the proper size for the area you are cooling check your air conditioner filter at least once a month and keep it clean turn off your air conditioner when no one is home set the automatic timer to turn on your air conditioner minutes before you arrive home ceiling fans can make your air conditioner's job easier while saving you money a two degree adjustment to your thermostat setting higher in summer lower in winter can lower cooling heating bills by four percent and prevent pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year if installing a new central air conditioner or heat pump you should know that recent field studies suggest that approximately percent of installed cooling equipment may have incorrect amount of refrigerant an incorrect refrigerant level can lower efficiency by five to percent and can cause the equipment to fail prematurely Thermostat Air conditioning HVAC Carburetor Brewery Refrigerator Welding Wind power Jet engine Renewable energy Autonomous building Sun Explosive material Ozone depletion Solar variation Energy development Carbon dioxide Ozone hole Turbocharger Apollo 13 Gas metal arc welding Motor oil Hydrogen economy Dialysis Thermal power station E85 Thermoregulation Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Spacecraft propulsion Solar cell Daylight saving time Carbon dioxide sink Transformer Ocean thermal energy conversion Vacuum Coal Ice Biodiesel Three Mile Island Deep lake water cooling Water (molecule) Nuclear power Lighting Superconductivity Earth's atmosphere Urban heat island Furnace Nuclear reactor Overclocking Internal combustion engine Diesel engine Gas compressor Paragliding Wind turbine Environmental concerns with electricity generation Hydropower Haloalkane Climate change Global climate model Homeostasis Gas tungsten arc welding Ozone layer Global warming Stirling engine Climate of the United Kingdom Tire Phase (matter) Water Phase change heat pump Kyoto Protocol First aid Hydraulic machinery Supercharger Severe weather terminology (United States) Swamp cooler Dry cleaning Diode Kitchen Space shuttle main engine Turbojet Gasoline Nuclear power phase-out Electrical wiring Greenhouse effect Ironing Dishwasher Aquarium Water purification Rebreather
