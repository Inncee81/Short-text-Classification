why is my ficus tree dripping excesive sap could it be scale what is with all of the ants i have an indoor ficus tree i have had for a while i recently noticed the carpet around the tree was becoming very sticky i took a closer look to see that the sticky gunk was covering the tree as well i do not know why i looked up some information and people are saying that it could be scales if this is true what should i do there are also tons of ants crawling on around and below the tree are they the cause or are they just attracted to the sap maybe honeydew somebody said any help would be greatly apprieciated thank you sounds like aphids as ants usually harvest them much the same way we do cows the ants will move them around etc prune a small branch and take it to a nursery they should be able to diagnosis the problem be kind though put the branch in a zip lock bag first there are several products you can use but it is important to know exactly what the insect is first hope this helps Fasting Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Liturgical year Lent Sunday Church of Christ, Scientist Wednesday Hebrew calendar Days of the week Sabbath Easter Week Frankie Laine Canonical hours Gregorian calendar Ash Wednesday Noon Bryan Adams Palm Sunday Salah Full House Eastern Orthodox Church Sunday shopping Church of Christ Julian day Priesthood Correlation Program Chronology of Jesus Tina Turner Ordinary Time Social rule Tina Arena Daylight saving time Great Jubilee Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Saturday Destiny's Child Thursday Brewery Great Lent Isle of Wight Rosh Hashanah Good Friday Dominical letter Dry cleaning Psychiatric hospital Vespers Sumo History of East Finchley Liturgical colours Gospel Day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Calculating the day of the week Arthur Koestler Eleanor Rigby Baptism Harrow School Ember days Calvinism Hour New Orleans Mardi Gras Church Coptic calendar Computus WNNX (FM) Great Apostasy Didache Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Friday Ai Yori Aoshi Justification (theology) Blood atonement Japanese tea ceremony Paschal cycle Endowment (Mormonism) Aaliyah Sheffield Wednesday F.C.
