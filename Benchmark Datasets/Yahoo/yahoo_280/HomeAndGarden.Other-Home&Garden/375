what three door refrigerator do you recommend i am looking for a three door refrigerator i odnt need that much freezer space all ineed is it to have the ice and water on the outside anyone have one that they would or wouldnt recommend please dont give me links to door refrideorators i would like personal advice thanks points to best answear we had a side by side for about a year and absolutely despised the thing and that's putting it mildly thank goodness for a good warranty it died and we got to chose a replacement for it we opted for a three door freezer on the bottom cubic foot amana we love it ice and water on the door plenty of room inside there's a deli drawer in the bottom of the fridge where you can put really large things such as a huge pizza you couldn't put anything like that in the side by side the bottom freezer is great pull out drawer with two drawers inside and pull out shelves over each of them we are a family of five and all of us are so much happier with this fridge we've had it for about a year now and still can't believe how much storage there is inside when you open the left door on the inside of the door there are slots to put cans of soda or whatever to keep them extra cold below that is a shelf for keeping condiments or at least that's what we use it for inside the right door there is an enclosed shelf which holds two gallons of milk at an extra cold temp gotta have cold milk to go with those oreos lol over that are two more shelves inside the fridge itself is amazing all the shelves are adjustable which makes it so convenient to have it fit your needs we looked at tons of fridges before choosing the replacement for the one we hated and we're so glad we chose this amana having the freezer on the bottom really makes sense as you don't get into it anywhere near as often as you do the fridge but when you do need to get into the freezer it's not difficult at all happy fridge shopping Ice cream Bong Dairy Sento Kitchen Food storage Refrigerator car 1957 World Series Stock car (rail) Mattress Tofu Poker jargon Theory of conduct Organic food Cuisine of Denmark Food preservation Bread In-N-Out Burger Patrick Star Temperature Coffee The Doors Swingout Fire fighting Milk Toyota Prius RuneScape quests Top-bar hive Volume Atari ST The Dalek Invasion of Earth Dormitory Heckler & Koch G3 Ice Carbon dioxide Sampling (music) Tea The Brady Bunch Ton Brewery Nestl__ Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Joke Spark plug Meaning Billboard (advertising) Codename: Kids Next Door Cruising (maritime) Tire Panama Canal Stairway Passenger car Glossary of partner dance terms Shoe Textile manufacturing Water (molecule) Drill bit Diving suit Thermal power station M60 machine gun The Inside Glossary of firefighting equipment Punt (boat) Equine conformation Soft drink Door Carburetor Norway national football team Kasparov versus The World Autonomous building Basement Winning Streak Strap-on dildo Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Convenience store Salad Fingers Dinghy Elevator Panama Canal Locks Glossary of American football Wal-Mart Floppy disk Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Chinglish Time Out of Mind Toilet Diving Isetta Irving Johnson (Tall ship) Scuba set Glossary of firefighting terms The Doctor Dances Railroad car The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items De Lorean DMC-12
