does anyone know a way of getting rid of ants in your home with ou killing them my daughter really doesn't want to kill the ant in our bathroom is there anyway of getting rid of them without killing them if you can figure out where they are coming from just place cinnamon sticks there they don't like it and they stay away but it doesn't hurt them i have also heard that bay leaves work but i have never had any luck with that another trick they won't cross a chalk line so again if you know where they are coming in you could block them with that if you don't know where they are coming from you could also try sprinkling baby powder on the countertop they won't walk through it you could probably just put cinnamon sticks on the counter too but they may just move to a different part of the house good luck Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Chess strategy and tactics Pitaten The Inside Luck EastEnders Bubble Bobble Characters of Lost Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Muslim ibn Aqeel Aerial (dance move) True Crime: Streets of LA Ant Phoebe Halliwell Animal Crossing Oh My Goddess!
