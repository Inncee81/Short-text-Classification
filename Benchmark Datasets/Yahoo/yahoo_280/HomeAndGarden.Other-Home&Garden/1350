am i being too hard on this issue we live in a dowtown condo building with quite limited storage space my husband has a bunch of stuff from high school and college in boxes that he doesn't want to throw away i have literally nothing from that era of my life left i mean i don't mind a few things but he has boxes of old papers from classes nametags from jobs maps knicknacks etc a lot of the stuff he didn't even know was there now it is just going to take up space in boxes and he never looks at it i just don't get it i told him the memories should be stored in his brain but he really wants to hold on to stuff i think is crap i feel like in years our kids are going to be going through our stuff after we're dead and throwing it away then can anyone shed some light onto this am i being too hard or is it really important to hold onto things from your past p s he says he is holding onto this stuff in case he ever writes memoirs of his life which he won't i am a pack rat and after having to move times in years i have realized that with all of my treasures not all of them have as much sentimental value as i thought ask your husband to let you help him go through his boxes and then with each item have him rate it not so important very important keep the 's 's and throw away the rest then what he keeps organize into smaller boxes it is hard to get rid of stuff when you think that everything is of sentimental value but if you have to move it over and over you start to realize that maybe not all of it is as special as you thought Flea Avenue Q Clothing Flea market Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Bubonic plague Aarti Nocturnal emission Odyssey Sento Bedbug Textile manufacturing Cruising (maritime) Daylight saving time Milton H.
