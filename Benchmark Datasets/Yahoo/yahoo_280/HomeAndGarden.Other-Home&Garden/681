why does chili pepper kill spray bottles i tried a recipe for killing ants i have a sudden unexplainable infestation in my bathroom the recipe involves a handful of chili peppers and a quart of water blended in my vita mix for minutes and then i strained the mixture with a fine wire mesh strainer i put the liquid in a spray bottle and started to spray the ants it lasted for about sprays and then the bottle would not spray at all i rinsed the nozzle with hot water cleaned out the parts and tried again but still it would not spray i tried a completely different spray bottle and the mixture killed that bottle in exactly the same manner i tried soaking all the little nozzle parts in soap hot water bleach and nothing gets them to work again is the problem the acid in the chili peppers or is this just a coincidental melt down of spray bottles so i took care of the ants the real problem is how to get these spray bottles to work again they won't work with any liquid even though the nozzles seem clear they seem to just pump air into the bottle instead of pumping liquid out i am way too lazy to go out and buy new spray bottles and i want to avoid killing new bottles in the future any ideas i gave up a long time ago on making my own spray from chili peppers had the same problem as you are saying you have i suspect we just cannot get it the solution strained enough that it keeps clogging the spray nozzle i know its not melting the plastic because i have bought this product from the stores and it never clogs the bottle yet i can use this same bottle when its empty make my own and it starts clogging they must have a better way of breaking the chili's down so it doesn't clog just not worth the aggravation of trying to know avail i buy it at the store now actually for ants the best product i have ever bought is called terro by it most anywhere put a drop on a little piece of cardboard put in corner of room with problem within an hour you will see hundreds of ants eating it and within hours you will not see an ant again its the best Fire extinguisher Brewery Water purification Soap Menstrual cup Coffee Thermal power station Fire fighting Bread Textile manufacturing Bong Red Hot Chili Peppers Chile pepper Plastic Fiberglass Carburetor Chili con carne Glossary of firefighting equipment Tea Powder metallurgy Tofu Gas metal arc welding Mattress Laundry detergent Breastfeeding Chocolate Cheese Rocket fuel White phosphorus incendiary Common cold Casting Ketchup Pottery Diseases of the honeybee Irrigation Bulk vending Fuel injection Turbojet Haloalkane Ammonia Single malt Scotch Hydrogen peroxide Champagne (beverage) Alcoholic beverage Manicure Dundas Square Siphon Glass Bacon Poker jargon Dairy Polyethylene terephthalate E85 Paint Hot sauce Ant Planet of the Daleks MTV2 Glossary of firefighting terms Ice cream Energy development Sodium hypochlorite Rum Vinegar Dishwashing Milk Electrophysiology Hydrochloric acid Oplan Bojinka Cube (film) Baby bottle Instant coffee Nitroglycerin Dialysis Urinal Spacecraft propulsion Dry cleaning Space shuttle main engine John Frusciante Beer Toilet humour Smoke-screen Cocaine Japanese toilet Carbon dioxide Explosive material Micro-encapsulation Happy Tree Friends Sulfuric acid Idli Moe Szyslak Cider Biodiesel Water Hamster
