does anyone know about the dangers of those large green electric boxes that sit in the middle of the grass we have alot of children in our neighborhood who seem to think that it's o k to play on the electric box in our yard i am not concerned that they are in the yard but i wonder about the dangers of electricution on these boxes can anyone tell me some stories or give me some information that might scare them away telling them is one thing listening is obviously another thanks i cannot give you any good scare stories but i agree the kids have to learn to play responsibly that includes staying off of these boxes usually you see those boxes where there are underground power lines so the wires and equipment are out of reach the cabinets should always be locked and therefore accessible only to authorized personnel while these boxes are electrically safe it would be a good idea to tell your kids not to climb on the box there are still ways the kids could get hurt playing on or around the enclosure often there is a label which identifies the box by location or number and includes a telephone number for the power company responsible for the box check the label and give the power company a call they would be able to answer your questions and concerns and possibly even send someone out to make sure it is safe and secure if you see a person from the power company looking it over go out with the kids and talk with the power employee they can give the kids enough information as to why they should not be playing around the equipment someone knowledgeable like that will make a bigger impression on the kids Telephone tapping Call for help Classified information Plame affair Surveillance Loudspeaker Episodes of Lost (Season 1) High-voltage hazards Rail terminology Password Tag Universal Serial Bus Poker jargon Airport Electrical wiring The Empty Child Jumpstart 3rd Grade Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marching band Black Mesa Research Facility Public-key cryptography The Parting of the Ways Glossary of firefighting terms Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ocean's Twelve Pop punk Silent Night, Deadly Night Electricity meter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Phreaking Avenue Q Hearing impairment Railway signal Bluetooth GSM services 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Modal logic Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act 21 July 2005 London bombings Consensus decision-making Survivor (novel) Baseball The Human Stain War of the Worlds (2005 film) Paragliding Electricity Mountaineering Burglar alarm Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Telephone Hamster Donald Rumsfeld Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Time Machine Malcolm in the Middle Logic The Inside Bass guitar Home Box Office Able Danger Changeroom Children of Dune Rich Mullins Computer security United States Postal Service Contract bridge Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Government of France Epistemology Disaster ITU-T Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Voice over IP Static (superhero) Private branch exchange Star Trek Customizable Card Game The Ark in Space U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Socrates Avalanche Nuclear proliferation TELUS Glen Jacobs Shen Gong Wu Objective-C Plame affair timeline Bank fraud Ownership 2003 North America blackout RFID The Amber Spyglass Glossary of American football Expert system Telephone exchange Floppy disk Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
