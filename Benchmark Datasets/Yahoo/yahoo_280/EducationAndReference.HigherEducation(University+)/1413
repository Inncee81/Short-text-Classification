college question i'd like to go to a pretigious college and i was wondering what classes and extra curricular activities in high school look good in college aplications i'm currently taking all honors classes and am in the student body which is all very stressful is it worth it and do colleges really look at this i'd really like to go to stanford well you haven't mentioned what grade you're in the best thing you can do as far as extracurricular activities are concerned is to get into something you enjoy band theater orchestra lacrosse tennis dance key club etc and stick with it all four years or as many years as you have left this shows consistency and dedication being an officer in a club or on the student council or being a class officer are all good indications of leadership these are the qualities that colleges are looking for besides good grades so yes it is worth it getting involved in the community like doing community service is another thing that colleges like however i would try to combine as many things as you can so as to not get too overwhelmed check out this link and look at admission policies and factors to see what stanford in particular is interested in http collegesearch collegeboard com search collegedetail jsp collegeid profileid Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in the United States Hunter College High School College admissions Secondary education in the United States Franklin W.
