laptop or desktop this question has been bugging me lately i would like a laptop because its just more convinient than a desktop so that i can take it almost anywhere to work on homework and stuff but i am pretty used to having a desktop a desktop would be cheaper and i could build my own for less than bucks at specs i want for games not including a monitor and operating system however there are decent priced laptops that i'm looking at that can run games about for a dell inspiron with a year accidental warranty i'm just not sure if i would use a laptop that much over a desktop i need some advice from college students is a laptop worth the convinience i'd say it's definitely worth the convenience i wrote for the college newspaper and took plenty of courses that involved a of writing in that sense the laptop was very beneficial for me i find it so much easier to work with a computer that you can take anywhere hello coffee shop study sessions than to worry about having to e mail yourself an assignment worrying about getting and then possibly losing a flash drive etc i say do what works best for you but if it were me i'd choose a laptop IBM PC compatible Laptop Atari ST Internet Floppy disk Windows XP Linux Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X Mouse (computing) Sun Microsystems Flash memory Desknote PowerBook Computer virus Pocket PC Commodore International ATI Technologies EMachines Wintel Windows Vista Supercomputer Kaypro GNOME Computer Microprocessor PowerPC Software bug Surveillance Wi-Fi Bluetooth Commodore 64 AmigaOS CompactFlash Microsoft Windows Musical Instrument Digital Interface University of Massachusetts Amherst Theory of conduct Mach kernel Sharp Zaurus Electronic Data Systems Linux distribution Linspire Amiga PowerBook Duo Microeconomics Compaq History of Microsoft Windows SUSE Linux Computer hardware Blu-ray Disc Opera (web browser) Computer workstation Apple Intel transition Bridgewater State College Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Television Timeline of computing 1990-forward IBook Apple II family IPod CPU cache Pentium M PC Engine Konfabulator Radeon Partition (computing) Cork GED Microsoft Office Desktop publishing John Lott History of the graphical user interface Dublin City University Operating system CPU design $ale of the Century Acorn Archimedes Quizbowl Windows Server 2003 GSM services Expert system Screenshot Road traffic accident X Window System Neopets Remote Desktop Protocol Video on demand Graphical Environment Manager Mozilla Firefox Poker jargon HP Pavilion GeForce 4 Ra (board game)
