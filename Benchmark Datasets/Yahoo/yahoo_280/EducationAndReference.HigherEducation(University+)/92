additional courses i have my bs and i want to take extra undergraduate courses how will this affect my gpa will these classes be added to my pre existing gpa or will they be counted separately thanks most times after you graduate with your undergraduate degree in order to take additional coursework you are required to apply as a graduate student any additional coursework will show up on your graduate level transcript regardless of the level of the course therefore it will not affect your undergraduate level transcript only if you apply for a second baccalaureate degree will the coursework appear on your undergraduate level transcript ask the registrar's office at your school how taking additional coursework will affect your gpa best wishes Graduate school Grade (education) Education in Australia Master's degree Juris Doctor Medical school Law school University of Central Florida College admissions Bachelor of Arts Chiropractic Washington University in St. Louis Middle Tennessee State University A-level UCAS General practitioner Open University Cornell University Physician __cole Polytechnique College Education in Germany IB Diploma Programme Australian Qualifications Framework University of Chicago SAT Pennsylvania State University Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Sweden Nuclear engineering Stevens Institute of Technology University of Bristol University of Maryland University College University of Maryland Baltimore County Hopkins School No Child Left Behind Act Kwantlen University College American University Johns Hopkins University The Catholic University of America British undergraduate degree classification Education in Malaysia University of Idaho University of California, San Diego Teacher MIT Sloan School of Management Degrees of Oxford University Master of Engineering Secondary education in France Lawyer Associate's degree Brown University Novosibirsk State University Pharmacist Education in Finland Franklin W.
