i applied for fall admissions a few days ago so do you think i could get into campbell university i want to become a pharmacist eventually i took the sat for the first time in june and made a without any preparation i know this is considered low but at campbell a scholarship is offered for a score of i plan to take it again in october i am number out of at the end of my junior year i have a cumulative unweighted gpa and a cumulative weighted gpa of i am a member of the national beta club and the national honor society i do volunteer work and ran cross country in th grade also i plan to join more clubs in senior year and do more extracurriculars thanks for all the help this is total sat score not just the math and reading i don't know much about campbell university when i applied to universities with pharmacy programs it was entirely in the northeast what you should probably do is take a look at websites like the princeton review or college board they'll tell you things like the average sat scores of entering students or their average gpas however just guessing t sounds like if you're th in a class of and you do extracurriculars you shouldn't have any issue getting into most pharmacy schools good luck Grade (education) College admissions SAT Education in the United States Law school Graduate school University of Southern California Middle Tennessee State University New Trier High School University of Central Florida Dr. Michael M.
