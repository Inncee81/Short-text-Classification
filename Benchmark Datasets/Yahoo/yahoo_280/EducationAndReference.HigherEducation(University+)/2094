honest opinions on academy of art university is this a good school in general what are the people like the neighborhood how do you get in do you need a portfolio i've heard rumors that the school isn't worth the money because the teachers don't really teach and you have to teach yourself everything and alot of people transfer out or drop out is this true also i want to major in graphic design does this school have a good program for that will you get alot of job oppurtunites from it what do you do in graphic design classes what is the homework like just curious i know i asked alot of questions just please be as helpful as possible anything will help thank you so much this is actually a decent art school you do have to be self driven no doubt and i wouldn't go to any purely art school if i wasn't sure that art was what i wanted to do post graduation i think this is one of the factors in the drop out rate after all if you decide that art isn't for you that's the only field the school offers in addition if you aren't highly self driven the culture of this school isn't a good fit aau is a good art school especially for students who don't have a portfolio ready for admission elsewhere and no in fact you don't need a portfolio for admissions but as i said if you think that art may not be your thing don't go you need to be of single focus in a program like this you need to be driven and devoted it's also quite expensive employers really do recruit at this school it's got a decent rep there are stronger art schools in california otis is stronger and there are worse that art institute chain of schools for example and fidm oh please no and there are art schools that are better suited to people who aren't sure art is for them or who want to study things other than art they would be better studying in an art program within a university see usc and ucla if you think the aau is right for you visit them but while you're looking at art schools in that area also visit otis and cal arts which are a step above aau University of Southern California Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Johns Hopkins University Education in the United States Homeschooling Theory of conduct Affirmative action California Polytechnic State University John Lott Georgetown University GED University of Michigan Education in Portugal No Child Left Behind Act Medical school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Juris Doctor College Intelligent design movement Columbia University IBM PC compatible Master's degree University of California, San Diego Teach the Controversy Software engineering Plame affair Los Angeles County, California Cornell University Tulane University Education in Taiwan Education Bowl Championship Series University of Pennsylvania American University Education in Germany Professor California Institute of Integral Studies Aesthetic Realism Trinity College, Dublin Education in Hong Kong Richard Feynman Education in Singapore Floppy disk Secondary education in Japan Community college Advanced Placement Program Harvard University Social rule University of Massachusetts Amherst Law school Alcoholics Anonymous Vanderbilt University The Catholic University of America University of California Bilkent University Satchel Paige African American Vernacular English Seneca College Grade (education) Initial D Grand Forks, North Dakota Academia University of Notre Dame Hogwarts subjects Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism Tufts University University of California, Santa Barbara University of California, Berkeley Virginia Commonwealth University Franklin W.
