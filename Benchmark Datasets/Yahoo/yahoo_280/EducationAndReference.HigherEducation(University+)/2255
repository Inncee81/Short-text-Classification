can i get into a good college with a act score i have a at a private school but my act and sat scores are certainly lacking what does that tell colleges about me if you are interested in a western school retake the acts if you are interested in an easter schol retake the sats don't take both again i think what this tells a good college is that you have test anxiety get a book on the test from the library or your school counselor to help you prepare and no doubt your score will improve also keep in mind that these scores are only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to college admissions i would also include an essay with your application which should be very well written o even if it isn't required it shows initiative good luck to you SAT GED College admissions Law school Education in the United States Law School Admissions Test Education in Romania Kaplan Graduate Record Examination Affirmative action Test (student assessment) Juris Doctor Homeschooling Trinity College, Dublin College Board Medical College Admission Test Education in the People's Republic of China Education in England Education in Hong Kong Tai Chi Chuan Boston College Lynbrook High School Grade (education) A-level Standardized testing Stuyvesant High School Mensa International Physician American and British English differences United States Academic Decathlon Patent attorney Bernard Williams College Cornell University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy The Princeton Review Hunter College High School Lowell High School (San Francisco) School counselor National Certificate of Educational Achievement University of Southern California Community college Higher education in Japan Medical school The Citadel (Military College) St. John's College, U.
