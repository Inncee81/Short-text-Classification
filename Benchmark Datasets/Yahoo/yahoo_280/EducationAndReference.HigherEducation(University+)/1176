have you ever felt like if just about every average joe in a college class seems to get an a then you don't really feel like taking the class seriously or feel motivated to learn i personally find this to be the case in my introductory college class it's an early class for freshman who want to get their first credits before fall semester and it seems like anybody and everybody is getting an a since the grade is so easy to obtain i've neglected to ask for help study and my gpa grade for the class is a i just can't motivate myself unless the class is far more challenging will the real deal fall semester of college be any more challenging by the way i go to indiana university if it makes a difference well you're taking introductory classes and i might be wrong about this but at my university these are really just to get you acclimated to the learning style of college rather than to educate or teach you anything of importance i mean yes they are credit classes and they do count but i don't think they're the real mccoy stacked up to the classes you'll be taking in the fall like i said they're more meant for you to slide into the year easily than to challenge you and make you work for a grade just consider it a bonus that it's an easy credit Graduate school Grade (education) Education in the United States Education in Germany Education in Romania Medical school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto The Citadel (Military College) Test (student assessment) Kwantlen University College Education in the People's Republic of China National Certificate of Educational Achievement Community college Middle Tennessee State University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy The College of New Jersey Lawyer Secondary education in the United States University of Houston Harvard University Advanced Placement Program Massachusetts Institute of Technology Academic term Brown University SAT University of Massachusetts Amherst Education Experiential education Stuyvesant High School Master's degree Jesuit College Preparatory School College admissions Bologna process Chiropractic Education in Malaysia Education in Portugal Student Alexander Technique The Sims 2: University University of Central Florida Franklin W.
