typically are you aloud to have non student guests stay over in your dorm i'm not sure if it varies for each college but from your experience yes or no how did it work out not only varies for each school but it varies also from countries in our place dorms are strictly prohibited from any visitors to come this is to prevent students from getting involve in malicious things preventing guys to visit the girls so as the girls will be prevented also to visit guys in return as it is controlled by the church's rules and policies the school is a catholic school on the other hand when i was in international school in another country living in a dorm women were separated also from men's dorm we were not allowed also to visit each other even brothers and sisters were not allowed we could only be together during the class the reason for this is that the school owner and the school management doesn't want to face the responsibilities that may occur beyond the school policy e g like women getting pregnant while still schooling etc Dormitory Marriage Separation of church and state Japanese tea ceremony Domestic violence Same-sex marriage Eastern Orthodox Church Volleyball French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Franklin W.
