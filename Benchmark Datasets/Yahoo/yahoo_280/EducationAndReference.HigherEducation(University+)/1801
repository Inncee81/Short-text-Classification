studying architecture and modelling i recently graduated high school and i want to study architecture in college im not that much of an artist however i am capable of drawing out plans and handling the technical part of architecture math physics i am worried however about the modelling part of architecture i am not very confident that i can convert the plans that i create into models would that hinder my architectural studies or stop me from becoming a successful architect i too was a little worried about modeling but yes they do teach you and you get better with experience one thing to keep in mind is that most schools are integrating computers into their programs so of the work that i do is on the computer the past semesters i only had to build model the rest was printed from our design software if you're afraid of computers you might want to rethink your intended major but models and hand drawing are nothing to be worried about at this stage Computer-aided design American University University of Michigan Computer Computer and video games Object-oriented programming Software engineering University of Waterloo X86 Massachusetts Institute of Technology IBM PC compatible Education in Taiwan History of computing hardware 64-bit Dynamic Systems Development Method Computer science Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Synthesizer CPU design Georgia Institute of Technology Engineering Central processing unit Education in Romania Architecture Construction Steve Jobs Juris Doctor Apple Macintosh Far Eastern University X Window System CPU cache Architecture of Windows 2000 Cooperative education Java programming language Cooper Union Stuyvesant High School MIPS architecture Cornell University Duke University W.
