do you have to take the sat's over again as a transfer student it's been almost years since i took the sat exam i took some college courses but now i want to really pursue my degree at a state college to get accepted as a transfer student will they use my sat scores for admission or does it not apply no so long as you have enough credits to be considered a transfer student rather than a freshman they won't even look at your sats or your high school gpa they'll look at your college coursework and admit you based on that if however you don't have enough credits well then they may ask for your sat scores and gasp high school transcripts if you are not considered a transfer student from the universities i'm familiar with none of them say that sat scores expire i think you're okay but check the websites of the schools you're interested in because if they have an expiration date for sat scores they'll say it right on their admissions pages the college board is the company you need to contact to have your sat scores sent to schools they have a website for scores as old as yours it can take a bit of extra time to have them sent so plan that in SAT Graduate school Juris Doctor Education in the United States College admissions Advanced Placement Program Law school Grade (education) Education in Australia Education in Germany High school Middle Tennessee State University University of Central Florida GED California Polytechnic State University National Certificate of Educational Achievement Trinity College, Dublin Belmont Abbey College Affirmative action Community college Franklin W.
