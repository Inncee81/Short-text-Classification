whatdo you think of this idea for my thesis i work as a code enforcement officer for my municipality and was thinking of writing my thesis about the rights of property owners versus the rights of state and local governments and the types of ordinances in place and the methods used to enforce them any thoughts and ideas on this subject would be greatly appreciated i need to find an interesting topic and something that relates to my degree b a in political science working on my masters in public affairs sounds like a good topic related to both your experience and your degree should be fairly easy to find sources as well here's something you could add those strange ordinances and why they exist for example in the town i live in to have a garage sale a person must obtain a permit from city hall which costs money at the time they apply for the permit they receive one garage sale sign which is the only one that can be displayed to advertise the garage sale sure i understand the city's need to not have garage sale signs on every light post all over town but just one sign my neighborhood has three access points i sure would like to have a sign at each one of these access points without being fined yes i would remove the signs after the sale is over you know silly things like that we even had a big stink awhile back about door to door solicitation including the little flyers it was getting so out of hand that the city passed a law saying that is was completely forbidden well many local businesses relied on the free advertising and complained so they modified the law to say that flyers could be put on front doors if the business purchases a permit from the city to do so now i'm getting all kinds of crap at my door again just another example good luck with your thesis seriously sounds like a good thesis especially if you're comparing something like big cities and small suburbs Trademark Public domain Patent Digital rights management Microeconomics Intellectual property Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Copyright Law Tax Juris Doctor Contract Copyleft Zoning Graduate school Politics of the United States Law of value MAME Master's degree Civil rights Law of the People's Republic of China Economics Property tax Knife Computer Surplus value Capitalism GNU General Public License Taxation in the United States Illegal drug trade Constitution of Ireland Legal research European Convention on Human Rights Logic American individualist anarchism Mathematics Object-oriented programming Mail Education in the United States Gun politics Software engineering Open source culture Privacy First Amendment to the United States Constitution Scientific method Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Political subdivisions of New York State Public good Theory of conduct Philosophy of business Two Treatises of Government John Wycliffe Prices of production Federal Marriage Amendment American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Wayne Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Gun politics in the United States Property (ownership right) Legal system of Hong Kong Extreme Programming Ethics Exchange value Scientology beliefs and practices Aerial (dance move) FairTax United States Constitution Classified information Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity C plus plus Separation of church and state Bus models used in New York City Transit Meme Australian constitutional law Fair use Corporate personhood Constitution Divorce Kashrut Victor Cousin Liberalism Compiler optimization Smoking ban Insurance Neopets General relativity Plame affair Copyright law of the United Kingdom Campaign finance reform Democracy George Boole Education in Portugal
