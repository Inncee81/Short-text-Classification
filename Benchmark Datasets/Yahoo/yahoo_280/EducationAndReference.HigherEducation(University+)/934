what's the most descent cal state to go for a chemistry major i will be applying to usc and and some uc's that have the pharmd program but as an undergrad i need to have a backup school so for science majors i'd like to know which cal state would have the best program thanks prolly the cal poly's what uc's have a pharmd program only ucsd comes to mind by pharmd program i'm assuming you mean a bachelor pharmd program usc and univ of pacific are two other schools to consider for a bachelor pharmd program because if you're just looking for a school to go to with the hopes of getting into pharmacy school any of the ucs would be a better choice than any of the cal states if you have any hope of getting into those yr programs uc riverside and uc merced are more than adequate as backup choices you should be able to get into the irvine davis santa barbara group if you don't think you can get into a uc not only should you forget about the yr pharmd programs but consider just doing the pharmacy prerequisite courses at a community college save a lot more money that way than attending a cal state do well enough there and you might be able to get into a pharm school directly if not then get into a uc and try again in a couple of years California Polytechnic State University State university University of Southern California University of California University of California, San Diego Pharmacist California State University Southern California California Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Education in the United States Education in Portugal Cal Poly Pomona California State University, Fullerton Academic degree Doctorate College World Series Chinese University of Hong Kong Big West Conference University of California, Los Angeles University of California, Riverside Oregon State University Education in Germany Graduate school University of California, Santa Barbara Temple University Education in Hong Kong University of California, Davis Bachelor's degree University of California, Berkeley Education in Australia Juris Doctor Education in Sweden Northeastern University, Boston Memorial University of Newfoundland Medical school Undergrads Master's degree University of Notre Dame Bowl Championship Series University of Houston California State University, Los Angeles Pacific Ten Conference University of Connecticut Community college Los Angeles County, California University of California, Irvine University of South Carolina Associate's degree Physician Bologna process California State University, Long Beach Ball State University Stanford University Education in Finland University of Michigan California Community Colleges system Georgetown University Far Eastern University NCAA Men's Soccer Championship Seneca College USC Trojans Football San Diego State University Tulane University Medical University of South Carolina Rutgers College San Jos__ State University California Baptist University 2004 College World Series York University Pharmacy University of Santo Tomas High school California State University, Northridge Advanced Placement Program University of Toronto Florida Institute of Technology San Francisco State University University of the Pacific Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Taiwan Central Coast, California Fight song Smith College Law school Athabasca University Pennsylvania State University Education in Canada A-level Brentwood, Los Angeles, California Middle Tennessee State University Christian Brothers University Mack Brown Pomona, California Hope College Florida A&M University Auburn University Florida State University Texas Southern University
