i will be a freshman in college august th today i am going to register for my classes just need some advice i'm going to register for my classes today and need some advice on a major i am going to become a dermatologist and have decided to major in biology for a couple years now well i get to researching typical majors to become a dermatologist and have found it really doesnt matter what you major in i want to major in biology because i like biology but i'm up for any suggestions on other pre med majors that people are considering i love english more than biology i'd say but i just need some advice on my situation and what my college life is going to consists of for those of you who have been in the situation i will soon be in im kinda getting nervous but im ready for school to start i'm excited thanks so much seeing how you want to major in bio the two intro to bio classes are some of the most popular on a campus so these will be large lecutre classes then split up into smaller classes for lab work so what you'll wanna do is look at the class size of each of the bio classes so you can get into the smaller ones also look at the times of the classes if you really dont like getting up ealy schudale later in the day classes the same goes for the intro to chem classes you might need also you may want to consider getting you general education classes out of the way or most of them it is personally up to you i knew i wanted to do bio so i got my gen ed classes out of the way freshman year for you whole english love etc i loved history when i was in th grade i probably knew more about it than mosthigh schoolers and a majority of the american populus i read history books from the libary for fun but however a major in history is rather hard to get a job with at least a very high paying one the same will go for your love of english even though you love it it will be hard to get a job with it and would not prepare you for med school so as someone above suggested read in your spare time Education in the United States Graduate school High school Biology Education in Taiwan Medical school Student College Lynbrook High School Kodocha University of Central Florida Secondary education in the United States Medicine RISC Advanced Placement Program Massachusetts Institute of Technology Homeschooling Redundant array of independent disks Hunter College High School Cornell University Education in the People's Republic of China Duke University University of Pennsylvania Mutual fund IBM PC compatible College of William and Mary Avenue Q Can't Hardly Wait Education in Portugal Johns Hopkins University Harvard University University of Maryland Baltimore County Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Cardcaptor Sakura University of California, San Diego University of Michigan Trinity College, Dublin Harvey Mudd College W.
