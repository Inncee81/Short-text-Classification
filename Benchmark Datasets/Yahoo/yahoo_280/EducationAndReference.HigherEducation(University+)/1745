college and fashion ok so i am to late to apply for the fall of at berkeley college in ny but i am applying to the jan semester i want to major in fashion marketing and management until then i have to go to a community college for a semester can you do that will i be behind the others at berkeley would it be better to take online classes at berkeley or go for a semester to scc it wouldn't matter if you took classes at a community college your first semester since all the freshman at berkeley in your major will be taking the same lower div courses so as long as you take classes at community college that are transferable and equivalent to the classes at berkeley you'll be fine it'll be cheaper for you the st semester as opposed to those who are in berkeley college Juris Doctor Education in the United States Master's degree Kwantlen University College Academic term University of Central Florida Education in Germany Middle Tennessee State University Princeton University Student Brown University Education in Taiwan Graduate school University of Massachusetts Amherst Carnegie Mellon University Gwinnett University Center Reed College Tulane University University of California, Berkeley Savannah College of Art and Design Community college Montgomery Blair High School Hopkins School University of Houston Pitzer College Emerson College Virginia Military Institute Juniata College Trinity College, Dublin Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Chiropractic Education in Portugal Hampshire College Duke University California Polytechnic State University Associate's degree Bologna process Education in the People's Republic of China University of Scranton Marlboro College Western Kentucky University Columbia College of Columbia University Concordia University Student loan Franklin W.
