the college life between community college vs university state college what the major difference between life in cc vs life in university or state college how much would i miss out if i take cc it depends on the college for my first semester i atteneded a community college which had dorms athletic teams several clubs etc and basically it was very much like a foru year school i am now attending a newer community college and we don't have dorms or athletic teams and clubs come and go each semester it also depends on what you're looking for in a college you'd have to do your research on community colleges in your area and see what they offer i would recommed doing a two year degree program at a community college first and then transfering to a four year school because then you'll have more expereience and you'll also have your freshman sophmore years of studying out of the way but that all depends on what sort of degree and field of study you plan on going into the community college i am currently attending is nothing like the steryotypical extension of high school and most people on campus study very hard we have a lot of speakers and events and some good clubs which have stood the test of time it's just the matter of getting involved Education in the United States Tulane University Middle Tennessee State University Cornell University Duke University Franklin W.
