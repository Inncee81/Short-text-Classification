what do i need for school i am trying to figure out all the essentials for a dorm so i can start shopping a year early so if you have suggestions please help definitely check with the college first for example my college has a mini fridge microwave in every dorm room i was allowed to bring a toaster which helped when i was tired of on campus school food if you can find one a microwave cookbook is a life saver for homecooked food cravings we can't have candles but candle warmers were allowed and that'll make your room smell great a can of lysol is a must for first moving in also a bottle of febreze can be a college life saver for when you don't have quarters to do laundry i found some neat mesh hanging organizers that i could hang from the ceiling for a space saver also under the bed storage is great don't forget random basics like paper towels plates utensils for when you microwave food i got a new bed set fun pillows and new towels in bright colors there usually isn't room for an extra chair but i did make room for an exercise ball fun to use and sit on or you can try storage that'll double as a seat basic cleaning products are handy for dorm room cleanliness checks most dorm beds are extremely uncomfortable unsupportive so i'd recommend buying a foam egg crate or memory foam mattress pad to put under sheets also check with the school to find out if you'll need twin sheets or twin extra long sheets a lamp proved invaluable to me i got a small desk lamp and hung string lights on my side of the room get a desk organizer and a wall calendar i've found a lap desk was helpful when i wanted to sit on my bed and do homework some colleges will let you hang things if you fill in the holes when you leave mine did and i got basic cheap shelves from wal mart to put things like my binders textbooks on a tv dvd player can be good for boredom you may want to get a fan if you like it cool at night and your roommate doesn't on the other hand bring a blanket in case you're cold and don't want to climb into bed when you're just sitting around also if you're modest a bathrobe can be handy i brought a phone but never used it i just used my cell phone plastic drawers can be cute and give you more storage cd player radio can be good also a tip for your wardrobe i bring clothes seasonally example in the spring i have my summer clothes and few winter pieces in case we have a random cold day important but often overlooked things extension cord ethernet cord for computer if you college has high speed not wireless internet umbrella rain boots cute and good for flooding sidewalks your preferred type of power strip to extend the amount of electrical outlets in your room i swear it seems like there's never enough the basic desk supplies pens pencil calculator scissors glue tape laundry detergent and dryer sheets first aid kit tool kit alarm clock a am class sounds late now but in college for some reason things change lol batteries flashlight nightlight if you have your own bathroom spray air freshener what if your roomie is a slob and a snack stash candy pretzels etc just something to snack on so you don't have to leave your room of course basic towels toiletries and bedding i know that's a lot to think of but trust me when i say you'll be glad to have all of it Plastic Dormitory Lighting Genericized trademark Hamster Oscilloscope Fire fighting Emergency preparedness Japanese tea ceremony Textile manufacturing Sento Atari 8-bit family Strap-on dildo Bicycle lighting Professional wrestling match types Thermal power station Microwave oven Brewery Radio controlled airplane Undergrads Friends Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Mouse (computing) Dairy Cruising (maritime) Solar power Solar cell Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Carburetor University of Massachusetts Amherst Seismic retrofit Battery (electricity) Violin Drill bit The Shining (film) Drag racing The Suffering (game) The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) IPod Japanese toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Daylight saving time DVD Futurama (TV series - season 2) Cuisine of Denmark Fancy rat Community emergency response team First aid kit Shaggy dog story Gramophone record Computer International response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Redundant array of independent disks Incandescent light bulb Dollar store Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Christmas tree Jumpstart 3rd Grade Garfield Autonomous building Passenger car University of Minnesota Basement Bed (furniture) Milton H.
