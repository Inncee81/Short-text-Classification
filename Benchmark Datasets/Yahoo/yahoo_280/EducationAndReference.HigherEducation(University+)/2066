question about transferring from a community college to a uc okay so i had back surgery which caused me to take on homeschooling for my entire senior year which pretty much blew my chances at going straight to a uc so i plan on going to a community college but according to the counselors at said school they claim that i need to take courses that will be transferrable and be specifically chosen according to the school i would like to go to and the major i would like to take there i want to take business management but how can i just decide on the college i would transfer to right now when i'm not even sure i would be able to get in also how do i know what classes each school wants you to take in order to get into its business school and if they have other requirements besides grades and the correct classes any help would be appreciated i forgot to mention the back problem i had ruined most of my junior year as well to the point where i was unable to go to school times a week i worked extremely hard after surgery via the homeschooling to make up both junior and senior year classes about credits total to do from january march which was when i graduated i also never took the sats for this same reason would've done the surgery earlier but the only open schedule with the specific doctor we chose and i'm glad i picked him was during the summer between my junior and senior years jc seemed like the best choice since i don't really feel like going back and taking sat classes and then the sats plus my gpa was extremely hurt during my junior year nd semester especially because i wasn't able to go to school from the intense pain i was in you do not have to pick the uc campus right now the counselors may mean you have to decide between the csu and uc systems but i believe csus also accept uc requirements so i'm not sure why it would be relevant there are only a few uc campuses that offer business as an undergraduate degree business berkeley and riverside bizecon irvine ucla riverside ucsb ucsc you should complete the igetc requirement which is universally accepted at any uc campus you should also complete your major requirements which will vary a bit from campus to campus but not by much Education in the United States SAT GED Graduate school Education in Germany Homeschooling Community college Medical school Grade (education) Juris Doctor Physician Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China College admissions California Polytechnic State University University of California California State University University of California, Riverside Affirmative action Education in Romania Education in Australia University of California, Irvine High school University of California, Santa Cruz Chiropractic Education in Taiwan Middle Tennessee State University University of Houston Law school Hopkins School The Citadel (Military College) University of Pennsylvania College University of California, San Diego Kwantlen University College Stevens Institute of Technology Master's degree Cleveland State University Columbia University California Quizbowl Junior Certificate Prostate cancer Georgetown University Northeastern University, Boston Brown University University of California, Los Angeles Duke University American University University of Southern California Hunter College High School Washington University in St. Louis Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy University of Alabama Virginia Commonwealth University University of Bristol Reed College University of Chicago A-level Princeton University University of Massachusetts Amherst Education in Canada Tulane University Hampshire College Bryn Mawr College University of Maryland, College Park Seneca College Smith College Freed-Hardeman University Associate's degree Education in Malaysia University of Maryland Baltimore County Florida Institute of Technology University of North Carolina at Charlotte Dallas Baptist University State university The College of New Jersey The Catholic University of America Worcester Polytechnic Institute Macquarie University Extreme Programming Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the Republic of Ireland
