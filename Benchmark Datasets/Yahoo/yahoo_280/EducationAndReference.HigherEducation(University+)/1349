can you recommend some colleges that i might be interested in and which might accept me based on info below i am about to go into my senior year of high school my courses have been honors ap when available my current gpa is weighted or about unweighted my current class rank is of about i got a on the ap biology exam only ap i've done so far my school only offers like ap classes sat scores math eng subtotal old scale score writing total i don't have much in the way of extracurricular activities clubs no sports no communtiy service no jobs thank you much i'm wanting a degree in computer or electrical engineering or something similar beyond that i have no idea really my personality is sufficiently pliable that i could probably get along ok wherever the point of this question is to get ideas if i knew exactly what i wanted i would probably know where i wanted to go to college there are hundreds of fine schools that would be delighted to have you apply and attend the very first decision you must make is how far you are willing to travel from home i had one kid who went to a fine college miles away and had a great college experience i had another who went miles away and had a horrible time of it once you make this key decision you can start identifying likely schools i think the us news online guide is enormously helpful get the enhanced version it cost less than of the schools you might want to also consider size courses offered and location relative to your interests one other consideration some college administrators are unusually repressive you may be in an otherwise excellent college but if you tell the wrong joke or are reported for stating the wrong political opinion you very well might get charged with hate speech and administratively disciplined or expelled three otherwise eminent institutions that are notorious for repression of free thought and speech include tufts johns hopkins and gettysburg college good luck to you Education in the United States Grade (education) SAT College admissions Education in Germany Graduate school Advanced Placement Program University of Central Florida Law school Education in the People's Republic of China New Trier High School Education in Australia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Taiwan Stevens Institute of Technology Software engineering Lynbrook High School Cornell University Education in Portugal GED Massachusetts Institute of Technology Middle Tennessee State University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology The Citadel (Military College) Juris Doctor Johns Hopkins University Secondary education in the United States American and British English differences Education in Malaysia Education in Romania Plame affair Franklin W.
