are online master's degree programs worth the trouble has anyone used any of the online schools to obtain a master's does anyone know how much they cost i'm really interested in it but i would probably have to tack on a few thousand to my student loans and that is not very appealing to me i graduated last year and already have a full time job but i'd like to get my mba or mpa i actually work at the university i graduated from but it does not offer master's programs and there is not an institution that does offer them within a few hundred miles so as of now online looks pretty good and the one's i've been looking at are accredited there are many online programs available some are good and some are not you need to make sure that the online university you select is regionally accredited if they have accreditation they will proudly tell you on their website if they don't have it they will give you a bunch of b s on why it isn't necessary to have it just make sure whatever you decide the program is accredited many online programs are quite affordable you need to check out different programs much depends on you and the type of degree you are seeking online learning is great but it isn't for everyone you need to be a self motivated person because there isn't anyone who is going to physically drive you to do the work but yourself Master of Business Administration Education in the United States Master's degree Graduate school Juris Doctor Athabasca University Architect Education in Australia Associate's degree University of Notre Dame Marylhurst University Software engineering University of Houston Florida State University Education in Germany Lawyer Academic degree Pennsylvania State University Chinese University of Hong Kong School accreditation Washington University in St. Louis Cass Business School, London Student loan Florida Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China Queen's School of Business Stevens Institute of Technology Librarian University of Central Florida College admissions Babson College Medical school Paralegal University of Alabama in Huntsville Distance education Memorial University of Newfoundland Georgetown University Physician University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez Columbia University Cooper Union College of the Southwest St. John's College, U.
