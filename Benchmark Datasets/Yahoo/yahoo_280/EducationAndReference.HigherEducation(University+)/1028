can i still go to university in september through clearing this month i'm years old and i have some average poor a levels from schooling in the last millenium i was wondering if i could get into a university in london to study something like law possibly course doesn't matter as much and if so what size of loan i could get for it interest free perhaps and what fees etc i'd have to pay is it too late because i need to have signed up to some application service or is there still a way in you can apply for a loan from student finance direct here is their website http www studentsupportdirect co uk the loan they provide for you will be interest free but you will need to pay back the base inflation rate since the value of money in this year will be less compared to years from now the university fee is approx a year but you can get a loan from student finance to pay for it until you graduate and get a job where the money you owe will be deducted from your wages i personally think the only way you can get into university is via ucas http www ucas com a list of vacancies in clearing will be displayed on this site from tuesday august scottish vacancies only and thursday august all vacancies until monday september the best thing to find out if you can still go to uni is to ring the university you personally wish to go to and ask them if its possible Student loan UCAS Tuition Credit card Education in the People's Republic of China Taxation in the United States Top-up fees Graduate school Life insurance Mortgage A-level College admissions Hyperinflation Education in the United States British universities Gross domestic product Usury Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Insurance Education in New Zealand Tax Debt Deflation (economics) Affirmative action Unemployment Interest Finance Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Economics Keynesian economics Bond Microcredit Employment in Hong Kong Income tax Corporation Bank Annuity Social Security (United States) Education in Germany Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Government debt Microeconomics Interest rate Public education Article One of the United States Constitution Monetary policy Economic inequality Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Publicly funded medicine Economy of the United States Supply-side economics Economy of Russia Unemployment benefit Real Madrid Dalhousie Student Union Education in Australia World Wide Web Juris Doctor School of Salamanca Cheque Voluntary Student Unionism Ocean's Twelve Federal Reserve __cole Polytechnique Asian financial crisis Short selling Grade (education) Free trade Higher Education Bill Capitalism Citigroup Contract Great Depression Gold standard Predatory lending Credit score 2004-05 in English football Leaving Certificate Money Price discrimination Annual percentage rate Wall Street Crash of 1929 World Wrestling Entertainment April 2005 in Canada Business cycle Unemployment types Temasek Holdings University of Bristol Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Professor
