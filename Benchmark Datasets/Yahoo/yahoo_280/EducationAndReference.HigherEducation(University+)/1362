getting into an ivy league school my story i started out high school with a bad outlook on the effort i should put into achieving high grades which has resulted in me receiving rather poor grades during my first two years of high school about avg gpa until i realized how bad this was and actually tried my junior year easily getting straight as i know no school will care about my story but i was wondering if the first two years will hinder my chances of getting into an ivy league school for undergrad my sat scores have consistently been around will it give enough boost or is it better to attend a decent school and get for years and then continue my education at an ivy league school for grad school first of all congratulations on your newfound maturity that will serve you well wherever you go in the future some people on this site are a little obsessed with ivies yes they are good schools and some in fact are excellent but there are other schools out there which are just as good in a lot of fields having said that there is some information we don't have are you taking ap or honors classes if not the most you could end up with would be a by the time you graduate and while that is certainly not terrible when you are applying to places as competitive as the ivy league schools it puts you behind some of the other applicants you aren't so far out of the loop that you shouldn't bother to apply especially if your sats are as high as you report but it isn't a sure thing so you do need to consider back ups if i were looking at your record i would want to know why things suddenly changed especially since you will only have about a year of the improved grades by the time you apply i would want to know that you have some good reason for a permanent attitude change not just a temporary panic while you apply for college you might work it into your essay somehow without sounding like you are making excuses for yourself again if your sat scores are that high and your higher grades continue you can get into some pretty good places relatively easily look at some of the more prestigious liberal arts schools at back up they tend to feed people into the ivy grad schools and will serve you well even without a graduate degree SAT Graduate school Education in the United States College admissions Education in the People's Republic of China College Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong High school University of Michigan Education in Australia Education in Taiwan Affirmative action Ivy League University of Pennsylvania Hunter College High School Education in Portugal Theory of conduct Public Ivies Brown University Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Master's degree Juris Doctor Education in Singapore Yale University Chiropractic Batting average Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Numerus clausus Education in England Cornell University Rugby league Culture of the United States Trinity College, Dublin Harvard University Pittsburgh Steelers Middle Tennessee State University Ultimate (sport) Education in Canada Shaggy dog story Volleyball St. John's College, U.
