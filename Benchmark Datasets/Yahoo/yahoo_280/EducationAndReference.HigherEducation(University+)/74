how do i know if the college i choose is good how do i know that employers will accept the certificate i get from hondros college hondros college is accredited by acics a national accreditor and not by one of the regional accreditors in ohio the regional body is the north central association what this means for you is that while the education may be useful and you can get a job with it provided you also have the other job prerequisites like experience and ability if you want to use this education for entry into higher learning such as getting a bachelor's degree then you may face a challenge most of their programs are vocational and pre licensing in this case it really doesn't matter where you went to school as long as you are eligible for the state exam for that profession and you get a license it's the license that's important that's what employers will care about an example if you want to be a real estate salesman in ohio having an mba from harvard is of no use if you don't have an ohio real estate license your question to hondros should be what is your pass rate on the xyz exam to help determine whether their programs are effective good luck School accreditation Juris Doctor Lawyer Education in the United States Education in Australia Paralegal Nurse Physician Education in Portugal Architect Master of Business Administration Education in Hong Kong Law school Software engineering Teacher City and Guilds of London Institute Community college Education in Malaysia General practitioner Grade (education) College University of Houston Education in Sweden Associate's degree Education in Germany College admissions Test (student assessment) No Child Left Behind Act Scottish Qualifications Authority Physical therapy A-level National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in the Republic of Ireland Marylhurst University Social work University of Phoenix University of Central Florida Real estate broker Education in Romania Education in Japan Athletic trainer Australian Qualifications Framework Education in England Medical school Professional Engineer Podiatrist High school Chinese University of Hong Kong Athabasca University Driver's license Academic degree School counselor Baldwin-Wallace College Attorney at Law Master's degree Education in Finland Babson College Education Advanced Placement Program Doctor of Philosophy Chiropractic Education in Austria University of the State of New York Education in Taiwan Florida State University Kwantlen University College Education in Singapore Pennsylvania State University Brown University Accountancy Quizbowl Distance education Bachelor of Laws Master of Laws Midwifery Virginia Military Institute Higher education Students' union Apprenticeship GED Amateur radio Electrical engineering Economic inequality Minimum wage Optometry Temple University Leaving Certificate Salt Lake Community College Israeli Arab Notary public Cass Business School, London Affirmative action Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania
