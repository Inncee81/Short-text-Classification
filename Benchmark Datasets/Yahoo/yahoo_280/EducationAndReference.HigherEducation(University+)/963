universities and their majors im searching for a college or university and i wanted to see if there is a website that tells you what majors what schools specialize in or a site thats lists all the majors and then lists the schools that are the best at that major most liberal arts schools dont really specialize in a major but you are right in that some are known for having a good school of journalism or biology or w e i would say you should just be undecided because what if you go to a biology school and then change your mind you wouldnt want to have to change schools to change your major allow yourself to explore new subjects find a school that has a wide variety of majors in a way all colleges are fundamentally the same i mean they have different atmospheres but they arent that different just choose a good one but choose a really good one for graduate school b c that's when having the best at your major really counts good luck University of Connecticut Biology Education in the United States Johns Hopkins University University of California, San Diego Bachelor of Arts University of Central Florida Brown University Legal research University of Maryland Baltimore County Cornell University High school Physician Oregon State University University of Edinburgh Education in Taiwan University of Michigan Education in Germany The College of New Jersey Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences Mathematics Harvard University Bioinformatics Francis Crick College admissions Education in Romania Northeastern University, Boston College Duke University Graduate school A New Kind of Science Australian National University Drew University Rutgers College Florida International University Advanced Placement Program University of Pennsylvania Niagara University University of Toronto Education in Singapore Chinese University of Hong Kong Kyoto University Physics Barbara McClintock New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences University college Columbia University Harvard College University of Queensland Nanjing University Georgetown University Education in the People's Republic of China Bob Jones University Western philosophy Drury University Yale University Hunter College High School Sonoma State University Secondary education in the United States Trinity College, Dublin Science Vanderbilt University Liberal arts Washington University in St. Louis Wesleyan University Education in Portugal Robert Hutchins The Sims 2: University California Baptist University Grand Valley State University Occam's Razor Biola University Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences Tulane University Angelo State University American University SAT University of Memphis Warsaw University Academia University of Hawaii at Manoa Wayne State University St Kevin's College University of Southern California Chemistry Seneca College California Polytechnic State University University of Alabama University at Albany Truman State University Furman University Medical school University of Miami Cornell University Graduate School Middle East Technical University College and university rankings Thammasat University Botany Extraterrestrial life Facebook (website)
