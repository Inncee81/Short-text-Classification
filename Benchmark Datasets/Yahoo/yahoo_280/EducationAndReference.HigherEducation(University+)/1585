which do you think is a better degree social science or liberal studies i want to get a degree where i have to do as little math as possible also i'm not really sure what i want to do so a general degree like one of these is would be fine for me i'm also currently in the military english was another degree i was thinking about any thoughts i think it would actually be better if you took psychology which is a social science the fact remains that if you take a broad major like liberal arts or humanities possible employers will think that you are just taking the easiest crap a college offered you at least with psych you can show that you had a focus this major is one of the easiest to take have and it can be used in any number of industries from marketing to finance non profit to governmental sectors another option would be criminal science though a tad harder is very similar english is a hard major because you are constantly reading books and writing papers i was an english major and by my senior year i had major requirement classes to take each class the highest level course each paper had to be at least pages long each book was about pages long sometimes i'd come to class with the wrong books or come prepared to one class when it was a totally different class with the same teacher all i can say is insanity insanity but thats what i wanted and did and though it was difficult it showed me what i could do under such tremendous pressure Master's degree GED Graduate school Education in Romania Education in Taiwan Academia Education in Portugal Capitalism Education in the United States Psychology College University of Maryland Baltimore County Privatization Church of Christ, Scientist Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Hong Kong Political economy Chinese University of Hong Kong Smith College Doctorate SAT Economic inequality Unemployment Exploitation Secondary education in the United States Education in Australia A-level Mathematics Bachelor of Arts Craps Corporate governance Junior Certificate Redundant array of independent disks Bipolar disorder Neuro-linguistic programming Liberalism Economy of India Aikido Quizbowl Economy of Africa Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Otterbein College Transactional analysis Crime The College of New Jersey Education in Austria City and Guilds of London Institute Anti-intellectualism Far Eastern University Hogwarts subjects Unconscious mind University of Massachusetts Amherst Credit card Florida Institute of Technology Bernard Williams Lawyer Sociology Arturo Frondizi Neoclassical economics Northeastern University, Boston Ethics A Course In Miracles IB Diploma Programme Reparative therapy W.
