i want to know some career query is it better to choose chartered accountancy over other careers like engineering mba etc does a chartered accountant get better salary better social status better industrial response compared to other careers a career as an accountant pretty much means you'll be obtaining one of the most secure highest paying jobs out there a bachelor's in accounting has the highest average starting salary out there something like minimum and within three years it has the highest number of people making six figure salaries on top of that it has the highest number of potential employers students ratio something like jobs already sending you job offers months before you even graduate the only big problem that i know of with an accounting degree is that in most situations there's a glass ceiling that comes with the career the degree is not as unlimited in potential as say a management or a finance degree you're pretty much an accountant for your company and that's it also i only recommend accounting if you absolutely love the subject several students i knew that were majoring in it switched majors because they knew they wouldn't have the passion for it no matter how well it paid so for what it's worth please only go with it if you love the subject Graduate school Education in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Portugal Master's degree Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China Mutual fund Corporate governance University of Bristol Salary cap Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in Germany Student loan Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Tax Education in Japan Member of the European Parliament Economic inequality Juris Doctor Athabasca University Unemployment Social Security (United States) Immigration to the United States Salary Credit card Insurance Software engineering Plame affair Electrical engineering Grade (education) Publicly funded medicine Barrister United Kingdom corporation tax Warren Buffett Electronic commerce Lawyer Management information system Management Israeli Arab Social Security debate (United States) Outsourcing Retirement plan Economy of India Nurse 401(k) Bachelor of Arts Accountancy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Health insurance Academia Division of labour Durham University University of Notre Dame Annuity Professor Taxation in the United States Physician Freeters GED Chartered accountant Unemployment benefit Far Eastern University Wheel of Fortune John De Lorean Washington University in St. Louis Epistemology Georgetown University Charter school Game programmer Gross domestic product Economy of the United States Arturo Frondizi Education in Romania National Health Service Apprenticeship Academic degree Database Trinity College, Dublin Pretty Good Privacy Divorce PE ratio College admissions Columbia University Investment bank Discrimination Stock Associate's degree National Insurance U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Lyceum of the Philippines McKinsey & Company Paralegal Batting average Contract Hartz concept Password
