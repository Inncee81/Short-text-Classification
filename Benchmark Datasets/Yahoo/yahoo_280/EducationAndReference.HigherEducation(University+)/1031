college public or private i'm looking at baylor and ut at austin planning on going to med school but of the two only baylor offers pre med i know i could probably major in biology at ut but will it affect my chances of getting to med school also which one would you think is better given a choice i would rather go to big public universities for the lower tuition costs it's all up to you both are great colleges you should make campus visits to both and see which best suits your preferences most med school students got their undergrad degrees in biology so that won't affect your chances of getting into med school the thing they are most interested in for admissions is your undergrad gpa being an active member of student organizations helps as well and i'm sure both schools have a pre med or health care club would you rather be at a big college or a smaller school make the choice that's best for you Education in the United States Medical school Cornell University University of Michigan University of Connecticut Education in Germany University of Texas at Austin Boston University Law school University of California, San Diego Baylor University University of Central Florida Grade (education) Baylor College of Medicine College admissions Education in Portugal California Polytechnic State University Affirmative action Graduate school Middle Tennessee State University Publicly funded medicine Hunter College High School Stanford University Duke University SAT Columbia University Baylor College of Dentistry Georgetown University Temple University Brown University Education in Australia Regent University University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University of California, Riverside Community college Macquarie University University of Maryland Baltimore County Harvard University University of California, Los Angeles Oregon State University Undergrads Grove City College University of Alabama Carnegie Mellon University University of British Columbia Master's degree Pennsylvania State University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology University of Southern California University of North Carolina at Charlotte Ivy League Johns Hopkins University Numerus clausus Education in Malaysia Tulane University University of San Diego Students' union Virginia Commonwealth University University of Washington Franklin W.
