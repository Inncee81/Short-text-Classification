save money or enjoy the college experience i want to go to a year university after i graduate from high school and i want to live in a dorm the problem is it costs per year to live in a dorm which is total not including books my mom said that she would find a way to pay for my room and board money the tuition is taken care of with scholarships she makes about a year though and a year is a lot considering her salary i want to live in the dorms really badly but i hate spending that much of her money and i wouldn't mind going to a community college first but i'd prefer a dorm should i go to a community college for the first years and save in room and board fees or should i take advantage of my mom's offer and have fun thank you they're right that you'll miss the experience of dorm life if you go to a community college it's not all fun on the year school campus sometimes it's having lots of people living with you who're taking the same class and getting ready for the same test who can study with you or finding someone who remembers dna sequences or natural logs or the french pluperfect tense right down the hall another consideration is that going to a community college is associated with taking longer to graduate and with not graduating at all that's probably more about the kinds of students usually lower ability fewer planning to finish in years than about the teachers living at home could wind up costing you more money are all your scholarships transferrable to the community college if you're worried about spending your mom's money start looking now for a summer job that you can use to fund yourself plan to borrow the room and board money for your senior year when you can see the job market ahead for you don't be any more expensive than you have to be only a few flashy clothes take sheets and towels from home and buy used books Graduate school Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Student loan Tuition Emerson College Trinity College, Dublin University of Virginia Publicly funded medicine The Sims 2: University Affirmative action University of Massachusetts Amherst University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Education in Hong Kong University of Central Florida Scholarship Rice University University of Michigan Mutual fund Florida Institute of Technology The Catcher in the Rye California Polytechnic State University Harvey Mudd College Caulfield Grammar School Dormitory Community college New York University Health insurance SAT Duke University Pomona College Georgia Institute of Technology Texas A&M University Boston College Inflation Capital accumulation Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Avenue Q Freed-Hardeman University GED Life insurance Warren Buffett Middle Tennessee State University Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Georgetown University Macalester College Education in Romania Queen's University Great Teacher Onizuka Princeton University Truman State University Kwantlen University College American University Cornell University College Professor Boston University Salt Lake Community College Boise State University Education in England Microeconomics Claremont McKenna College Education in Japan Hamilton College Phillips Exeter Academy Mortgage 401(k) Gross domestic product Bridgewater State College Harvard University Reed College Pennsylvania State University Columbia University Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Code: Lyoko Mount Holyoke College PLATO Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Milton Academy Baylor University Johns Hopkins University Carnegie Mellon University Stock Annuity Wabash College Oh My Goddess!
