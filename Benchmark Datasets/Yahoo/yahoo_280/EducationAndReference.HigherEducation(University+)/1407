high school graduate confused about major i recently finished high school where i mainly studied the sciences my course didn't give me the option of selecting any of the arts in addition to the sciences so i never studied literature history visual arts or anything like that after the years i've come to the conclusion that i don't like maths and want nothing to do with numbers ever again i like biology and was thinking of becoming a dentist my dad's a surgeon but i know it takes so long at the same time i'm a very artistic person love to paint design and write however i don't know if choosing something from here will pay off in the long run can i choose a major in the arts though i don't have any background preparation in that area which majors do you think are good for me first congratulations on finishing high school that is a huge accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourself i do have one quick question for you though have you been accepted to college and will you be attending this fall i will go on the assumption right now that you will be so my answer will be based on that of colleges and universities will let you select a major based on your own interests and skills even if you have absolutely no background or experience in the arts you can select that major if you'd like and you should college students make the mistake of choosing a major based on how much money you will make when you graduate what mom or dad think you should do or choosing something just because you're not sure what will pay off in the long run my advice if you can go into college as an undecided student you can take the first years to decide what major you'd like i can tell you about of the freshman at the university i work for come in as undecided students you can take classes in both the arts and the physical sciences and that will help you define what major to choose you can also take a career assessment which can help you narrow down what majors you'd be interested in there are plenty of them out there the strong the focus they help you identify the skills and interests you have and match them with appropriate career fields it will be easier to narrow down what major to choose once you've done this most importantly talk to your parents i can't tell you how many students that i've met who have been afraid to tell their parents how uncertain they're feeling in the long run it will be helpful your parents i'm sure will be more than willing to talk with you about your future remember most people don't figure out what career they will have when they're and in fact most people change their careers up to six times in their lives you are not alone simply explore your options and talk to people who can help you good luck Education in the United States GED Education in Romania Graduate school College admissions Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Education in Taiwan Advanced Placement Program Homeschooling Medical school Quizbowl Economics Philosophy of mathematics Theory of conduct Massachusetts Institute of Technology Science University of Michigan Secondary education in the United States Ethics Halting problem Physician Education A Course In Miracles University of Maryland Baltimore County Social rule Intelligent design Art Transsexuality Abortion debate Vanderbilt University Doomsday argument Aesthetic Realism Saved by the Bell No Child Left Behind Act U.S. Electoral College Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Singapore The Sims 2: University Robert Hutchins Princeton University Requirements analysis University of Massachusetts Amherst One Tree Hill (TV series) Georgetown University Western philosophy Johns Hopkins University The Adventures of Pete & Pete IB Diploma Programme Economic inequality The Apprentice 2 Goodness and value theory Richard Feynman Sexual orientation College and university rankings Modernism Academia Education in Portugal Harrow School Asperger syndrome The College of New Jersey Columbia University Franklin W.
