i was looking at some colleges and what is the diffrence between a private and a public college a friend and i are going to be starting high school this year and were looking for some art colleges and i found one site wich shows diffrent colleges and universitys in a certain state or city now it shows the name of the college they city its in and what type of college it is and i'd really like to know what the diffrence of a private and public college is a public college is funded by the state government while a private college is funded primarily by tuition and donations this means that the private school is more expensive because tuition is not subsidized by the government public schools are often larger and more crowded at their worst it may be hard to get into the classes you need because they can't afford to hire enough faculty there is sometimes less of a need to please the students because there is a sense that you get what you pay for so you can't expect too much that isn't true of all public schools but particularly at those which are not the state's flagship schools it is common private schools are often smaller and tend to pride themselves on their low student faculty rations so that you get to know the professors unless the school is in financial trouble there are often very updated facilities like the dorms might be newer and there would be more impressive fitness centers along with things like labs and studios for academic areas within each type of school there is a range of quality the very best schools harvard stanford mit etc are pretty much all private but there are some pretty terrible private schools too with public schools the best places like uc berkeley are competitive with the vast majority of schools but the worst can also be pretty bad there are public colleges out there that if they were private and not government subsidized would be out of business Education in the United States Graduate school Tuition Duke University University of Michigan Emerson College Student loan Cornell University New York University College School choice Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Columbia University Rice University University of Toronto University of Houston University of Southern California Texas A&M University Brown University Pennsylvania State University Professor University of Rochester Education in Portugal Harvard University University of Virginia Vanderbilt University Yale University Students' union Affirmative action College and university rankings Boston University Georgetown University University of Pennsylvania Law School Stanford University University of Szeged Private school Massachusetts Institute of Technology Price discrimination Boston College Princeton University Ivy League Education in Germany University of Central Florida Miami University Publicly funded medicine Truman State University University of San Francisco California Polytechnic State University Independent school (UK) Johns Hopkins University University of Tennessee Florida Institute of Technology University of Massachusetts Amherst American University University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Hopkins School University of Alabama Community college Law school Culture of the United States University of Arizona Brigham Young University Hunter College High School Education in France Education in Hong Kong Middle Tennessee State University Public education University of Washington Washington University in St. Louis MIT Sloan School of Management California State University, Long Beach University at Albany Dalhousie University Trinity College, Dublin Dartmouth College University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Bristol Stuyvesant High School University of California Williams College Grade (education) Charter school Savannah College of Art and Design Baylor University University Intelligent design movement The Hidden Curriculum Education in Taiwan Virginia Commonwealth University University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Northeastern University, Boston
