which is better johns hopkins med or duke med i want to go to johns hopkins school of medicine but next year i'll be in duke group my middle school has groups and they do a different kind of group each year and this year is collages and i looked up duke and i like it just as much as johns hopkins i want to be a surgeon so i would attend their medical schools but which is better wow its a bit early to be thinking about which med school you want to go to believe me that when you get to that point unless youre a superstar you will be happy to get into any medical school much less trying to decide between johns hopkins vs duke plus your surgical aspirations maychange a million times before residency all of that aside although as someone said jh ranks higher than duke its important to understand that these rankings are typically based on money the school receives towards research while an important aspect of the quality of the medical school research money doesnt necesarily correalate with quality of clinical instruction which at the end of the day is most important to me as a physician at any rate as a duke alum undergrad t' i'm a bit biased towards duke med its in the warm rural ish south plus their hospital has a cool little train that transports patients throughout the hospital Medicine Johns Hopkins Hospital History of intersex surgery Publicly funded medicine Medical school Hospital Johns Hopkins University Alternative medicine Triage Abortion Asthma Malaria Pneumonia Pulmonary hypertension Podiatrist Stanford University School of Medicine Psychiatry Homeopathy Stroke Weill Cornell Medical College Prostate cancer Duke University School of Medicine Bipolar disorder Ayurveda General practitioner Surgery Organ transplant Migraine Medical analysis of circumcision Placebo effect Rabies Pharmaceutical company Autism Nurse Dafydd Williams Evidence-based medicine Duke University Cancer Osteopathy Ambulance Washington University in St. Louis Folic acid The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio History of medicine Denton Cooley Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma William Stewart Halsted Bioethics of neonatal circumcision New York University Randomized controlled trial New England Journal of Medicine Public health in mainland China Stomach cancer American Medical Association Acupuncture Phimosis Medical malpractice First aid Bill Frist Education in the United States Health maintenance organization Medical University of South Carolina Common cold Malignant melanoma Education in the People's Republic of China Medical record Medical College Calcutta Chinese University of Hong Kong Mesothelioma Master's degree Obesity Chagas disease Sleep apnea McGill University Schizophrenia Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons Hypoglycemia Colorectal cancer Growth hormone treatment Atherosclerosis Traditional Chinese medicine Clinical depression Charles Darwin's illness Emergency medical technician Medicare (United States) Multiple sclerosis Doctor University of Nottingham Emergency Medical Services St John's wort Jayant Patel University of Michigan Ophthalmology Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sex assignment Vanderbilt University
