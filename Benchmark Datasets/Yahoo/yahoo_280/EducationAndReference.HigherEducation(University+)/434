how do i find an academic job in the us is there a search engine like jobs ac uk which lists jobs in american universities www chronicle com is the website for the chronicle of higher education which lists many of the academic jobs in the u s know though that unless you are a star and the departments try to recruit you or if you are in a field that is desperate for faculty most schools would rather hire domestically especially if you are already mid career or got your degree from a university outside the u s also while as i stated the chronicle is probably the most common vehicle for announcing faculty positions more disciplines lately have turned to listservs within their fields to make such announcements they are more likely to draw qualified applicants in my discipline for example we for many years used the chronicle and various other print format vehicles to list our positions we were flooded by applications from those in other overcrowded disciplines who were convinced they could teach courses in ours we still get a little of that since we need to post broadly for affirmative action reasons but when we post on the listserv we get almost exclusively applications from those who at the very least are in the right discipline for the job i should also mention that most universities in the u s do their initial round of interviews at the annual conferences in their disciplines so most jobs are posted only in the few months leading up to those someone else mentioned monster com that is a general job listing site but i've never seen an academic job listed there i use it extensively to find jobs for my students but i would never look for a job for myself there Graduate school Professor Education in Portugal Academia Affirmative action Cornell University Education in the People's Republic of China University of Bristol Doctorate College Software engineering Master's degree University of Michigan Medical school Physician Dublin City University University of Szeged The College of New Jersey College admissions Lawyer Academic degree University of Coimbra Education in the United States Simon Fraser University Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Master of Business Administration Boston College Bilkent University University Education in Australia Uppsala University United States Naval Academy Trinity College, Dublin Oregon State University University of Maryland Baltimore County Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Sweden Darmstadt University of Technology Middle Tennessee State University Education in Germany University of North Carolina at Charlotte Tianjin University Vanderbilt University University of Cambridge Librarian Columbia University A-level University of Alabama Carnegie Mellon University University of California, Los Angeles University of California University of Notre Dame Cooperative education University of Maryland, College Park American University Open University Open access Brigham Young University Marshall University San Diego State University Duke University Intelligent design movement Psychology United States Air Force Academy Institute for Christian Studies Law school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus GED Massachusetts Institute of Technology North Carolina State University Higher education Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee University of Pennsylvania Law School Doctor of Philosophy Air Education and Training Command PHP Plame affair __cole Polytechnique Brown University City and Guilds of London Institute Pennsylvania State University Lecturer Community college University of Washington University of Glasgow College and university rankings Israeli Arab University of Canterbury William A.
