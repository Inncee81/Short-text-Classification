how do i visit home if i work part time during college two hours away from home and was wondering how easy it is to take time off of work to visit family during a few weekends or holidays if you take a job that was designed for a student then it is quite easy because employers often expect that you would be away for holidays you may need to shorten your holiday somewhat though to make it easier for the employer to get by if the job is just a job it becomes more difficult and you may have to use vacation time if your job gives you any and visit your family less frequently the problem with that is that the dorms are usually shut down during major holidays and you might not have anywhere to stay this may depend upon the number of students from out of state and international students at your university though Graduate school Tourism Unemployment Education in Germany University of Massachusetts Amherst GED Long Island University C.W.
