college out of the country i am senior and i have been thinking about going out of the country for college for years now the problem is i have bad grades and no money does anyone know how they deal with transfers as i might have to transfer out of a us school after i save money particularly canada qu bec france and england should i go through a us college or one based out of the us also is there any help i can get anywhere the faculty at my high school won't help and i only have a few uk websites like ucas honestly your best bet is to a go to a us college first and do really good out the gate and b research for foreign programs on your own b c high school nor college counseling centers are much help start at the site i listed from there you can find more info go to a us college that has an international education abroad program and try to do it your second year if you do good there you can apply for transfer to a foreign school or i know people in my undergrad who spent of their undergrad in various foreign colleges doing study abroad programs throughout college so it was like they had transferred you just have to find the school for you also unless you speak french and can test well in it france may not be an option as most schools have a strict language requirement the school i'll be attending in london even goes as far as to make those who don't quite pass the language requirements to attend summer school at their own expense and if they don't pass they don't get in and that's gradute school and with english well most european colleges their standards are a little higher so it may be tough to go directly from high school to there it was hard enough for me from undergrad to grad lastly there are american school that have international locations like american university but they have high admission standards like i said you best bet is to do the internet research yourself on schools that have goos study abroad programs good luck Graduate school Education in the United States College Education in the People's Republic of China Education in France High school College admissions Education in Romania Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Portugal A-level Grade (education) Education in Australia IB Diploma Programme Advanced Placement Program Law school Medical school GED Middle East Technical University Lawyer Johns Hopkins University American University Education in Malaysia No Child Left Behind Act Affirmative action Education in Taiwan Georgetown University UCAS Education in Singapore Leaving Certificate Appeal Brigham Young University Bilkent University Undergrads Seneca College Regent University Physician Queen's School of Business Education Secondary education in Japan University of Connecticut Secondary education in the United States Master's degree Culture of the United States Bologna process Education in Qu__bec Gross domestic product Associate's degree Education in Japan College and university rankings Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Craps Warsaw University York University Education in Sweden Dentistry Cornell University Marshall Plan Chinese University of Hong Kong Higher education in Japan Esperanto as an international language Mathematics __cole Polytechnique University Community college Kalamazoo College United States Air Force Academy University of Pennsylvania Tariff Middle Tennessee State University Rice University Blackjack University of Toronto English language Gymnasium (Denmark) Foreign language Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gold standard Charles William Eliot Education in the Republic of Ireland Food and Drug Administration Education in Finland University of Arizona Darmstadt University of Technology Study abroad University of California, San Diego City and Guilds of London Institute
