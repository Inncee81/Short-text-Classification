first week of college im starting the university of south alabama this fall i move in on aug and class starts aug im so nervous i mean i will know noone down thier and i wont go home again till christmas break im taking a max hours and im nervous about my classes as i have no freaking clue where none of them are how are first week of college pretty much easy or hard any comments would be great are there usually alot of partys my ideas go a day early and stay in a hotel if you can so that you can visually identify where you need to be the next day at your residence hall or apartment read your college catalog religiously so that you have a firm grasp on what classes you need to take to meet both distribution requirements and major requirements note particularly when drop add begins and ends walk around campus as soon as you get moved in so that you can get a feel of where the studying goes on and where the fun is you can also see where the classroom buildings are so that when someone tells you yeah that's in science hall you won't have to look at a map as much put something on the outside of your room door that lets your hallmates know what kind of person you are i like anime so i would put an anime poster on my dorm door nowadays bring a car and your hallmates or neighbors will love you when it is grocery shopping time find a ride board or similar ridesharing exchange and try to make a trip home or two that first semester or quarter away despite your plan to wait until christmas barring that build in a trip away maybe biloxi pensacola beach gulf shores so that you have something to look forward to even if you can't make it home the first week is harder in terms of adjustment to your new life than it is academically many teachers just hand out a syllabus or calendar of planned lessons for the term and set you free on the first day you'll want to check out your college bookstore as soon as you can to get books so you can read ahead for your next lesson though and you may have to time that visit well or else get used to long checkout lines there are usually a few campuswide or freshmen only parties in the first week and you should show up for part of them if you can just to see who might be interesting company and or potential study buddies but try not to worry usa wouldn't have admitted you if you weren't prepared to be a student and colleges in general are very good about helping new students make transitions do make an effort to speak to your classmates on your first day before or after each class and don't miss any orientation sessions your school offers good luck college is such a fun part of life if you play your cards right Massachusetts Institute of Technology Poker jargon Education in Germany University of Massachusetts Amherst Education in the United States Florida Institute of Technology Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amazing Race Emerson College College University of Central Florida Freed-Hardeman University The Catcher in the Rye The Citadel (Military College) Homeschooling Trinity College (Connecticut) University of Houston American University Rice University Georgetown University Georgia Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China GED Juris Doctor Maison Ikkoku Great Teacher Onizuka Tulane University Duke University Wheel of Fortune Cornell University Social rule Merrimack College One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Virginia Commonwealth University Education in Japan Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Phillips Exeter Academy Yearbook Can't Hardly Wait Undergrads Harvey Mudd College University of Tennessee at Chattanooga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Graduate school The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jon Secada Boston College University of California, Irvine Princeton University FoxTrot University of Virginia Mid-levels Bridgewater State College Friends Trinity College, Dublin Marching band Jumpstart 3rd Grade Dormitory Columbine High School massacre Good Times Gwinnett University Center Auburn University E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
