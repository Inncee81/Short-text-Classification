what level of college should i attend i am thinking about attending college should i start with a community college or start with a four year program or try a vocational trainging program i am interested in computers writing art but i really cannot decide what i should major in looking for serious answers where you want to start will depend on your grades test scores of course if for some reason you don't make the cut with those its fairly easy to transfer from a community college to a yr university i am at uc berkeley and there are plenty of transfers from city and community colleges from what i know vocational training is a bit more limiting a yr college is going to give you the most options you do not need to know what you want to major in before you apply some schools require you to apply to a separate program for computer science but you could always apply to the computer program after you are admitted as a general student i know some sophmores in college who haven't declared a major yet also looking for financial aid options is never a waste of time grades and extracurricular activities like sports and community service are the key here and of course you must be able to prove financial need don't let money limit your choices when it comes to going to a good school Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China College admissions GED Education in Romania Education in Germany Graduate school College Juris Doctor Student loan Education in Sweden Students' union Associate's degree Education in Finland Community college Education in Taiwan Education in Hong Kong Quizbowl Education in Australia California Polytechnic State University Seneca College Education in Malaysia UCAS Chinese University of Hong Kong Grade (education) Hunter College High School National Certificate of Educational Achievement University of California, San Diego Salt Lake Community College Homeschooling Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Physician IB Diploma Programme Law school Hopkins School Secondary education in the United States Lynbrook High School CPU cache Trinity College, Dublin PLATO A-level Education in England Theory of conduct Test (student assessment) Public education Affirmative action Georgetown University Education in Canada City and Guilds of London Institute Economics Bilkent University Numerus clausus Franklin W.
