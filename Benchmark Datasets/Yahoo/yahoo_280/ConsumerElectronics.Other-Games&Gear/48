rate my pokemon diamond team team pearl please make any suggestions comments or friendly criticisms this team is untested wifi but i'm sure it'll be great but most importantly don't just leave a plain comment say why and what i can do to improve milotic nature mild moves recover mirror coat hydro pump ice beam item focus band tyranitar nature lax moves stone edge earthquake crunch rock polish item leftovers exeggutor nature modest moves sunny day solar beam synthesis psychic item heat rock extends sunny day arcanine nature adament moves crunch extreme speed flare blitz dig item shell bell metagross nature lax moves hammer arm meteor mash zen headbutt explosion item wide lens magnezone mirror coat magnet rise thunderbolt thunder wave item undecided note magnezone i know i know too many electric moves when i get another flash cannon tm i'm takin out mirror coat for it exeggutors ability doubles it's own speed but i do agree with you my team does have pretty low speed modest natures works better than mild but otherwise your milotic's good to go i personally prefer surf instead of ice beam because it has higher accuracy but it's up to you because dig takes two turns it becomes a little easy for the other team to predict howl or fire fang are two other options instead of dig lax is not a good nature since it lowers defense for special defense my friend likes psycho cut instead of meteor mash because of accuracy issues don't get rid of thunderwave on magnezone it's useful and very annoying exploding metagross is nasty especially against tanks or walls like blissey exeggutor isn't commonly used and though it's low speed is something to worry about its other stats aren't too bad i don't know how useful rock polish would be on tyranitar but i can't think of a move to replace it atm your team is nicely balanced but what i'd worry about is speed the fastest pokemon on your team is arcanine which has base speed a lot of your pokemon have high defenses but a lot of fast ou pokemon also have high attack sp atk Pok__mon types GunBound Tank Items in the Metroid series RuneScape weapons Aggron Volleyball Wild ARMs 2 Naruto jutsu Drill bit Final Fantasy magic Robot Master Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bagon Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Brewery Limit Break Metagross Laser Glass Solar power Combine (Half-Life 2) Pok__mon Colosseum Quake III Arena Universal Century Technology Team Fortress Classic Explosive material Nuclear weapon design Sun Milotic Equine conformation Casting Steam engine Shen Gong Wu Sceptile Messerschmitt Bf 109 Pok__mon Gold and Silver Tribes 2 Cosmic Era technology Super Metroid Mars Exploration Rover Hydrogen economy Exeggutor Tank classification Unreal Fast bowling Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Pottery R-Type Diamond Team Rocket Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Jet engine EXpanded MultiPlayer A-10 Thunderbolt II Seismic retrofit Defense of the Ancients Wind turbine Opportunity rover Speed of light Theory of conduct RuneScape Blood (computer game) B-47 Stratojet Orre Diamond simulant Plastic Vacuum Diesel engine Outpost 2 Terran (StarCraft) Internal ballistics Deoxys Diablo II Lightning Cosmic Era list of characters Carbon dioxide Protoss Tenshinhan Railgun Guilty Gear Piccolo Junior Saga Zerg The Legend of Zelda series enemies Blaziken Armored Core Characters of Naruto Transformers: Cybertron Sacrifice (computer game) Helium
