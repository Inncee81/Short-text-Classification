which system to get grand theft auto iv on i'm trying to decide which system to get it on either pc xbox or ps i don't own a ps but i would definately buy one if the game is going to be better on it i always like the gta games on ps more than xbox they didn't seem the same on xbox although that might be beacuse they were ported this time it isn't being ported so it might turn out better the reason i would want on pc is simply because i love to mod after i've completed the game but the problem is some games run rather laggy on my pc i have gta san andreas and it lags sometimes especailly when you are flying and you go to high then it's like frame s anyway i don't plan on upgrading my computer so do you think the xbox version will be just as good as the others i can't wait til this game comes out it looks sweet and i need to have it on the better system is the better option as of right now being as it will have downloadable content unlike the the ps over all i would say pc but that might not come out for another year the downloadable content add's like a more hours game play in all new missions Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Xbox Grand Theft Auto III PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto (game) Hot Coffee mod Rockstar North The Sims 2 Xbox Live Video game controversy Xbox 360 Computer and video games Counter-Strike Claude Speed Electronic Arts Grand Theft Auto Advance Nintendo Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Halo 2 Steam (content delivery) Need for Speed Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Censorship in Australia Computer role-playing game Mod (computer gaming) Nintendo Revolution Expansion pack Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Nintendo GameCube Jack Thompson Game programmer Game programming Entertainment Software Rating Board Quake Warez Modchip The Sims PlayStation 3 Star Wars: Galaxies Bubble Bobble Half-Life Lag Frame rate Doom 3 Take Two Interactive Quake II History of computer and video games Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon IBM PC compatible OutRun 2 Quake III Arena True Crime: Streets of LA PlayStation Portable Ninja Gaiden Atari 8-bit family Half-Life 2 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Postal__ RollerCoaster Tycoon History of operating systems Nintendo Entertainment System Gradius Abandonware Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack Action Replay America's Army MAME Musical Instrument Digital Interface Cheating in Counter-Strike The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Video game music Game Boy Deus Ex: Invisible War GunZ The Duel GameFAQs History of video games (Sixth generation era) Poker jargon Mach kernel Galactic Civilizations Console game Liberty City (fictional) Rare (video game company) PowerPC FIFA Series Radeon GO Transit Penny Arcade (comic) Jade Empire Universal Serial Bus 400-Series Highways Linux kernel
