what's better psp or nintendo ds what are the pros and cons of each points to best answer im thinking of buying one of them but im not sure which one note in order to be eligible for the points you must list the pros and cons of each system psp pros design is really sleek casual gamers will be more enticed by psp s looks than by the ds third party support is very strong developers like to deal with sony over the other companies graphics are close to the playstation capability to play games along with movies and music has usb connectivity this has great potential analog stick allows for better gaming also same control layout as ps controllers will allow for easy ps ports or ps game sequels psp cons sony has a reputation for fragile devices and it doesn t seem too sturdy but this is just a thought not confirmed the screen does not have any protection so scratches are an issue sony does not have a very strong first party line up or even must have games they need a really big game that will lure people to the psp the battery life of the psp will be a very big issue at the moment it seems as though the batteries will allow for a little over hours with movies hours with games and to hours with music having a disc means that loading times will be a bit slower and these also contribute to the battery life being short everything in the pros sections contributes to this con the price many people will not want to lay down more cash for a handheld then what the xbox may cost of course you get what you pay for and the currently estimated usd price tag certainly is worth it even if many aren t willing to pay that much ds pros it has a unique design that is very attractive to the general public and also has a clamshell design to protect the screens the ds has two screens which will allow for very unique games the touch screen can also play as a virtual analog stick or mouse one of the screens is a touch screen this allows for unthinkable innovation and we hope to have some truly revolutionary games ds will once again use cartridges but this time they will contain much more size over gigabyte and no loading time battery life will not be an issue with the ds with around hours each time around the price of the ds will be quite low at the first party games of the ds are very strong games like metroid prime super mario x and animal crossing will surely make the psp jealous ds cons even with the sleek design of the ds it will not be as tempting to the mainstream gamer as the psp will there is no analog stick and with many gamers when playing a d game the analog stick is a must have no games have even come close to using the touch screen to its potential also if games do not set an option for lefties in games they will have a very hard time with the ds the graphics of the ds are much weaker than the psp the ds will have graphics close to or a bit better than the n while the psp will be close to the ps this is a very large difference not a direct con with this pro but an important one ds needs to draw in older audiences as well its image of a kids company does not help the ds at all the third party lineup for the ds is not very strong at the moment nintendo really isn t known for third party support and it is shown here again Xbox Sega Xbox 360 Console wars Nintendo Entertainment System Game Boy Game controller Game Boy Advance Mouse (computing) Console game Sega Dreamcast Sony Computer Entertainment History of computer and video games USB flash drive N-Gage Platform game Universal Serial Bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Laptop Game Boy Advance SP Video game music Intellivision Action Replay The Legend of Zelda series Electronic Arts The Sims 2 Chrono Trigger TurboGrafx 16 First-person shooter Atari 8-bit family IBM PC compatible History of video games (Sixth generation era) PC Engine IMac Gradius Floppy disk Game programmer Wipeout (game) Apple Macintosh Worms (computer game) Console emulator GamePark History of video games (16-bit era) Hard disk MMORPG Commodore International Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Atari ST Boss (video games) Lemmings (computer game) Copy protection Poker jargon Bubble Bobble Modchip DVD Atari 2600 Crash Bandicoot MAME Sega Game Gear Atari Lynx Timeline of computing 1990-forward CD-i Sony The Sims Resident Evil 2 Spider-Man ATI Technologies Memory Stick DualShock ZX Spectrum Gameking Regional lockout Adventure game Counter-Strike Atari
