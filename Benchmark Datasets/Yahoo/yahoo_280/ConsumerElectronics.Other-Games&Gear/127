i have a psp ta motherboard what would happen if i downgrade it if i downgrade it would i be able to upgrade it again using an official firmware from sony i heard that psp with ta that has been downgraded cannot be upgraded using an official upgrade so you want to downgrade to then upgrade to a different stock firmware whats the point of that if you spent all this time downgrading to you might as well update to a custom firmware so you can homebrew the newest custom firmware m gives you every single feature the sony firmware gives you plus the ability to play downloaded games emulators and other applications PlayStation Portable Homebrew (video games) Modchip Universal Media Disc Verizon Wireless MSX Sega Dreamcast Wipeout (game) PlayStation 3 GamePark Hot Shots Golf (series) Xbox Sony Computer Entertainment IPod Game Boy GBA Movie Player Apple Macintosh Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories PlayStation 2 ITunes BIOS Advanced Audio Coding Sound Blaster Mandriva Linux Microsoft Regional lockout Nintendo Patch (computing) Handheld game console Copy protection Steam (content delivery) Microsoft Windows Vorbis Atari ST Object Desktop ITunes Music Store ZX Spectrum IBM PC compatible SubSpace (computer game) VAIO Mac OS X Windows 2000 BitTorrent Asian financial crisis Apple IIGS Street Fighter Alpha Floppy disk Star Wars: Galaxies Treo 650 Championship Manager Acorn Electron Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo Revolution Read-only memory Worms (computer game) Counter-Strike Power Macintosh G3 Apple Intel transition Mikoyan MiG-29 Game Boy Advance Debugging Danger Hiptop Creative Zen Windows XP PowerBook 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Console wars IBM POWER Need for Speed ABIT PlayStation (original) MIPS Magnum Video game music GeForce 6 Series Namco Museum MAME Extensible Firmware Interface Final Fantasy (video game) TiVo Power Mac G5 Ultima Online SAM Coup__ OpenVMS Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mac OS 9 Console emulator April 1, 2005 Windows Vista Intellivision Linux Football Manager Xbox 360 GP2X DVD BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Protoss Amiga
