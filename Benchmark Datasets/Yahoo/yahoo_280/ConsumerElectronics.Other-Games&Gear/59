if i downgrade my something psp will i loose internet abilities is it a bad idea to downgrade i keep hearing people talk about downgrading there psp what's the benefits what's the cons the second poster was right but to go into a little more detail yes if you downgrade to and stay there you wont have the internet however very few people stay at once they downgrade they usually update to a custom firmware which is only possible with sony the custom firmwares give you all the benefits of the sony firmwares so when you hear the cfw oea it means that it has all the abilities of the sony firmware plus the ability to homebrew which are applications made by people that dont have any legal affiliation with sony sony requires you to update your psp for newer games and with custom firmware you simply wait a couple weeks until someone comes out with an updated cfw that will work with the game the newest sony firmware is the newest custom firmware is m so any game that requires you to update to can be played with that cfw there are a few cons say a brand new sony firmware came out say you bought a game today that required a update it does take some time for the custom firmware guys to make a custom so you may wait a few weeks to be able to play it if you do a halfass job downgrading or updating your psp you can ruin it but there are so many psp forums ask questions until youre positive on how to do it i was very nervous about downgrading but once i found all the info i was very confident that i wouldnt have any problems PlayStation Portable Verizon Wireless Copy protection PlayStation 3 Homebrew (video games) Universal Media Disc Regional lockout Nintendo DS Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories IPod Sega Dreamcast Sony Vorbis Wipeout (game) Patch (computing) Computer and video games Apple Macintosh Steam (content delivery) Domain Name System MAME Floppy disk GameFAQs Nintendo ITunes Mega Man Legends Championship Manager Sega Software testing DVD FairPlay ITunes Music Store The Sims 2 Street Fighter Alpha IGN Game Boy Console wars GamePark MMORPG Hot Shots Golf (series) Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Tungsten Handheld Advanced Audio Coding Ford Motor Company Electronic Arts Counter-Strike BitTorrent Handheld game console Football Manager Microsoft Married... with Children Windows XP Syphon Filter Wheel of Fortune Game programming WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Debugging RISC Sony Computer Entertainment Internet fraud Apple Intel transition 24 Hours of Le Mans Customer relationship management Xbox GameSpot BlackBerry Something Awful RuneScape Mandriva Linux Poker jargon Health insurance Cheating in Counter-Strike Sender Policy Framework Final Fantasy XI Breath of Fire III Sony Corp. of America v.
