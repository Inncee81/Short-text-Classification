charging nintendo ds lite using ac powered usb cable i have a usb to ndsl cable which charges normally on my laptop i am looking for a ac power adapter to fit my usb and indirectly charge my ndsl through it i have tried using the hp's ipaq rw usb adapter with my ndsl cable and it charges well too i am just not too sure of what the digits on the adapter input ac v hz ma output dc v a max is this safe for charging ndsl if not what should the the number i have to look out for when buying the adapter i've seen ma models out there any form of usb charger is fine they all operate on volts which is within the safe range for charging the ds lite and as for the current ma that does not matter that only determines how fast it will charge lower ma means a slower charge time a normal usb port on a computer will provide up to ma at volts so anything around there is fine the ds lite will draw up to ma when charging so i would recommend you get the ma version as it is closer to the specifications of the ds lite charger Universal Serial Bus USB flash drive PlayStation Portable Hard disk IPod Apple Macintosh FireWire Laptop Xbox 360 Nintendo GameCube Bluetooth Secure Digital card Loudspeaker Super Nintendo Entertainment System RS-232 SCSI Oscilloscope Mouse (computing) Nintendo Revolution PowerPC Xbox IBook CompactFlash Computer Operational amplifier Decibel Musical Instrument Digital Interface Game Boy Transformer PlayStation 3 ATI Technologies Architecture of Windows 2000 Closed-circuit television PlayStation 2 Memory card Timeline of computing 1990-forward Analog-to-digital converter Sharp Zaurus CMOS Circuit design Central processing unit Power Mac G4 Cube Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART Battery (electricity) Nickel metal hydride Computer bus Battery electric vehicle Digital photography USB mass storage device class Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sound card Digital audio player Port (computing) DVD Anchor IMac Diode Game Boy Advance SP C plus plus IPAQ Computer hardware Logic families Volt GSM services Pocket PC Fuse (electrical) Archos Incandescent light bulb Creative Zen Transistor-transistor logic Electrical wiring Mach kernel Atari ST Image scanner Embedded system Windows XP ZX Spectrum AirPort Parallel port PC Engine N-Gage Wi-Fi Sound Blaster Cable television Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Digital circuit Commodore International Ford Ranger EV MIM-23 Hawk Phantom power Sega Saturn MicroATX Linux kernel Variable Frequency Drive Dongle Jack plug
