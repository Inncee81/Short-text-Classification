harvest moon players only please ok i have a seed maker and it says you can put fertilizer in it to make better seeds i cant figure out how to do it anyone know yea you put the harvested fruit in it the crops basically have levels seeds from the market are level if you sow seeds more than once over the same soil it then there is a chance that the fruit will be a level higher than what the seeds were so if you plant two sets of supermarket seeds then their fruit should be level you can put this level fruit in the maker and then you can repeat to get level fruit and so on the shipping price increases with the level of the fruit that you produce according to the equation of shipping price equals base price times level squared so that higher level fruit can make a ton of money Agriculture Peanut Organic food Fruit Famine Green Revolution Hemp Banana Seed Tobacco Black pepper Alcohol fuel Fruit tree propagation Rambutan Garden Strawberry Potato Vanilla Flowering plant Weed control Alfalfa Global warming and agriculture Inflation Illegal drug trade Microeconomics Deforestation Cereal Sugar beet Slot machine Monsanto Barley Norman Borlaug Loganberry Combine harvester Coffea Compost Maize Sowing Sustainable agriculture Sorghum Organic certification Agriculture in Australia Wheat Watermelon Common Agricultural Policy Diminishing returns Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Biodiesel Monetary policy Turnip (brassica rapa) Cannabis cultivation Sugar Community-supported agriculture Jute American individualist anarchism RuneScape weapons Acorn Coconut Monopoly (game) Flax History of aerial topdressing in New Zealand Local food Palouse Sugarcane Buckwheat Economy of Pakistan Uranium Supply and demand Vegetarianism Plant Cotton Pollination Species Olive Fish farming RuneScape skills Pine Soil science Monopoly Technical analysis Economy of Egypt Ice cream Wine Tesco Neolithic Revolution Economy of Moldova Sunflower Comfrey Onion Plough Soil pH Truffle Money supply Nuclear power Habanero chile Banksia Livestock Avocado
