nintendo ds should i buy a ds ive seen them and seen the games and they seem great but im not sure if it will be a waste of my money most people will think im crazy because i already have a psp which i will continue to play on aswell if i do get a ds but the ds seems to have some things that the psp dosent for instance the brain games and the pokemon games im not a huge fan of pokemon but the look of the trade game thingy looks funn what do you think are they worth thanks buy one on ebay with a couple of games with it you should get a new one with one or games for around all in i was in the same boat as you with the psp etc and just bought one with a couple of games and am hooked it's different to the psp the style of games seems to be more strategic puzzles and mysteries etc the psp is good for rpgs and action games button bashing stuff but the ds is more focused on mind games things that make you think if you like this sort of thing i suggest you go for it worst case you can sell it on ebay if you don't like it suggest you get a game called hotel dusk room it's an interactive mystery game Computer and video games Sega Pok__mon (video games) Game Boy Computer role-playing game Nintendo PlayStation Portable Wheel of Fortune The Legend of Zelda series Poker jargon Adventure game Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Crystal Handheld game console Animal Crossing Game Boy Advance The Sims Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Breath of Fire III Mario Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Console wars PlayStation 3 Handheld video game Monopoly (game) Katamari Damacy Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Pok__mon History of computer and video games Electronic Arts Pok__mon Trading Card Game Chrono Trigger First-person shooter Game theory Nintendo DS The Sims 2 SpongeBob SquarePants Tekken The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Wipeout (game) Betting (poker) Doomtown ROM image Pok__mon Mysterious Dungeon Sony Computer Entertainment Neopets Tomb Raider Ives Manufacturing Company Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Console game Dualism (philosophy of mind) MAME Mortal Kombat Nintendo Entertainment System Boss (video games) G-Man (Half-Life) Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Collectible card game Mega Man Legends Paintball Star Trek Customizable Card Game Xbox Magic: The Gathering Online The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker MMORPG N-Gage Atari Baseball Stars Super Nintendo Entertainment System Gross domestic product Nintendo Revolution Sonic Adventure Regional lockout WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Syphon Filter Best Friends Forever Otakon Game controller Tetris Attack IGN Game Game Critics Awards Live 8 1957 World Series Legacy of Kain BloodRayne Virtual economy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Nintendo GameCube The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Lemmings (computer game) Need for Speed EverQuest Pok__mon Stadium Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Video game developer Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Super Mario 64 GamePark Dungeons & Dragons
