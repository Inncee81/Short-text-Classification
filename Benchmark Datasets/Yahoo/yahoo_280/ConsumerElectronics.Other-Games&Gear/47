rate my pokemon diamond team team please make any suggestions comments or friendly criticisms this team is untested wifi but i'm sure it'll be great but most importantly don't just leave a plain comment say why and what i can do to improve milotic nature mild moves recover mirror coat hydro pump ice beam item focus band tyranitar nature lax moves stone edge earthquake crunch rock polish item leftovers exeggutor nature modest moves sunny day solar beam synthesis psychic item heat rock extends sunny day arcanine nature adament moves crunch extreme speed flare blitz dig item shell bell metagross nature lax moves hammer arm meteor mash zen headbutt explosion item wide lens magnezone mirror coat magnet rise thunderbolt thunder wave item undecided note magnezone i know i know too many electric moves when i get another flash cannon tm i'm takin out mirror coat for it milotic first thing that nature isn't too good for her i suggest bold if you want to be defensive or modest if you plan on being more offensive also don't use hydro pump the accuracy is too low use surf instead also leftovers is better for her so that she can stay in the game longer i like the mirror coat on her though genious tyranitar you did really good on him he covers a lot of pokemon types his nature is even decent although he could be better adamant but if he is already trained keep him the way he is good job exeggutor this is one of the best exeggutors i have seen kudos he is practically perfect in every way arcanine good job once again you might want to get rid of fire blitz and replace it with fire fang or flame thrower also shell bell isn't the best item but it works pretty well metagross ' i dont have much experience with these but from the looks of it he is looking pretty good magnezone his moves are a bit iffy but once you get flash connon over mirror coat he will be really good i would suggest trying to find more leftovers as an item but if you can't get a hold of anything like that attempt to find a simple item to boost his moves a bit hope i helped and im not trying to sound rude im just trying to help Pok__mon types Items in the Metroid series Aggron RuneScape weapons Explosive material Final Fantasy magic Tank Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cosmic Era technology Milotic GunBound Solar power Bagon Drill bit Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Metroid Prime Mars Exploration Rover Directed-energy weapon Nuclear weapon design Naruto jutsu Diablo II Universal Century Technology Wild ARMs 2 Exeggutor Metagross Quake III Arena Blood (computer game) Combine (Half-Life 2) Team Fortress Classic Team Rocket Robot Master Metroid Prime 2: Echoes Super Metroid Steam engine Laser Trench warfare Light Piccolo Junior Saga Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Gold and Silver Hydrogen Lightning Flygon New York Jets Glass Orre Internal ballistics Tribes 2 The Legend of Zelda series enemies Vacuum tube Vacuum Queen (band) Energy development Solar cell The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Speed of light Naval mine Unreal The Suffering (game) Heinkel He 112 M16 (rifle) Fusion power Lightsaber Tenshinhan Brewery Tank classification Natural Selection (computer game) Seismic retrofit Bomberman Aurora (astronomy) Loudspeaker B-47 Stratojet Hubble Space Telescope Wind turbine Natural disaster Seismometer Heinkel He 100 Solar system Messerschmitt Bf 109 Age of Mythology Radar Transformers: Cybertron A-10 Thunderbolt II Jet engine Advance Wars: Dual Strike Shell (projectile) Firearm AIM-9 Sidewinder
