when interviewing avoid talking salary but what if they really persist help i'm perplexed i keep coming across employers who really try to screen me out right away on the salary part they want to know how much am i looking for and when i try to avoid the question at all costs as the numerous books and jobs boards say to do these employers get really pushy about it to the point where they may raise their voice or totally stop the interview till i answer ofcourse i explain it depends on the position i'm negotiable i try to turn the tables by saying are you offering me the job it's like pulling my teeth then when i do say an amount sometimes i am in the range of what they were going to pay sometimes other times i am way to high which i am not but this whole process seems to leave a bad atmosphere after wards what am i supposed to think do or say about this just blab the wages first time they ask if the employer asks you about what you expect for pay then they have opened the door for you to answer it's not inappropriate to answer when this happens however you should not be the one to ask about the pay first actually when you put up such a defense when the employer asks the question regarding pay it really makes you look like you are hard to get along with and would not be able to work well with others Social rule Inflation Labor theory of value Efficiency wages Microeconomics The Doctor Dances Blackjack Economic inequality National Kidney Foundation Singapore Poker jargon Plame affair Extreme Programming Salary Wheel of Fortune Minimum wage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Economics $ale of the Century Tax Game programmer Social Security (United States) GNU General Public License G-Man (Half-Life) Graduate school Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Unemployment Labour economics Monetary policy Expert system Health insurance Keynesian economics Mutual fund Employment The Parting of the Ways Labor-power Flat tax Capitalism Swedish allotment system Student loan Wage Rick Santorum Principal-agent problem Division of labour Surplus labour Outsourcing Professor The Princeton Review Rent (musical) Unemployment benefit Taxation in the United States Drug test Insurance Progressive tax The Time Machine Steve Jobs Trade union Compensation of employees Slot machine ACORN 401(k) The Joker's Wild Bad Wolf Credit card Call centre Working time Interview Salary cap Alan Keyes Theory of the firm Little Britain Avenue Q Warren Buffett 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio The Shining (film) Supply and demand Air traffic controller Freeters Anarchism and capitalism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glen Jacobs GED Software engineering Volleyball The nature of God in Western theology Offshoring Carl Barks I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue British House of Commons God Emperor of Dune Publicly funded medicine James Randi Gas metal arc welding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tariff Conscription SAT SCO-Linux controversies Betting (poker)
