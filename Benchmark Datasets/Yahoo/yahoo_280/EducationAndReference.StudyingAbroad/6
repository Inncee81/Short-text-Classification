how do foreign employers look at foreign degrees for example how would a us employer look at a degree from a foreign institution and visa versa a foreign employer and an applicant with a us degree with a lot of bias if you have a uk degree most countries see it as a higher qualification than a us degree if you have an eastern european or russian degree western countries degrade it to a diploma even though the chances are that it's probably a higher qualified degree than both the us and the uk apart from national bias it can also depend on the individual uni if you hold a degree from oxford or cambridge you are almost guaranteed to work anywhere in the world regardless of how stupid you really are as for the us a place like yale will open doors with us controlled companies ngos etc and yet the same applies many dumb people come form the likes of yale as many dumb people come from oxford as for actually looking at a degree in most cases for top jobs it's more of a school tie gets you the position rather than your skills qualifications and experience Graduate school Master's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Lawyer Juris Doctor Immigration to the United States College Professor University of Cambridge UCAS Academic degree Grade (education) Non-governmental organization Apprenticeship Affirmative action City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Germany Numerus clausus Education in the People's Republic of China Medical school College admissions Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Equal Protection Clause Barrister Illegal immigration Capitalism Visa (document) Teacher Social work Education in Malaysia Freedom House A-level Gender-neutral language Paralegal Education in the United States Election Associate's degree University Democracy Civil rights Republic Bologna process IB Diploma Programme Australian Qualifications Framework Unemployment Diplomacy Sport rowing Academia Bachelor of Laws Tianjin University Yale University Law school Australian constitutional law Electrical engineering Cold War Privatization Institute of technology Patent attorney International relations Education in the Republic of Ireland International Criminal Court Teaching English as a Foreign Language Education in Sweden Copyright law of the United Kingdom Anti-intellectualism Economic inequality UEFA Cup National Certificate of Educational Achievement Doctorate Divorce Conscription Diploma mill 401(k) Rugby league Playoff Liberalism Randomness Model United Nations Elevator British nationality law Education in Romania Mail-order bride Offshoring Hispanic Notary public Credit card History of British nationality law Open University Privacy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Nurse Software engineering College and university rankings Publicly funded medicine GED Racism Trinity College, Dublin Habilitation
