what exactly are the benefits to studying abroad i am a high school student i have traveled studied abroad to china in the summer before it was great truly i learned a lot about the language about the culture and a lot of life lessons that can't be taught in school but academically speaking what are the benefits to studying abroad for an actual semester does it only help people who want to become more familiar with a specific language and gpa will credits carry over please and thanks in advance the benefits are immense but subtle you may not even be aware of how you've changed until years later in high school i traveled to germany for weeks and in college i studied abroad in japan for a year even going abroad for a few weeks really has a lot of benefits as you've seen experiencing the language culture and people first hand are the big ones however you were still mostly a tourist you would be going home in just a matter of weeks i wasn't in germany long enough to really get culture shock by being abroad for a longer period of time you'll get a much deeper understanding of the language and the culture the longer you're abroad and fully immersed in the culture and language you'll learn a lot more one semester abroad will teach you than what you'd cover in a classroom in or maybe semesters the benefits are much greater than just learning the language however since my time in japan i feel i've better able to communicate with people from all different backgrounds simply because i've had that experience of being the foreigner and struggling to learn the language at many of the companies i've worked at i've been able to use my japanese skills as part of my job or even to greet vips from japan i'm by no means fluent but just being able to properly greet someone in their native language goes a long ways towards making a positive impression it also helps convince the visitors that the company is serious about doing business as for gpa and credits that will depend on the particular program you will study through the japanese program i attended was actually run as an extension of my university so i got full grades and credits for the classes i attended some of my classmates were from different universities and had to use their local policies about transferring credits check with your school to see what programs they offer or what their policies on study abroad programs are even if you don't get credit i would strongly encourage you to go abroad for a semester i cannot tell you how much it has changed my life or how many opportunities it opened down the road it was well worth the effort and money GED Logic Mathematics Classical education Economics Franz Boas Philosophy of science Scientific method Test (student assessment) Psychology Critical thinking Object-oriented programming Scientology beliefs and practices Education Philosophy Alexander Technique Western philosophy Martial art Second language acquisition Parapsychology Ontological argument Jacques Derrida Art Law school Socratic method Physics Software testing Neuro-linguistic programming Developmental psychology Graduate school Aikido George Lakoff Software engineering Catechism John Wycliffe Socrates Deconstruction Epistemology Philosophy of mathematics Research Asperger syndrome Richard Feynman Leo Strauss Martin Heidegger Guide for the Perplexed A New Kind of Science Arabic alphabet Consensus decision-making Ludwig Wittgenstein Montessori method Jacob Neusner Ethics Lisp programming language Presuppositional apologetics Category theory G__del's incompleteness theorem Willard Van Orman Quine Science Education in the United States Cryptanalysis Tai Chi Chuan Bayesian inference Culture A Course In Miracles Expert system Strategic management Religion Philosophy of history Education reform Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China History of science Probability Qualitative psychological research Philosophy of language Sexual orientation Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Juris Doctor Japanese tea ceremony Extreme Programming Speed reading Geometry Biblical inerrancy Philosophy of education Database Donald Davidson (philosopher) Cultural relativism Plato Max Weber Existentialism Victor Cousin Meaning of life Originalism Patent Turing machine Autism Literacy Labor theory of value Photography
