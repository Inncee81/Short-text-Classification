does anyone have a testimony of healing yourself w natural medicines or remedies i sure got a true testimony for you i am and suffer ed from severe osteoathritis which caused bone spurs to grow wild i've had six surgeries for those already i also have had an eczema from my ear to my throat and a mysterious colon condition causing great discomfort my doctor was never able to figure out what was wrong with my colon i have been on vioxx until they were taken off the market then i was put on celebrex i went through a colonoscopy and various blood tests in order to find out why my stomach was bloated like i had gas under my skin a liver profile came out fine all the blood works were with normal results i had a swelling from my left kidney to my lower abdomen and actually felt my kidney even though i wouldn't say that it was pain with all that did i fall downstairs and literally tore my left big toe in half that one required stitches to put it back together and the docs in the emergency room told me they had never seen a larceration like that in the past the vioxx had only treated the symptoms but never took care of the athritis itself and with the celebrex it was even worse because their effect reduce inflammation pain only lasted for a few hours and then the pain came back i was scheduled to get another bone spur in my foot removed and to get that joint fused because i could not walk any longer this surgery was supposed to take place on june of this year i was tired of it i had already eye surgeries six surgeries for bone spurs and a few other surgeries and i just did not want to go through this again so i started to hunt the internet for natural remedies to alleviate my athritis i ran across an article from this woman who had athritis and knew what the pain was like after reading her article did i go about researching the article had talked about glyconutrients and i have never heard of them before but after weeks of research did i decide to order me some to be honest i was very skeptical and went into this saying that i might waste my money but i'll give it a shot i was at a point where i would have tried anything in hopes of getting rid of the pain associated with athritis and bone spurs i started to take glyconutrients on may st of this year withing six days did i notice that the level of pain had gone down after weeks could i honestly make the statement that i still had some discomfort but no pain now after months am i painfree from athritis and i can also bend the toe of my right foot again ssomething i had not been able to do for years i broke it back then and never took care of it so it ended up stiff i was scheduled to set up the details of the surgery on june th and you should have seen the face of my doctor when i bent that toe the surgery was cancelled because the doc said that with such an improvement i didn't need surgery and whatever you take keep on taking it he also asked me for the name of the product for patients who wanted to try something different naturally i was elated i had not paid much attention to my other health problems but a friend of mine told me that my skin got a lot better and that my hair was hiny and healthy so i checked for the eczema that went from my ear to my throat and i didn't want to believe it it was all but gote all there was left was a slightly discolored skinsurface where the eczema was i also noticed that the weird swelling in my stomach had gone away and the discomfort from stomach problems had gone along with it i can pretty much document all this the best thing that happened though is this i am legally blind and over the years have i lost almost all color perception except very bright colors of blue red and yellow with yellow really being hard on my eyes when i watched television it was pretty much black grey white with bright red and bright blue like a royal blue in the picture when that color was present i never was able to distinguish colors while watching television and to my amazement has my color perception improved dramatically i am able to make out most colors now even though i still have dificulties with some like grey and powder blue but for the most part have the colors returned my fiance who saw me go through these dramatic improvements in such a short period of time has a few of his own health issues such as diabetes open sore on his leg ulcer on his leg high cholesterol and high blood pressure he started to take the glyconutrient days after i had started them and believe it or not after months was his cholesterol down to his blood pressure a svelte his open wound on his leg has started to heal it is no longer open his diabetes has pretty much disappeared and his sinus problems are gone it blew my mind when he came back from the doctor and told me that he is off of all medication except one and that one is kept as a precaution until his next scheduled visit in months maybe you believe that i am exaggerating but i am not i hardly can afford this stuff because i am on disability which isn't a whole lot of money but i decided that this was my supplement for the rest of my life a lot of money often goes down the drain for junk this stuff works so i am going to buy it from here on no matter what if you have any more questions feel free to e mail me Carpal tunnel syndrome Tocopherol First aid Hypoglycemia
