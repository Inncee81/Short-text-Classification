how do you feel after reiki attunement i had mine a few hours ago and i feel a bit shaky and sick is this normal although i feel good too this is very normal just make sure you drink plenty of water it may be your body releasing built up toxins so that you can be a better channel for the universal energy i haven't been attuned yet but my mum is a reiki master she said when she was attuned she felt a rush of emotion as if a flood gate had been opened and she cried her eyes out apparently that is quite common reaction it can cause all sorts of emotions or reactions from crying to laughing in fits of hysterics to serene calmness everyone is different and experiences it differently some have no reaction at all good luck my mum says reiki has changed her life in so many positive ways Reiki YuYu Hakusho Social rule Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Grief Hypoglycemia Stroke Anxiety About a Boy Force (Star Wars) New Age Traumatic incident reduction Poison Time Out of Mind Yusuke Urameshi Post-traumatic stress disorder Happiness Pitaten Milton H.
