earache and there may be foul discharge during childhood ear infections occur after measles chicken pox mumps or the common cold chronic tonsillitis and other infections may spread to the eustachian tube and cause pus to accumulate in the middle ear cavity which is known as otitis media wax normally protects the ear canal from infection and injury but when too much wax is present it should be gently removed do not attempt to dig the wax out yourself you may puncture the drum and produce a middle ear infection which might lead to permanent loss of hearing sometimes the ear canal becomes badly swollen and infected particularly after prolonged swimming this is known as otitis externa there is severe pain and there may be tender lymph nodes behind the ear and in the neck older people with nerve deafness often complain of ringing in the ears nerve deafness may also arise from hardening of the arteries as the condition progresses the patient may not be able to distinguish between
