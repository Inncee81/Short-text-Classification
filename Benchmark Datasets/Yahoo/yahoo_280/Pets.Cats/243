why does it hurt so much to lose them i had to have my cat put to sleep today he was seriously ill very very thin and had stopped eating and drinking this week the vet had given him some antibiotics which we were trying but today he started struggling for breath and couldn't stand up and we decided enough was enough i feel so awful did i do the right thing the vet said that yes it was probably the right decisions the only other thing they could do was to put him on a drip and subject him to loads of blood tests which i didn't think he would be able to cope with being as ill as he was they weren't sure what exactly was wrong with him so we took him to the emergency vets and had him euthanased so he wouldn't suffer anymore i was with him right till the end this is the part of having a pet which i hate losing them i miss him so much thanks for all your answers so touching my partner is really down at the moment as reggie was his cat but we are both really really missing him i hate having the make the decision about euthanasia i keep beating myself up that maybe we should have tried the tests i also feel guilty as i have an moth old baby and in the past few months have been so busy with the baby that i haven't had as much time to spend with reg as i used to i'm so sorry for your loss reg was part of the family and it is natural that you should grieve i hope the following is of some comfort may i go now don't you think the time is right may i say good bye to pain filled days and endless lonely nights i've lived my life and done my best an example tried to be so can i take that step beyond and set my spirit free i didn't want to go at first i fought with all my might but something seems to draw me now to a warm and loving light i want to go i really do it's difficult to stay but i will try as best i can to live just one more day to give you time to care for me and share your love and fears i know you're sad and are afraid because i see your tears i'll not be far i promise that and hope you'll always know that my spirit will be close to you wherever you may go thank you so for loving me you know i loved you too that's why it's hard to say good bye and end this life with you so hold me now just one more time and let me hear you say because you care so much for me you'll let me go today Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha Pitaten Knots Landing The Contender (television series) Days of our Lives Blood on the Tracks Characters in the Smurfs New York Giants Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) W.I.T.C.H.
