i think something's wrong with my cat she will sit in the same spot go eat she eats a lot because she is a large cat then she will just sit there for hours on end and she has dreams we think that she's dreaming about running because her legs look like she lying and she snores it's very odd she's years old and i would like to know if i should do something oh and she is an indoor cat she has another cat in the house who is the same age and they seem to play fight every night at around pm and it's a constant thing she is very loving and weighs in at a hefty pounds or so ok i'm not a vet but i have four cats so here goes a healthy cat will sleep hours a day that's right twice as much as you or i do you play with your cat they're easily bored have you provided them with toys that are bright and shiny or that make a sound they probably are dreaming about running lots of cats do that is she the only animal in the house many cats get lonely without company and can sometimes become daydreamers just like you would if you had no one to talk to if you're really concerned about her happiness get a little kitten for her to play with a pet for your pet we have two older cats who seemed like yours listless and bored then a tiny little kitten came into our lives and the two older cats actually look and act younger they have lost weight have more of a shiny sparkle in their eyes are more energetic and in general seem happier they hissed at the little guy for about three days but after that he was one of the gang and is a great help to his lder brothers kind of a personal trainer now they don't dream of running anymore because they get real running chasing and being chased by the little kitten Cat Garfield Phoebe Buffay's songs Guinea pig Ferret Fancy rat Salad Fingers Domestic rabbit Puma Doris Day Kitten Maine Coon Pitaten Kodocha Girly Shaggy dog story Turkish Van Care Bears Monster Rancher monsters The Amber Spyglass Avenue Q One Piece minor characters Hamster Dr. Seuss Ren and Stimpy Cats (musical) Teacher's Pet (Disney) Housebreaking Azumanga Daioh Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind Dream Characters of The Sandman KaBlam!
