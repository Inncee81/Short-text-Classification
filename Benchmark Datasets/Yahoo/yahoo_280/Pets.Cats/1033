what human food can i feed my sick cat i am unable to get my cat his blue select brand top of the line at petco and petsmart cat food for a few days he has been throwing up pro plan for two days and now is throwing up yellow stomach bile i gave him a few droppers of water which seems to have calmed his stomach a bit i do not want to give him anymore cat food that he cannot tolerate what human food can i make give him that will be good for his stomach thank you for your help oh and does anyone know of something i can use from around the house to clean the stomach bile out of the carpet thanks again hi has your cat been passing any stool if so what does it look like if the stool is black and tar like take him to the vet now if it is dry and crumbly also a vet call as he's dangerously dehydrated if vomiting or no stool persists for two more days please take your cat to the vet to rule out an intestinal blockage cats dehydrate extremely easy and the unfamiliar food may have lead to a dangerous case of constipation cats need more taurine less carbs and more protein than dogs people or other pets do i would get the standard cat hairball remedy boil up some diced chicken thighs complete with the skin mix liberally and dose him on water for the next three days keep him in a quiet and comfortable place and check his litterbox faithfully no milk and no veggies pasta wheat products or salty stuff cats like water with flavor in it or alternately they like to drink it running straight from the tap if your cat is into the flavored water give him a small amount of the chicken broth from the thighs you boiled if he is a tap drinker then put him in the bathroom with the tap constantly running in a tiny stream either way you really want him to drink lots of water in closing many cats especially the very young or very old ones do not handle abrupt changes in their diet so well if the food is too expensive or tends to be chronically understocked i'd buy the desirable food find a more affordable or more available brand that has the closest ingredients list match as possible with the first brand and gradually wean him onto the new food by slowly mixing the new stuff in increasing portions with the preferred food he should be completely weaned onto the new stuff in about a month no sooner remember when you compare the ingredients that the order in which the ingredients appear is just as important as what the ingredients are you will unlikely find an exact match but you can come really close with a little perseverance remember that there are also a number of smaller local retail feed stores in your area that will likely carry your brand for a lot less bucks and a lot more quantity as for the kitty vomit i've had a lot of luck with a product called kids 'n' pets it's a five star rated enzymatic cleaner that is safe for everyone and no allergic reactions from anyone in my home i wish you and your kitty the best Breastfeeding Hamster Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Food Diarrhea Dietary fiber Tofu Chocolate Ice cream Ramen Brewery Coeliac disease Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Adjustable gastric band Japanese cuisine Dog Pasta Domestic rabbit Urinary incontinence Healthy eating Beer Dairy Guinea pig Insulin Lactose intolerance Crohn's disease Cirrhosis Ferret Pet skunk Livestock Sulfuric acid Allergy Chicken Tocopherol German cuisine Kosher foods Soy milk Aspartame Veganism Alcoholic beverage Tooth enamel Mountain Dew Vegetarianism Food allergy Dehydration Kitten Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Cantonese cuisine Aerial (dance move) Kitchen Potato Russian cuisine Poker jargon Omega-3 fatty acid Water Plastic Chili con carne Sugar Cheese Foodborne illness Taboo food and drink Microeconomics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In-N-Out Burger Hydrogen peroxide Milk Sento Enzyme Domestication Animal testing Barbecue Vitamin C Raw food diet Botulism Coca-Cola Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Ammonia Chicken soup Fugu Egg (food) Aloe Illegal drug trade Cuisine of the Philippines Garfield Roman eating and drinking Gastroparesis
