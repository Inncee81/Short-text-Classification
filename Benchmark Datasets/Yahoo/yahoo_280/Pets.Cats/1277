what temperature do cats like their living space to be my house is always really cold cuz i like it that way but i don't know if my hobbes does is there a temp thats to cold oddly enough cats like heat although each cat is different one woman i knew had a hothouse one summer during a heatwave when the temperature was about her cat would go into the hothouse where it was much hotter she wondered if this was safe so i asked my vet the vet said it was fine as long as the cat had a way to get out of the hothouse by itself and that water was available to the cat she said that animals know when they have had enough and will go where they feel most comfortable hobbes can adapt to many temperatures don't worry about it even though you say your house is really cold i assume it's not like the middle of winter during a blizzard also he can always jump onto your lap when he wants to get warm what you might consider doing for hobbes is buying him a nice fleece cat bed this way if he feels too cold he can go snuggle up in his warm bed also their fur acts as an insulator holding in both the heat the cold as needed there is one way to tell if a cat is too cold they will lie down with one arm draped over its nose to keep it warm its nose is not protected from the cold so when i see my cat do that i get her a small blanket i warm blanket available to him on a chair and or a fleece bed should be enough to ensure hobbes has a place to go if he feels too chilly Thermoregulation Cat Brewery Sauna Temperature Autonomous building Water Greenhouse Ice Air conditioning Comanche Warm-blooded Wool HVAC Dinosaur Mattress Climate of the United Kingdom Chinchilla Sento Heat Mars Exploration Rover Spark plug Passive solar Calvin and Hobbes Milton H.
