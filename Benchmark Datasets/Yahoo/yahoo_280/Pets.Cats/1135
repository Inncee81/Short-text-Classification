why do kittens go crazy at night her name is delilah and she's almost two months old she lives with with two other dogs in the house but is alone when it's bed time every night before i'm about to go to sleep she goes nuts bouncing from the bed to one corner at lightning speed she will also attack anything that moves the slightest bit i'll try to play with her for a bit so i can get some rest but nothing works and if i try to ignore it and go to bed she'll attack everything from my toes hands shoulders and eyes is there anything i can do cats are crepuscular which means they are most active at dusk and dawn however they play all throughout the night she is just being a very normal healthy playful kitten the only thing you can do is learn to sleep with a bouncing kitten around you if you put her in another room make sure that room is kitten proofed kittens will get into everything and they learn how to climb very quickly get her some toys to amuse herself with a cardboard toilet paper roll is a great toy for kittens i wouldn't give her string actually as she could get tangled in it and choke herself when you're asleep wal mart has a bag of assorted cat toys for and it's well worth the investment my cat zoe got of those bags and he plays with them every day also get her a scratching post for at wal mart it will save your furniture later just be patient your kitten is still a baby and she will eventually tire herself out and hopefully cuddle in beside you before you go to bed though give her a long play session i use one of those cat fishing poles with the feather thingy on the end and i made my kittens run around chasing it for about half an hour before i went to bed they still played for a little while i had kittens bouncing around on me but soon they became exhausted and curled up next to me and went to sleep however once the sun was beginning to come up they were back to playing again just be patient with delilah Ferret Fancy rat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Toilet humour Guinea pig Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dean Koontz Blood (computer game) Manx (cat) Urinary incontinence Four square EastEnders Sin City Pet skunk Dog Out-of-body experience Thermoregulation Shen Gong Wu Kitten Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Softball Professional wrestling holds Narcolepsy Phoebe Buffay's songs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Professional wrestling attacks Table tennis Dialysis The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling throws Palindrome Ron and Fez The Contender (television series) Jam (TV series) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Insomnia Kodocha 1957 World Series Strap-on dildo Darkwing Duck Badly Drawn Kitties 2000 Australian Grand Prix Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Bon Jovi Milton H.
