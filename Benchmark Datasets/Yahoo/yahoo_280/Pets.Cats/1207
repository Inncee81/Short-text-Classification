does anyone ave any success stories from taming a wild or feral cat if so how long did it take and what did you i have cats of which were feral for my th cat moggie it only took two days believe it or not i had just moved into my new house and i'd put a powder poision around the perimeter to repel scorpions and spiders one morning i came outside and noticed that there were little kitten prints in the posion and the trash can had been overturned and eaten out of this was my first sign that my other animals and i were not alone lol xd i saw him a few days after that he was a little orange tabby very young and he was sunbathing on the porch i came out quietly and he saw me but he was too afraid to move and so he stayed frozen where he was i sat down at a distance and waited until he got comfortable with me being there and when his attention wavered from me i would quietly scoot closer to him eventually i was right next to him and i snuck up and gave him a pat on the head he tensed for a minute but then started purring and a few minutes later he was snuggled in my lap having a grand old time my newest addition abigail a kitten as well was a harder job to tame i found her on the side of the highway and she followed me all the way back to my home though she hid in the brush and stayed at least feet away from me the whole time a storm was coming so i had to catch her when her back was turned and i put her in my room for the first few days she hid under my bed and hissed and spat at me if i reached for her realizing she was more of a playful kitten than the lap cat type i got a string and lured her out of hiding i distracted her with the string and every now and again i would gently pet her for a split second then withdraw my hand eventually she got used to me and she would let me pet her without the aid of a distractor Cat Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Feral cat RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Curse of Fenric Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Xiaolin Showdown Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New York Giants Socialization Sin City One Piece minor characters Dog training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Piccolo Junior Saga Tiger Milton H.
