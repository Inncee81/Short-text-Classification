should we really get our cat's teeth worked on we have a cat twelve years old who went to the vet for the first time in a couple of years today she has just become an outdoor cat since we bought our house the vet suggested that we have some teeth extracted since she has four cavities and one tooth has broken off leaving an exposed nerve now this sounds horrible but the cat acts fine the procedure could cost up to and can only be done if the cat passes some blood tests and such we can afford the procedure but it will put a crimp in some of our spending for a little while i want to be a compassionate pet owner but on the other hand i don't want to be paying a lot of money for something i can't tell is wrong and that doesn't affect the cat's behavior and she doesn't seem to be suffering so considering the practical ethical and financial ground should let the vet do it would you do it can you tell if your cat has pain just because she isn't suffering doesn't mean that she isn't in some lesser form of pain how would you feel if you had a bunch of cavities and an exposed nerve it sounds like you are only conserned with the cost and not the cats long term health any of those teeth can get infected and abscess and then the vet cost is going to be even more Guinea pig Dental caries Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Ferret Pneumonia Procrastination Tuberculosis Pet skunk Friends Microeconomics Veterinarian Acupuncture Domestic rabbit Tooth enamel Rabies Dentistry Economics Babe Ruth Zoophilia Trigeminal nerve Tooth Goodness and value theory Dog Animal rights Prostate cancer Capital punishment Cocaine Breastfeeding Pitaten Life insurance Theory of conduct Menstrual cycle Maxilla Multiple sclerosis Badly Drawn Kitties Gross domestic product Garfield Medicare (Canada) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tobacco smoking Equine conformation Vulcan (Star Trek) Time Out of Mind Divorce Local anesthesia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Methamphetamine Female genital cutting Mesothelioma Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Shaggy dog story Massage Malaria Colorectal cancer Capitalism Kidney Hell Knots Landing Animal testing Theodicy Stem cell Enzyme Growth hormone treatment Randomness Microchip implant (animal) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Naruto jutsu Nine Inch Nails Oral sex Human sexual behavior Asbestos Estoppel Health insurance Abortion debate Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alignment (role-playing games) Urinary incontinence Blood transfusion Mode choice Stuttering Tetrapod Spanking Hypnosis Characters of Naruto Housebreaking Cancer Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Smoking Room Animal euthanasia Insurance Meme Dog training Mandible Abscess
