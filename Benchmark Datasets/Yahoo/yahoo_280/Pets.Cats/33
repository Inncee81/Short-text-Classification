oral ringworm meds for cat my cat was dignosed with ringworm days ago and the vet gave me a topical treatment to use for weeks and an oral treatment to be used once now and once again in weeks the problem is i can't get him to take the oral treatment will the topical treatment alone take care of the fungus i have been using it for days and have already seen some imporvement i just don't want it to bounch right back the meds are liquid and the minute i put it in his wet food he won't eat it it must be taken with food so giving it orally with a syringe isn't a possibility the topical alone should work but the oral really makes an improvemnt try wrapping your cat in a towel or small blanket like you would a baby papose style or like making a buritto wrap tightly and get the paws in the towel hold the cat in your lap on it's back with the paws in the toewl that leaves both your hand free to put the pills in and hold another easy way is to put a little bit of babyfood meat on a spoon with the pill hidden in it and let your cat lick it off the other way is some vets have pill poppers a treat with a whole in it that you can place the pill each method works on one of my cats hope you have good luck and sorry about the ring worm we just got over it Guinea pig Ringworm Cat Oral sex Psoriasis Hamster Fancy rat Ferret Migraine Diazepam Acne Fecal incontinence Rabies Oral contraceptive Upholstery Urinary incontinence Common cold AIDS Heartworm Halitosis Hyperthermia Breastfeeding Sewage treatment Antidepressant Casualty lifting Pet skunk Menstrual cycle Diarrhea Folic acid Social rule Paracetamol Veganism Tooth Chopsticks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Garfield Alanis Morissette Professional wrestling match types Dog Pneumonia Ascariasis Ketoconazole Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medicine Customs and etiquette of Japan Phoebe Buffay's songs Phimosis Trapping Professional wrestling holds Osteoarthritis Malaria Tlingit Insulin Gastroparesis Towel Theory of conduct Herpes simplex virus Emergency contraception Manicure First aid Binge eating disorder Birth control Menstrual cup Vitamin D Hypoglycemia 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chronic fatigue syndrome Korean cuisine Condom The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Domestic rabbit Medical cannabis Bacon Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sauna Hazing Dog training Comanche Hyperthyroidism Creatine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape quests Spider 613 mitzvot Giant Panda Baldness treatments Caffeine Coeliac disease Chagas disease Chlorpromazine Fire fighting Wood carving Maneki Neko English English Hypothermia Japanese tea ceremony Singlish
