my cat is coming into heat approx every days what is causing this she weaned her kittens on june she went into heat on june since then she has been in heat july july july and aug i want to get her spayed but i think they charge more if she is in heat i can't seem to get her at a point where she is not in heat what could be the cause of this she was hit by a car in march and her leg was shattered she was in a splint for over months but has healed very well and is walking with only a slight limp did the accident affect her hormonally she is a totally indoor cat i am not allowing her out so that she cannot mate and get pregnant again this cat was a stray that i rescued after she was hit by a car she was also pregnant when she was hit the kittens turned out ok i do plan on getting her fixed now that i have received such great answers sxcept the one that advised to put her down cats need to be either neutered or bred that is because in the female the heat cycles will get closer together while each cycle will last longer eventually your female cat will almost always be in heat in the warm seasons of the year get her spayed please and quickly before she darts out and gets with a tom addling more unwanted kittens to the millions that are already here spaying a cat in heat means that the reproductive organs are saturated with blood most vets do not charge extra for cats in heat it is not unsafe if you are uncomfortable with that then as soon as you see a break in the cycle get her spayed knowing that she will only be out of heat for a day or two she's miserable help her out Cat Dog Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Kitten Ferret Guinea pig Estrus cycle Manx (cat) Feral cat Menstrual cycle Socialization Breastfeeding Pregnancy Heinkel He 112 Housebreaking USS Whale (SS-239) Kakapo Carbon dioxide Knots Landing Eddie Guerrero Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sterilization (surgical procedure) Castration 1957 World Series Equine conformation Atomic Kitten Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Friends Nutrition 2005 Atlantic hurricane season European Rabbit Endometrium Blink-182 Anopheles 2005 United States Grand Prix Puberty Thermoregulation Days of our Lives Emu Rabbit Diesel engine M60 machine gun Transformer Birth control Sailing Lion Prostate cancer Hamster Species Lighting Gregorian calendar Sarah Kerrigan EastEnders Daylight saving time Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Terminal ballistics Garfield Tigon 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Sauna Heartworm The Joker's Wild Ozone depletion The Price Is Right Chaos Emerald Neighbours Sterilization (microbiology) Siamese (cat) Ovulation Carburetor Darts Woman Red Squirrel Rail transport in Ireland Light-emitting diode 2000 Australian Grand Prix Climate change Egyptian Mau Ted Kennedy Dairy Abortion in the United States Treecat Azumanga Daioh Solar variation Lazarus Long Warm-blooded Fertility awareness Osteoarthritis Diode House Mouse Ozone hole Clownfish Escape from New York Toxoplasmosis USS Waters (DD-115) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Sydney Harbour Bridge
