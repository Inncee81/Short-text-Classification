where does your cat sleep at night my boyfriend and i had a bit of a debate the other day because he keeps his cat outside all night whereas i feel better keeping mine indoors overnight he says it's not fair to keep a cat cooped up like that since it wants to be outside plus he says if his cat stays inside it wakes him up every ten minutes but i say it's not safe for the cat to be out all night he told me it's no less safe then it being out in the daytime since i do let my cats in and out during the day well except for one she's just an indoor kitty i dunno what do you guys think and how do you do things with your own cats lol these answers are so fun to read because i can relate to so many of them my cats like to try and force their way under my blankets and we do have one that's terrified to go outside my kitty sleeps with me on my bed and one of my cats has tried to sleep on my face a few times and we did sadly have a cat get out and get eaten by a coyote and another cat got out and was hit by a car all the more reason i feel secure having them in anyways carry on i have both indoor and outdoor sleepers for the most part i round the indoor outdoor kitties in for the night there are two cats however that never come insides barn cats they can't live in the house due to urination problems or the fact that they hate other cats but they both sleep in the barn where they have cat beds it is safer for the cat to be indoors because large predators come out at night foxes racoons coyotes wolves in certain areas mountain lions and bears now bears and wolves are less likely to eat your cats but the rest of the listed predators are usually the culprits domestic cats are just that domestic they were bred for companionship and showy colors they retain a lot of their predator wild instincts as we all do but for the most part it is a shallow base of instincts i'm sure you've experienced where your indoor outdoor kitty will kill a mouse or almost kill a lizard and do nothing but play with it never eat it the instinct is to catch something moving fast not to necesarily kill it properly or eat it by expecting domestic cats to respond to their environment like a savvy wild cat you are giving them more credit than their breeding and in most times their upbringing cats raised in the home and let out with older cats once in a while until they're old enough is not a full on boot camp into surviving outside like they might have gotten where they feral or wild there are some cats that just can't be inside ferals for instance and in different cases random personality types but most animal rescuers agree if you are going to take the danger of letting your animal outside you should at least bring them in before dusk when the predators wake up to hunt and fat cats shouldn't be outside long anyway most cats raised in an indoor only environment never are even curious about the outdoors they may want to sit in the sun of a window or go out onto a screened in back porch and catch flies but they never know the difference they live healthy and fullfilling lives indoors therefore it isn't cruel to expect them to live indoors all the time cats brought up outside or in an indoor outdoor environment tend to be harder to adjust to the indoor only scene but at the rescue we do it every day and most converted cats end up living happy lives indoors after the brief awkward stage where they try for the door whenever you open it so most of my cats and most of the cats i know are in before dusk and let out after dawn for safety reasons a lot of people have differing ideas but what it boils down to is that you are the animal's owner and protector you are the one responsible for the animal's safety it's better to be safe than sorry for their sake more than your emotional attachment indoor at night Dog Guinea pig Domestication Domestic rabbit Avenue Q Gray Wolf Feral cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hunting Hamster Pet skunk Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Puma Fox hunting Livestock Volleyball Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Garfield Kevin and Kell Trapping RuneScape quests EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Horse Archery Leopard Kakapo God Emperor of Dune Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lion Tlingit Spider Theory of conduct Taboo food and drink Sleep Passenger car Tag The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Honeybee Comanche House Animal rights The Invisibles Daylight saving time Feral Jam (TV series) The Death Gate Cycle Oh My Goddess!
