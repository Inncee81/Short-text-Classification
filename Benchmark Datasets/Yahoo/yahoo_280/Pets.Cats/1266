any suggestions on why a cat bites draws blood and hangs on to people like a monkey can't afford law suit the cat has been spayed along time ago he is a male tuxedo cat approx years old and is an inside cat i really need help my guess is that he has been doing this since he was a little kitten and no one has trained him differently if it were another cat they have an innate sense of how far to go before harm is done so you need to train him he already has been neutered so that should have calmed him down some he needs to get disapproval for what is is doing punishment is not what you want to do since he has no idea of the damage he is doing you get his attention immediately when it does it usually by a gentle tap on the nose and the word no since this has probably been going on for some time it will take awhile a squirt bottle really isn't of use here since the quarters are too close a squirt bottle is good when he is on the counter etc most cats want to please and hearing the word no and a tap on the nose will often change behavior if he is hanging on someone else you go over and say no and a tap on the nose don't get into a punishment tap it is not his fault Cat Pet skunk Dog Ferret Socialization Domestic rabbit Dog training Housebreaking Kitten Morality Theory of conduct Feral cat Sharia Characters of Naruto Gender Phoebe Buffay's songs Manx (cat) Philosophy of language Baldrick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ranma __ characters Tobacco smoking Joke Lie Capital punishment Characters in the Smurfs Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Milton H.
