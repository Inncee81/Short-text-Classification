how can i get my cat to stop scenting scenting me or just carrying a cloud around him my cat is scenting me and it smells awful sometimes he just has a cloud around him and sometimes it'll be left behind on what he's laying on he doesn't have anyone to compete with anymore we used to have a cat a female litter mate sister he uses his cheeks mostly the gland right near his mouth and i can always tell when he's scenting rather than just trying to get attention i came home tonight and he just stunk he is neutered so i don't think he's going through a mating thing i hate the smell it's so awful i am starting to bath him every weeks now because it just starts building up and i try to wash and spritz whatever he might make stink and use air freshener what the heck do i do i'm a bit confused you seem to mostly be talking about him rubbing his head on you and other things with his cheeks to mark i have been around cats for decades and yes they mark this way all the time however i have never been able to smell it cats have anal glands located right by their rectums that produce a foul smelling substance your cat may have a problem with them as they can become impacted and abscessed so have your vet check it out he may simply require them to periodically be expressed you said your cat has been neutered but didn't say how long ago if it has been only recently it does take awhile for the tom cat smell to go away so be patient if that is the case spraying is when a cat male or female uses urine to mark their territory cats will back up to objects and walls and then spray urine without squatting there is not too much you can to to prevent this behavior except to try to keep your cat's territory free from what your cat sees as threats or to use pheromones as found in feloway products available from your vet Animal communication Pet skunk Skunk Menstrual cycle Housebreaking Shaggy dog story House Mouse Kakapo Rabies Guinea pig Anal sex Prostate cancer Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Dog Traumatic incident reduction American lobster Territory (animal) Fancy rat Honeybee Kitten Olfaction Hemorrhoid Fecal incontinence Trademark Tobacco smoking One Piece minor characters Flatulence Domestic rabbit Halitosis Grammatical gender Fire fighting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Gender Odor Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington Cheetah Radiation therapy Gender-neutral language Felis sapiens Breastfeeding Prolog Biology and sexual orientation Elephant Pep__ Le Pew Mosquito The Fairly OddParents Taikyoku shogi Shark Feral cat The Critic Garter snake Calvin and Hobbes Gloom (Pok__mon) Equine conformation Manx (cat) Jam (TV series) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Water Spotted Skunk Shit Natural Selection (computer game) Camp Lazlo Tasmanian Devil Ant Medicine Social rule Garfield Milton H.
