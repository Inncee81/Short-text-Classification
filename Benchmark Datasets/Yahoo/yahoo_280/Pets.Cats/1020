covered litter box problems i've had my cat for about months she was stray abandoned she took to using a litter box without any trouble which was really nice we started with a standard inch deep tray she threw litter everywhere when she'd dig so i got a covered one everything was fine until recently suddenly she seemed to stop covering her twosies and she had a tendency to come flying out of the litterbox afterwards the smell would eventually drift through the rest of the house and i'd have to go cover it myself we moved months ago and she's put on some weight it's hotter than where we used to live so she's less active and i thought maybe she didn't have enough room in there anymore i took the cover off and she immediately resumed covering her waste like always we use crystals now instead of clumping litter so there is less for her to kick out anyone else have trouble using covered boxes do cats really like the cover or is it just humans projecting modesty onto them no i never was able to use the flap that came with it she refused to push her little head through lol it's a human thing cats do not naturally go into caves to eliminate many cats some of mine included are afraid of covered litter boxes one won't use it under any circumstances and the other will but rushes out as quickly as possible leaving everything unburied just like your cat does another factor is the scented litter box fillers lots of cats hate the smell which is even more concentrated in a covered box i find it easier to use an uncovered litter box and fill it with a good quality litter than controls odor well i find that odor lockers works well Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Cat litter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sulfur Fancy rat Eddie Guerrero Tobacco smoking Pollution Feral cat Hamster Mattress Albatross Kakapo The Contender (television series) Kurt Cobain Olfaction Dog Guinea pig Operation Market Garden Shen Gong Wu The Amber Spyglass Welding Vermicompost Semiconductor device Escape from New York Pok__mon Live!
