diarrhea in cats i have three indoor cats brothers age who share litterboxes approx days ago we noticed fresh diarrhea in the litter i assumed that it may have been due to a switch in their food fancy feast grilled to normal fancy feast so i switched them back to their original food and we didn't see any more diarrhea for a few days yesterday my longhair cat had new diarrhea stuck in the fur on his rear he clearly did not try to clean it off himself i gave him a bath and cleaned up the skid marks he left on the bathroom floor by the box i noticed that his anus seemed a little red and swollen today i found more light colored diarrhea stuck on his bum though not nearly as much clearly i need to bring at least the longhair to the vet i'm only here to ask for some educated guesses as to what this might be since i'm at a loss aside from the diarrhea everyone's acting normally eating fine nobody's dehydrated their skin snaps back when pulled heat stress something else the cats got their full kitten shots but they didn't keep up on the annuals their gums are pink and they aren't sticky they all have very healthy appetites they're playful they aren't particularly dehydrated the longhair is just a little more lethargic than usual but that could also be due to the heat since we don't have ac basically they're all acting normally aside from the runny stools on the occasions while they're indoor cats the longhair got out recently about weeks ago for days so there's a chance he brought some intestinal parasites with him do you think that anything else could cause these symptoms though okay it could be a number of things internal parasites there is also something it could have it isn't a parasite but i don't remember what it's called a cat i had recently had it and had the same symptoms and it could also be flv fiv i suggest taking your cat to the vet immediately Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Cat Stomach cancer Guinea pig Dehydration Ferret Garfield Pet skunk Kitten Toxoplasmosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hamster Manx (cat) Dog Nutrition Dietary fiber Cheetah Phoebe Buffay's songs Hyperthermia Vitamin C Cancer Myxobolus cerebralis Diseases of the honeybee Allergy Protein-energy malnutrition Maine Coon RuneScape quests Prostate cancer Chocolate The X-Files (season 1) Pneumonia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Happy Tree Friends Labrador Retriever Clinical depression Carnivorous plant Hemorrhoid Common cold Foodborne illness Chicken Ebola Schistosoma mansoni Babe Ruth Breastfeeding Siamese (cat) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cirrhosis Carpal tunnel syndrome Lactose intolerance The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Milk The Inside Rotavirus House Mouse Conker's Bad Fur Day Malaria Dialysis Ascariasis Japanese tea ceremony Thermoregulation Trichinosis Japanese toilet Gray Wolf Hirschsprung's disease Giant Panda Homer Simpson Tooth Potato Sento Crohn's disease Social rule Raw food diet Menstrual cycle Asthma Coprophagia Taboo food and drink Gastroenteritis Captain Thunderbolt Cuisine of Laos Feline Panleukopenia Comanche Cryptosporidium Insulin Turkish Angora Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Intestinal parasite
