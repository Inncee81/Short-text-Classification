i've had my kitten for weeks now and its still so scared i don't know what to do to make it feel like its at its new home it hides any chance it gets but it plays with his sister also but when i get close he runs and hides most of the time when i go to pick him up he just runs when he do pick him up and sit with him i just know that he wants to get away i leave him in room but sometimes i try to take him around with me but when i do the first chance he gets he gets up and runs back to his room where his sister is i've been trying to do everything that has been asked to make the scared kittens less scared but its not working what can i do i really want him to be friendly like his sister just give him time two weeks is nothing and each cat has a personality of his own this one might just be a bit aloof there is nothing wrong with that he'll come around eventually so be patient Silent Night, Deadly Night Social rule Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tag Milton H.
