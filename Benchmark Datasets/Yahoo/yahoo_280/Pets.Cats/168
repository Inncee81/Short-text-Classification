whats the best way to tame a cat i've been looking after a cat that was feral at one stage her kitten the others were put down before i got them is a very friendly kitten that has no problem demanding being patted and stroked by anyone and everyone she's progressed too she spent a lot of time hiding under our bed apart from to come out to use the litter box and now she comes out and eats with our other cats and sleeps in the sun around our home i have picked her up before but only when she's rubbing up against other cats and feels secure i can approach her when she is sleeping on the bed if i go very slow and maybe one out of ten tries i can stroke her but progress has slowed down i'd love to tame her down more she's very soft and silky she hasn't scratched once she's a real gem does anyone have any tips first of all thanks for being patient i am currently working on a feral mommy one thing i found very useful was petting the kitty with a back scratcher it got her use to being touched but she didn't feel like i was invading her space someone else suggested tuna great idea any type of strong smelling moist food is great the kitty will smell it and come out to get some when she does talk very softly to her and try to rub her she will eventually associate petting with good feelings mostly just be patient she may or may not come around the important thing is that she doesn't sound aggressive Cat Guinea pig Garfield Feral cat Dog Domestic rabbit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pet skunk Ferret Hamster Shaggy dog story Kitten Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Consciousness Salad Fingers Atomic Kitten Avenue Q Phoebe Buffay's songs King Crimson Fancy rat Animal communication Catscratch Social rule Sluggy Freelance Friends RuneScape quests Pitaten The Smoking Room Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Characters in the Smurfs Domestication Milton H.
