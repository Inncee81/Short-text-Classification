cat left outside in florida heat i let my orange tiger cat out on the porch as you all know summer in florida is the worst it was only for an hour or two but when i finally heard him crying i saw he was panting so i immediately let him in he got inside and he panted a little more but then he stopped i tried to get a good look at him and i saw that underneath his left eye was shiny with what looked to be water so he was either crying or sweating will he be alright i wet his coat with ice cubes and he hardly moved he hates water but now he's stopped panting should we get him to the vet or was he just uncomfortable lots of water and a trip to the vet i would also recommend against letting him outside no matter what the weather there are many more dangers outside besides the heat indoor cats are generally a lot healthier and live longer than cats that go outdoors good luck and best wishes to you and your cat Cat Guinea pig Garfield Hyperthermia Sauna Domestic rabbit Diving suit Piccolo Junior Saga Opportunity rover Dog Ice Ren and Stimpy Fancy rat Phoebe Buffay's songs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret One Piece minor characters Toilet humour Pitaten Swimming pool Shaggy dog story Fast bowling Characters in the Smurfs Cruising (maritime) Hamster ThunderCats The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Xiaolin Showdown Water Climate of the United Kingdom Extreme weather Veterans Stadium Jackass: The Movie Thermal power station Luck Okashina Okashi Hiking Ben Johnson (athlete) The Contender (television series) Soldering Terri Schiavo Ice hockey Light-emitting diode Thermoregulation Breastfeeding Carbon dioxide Grandview, U.S.A.
