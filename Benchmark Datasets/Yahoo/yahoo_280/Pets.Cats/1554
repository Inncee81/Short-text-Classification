do you agree with this around here in all the small towns people just go around shooting cats and kittens becase there are too many or they think they are pest they will also do the same with dogs once in a while but not as often just as a way to get rid of them the things is there is really nothing we can do because there are no humane soceitys or shelters the closest one is miles away and they only have a mile radius and the cops just ignore the complaints we and my freinds have been saveing wild kittens out on a farm just because the lady is going to shoot them for no reason and it happens all the time got other ideas and what do you think about these situations and what the people do call the state police tell them your local cops are ignoring the complaints and you want something done also at the same time write call your local congressman and explain what sort of backwards podunct people live in y our town at some point someone's going to miss and kill a kid or someone's pet this is something that does indeed happen but that doesn't mean that it isn't animal cruelty and if your stupid local cops won't listen go to the state police and explain what is going on and why you want it to stop where are they discharging their firearms is where they are shooting in an illegal place if so your cops need to listen round up as many friends and adults that are sick of this behaviour sign petitions and give it to the police state police and your congressman Cat Ferret Sin City Socialization Garfield People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Theory of conduct Dog Great Teacher Onizuka Puma Animal rights Feral Feral cat Kitten Kyle Broflovski Pet skunk Dilbert True Crime: Streets of LA Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Taxi Driver Jam (TV series) Ranma __ characters The Holocaust Baldrick Shaggy dog story Ron Weasley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trailer Park Boys Papa's Got a Brand New Badge Pet store RuneScape quests Ren and Stimpy Zoophilia Jack Thompson Badly Drawn Kitties Silent Night, Deadly Night Tiger Hunting KRS One Rabbit The Untouchables Police Beltway sniper attacks The Invisibles Blood (computer game) Reservoir Dogs The Marshall Mathers LP Azumanga Daioh Palestinian National Authority Sharon Tate Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Pitaten Taboo food and drink The Price Is Right Dogville Grand Theft Auto III The Inside Rent (musical) Grand Theft Auto (game) Domestic violence Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kim Possible Cruelty to animals Teacher's Pet (Disney) Terminal ballistics Mumia Abu-Jamal The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Bob and George Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Barry Horne God Emperor of Dune Poker jargon 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pet George Michael Prisoner's dilemma EastEnders Ed, Edd n Eddy Kodocha Doug Firearm The Flintstones Working dog Organic farming Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Punisher Jean Charles de Menezes The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Concealed carry (USA) Domestic rabbit Pok__mon Live!
