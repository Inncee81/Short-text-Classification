this is going to sound silly but my cat pees in the bathroom sink how can i stop him he uses his litter box and we clean it regularly but for some reason he jumps into my bathroom sink and pees i've caught him doing it once but i can't get rid of the smell poured bleach and hot water down drain i think he's doing it while we sleep can't close the bathroom doors because we have a strange house layout and heat air won't flow back to the bedroom how do i a get rid of the smell and b stop him from doing it when i can't even catch him use a vinegar soda bicarb solution to clean the skin then spray some vinegar around the sink also check if he's peeing anywhere else in the bathroom the smell may be coming from somewhere else if you've washed it all down the sink btw the peroxide in the bleach reacts with the ammonia in the pee that's why it smells worse Vinegar Hydrogen peroxide Ammonia Kitchen Menstrual cup Toilet humour Solvent Japanese toilet Toilet Dishwasher Bathroom Water Acetic acid World War Three (Doctor Who) Blood Simple Tattoo Fire fighting Disinfection Urine Sodium hydroxide The Shining (film) Organic peroxide Bidet Water purification Hamster Sulfuric acid Ron and Fez Sento Jackass: The Movie Bleach Washing machine Urinal Pet skunk Water (molecule) Sin City Thermal power station Skunk Gilding Dairy Toilet paper Otitis externa Cat Hot sauce Felis sapiens Plumbing fixture Barbecue Dymaxion house Wood pulp Coffee Basement Dormitory Dialysis Traumatic brain injury Residual-current device Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister Tap (valve) Domestic water system Happy Tree Friends Caving Brewery Fume hood Skin Soap Sulfur Bong Air conditioning Laundry detergent Passenger car Fecal incontinence Autonomous building Spotted Skunk Ozone Sodium percarbonate Polar Bear Albatross Gaia Online Fancy rat Casting Shaggy dog story Russian joke Big Day Out 1,4-dichlorobenzene Jewish cuisine Hebburn Snake Alum Bleach (manga) Ethidium bromide Nitric acid Peroxide Sodium carbonate Contact lens McMansion Japanese tea ceremony Kurt Cobain RuneScape Mini-Games Menstrual cycle
