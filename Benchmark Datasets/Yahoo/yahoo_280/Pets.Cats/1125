my oldest cat has problems with my oldest cat is nine years old and well he has problems with keeping food down i have taken him to the vet to check for any underlaying problems and there are none i have switch brands of food and still he throws up food on a regular basis is there anything that might help the cat keep food down i also give him special food that is made for sensitive stomachs and it doesn't help i also don't buy the bargain brands of supermarket pet food what does anyone that gives their cat at this stage when nothing helps and the sensitive stomach foods cause more problems to him throwing up when i went to the vet he told me to try vaseline for the hairballs since both cats are long haired i used it on both and well i took him to three different vets who all said to change him over to a sensitive food diet did that the last vet gave him all sorts of tests and my cat came out clean for all of them including some stomach biposies so had him tested and all came back with a negative both cats get feed four times a day in small amounts but i've never heard of giving a cat pumpkin before i already get the sensitive stomach cat food it just seems to upset his tummy more have you tried feeding him small amounts more often he may be throwing up because he eats too fast an indication of this is if they throw up right after eating you can also try canned pumpkin unsweetened kind it will help settle his stomach if it is upset and put some nutrients in him but even with that give small amounts more often instead of a lot at once pumpkin is generally given to dogs but i also give it to my cats if they need it it helps with diarrhea constipation and upset stomach given it is just a condition stress food related got into the human food etc and not a symptom of an underlying problem pumpkin can als be used as a fill in for regular food for overweight animals so they have something in their stomach but are not getting the fat and calories from their regular food as far as i know they can eat as much as they want and it will not hurt them but it will make their poop orange the other posibility is he is allergic to something in the food if that has not already been tested for and yet a rd thing is he could just be a vomiter if he is keeping enough food down to maintain his health and otherwise acts perfectly normal he could just be a cat who throws up a lot my oldest cat did that off and on for a few years i changed foods but the vet said he was normal and healthy and seemed to be getting enough to eat and since he was not acting sick that he would be fine and he is he has stopped vomiting frequently it has been several years he is years old and long haired Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food Cat Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Nutrition Chocolate Fancy rat Hamster Gastroparesis Adjustable gastric band Vitamin C Prostate cancer Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Dieting Hypoglycemia Ferret Binge eating disorder Vomiting Dietary fiber Veganism Pneumonia Tocopherol Kashrut Urinary incontinence Healthy eating Diabetes mellitus Foodborne illness Insulin Chronic fatigue syndrome Chemotherapy Egg (food) Cancer Dog Vegetarianism Tooth Tooth enamel Aspartame Raw food diet Kodocha Milk Taboo food and drink Super Size Me Dairy Little Britain Atkins Nutritional Approach Lactose intolerance Multiple chemical sensitivity Animal testing Pitaten Cirrhosis Fugu Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Pet skunk Crohn's disease Charles Darwin's illness Livestock Paracetamol Homer Simpson Sauerkraut Pumpkin Theory of conduct Natural Hygiene Foie gras Cat food Weight loss Shark Food allergy Colorectal cancer Organic food Polycystic ovary syndrome Botulism Clinical depression Welding Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Menstrual cycle Gastroesophageal reflux disease Folic acid Kitten Characters of The Sandman Calorie restriction Carburetor The Ashlee Simpson Show Chicken Burdock Animal rights Obstetrics HIV test Fasting Genetically modified food
