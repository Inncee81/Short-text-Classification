allergic to cats help me out my girlfriend and i have been together for years and have lived together for the last and her sister is also staying with us between my girlfriend and her sister they have cats each but im allergic to cats so my nose is always stuffed up and my eyes get puffy but she loves these cats and although im not a pet person i got used to them and love them as well i dont want to have her get rid of them because weve had them forever and shes had cats since she was born i already take claritan and sometimes cold and flu medicine but nothing works any advice clean clean and clean again vacuum at least once a week and have them groom the cats frequent bathing is not a good idea for the cats just need to brush them and then wipe them down with a damp washcloth dust the house weekly as well and have them scoop the litter box daily and with cats i would scoop the box boxes twice a day also try to keep the cats off your bedding i know that's a hard one but it can be done i have always had the same allergic reactions you described when i'd be around my friend's and family's and neighbour's cats but then i got my own kitty and it was a different story she is short haired and i clean weekly and scoop daily and groom the cat i have almost no allergic reaction to her at all Cat Hay fever Hamster Guinea pig Fancy rat Flea Ren and Stimpy Common cold Garfield House dust mite Peanuts Cheetah Chinchilla Pet skunk Kodocha Phoebe Buffay's songs Domestic rabbit Tattoo Calvin and Hobbes Pitaten Kitten Badly Drawn Kitties Ranma __ characters Tarantula Keeshond Red Dwarf characters Poker jargon Felis sapiens Ferret Girls Aloud College Roomies from Hell!!!
