can steroid ointment prescribed by the vet cause vomiting in cat my cat who is very petite has a cut in her eyelid which watered and swelled the vet gave us a steroid ointment to treat it three days ago today she threw up her supper not a cat who throws up at all either after growling and gagging the vet is closed i am stopping treatment until i talk to him but has anyone heard of a relation between steriods and vomiting otherwise she is a perfectly healthy and cared for cat no worms etc since the cut is on her eyelid your vet probably prescribed an ointment that is safe to use directly in the eye just in case medications like that are extremely safe and topical ointments are generally not absorbed into the system to cause a systemic reaction like vomiting also steroids are the commonly used treatment for allergic reactions and are extremely well tolerated by cats cats are the best vomiters in the world so i would think by what you described that your cat got a small piece of food stuck and while trying to dislodge it vomited everything up don't be alarmed and continue using the ointment as prescribed but should your cat vomit more frequently and show any other symptoms call your vet to see if something else is going on and to help you feel better my cat has ibd and needs periodic steroid injections to stop him from the several times a day vomiting of his freshly ingested food Psoriasis Conjunctivitis Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Radiation therapy Paracetamol First aid Eczema Ulcerative colitis Insulin Hay fever Inflammatory bowel disease Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Rosacea Crohn's disease Cat Diarrhea Gastroparesis Asthma Diabetes mellitus Fecal incontinence Gout Medical prescription Chronic fatigue syndrome Anaphylaxis Homeopathy Cluster headache Osteoarthritis Coeliac disease Diazepam Aloe Cephalexin Multiple chemical sensitivity Food allergy Hamster M__ni__re___s disease Medical cannabis Garfield Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Anabolic steroid Hypoglycemia Addiction Mercury (element) Aspartame Chemotherapy Chocolate Foodborne illness Spider Ferret Carpal tunnel syndrome Scabies Acne Buprenorphine Prostate cancer Ebola Hyperemesis gravidarum 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Migraine Dracunculiasis Botulism Clomipramine Drug addiction Zinc Maprotiline Snake Clinical depression Animal testing Trichinosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Heartworm Antidepressant Multiple sclerosis AIDS Phimosis Acupuncture Anesthesia Paget's disease of bone Menstrual cycle Glucocorticoid Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Epidural Nitroglycerin Traditional Chinese medicine Mouth ulcer Hydrogen peroxide Controlled Substances Act
