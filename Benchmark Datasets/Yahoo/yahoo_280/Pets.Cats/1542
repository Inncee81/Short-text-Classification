trying to fix my feral cat i took in a male feral cat months ago when he was just a kitten his name is wyner because when i go outside all the feral cats know it's time to eat he would always whine alot when it's time to eat he walked in my house all the time i need to get him fixed but to pick him up and put him in the carrier forget it he will let you pet him when he wants but generally he will hiss and put up his paws to fight you he is the only one not fixed in my house as i have several cats and theirs usually a fight with him he causes it or my other males do he howls at night i saw an answer on a question here about someone giving their dog dramamine would it be ok to give a pill to my cat so he'll relax enough so i could put him in the carrier or any suggestions i had left the carrier in the living room with the door open i've placed canned food and other stuff in there he will not go in i have cancelled his appts so many times any suggestions all my cats live indoors wanttoknow i had a similiar problem with a feral cat and my vet suggested this confine your cat in a small room such as a small bedroom and bring in your carrier make sure that the carrier is open and ready to take the cat get a towl preferrably a beachtowl and use that to either throw it on top of the cat like a net and then scoop him up and place him into the carrier or using your hands cover him with the towl and then place the cat in the carrier the towl will provide the illusion of cover for the cat so that he may not put up a big fight and it also provides a shield for you from his claws should he decide to fight when my cat was the same way as yours but this system has worked for me everytime you don't need drugs for your cat that could lead to bigger problems and bigger medical bills when all you need is a big cheap towl good luck Cat Socialization Hamster Shaggy dog story Feral Kakapo Garfield Conker's Bad Fur Day Guinea pig Fancy rat RuneScape quests Dog Housebreaking Feral child Feral cat Sin City Bobcat Customs and etiquette of Japan Cable television The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Brown Bear Gray Wolf Rocko's Modern Life Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Japanese tea ceremony Draw poker Poker jargon Piccolo Junior Saga Tobacco smoking Apollo 8 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Aerial (dance move) The Smoking Room Richard Chase Sabretooth (comics) Maneki Neko Domestication Teacher's Pet (Disney) Betting (poker) Sento Invader Zim Phoebe Buffay's songs Kitten Little Britain The Fairly OddParents Carolina Panthers Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) American Black Bear English grammar 1957 World Series Island Fox Magical objects in Harry Potter The Time Machine Major League Baseball television contracts Game show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Andr__s Galarraga Eric Bischoff The Brady Bunch The Dalek Invasion of Earth Dean Koontz Kangaroo Second Battle of the Atlantic Dilbert The Ersatz Elevator Ron and Fez Puma Friends AFI 100 Years series Feral cat colony Oasis (band) Ben Johnson (athlete) Ron Weasley American lobster Combine (Half-Life 2) One Piece minor characters Metaphysics SMTV Live Pet Sounds Janet Jackson Bart Sells His Soul Stomach cancer USS Forrestal (CVA-59) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Big Brother (USA TV series) Kill Bill Luck Satchel Paige Taboo food and drink RuneScape Random Events Battle of Midway Cannabis cultivation Singlish Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
