introducing new puppy to old cat i just got a month old bull terrier mix today and i have been trying to introduce him to my year old cat the cat seems to stand his ground and growl at the puppy when he comes near which is understandbale because the puppy wants to jump at and play with the cat he has also barked at him a few times and i immediately told him no each time if the cat tries to run the dog instinctively wants to chase him any suggestions on how i can get the puppy to just ignore the cat is there a chance that they will ever be friends okay at first they will not like each other and might fight when they are around and the cat might hiss and growl and the puppy might take it as the cat is playing at first but then the puppy will get the hint all you can do is leave them in the same area and let them get used to each other on there own time for example i just got a chiuahaha and i have i cat and she is so used to having my house to herself and when she seen i had a dog for like the first week they faught and now they get along just fine every now and then they fight but other then that they get along just fine they clean each other i also have other cats and they liked my dog the minute he got here so it will take a little bit of time Dog training Dog Lady and the Tramp Cat Skinny Puppy 101 Dalmatians: The Series Nintendogs Fox hunting Border Terrier Beethoven (film) Socialization Bull Terrier Shetland Sheepdog Clifford's Puppy Days Dog show Dog agility Kakapo Mixed-breed dog Black Pete Breed standard American Pit Bull Terrier The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Fancy rat Into the West (miniseries) Tag Dog breeding German Shepherd Dog Labrador Retriever Richard Chase Paranoia Agent Rottweiler Ferret Pit bull Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Tosa (dog) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Garfield Krypto Fox Terrier (Smooth) Cats (musical) Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Kerry Blue Terrier Yorkshire Terrier Basset Hound Growlithe West Highland White Terrier Taikyoku shogi Puma Obedience training Border Collie Golden Retriever Scooby-Doo Puppy mill Dean Koontz I Haven't Got a Hat Miniature Fox Terrier Harry Nilsson Mange Staffordshire Bull Terrier American Eskimo Dog Best of Breed Crate training Petplay Fox Terrier (Wire) Ranma __ characters Jack Russell Terrier Spot the Dog Bark (dog) Terrier Snoopy Skye Terrier The Perishers Cairn Terrier Dobermann One Hundred and One Dalmatians United Kennel Club Pete the Pup Jam (TV series) Maltese (dog) Ron and Fez Australian Silky Terrier American Bulldog Krypto the Superdog Boston Terrier SMTV Live Alaskan Malamute American Kennel Club Maka dai dai shogi Shaggy dog story Chinese astrology Eddie Guerrero Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Gray Wolf Social rule Andr__s Galarraga Zoophilia Flea Miniature Pinscher Origins of baseball
