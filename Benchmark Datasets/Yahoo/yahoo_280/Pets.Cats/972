kitten comments and advice still nursing at months my month old bengal is a little strange he insists on nursing on my arm and if i try to make him stop he cries and whines about it he was with his mom until he was weeks she went into heat and her milk made the kittens sick so they were taken away weeks early kaidyn also insists he has to go everywhere with me he rides in the baby stroller walks on a harness and even likes car rides he even takes showers with me his favorite thing though is to sit in the baby swing and swing he even knows how to turn it on by himself i also have kaidyn's sister kianna and she is a perfectly normal cat she likes being held but doesn't insist on it all the time she seems normal compared to her brother i'm worried kaidyn may freak out when i go on vacation next month for weeks and i would love for him to be more independant than he is the cats won't be alone but they will be staying with someone other than me taking them is not possible any advice on kaidyn what you're getting here is anxiety from your cat self soothing behaviors being weaned at weeks of age is pretty good for a cat and if as you say you have his sister and she doesn't exhibit the same behaviors then kaidyn has bonded strongly to you and placed you very firmly in his mom's place and doesn't want to let go of his 'kitten role' some don't and always seem to want to keep a bit of the kitten behavior i have a female that still does the head nudges to my arm or shoulder when she wants pets like she would to her mom to get her to let the milk down it's just something that zuni does but if i don't let her or can't sit still for her to be petted she doesn't come unglued here is the problem with your kitty and quite honestly i see that part of the problem is probably coming from you for allowing it i don't mean to be harsh but if you allow him to go everywhere with you in a baby stroller car etc you have taught him that he is in fact your 'baby' and allowed to be part of your life in all aspects the coming vacation time will be very difficult for him starting right now begin to separate yourself from kaidyn more giving him more time with his sister and less time with you if he becomes aggitated there are products that will give some relief that are perfectly safe and natural such as bach's flower remedies try rescue remedy for anxiety you can find it on the internet to purchase in a number of places and it's usually available at most health food stores also prices vary so choose the ones that fit your budget there are others of his products that will help too when kaidyn wants to nurse give him some pets and love but firmly remove him from the nursing position and if you must set him down with some more pets walk away if you must give him some rescue remedy if he becomes upset directions and information are on website http www bachcentre com centre rescue htm and work hard to help him get more independent before you leave on vacation if you do take him with you on a walk or a car trip take kianna with you also don't make him the 'special one' but i truly think it might be best to stop that for a bit until after the vacation just try to wean yourself and kaidyn from each other and i'm sure things will work out would you mind giving an update later on i'd be curious to see how things work out good luck Breastfeeding Cat Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Garfield Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Milton H.
