do you think cats can sense something is going to happen before it happens i had a cat a couple years ago and i was sitting on my bedroom floor placing some good food down on the floor for the cat to eat i don't remember what i think it was some chicken or something point is it was definately a yummy treat that i expected my cat to gobble up instead all of a sudden the cat got all tense and freaked out and was staring inside my closet it just kept looking in there and it's eyes were real big she lost all intrest in the food and ran under the bed no more than minutes later a fire started in that same closet i swear to this day i still don't know how that fire started but it was a serious fire the whole place burnt my family and i made it out unharmed thank goodness but sadly i don't think my poor cat made it out i never saw her after that does anyone besides me think that this cat sensed that something wasn't right or am i crazy for even thinking that thanks and sorry this is so long cpinatsi i'm sorry but i was more worried about getting my two small children out of there than my cat the front door was open while the house was on fire but i think my poor cat died while trying to save her litter of kittens of course i was sad about it but there wasn't much i could do for her cpinatsi by the way i did not give you a thumbs down catloverami i would hope that if when you have children your first thought would be to get them out by the time we realised the fire and got ourselves out the whole bedroom was aflame the house was filling with smoke and windows were exploding so no i did not go back in and try to save my cat they do did you read about all the animals and their reactions during the big tsunami there was another article recently in the paper about a cat in a nursing home who would go to the rooms of patients who it sensed were gonna die the cat has a perfect track record i believe Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Milton H.
