cat and dog fleas help help please months ago i noticed my dog was itching alot at close hand i notice a couple of fleas so off i went to vets and bought front line for cat and dog also a spray which you spray in a room and leave for mins striped the beds and washed sprayed mattresses etc after mins hoovered all up and washed wooden floors this is ment to last up to months but no dog got fleas again cat was clean so i put the spot on again and sprayed all the house again dog is washed nearly every day in flea shampoo now and is getting on my nerves please can i do any thing else dog does not go out the garden and is white and nearly shaven lol the last straw has to be to find the cat a new home as i think its the cat bringing them in as had the dog years and not had this before please any help firstly you are washing your dog way too often and thats probably why the spot on isn't working secondly if your cat was bringing in fleas the cat would have them too maybe you need to treat the house again what kind of heating do you have fleas love central heating and hot air blowers you have to apply frontline every weeks i use advocate which covers fleas worms lice ticks etc maybe try a different treatment after all some things are more effective than others it may be that frontline doesn't suit your dog but in my opinion its not working because you are washing your dog too often dogs only need washing a few times a year unless of course they've been rolling in the mud good luck Flea Mattress Sento Fire fighting Dog Fancy rat Shampoo Pet skunk Red Hot Chili Peppers Hamster Dog training Heartworm Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Massage Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ron Weasley Cat Lisa the Vegetarian AFI 100 Years series Japanese toilet Neighbours Skunk John Frusciante RuneScape quests Tire Hall & Oates Rabies Ranma __ characters Garfield Billboard Hot 100 Kitchen Housebreaking Upholstery Guinea pig Common cold Spidey Super Stories Rose Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Bedbug Clothing Glossary of nautical terms Fountain Hair Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Price Is Right Maneki Neko Professional wrestling holds Social rule Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fan (implement) Lyme disease Richard Chase Hazing Drag racing Eczema Unclean animals Professional wrestling match types Teacher's Pet (Disney) Urinary incontinence Invader Zim Chocolate Car washing techniques Ren and Stimpy Hand grenade Ferret Kakapo Diseases of the honeybee Woodworking Fecal incontinence Palindrome Kim Possible Opportunity rover EastEnders Dandruff Luck McMansion Quake III Arena Philip J.
