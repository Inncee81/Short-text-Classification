my friend took in a momma cat with kittens the kits are wks and momma was put down with fel leukemia dy i had my heart set on one kitten and they all seem happy and frisky but so did mom i'm confused by the on line info about cat lukaemia some info says the kittens may be fine but other info makes it sound like all cats should be sick i have other cats and would never want to expose them unknowingly should we bother having the kitten tested or should my friend have the whole litter put down this is heart wrenching and confusing has anyone else had this experience i would love some thoughts here is a statement so not all cats will be exposed from the mother if that is the source felv usually spreads through infected saliva it can also spread through infected urine tears and feces and through an infected mother to her kittens during gestation and nursing twenty percent of felv positive mothers pass the virus to their kittens methods of transmission include the following bite wounds from infected cats more common among outdoor and indoor outdoor cats blood transfusions mouth and nose contact with infected saliva or urine mutual grooming nose to nose contact shared food dishes and water bowls shared litter trays sneezing and here is another statement and the link is the second one in the source i just discovered that one of my cats has felv yet i have other cats as well what should i do unfortunately many felv infected cats are not diagnosed until after they have lived with other cats in such cases all other cats in the household should be tested for felv ideally infected and non infected cats should then be separated to eliminate the potential for felv transmission in other words test all the kittens some may not have it since only of mothers will give it to their kittens separate the kittens that have it Cat Feline leukemia virus Cytomegalovirus Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS H5N1 Hepatitis C Rabies Kitten Tuberculosis Transmission (medicine) Ebola Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Ferret Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pet skunk Group A streptococcal infection Lassa fever Escherichia coli O157:H7 Safe sex Hamster Elephant Prostate cancer HIV test Body piercing Chagas disease Tobacco smoking Feline immunodeficiency virus Meme Diabetes mellitus Computer virus Entamoeba histolytica 2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore Gonorrhoea Diseases of the honeybee HIV Sexually-transmitted infection Cocaine First aid Blood transfusion Tick AIDS reappraisal Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis B Malaria Marburg virus Breastfeeding 28 Days Later Chinchilla Toilet humour Cancer Obstetrics AIDS pandemic Socialization Dog Poliomyelitis Hepatitis Medicine Rocky Mountain spotted fever Fertility awareness Human T-lymphotropic virus Coeliac disease Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Housebreaking RuneScape quests Toxoplasmosis Measles Traumatic brain injury Avian influenza Leptospirosis DDT Allergy Fancy rat Parvovirus B19 Anemia Manx (cat) Smallpox Intravenous therapy Leukemia AIDS Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Feral cat Joy Division (band) Lupus erythematosus Cephalic disorder Ultraviolet Infectious mononucleosis Urine Sluggy Freelance Phoebe Buffay's songs Vulcan (Star Trek)
