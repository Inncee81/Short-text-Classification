cats traveling overseas i may be moving overseas and i was wondering what the options for taking you cats with you on an air plane with are my cats a completely different but they are both freaked out when it comes to any traveling i heard about tranquilizers but i don't really know too much about it i would rather have both of my cats sleep through out the ride of course i would go to a veterinary before any of this happends to get opinions and vacinations but i thought i would ask here as well thanks there are very strict rules in many countries about bringing pets along often there is a variable quarantine time where your pet must be in a kennel as well as guidelines about vaccines etc just something else to consider as well as the plane ride there are some sedatives that your vet might recommend when it comes time to travel one non prescription sedative that works really great on my cat is rescue remedy a bach flower essence that you can get at most holistic natural food stores your vet will probably tell you this but try anything that you are going to give before the trip you don't want your kitties to have a bad reaction in the middle of the trip you must make a reservation for your animal with the airline when you get your tickets which will be extra what a ripoff as long as your cats aren't monster sized they should be able to ride with you in the cabin which i would recommend unless they are going to holler the entire time any soft sided carrier thats labeled for airline travel will work and then you just put them under the seat in front of you they are considered your carry on but you must still pay money to have them with you fyi my small dog travels wonderfully on a plane often when i leave people comment they didn't even know there was an animal aboard i have never taken an overseas flight with her though you also need to consider food water litterbox availability if you're going to be on a really long flight your vet can probably make recommendations once you figure out how long you will be in the air and what your layovers are Cat Pet skunk Ryanair Airline Dog Rabies Public transport RuneScape quests Veterinarian Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret Hong Kong International Airport Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Guinea pig Boeing 747 Docking Socialization Aircraft USS Waters (DD-115) USS Enterprise (CVN-65) Hamster The Amazing Race USS Forrestal (CVA-59) RuneScape locations Domestic rabbit Lisa the Vegetarian Pan American World Airways Malaysia Airlines Mattress Air New Zealand Food and Drug Administration Microchip implant (animal) MN Airlines, LLC Vietnam Airlines Fancy rat Greyhound Friends USS Wallace L.
