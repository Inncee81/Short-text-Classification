what are the costs involved in having a little puzzy a kitten will need inoculations and neutering about if i have a male cat can i do without these a cat will eat about one tin of food a day how do people who have loads of cats manage what is a low cost pet thinking about rats ignoring my dogs hamsters and my fish just on my three cats alone i don't spend that much really on them a month they go to the vet once a year unless sick so that is each a year for vet visit then they have food which is a bag and i go threw a bag about every months and then they share cans of wet cat food every other day which is for cans and then their litter is a month so in all honesty they don't cost that much besides initial cost of buying everything they need and then adopting them as for a 'cheap' animal i don't think there is a such thing even a rat would cost i have two hamsters and they have bags of food but that lasts severl months then about in bedding a week i would go with a hermit crab or a fish maybe they are cheap but need a lot of work no animal is cheap to own but everything you give into them they give back fold in love Cat Hamster Ferret Guinea pig Dog Pet skunk Kitten Fancy rat Feral cat Socialization Domestic rabbit Phoebe Buffay's songs Pet Pet store House Mouse Animal testing Taboo food and drink RuneScape quests Tesco Canning Felis sapiens Dairy Animal communication Jade Emperor Spidey Super Stories Flea Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Internet phenomenon Veterinarian Cuttlefish Confidence trick Brown Rat Ren and Stimpy Vomiting Castration Coconut crab Hunting Tooth enamel Mutts Dustbin Rat Carnivore Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Golden Hamster Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Island restoration Meat Feral Mattress Homer Simpson Plastic Food preservation Hedgehog The Secret of NIMH Stock car (rail) Kashrut Seabird Rabbit Coprophagia Emergency preparedness Tlingit Rule of St Benedict Manx (cat) American Black Bear Shaggy dog story Microchip implant (animal) Theory of conduct Gambian pouch rat Puma Little Britain Plastic bag Ralston Purina Company Animal Sick Puppy Baldrick Octopus Kangaroo Chinchilla Estrus cycle Soap opera Kodocha Animal rights Economy of India Red Fox Dog training Dean Koontz SpongeBob SquarePants Sewage treatment The Cat in the Hat Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers The Young Ones (TV series) Badly Drawn Kitties Ron Weasley German grammar Kakapo Fast food
