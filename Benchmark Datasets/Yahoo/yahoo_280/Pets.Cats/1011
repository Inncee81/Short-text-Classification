is there any way i can teach my bengal cat to stop jumping on the counter taunting my other cat etc i've had my beautiful bengal kitten for about months now and it's hard to get him to behave i've run out of ideas i've tried the squirting him with a water bottle when he is misbehaving he loves the water so it's more of a play time for him i've tried the pennies in a can idea and that just doesn't work i've also tried picking him up and placing him on the floor saying no very firmly nothing just seems to be working i know he's still a kitten and is just curious but i do not feel safe with him always up on kitchen counters and taunting my other bigger cat what else can i do to help train him any suggestions ahh just my area of expertise first of all water yelling and scruff grabs are no good to a bengal nonetheless any other cat to train a 'wilder by nature' cat you need consistancy w words and actions i have male indoor cats and outdoor feral that i ve trained they dont jump on counters or fight with one another counters get a spray can filled with air u would use one on computers and etc and u can find it in the computer aisles not only will the sound get them but the fact that there's something blowing on them just gets their nerves the spray cans are harmless so if u manage to spray in the face by accident theres no harm pick a word or a phrase to use when using the can only i used 'get down' spray the cat with the air and say get down loud and firm continue spraying until he gets down dont remove him yourself stick with one word it'll take time but it will work nowadays if my cats attempt something they arent allowed to do just the sight of the can or me coming or just the words get down motivate them enough as far as fighting goes when it happens i just grab the cat that started it and give him tight snuggles he'll struggle and whine about it but i dont let go i hold him for about minutes he's a lap cat still and now he looks for me when he's feeling fiesty and if i'm in sight he doesn't dare lol i have to run to dinner if you have any other questions feel free to contact me nannographical aol com Tag Fire fighting Cat Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Toilet humour Dog training Diving Combine (Half-Life 2) Billiards Conspiracy (TNG episode) Atomic Kitten Marathon (computer game) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pure Pwnage Columbine High School massacre Pittsburgh Steelers Kakapo Skateboarding trick Garfield America Online 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jam (TV series) GunZ The Duel Baroque chess Guilty Gear Dundas Square Cincinnati Bengals Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Ben Johnson (athlete) Japanese toilet Escape from New York Tenshinhan Kitchen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hiking Indian rebellion of 1857 Good Times Syphon Filter The Jim Rome Show Rose (Doctor Who) Son Gohan Guinea pig Jumpstart 3rd Grade Russian joke Piccolo Junior Saga Blood (computer game) Ultimate (sport) Professional wrestling throws Theory of conduct The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Electrophysiology Housebreaking Martial art Ferret Taikyoku shogi Avenue Q Winning Streak Aikido Professional wrestling match types Hand grenade Parkour Pinball Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Kasparov versus The World Professional wrestling holds Ed, Edd n Eddy Theodicy Jazz Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Tick Felis sapiens Athletics Computer virus World War Three (Doctor Who) New York Giants The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Codename: Kids Next Door Urinary incontinence SMTV Live The Death Gate Cycle Ice hockey Natural Selection (computer game) Jackass: The Movie Buddhism The Legend of Zelda series enemies Domestic rabbit
