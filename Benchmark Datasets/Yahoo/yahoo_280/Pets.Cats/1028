why is my kitten moaning he is usually playful and very active and cuddley today and yesterday he is laying around and whenever someone even goes to pet him he moans even if he isnt touched he is not eating either please help ugh sorry to hear this yes you should probably take him to a vet if he's not moving at all getting up walking about then there's a good chance he's suffering from related issues from one of the common diseases like feline leukemia or kitty aids if not treated your kitten will probably suffer kidney failure or some other catastrophic system shutdown and die it is possible of course he's suffered an injury and taking him to your vet would be the thing to do their too we've fostered hundreds of strays and we lose a lot of kittens to this stuff it's the most dangerous time for them if he survives to six months cats can usually live a happy long life with proper medical care if this cat is a stray hasn't had shots or been checked or is from a stray then definitely get him checked even if he isn't it's still possible the visit and diagnosis shouldn't run more than and then you can decide what to do but please do something if it is the above he'll suffer greatly for many hours before he dies Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pet skunk Garfield Kitten Rabies Medicine Guinea pig Tuberculosis Fancy rat Cats (musical) Leukemia Socialization Diabetes mellitus Triage Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Heartworm Aortic dissection Theory of conduct Myocardial infarction Prostate cancer First aid Terri Schiavo Kodocha Phoebe Buffay's songs Stomach cancer Atomic Kitten Puma Blood (computer game) Anorexia nervosa Stroke Veterinarian Paget's disease of bone Pneumonia Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Smoking Room AIDS Joy Division (band) Pitaten Escape from New York Equine conformation Cancer Growth hormone treatment Duesberg hypothesis Feline leukemia virus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hip fracture Domestic rabbit Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder National Institutes of Health Hamster Folic acid Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Abu Dhabi Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hypertension Catscratch Cirrhosis Abortion debate Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Kidney Animal euthanasia Lupus erythematosus Little Britain Malignant melanoma Terri Schiavo timeline Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Radiation poisoning Epilepsy Girly John F.
