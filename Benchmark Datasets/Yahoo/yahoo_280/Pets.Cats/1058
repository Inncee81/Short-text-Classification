can a female cat not go into heat i have a two year old female that that was the runt of her litter we have not got her fixed yet since she has been an indoor cat and she has never done the dread yowl i remember well from my cat growing up well now we live in a townhouse and she has been pushing her way outside it is time to get her fixed but what i would like to know she has never shown any signs of being in heat she is also very anti social and doesn't like people could she just not be going through heat or just shy away for us not to notice because of her social anxiety also can a cat spontaneously go into heat when outside or is it in a cycle cats are pretty sneaky about a heat cycle especially if they are also shy cats anyway dogs have a much more obvious discharge it's easy to miss a cat's cycle that's how so many people end up with oops litters a friend of mine never noticed her cat in heat but wondered why every so often the cat peed in her laundry and hung out at the windows and doors i told her she was probably in heat and her vet confirmed it they can come in as often as once a month depending on the cat and they can become pregnant again while still nursing a litter cats are really prolific i would get her spayed asap so you don't have the responsibility of placing kittens most shelters are absolutely overrun with cats and many now refuse to take them i rescue street cats and after i've placed cats with everyone i know and many live with me i've run out of places too and it kills me to see them sick and on the streets unwanted kittens are so easy to prevent and your kitty will be much happier and calmer did you know that queens female cats that keep cycling and don't get bred can even get sick Cat Domestic rabbit Socialization Dog Pet skunk Kitten Feral cat Manx (cat) Guinea pig Garfield RuneScape quests Estrus cycle Hamster Gray Wolf Fancy rat Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jam (TV series) Lion Tobacco smoking Feral Housebreaking Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Nuclear power Code: Lyoko Paranoia Agent God Emperor of Dune Tick Ren and Stimpy Chinese astrology Badly Drawn Kitties Dean Koontz Theory of conduct Characters of Lost Shaggy dog story Joke Tigon Prisoner (TV series) One Piece minor characters Chinese calendar Traumatic incident reduction Azumanga Daioh House Mouse European Rabbit Menstrual cycle Sheryl Crow Social rule Inception of Darwin's theory First aid EastEnders Okashina Okashi The Marshall Mathers LP Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Golden Retriever Cat litter Pet store Glossary of climbing terms Entropy Fire fighting The Death Gate Cycle Oh My Goddess!
