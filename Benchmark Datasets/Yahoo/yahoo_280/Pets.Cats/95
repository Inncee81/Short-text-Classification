my cat doesn't like my husband any suggestions i adopted a kitten a year ago from the humane society to keep my other cat company when i adopted her my husband was deployed to iraq he came home about seven months later and ever since the cat has hated him she doesn't hiss or anything but if he comes into the room she hides or runs away i've tried the technique of him feeding her so that she associates him in a positive manner but that doesn't really help he pets her when she lets him and is gentle but she refuses to bond with him any suggestions serious answers only please thank you there can be many reasons why your cat is afraid of your husband he shouldn't reach for her or try to grab her because that is too scary just think about how much bigger he is please be patient and let her come to you some cats are just more timid than others and some cats pick a human to be theirs and no other human will do he can try tempting her with treats it might be the fact that he smells different than you do maybe he should give you a big hug before he tries to pet the cat if that doesn't work you could try rubbing the cat's blanket on his hands first cats are very sensitive about smells in time the cat may warm up to him and then it may not Cat Pet skunk Dog Shaggy dog story Dog training Sin City Feral cat Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 2) RuneScape quests Ranma __ characters Domestic rabbit Socialization Care Bears Kitten Skunk Hamster Guinea pig Social rule One Piece minor characters Garfield Characters in the Smurfs Fancy rat Friends Characters of Naruto Animal communication EastEnders Azumanga Daioh Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Hellsing Jam (TV series) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Smoking Room Ron Weasley Spanking Lie Minor Harry Potter Beasts Teacher's Pet (Disney) Code: Lyoko Ultimate Spider-Man Tobacco smoking Albatross Breastfeeding Zoophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) InuYasha (character) Rabbit Cro Kim Possible Xiaolin Showdown Surveillance Taboo food and drink The Subtle Knife Doomsday argument Baldrick The Amber Spyglass The Star Wars Holiday Special Plame affair Haven (TNG episode) Toilet humour Rei Ayanami Symbiosis (TNG episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kakapo Manx (cat) Tyrannosaurus rex Lazarus Long Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Kasparov versus The World Abortion debate Massage D.N.
