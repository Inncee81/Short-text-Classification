cat at the very start of kidney failure what to expect my year old cat was just found to have elevated creatinine levels other kidney factors in blood test were in normal range after ua showed that her kidneys are not concentrating her urine enough she just had a bladder infection took antibiotics and the infection has cleared her appetite and activity levels are as usual still the vet said the next step is to do a different ua after an overnight fluid restriction to confirm that she her kidneys are not working right then we will put her on k d food if need be so i would like to hear especially from those who have gone through this with their cat what to expect the kinds of things you don't think to ask about in the vet's office my cat is on k d food which i believe is the most amazing thing in the world before this he was losing wait sleeping constantly he had no energy and no will to even eat now he's outside chasing butterflies and even putting on weight the k d food will not hurt a healthy cat and will help massively if the cat does have kidney problems so i'd suggest starting now before you even get the results back my cat has also been taking a tablet called fortekor at mg ask your vet if that would be appropriate it's just a daily pill and fantastic another important thing to ask is if the vet can discover the cause if there is a cause then you also need to be treating that unfortunately my cats illness has no cause so he will be unlikely to live more than years and since he's also only years old this is particularly tragic luckily for you this is often not the case things you might test for include polycystic kidneys and lymphoma water consumption will also go up so it's important to provide enough personally i have given him sources of water one upstairs one downstairs and one outside and he still drinks out of the toilet when he gets the chance due to this she will also need to urinate more so be prepared for the odd accident it's not intentional she really can't help it the most important thing to remember is that your cat can still live out its life normally and without pain if you manage the problem this means a low protein diet proper medication and a lot of water good luck Kidney Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dieting Prostate cancer Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Pneumonia Folic acid Cancer Insulin Hypertension Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypoglycemia Fancy rat Cirrhosis Paracetamol Vitamin C Atkins Nutritional Approach Kidney stone Diabetic nephropathy Tocopherol Paget's disease of bone Diabetes insipidus Coeliac disease Group A streptococcal infection Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Gout Ferret IgA nephropathy Raw food diet Anorexia nervosa Acute renal failure Domestic rabbit Lupus erythematosus Nephrology Obesity Hepatitis Aspartame Veganism Diarrhea Psoriasis Urinary system Tobacco smoking Glycogen storage disease type I Medical analysis of circumcision Blood Theory of conduct Turner syndrome Traumatic brain injury Obstetrics Crohn's disease Multiple sclerosis Sickle-cell disease Colorectal cancer Antiretroviral drug Renal physiology Hyperglycemia Sugar substitute Nephrotic syndrome Acne Water Cat Cytomegalovirus Atherosclerosis Oral contraceptive Bipolar disorder Protein-energy malnutrition Urinary tract infection Menstrual cycle Multiple myeloma Caffeine Polycystic ovary syndrome Low-carbohydrate diet Psychosis Livestock Antibiotic Anemia Common cold Diabetic ketoacidosis Legionellosis Adjustable gastric band Organ transplant Herpes simplex virus Endometriosis
