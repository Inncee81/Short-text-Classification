why is it that my one yr old cat who was a stray that came to my place after my neighbors abandoned the poor kitten which i've had for a year would accept other stray cats on her domain male or female she thinks it's her territory but oh no if stray dogs come on her property she chases them she chased a lab unless we're around the dog then it's the challenge so why doesn't she have a problem with cats she doesn't know and willing to share with them i know cats hate dogs but still her property is my house and the land surrounding it i live out in the country it's a territory issue she is protecting her territory that's normal behavior good luck Cat Manx (cat) Garfield Public domain Feral cat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Xiaolin Showdown Cats (musical) Ferret Philosophy of language Brian Griffin Animal shelter Luck Ten Commandments Arab-Israeli conflict Trailer Park Boys UN Security Council Resolution 242 The Fairly OddParents People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kim Possible Socialization Trademark Feral Lion Fox hunting Dog agility Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Kodocha Brown Bear Blue Dog Democrats Israeli West Bank barrier SMTV Live CatDog Rabies Steven Wright Lady and the Tramp Mickey Mouse Characters in the Smurfs Neighbours Ren and Stimpy Property (ownership right) State Anti-virus software Kitten Azumanga Daioh OpenBSD The Perishers Leopard Pitaten Gray Wolf Polygamy Care Bears Intellectual property Stray Cats Dean Koontz Light pollution Bank Rocko's Modern Life Eminent domain W.I.T.C.H.
