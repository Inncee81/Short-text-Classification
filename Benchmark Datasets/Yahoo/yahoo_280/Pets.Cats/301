baby kitten question i found a kitten what can i do to save it this morning i went out to do some shopping as i began to drive i saw a dead cat at my corner she appeared to have been hit by a car and was splattered all over the road then i looked and i see something moving not that far away it is a new born kitten its eyes aren t even open and it can t walk yet i picked it up and now have it at home what should i do with it obviously it needs to be nursed by a cat should i bring it to an animal hospital they should be able to take care of it can i feed it some kind of formula and attempt to save it myself the issue with that is i work all day right now it chirps probably calling for its mother i have brought the kitten to a hour animal hospital they will take care of it better than i could ever do on my own the nurse there said the kitten was no more than to days old since it still had a small piece of the umbilical cord i did not find any other kittens where i found this one hopefully it was the only one in the litter local pet stores or vet offices should have a formula that is made for kittens take the kitten to a vet to raise an orphaned pet is a very tiring but rewarding job you also need to know that after you feed it you need to gently rub its genitals to make it eliminate or it will die the mother does this for a few weeks after birth some vet offices may offer to take care of it during the day while you work my vet did when i lost my dog after she had pups good luck Kitten Guinea pig Cat Ferret Domestic rabbit Hamster Pet skunk Pet store Sin City Childbirth Socialization Fancy rat Atomic Kitten Microchip implant (animal) RuneScape quests Dead Like Me Housebreaking Scooby-Doo Veterinarian StarCraft: Hybrid Manx (cat) Tick Neighbours Phoebe Buffay's songs Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Pet EastEnders Feral cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Rabies Taikyoku shogi Brown Bear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ron Weasley Azumanga Daioh Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Infant The Contender (television series) Barry Horne Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Social rule Knots Landing Midwifery Paul Is Dead Jam (TV series) Animal communication Fetus Shark Adoption Ralston Purina Company Obstetrics Everwood House Mouse Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gray Wolf Internet phenomenon Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Blood (computer game) Sexual reproduction Softball Cats (musical) Richard Chase Cuteness Louis Wain Giant Panda Dog training Goatse.cx Ayrton Senna RuneScape Random Events Killian documents Badly Drawn Kitties Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 T'Pol Golden Retriever Ron and Fez Hillary Rodham Clinton Neopets Delta Goodrem Premature birth Terri Schiavo Tokyo Mew Mew Xiaolin Showdown Mid-levels 1957 World Series Medicare (Canada) Serval Teacher's Pet (Disney) Girly Aphrodite
