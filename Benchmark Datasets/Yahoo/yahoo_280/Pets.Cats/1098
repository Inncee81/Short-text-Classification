tips on introducing a new kitten to our cat hello all we already have a female cat who is year her name is lala we also just recently got a new kitten who is a boy and his name is meatball we figured she might like having a new companion yet it seems like shes not having it at all i was wondering if anyone had any tips on introducing them to one another and creating a kitty harmony right now we keep meatball in a seperate room and we havent really let them see eachother we also have been switching them in and out of eachothers rooms so they can sniff eachother lala seems kind of aggresive towards him shes always hissing at the door he is behind and she hisses at us if we smell like him it just seems like she hates him i would hate for them to never get along i would really love for them to get along and any help is very much appreciated thanks lala has been our only baby for awhile so i can understand her jealousy thanks for all your answers yes miss lala is the alpha diva and yes she is spayed there hasn't really been much going on except for her hissing at us and meatball we have also been sticking a sock on our hand when we pet meatball and pet lala with it too to swap smells that doesn't bother her really also has anyone heard of or used feliway spray i heard that that can also help in introducing cats thanks again hissing and growling is usual cats hate change and lala considers herself alpha and now there is competition if there is only hissing and no blood drawn then there is no need to keep them separate any longer time is the best healer of disputes witchie gave you good advice you can also take a towel and rub each of them in turn transferring the scents to each other that works best when they simply don't recognize each other however like on a return from a vet visit when they come back with the dreaded 'vet scent' let them see each other and simply watch unless it gets real serious let them do what they want and by serious i mean fur really flying and serious biting or clawing growling and hissing is to be expected perhaps this might go on for several weeks and then lessen and perhaps they become even bosom buddies just be sure to have meatball neutered at the appropriate age i hope lala is spayed Cat Pet skunk Garfield Ferret Dog Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Kitten Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Guinea pig Feral cat Phoebe Buffay's songs Skunk Housebreaking Badly Drawn Kitties W.I.T.C.H.
