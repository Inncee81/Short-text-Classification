i just got a new kitten how do i potty train her because on the search it says to put her in a cage noway the searches say to put the kitten in a cage with her food water and a litter box but i will not put her in a cage she has a free spirit and i have another that is already potty trained how old is the kitten potty training doesn't kick in until they are around weeks after that it seems almost instinctive to most cats put her poop in her box show it to her let her sniff use her paw to cover it with litter and let her jump out on her own she will catch on quickly hint for super young kitties it's helpful to have a few boxes around the house in different rooms they're just like little kids at first and can't hold it long enough to run to the box all the way on the other side of the house also get a box with shorter sides while she's small if she can't get into it she can't use it p s i agree with you kittens shouldn't be penned up to be trained caging cats makes them focus on escape not potty training the only exception is a stubborn cat that refuses to use the litter box but that's a different question lol Cat Kitten Hamster Ferret Garfield Fancy rat RuneScape quests Toilet humour Professional wrestling match types Mixed martial arts Dog training Softball Pet skunk Trapping Sarah Kerrigan Housebreaking Chinchilla Xiaolin Showdown Dog Pitaten Tag B3ta Hello Kitty Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Joy Division (band) Aerial (dance move) Escape from New York Cat litter Glossary of American football Vegeta Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Poker jargon SpongeBob SquarePants Clouded Leopard The Inside Fox hunting Soap opera Big Brother UK series 5 Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Internet phenomenon Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Socialization Volleyball Japanese Bobtail (cat) Bengal cat Ren and Stimpy Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Brown Bear Crate training Drizzt Do'Urden House Mouse Suplex Days of our Lives Rabbit Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rugby union positions Ron and Fez European Rabbit Eddie Guerrero Trailer Park Boys Toilet training Atomic Kitten The Sims Siamese (cat) Good Times House of M Cuteness Cat Stevens Saw II Red Squirrel Toilet The Island (2005 film) The Catcher in the Rye Sluggy Freelance Tai shogi Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Asiatic Golden Cat Invader Zim Manx (cat) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Balinese (cat) Kurt Cobain The Cure Magic (illusion) Canadian football Nico Robin Feral cat The Ersatz Elevator Glossary of partner dance terms Triathlon John Cage Beat generation Janet Jackson Animal Crossing Starfleet ranks and insignia Equine conformation YuYu Hakusho
