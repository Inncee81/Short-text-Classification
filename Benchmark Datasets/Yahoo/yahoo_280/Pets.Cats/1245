how do you introduce two new cats to my cat that we've had for several years it's a long story but we have a cat and now we got two more but when we gently tried to show them to the cat we've had for several years one at a time our older cat and the newer cats hissed and growled every time we don't want to stress out the older years kitty but she needs to learn to get along with the other two who are both sisters right now they are seperated but the older cat freaks out when we show her one of the other two is there a way to make them friends i'm sure they will get along eventually and we aren't forcing them to become friends with the older cat any one know of a solution anuolf i know what you mean about how it's like someone coming into your home and eating your food sleeping in your bed all that lol and chicki thanks for the great information is was hard to pick the best answer and on the good side the two new cats get along extremely well with us because long story but we've actually had them for almost a year but they were outdoor cats long story though lol i'm assuming you have the two sisters living in one section of the house the other cat living in another section of the house the easy way is to swap the cats over they will then get used to each others smells before they actually meet face to face and will reduce the amount of hissing you get however no matter how you go about it hissing will occur it usually only lasts a week and they will sort out who is boss and then once that is done it's back to normal they will soon be friends Cat Friends The Cure Phoebe Buffay's songs Alger Hiss Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Pok__mon Abilities Kakapo Dominoes Sin City Polish language Gramophone record RuneScape quests Garfield Dog training Mattress The Amber Spyglass Ron and Fez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Days of our Lives Badly Drawn Kitties 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule W.I.T.C.H.
