help my cat might dye omg omg my cat is an outside and inside cat and has fleas so i bought this flea spray and decided to spray him outside cause then the fleas will jump off him inside the house so thats why i did it outside well i started spraying him and he didnt like it and ran around the yard but you have to wait min and wipe the spray off before the cat licks himself cause its poison so he jumped over the fence and went somewhere but i know he'll come back he always does but im afraid he will lick himself will it affect him and kill him what should i do it could make him sick try clinking his dishes together or running the can opener or whatever you do when you feed him then wipe him down immediately don't panic he'll sense your anxiety and won't come back just be calm and do the food thing he should come if he doesn't and comes back later sick take him to the vet right away and next time treat him with advantage or front line or some other kind of flea treatment that stuff you buy at wal mart can make cats sick get it from the vet it's the safest best option Cat Fire fighting RuneScape quests Red Hot Chili Peppers Full Metal Panic?
