i feel so good heres why do you think i did good i was playing with my kitten with some string then i got a phone call so i went to get the phone call when i came back i found that my cat strangled herself with the string and was not breathing i wiped the saliva from her mouth put her on her side kept her mouth closed and blew into her nostrils after seconds of this she started breathing and licked herself immediatly i think it's amazing really my husband's year old granddaughter flung her kitten from her when it hissed and it hit against the wall and fell into a crumpled heap his daughter was on the phone with us at the time and we heard the children crying her husband took it outside she thought he would shoot it but instead he did the same thing you did and the kitten revived it had the wind knocked out of it but no lasting harm was done her vet said the kitten survived simply because it is a kitten and its bones are still soft now a word to the wise about that string a cat or dog can swallow string and it leads to real problems stick to ribbons that you've tied into a knot at the end that way they don't swallow threads Cat Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Salad Fingers Blood on the Tracks Textile manufacturing Atomic Kitten Jam (TV series) Oral sex Knots Landing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction About a Boy The Inside Future-Drama The End of the World (Doctor Who) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cats (musical) Stuttering One Piece minor characters Diving Softball EastEnders Theory of conduct Toilet humour Leviathan The Legend of Zelda series enemies Kodocha StarCraft: Hybrid Book of Isaiah Blood (computer game) Vegeta United Airlines Flight 93 Happy Tree Friends RuneScape quests Jon Secada Through the Looking-Glass GunBound Dodgeball 1957 World Series Violin The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Saliva Tooth enamel Campfire Guinea pig John Forsythe Azumanga Daioh Big Brother UK series 5 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Internet phenomenon Rabies The Sound of Music Kirby The Beatles bootlegs Chocolate Phoebe Buffay's songs Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Tooth Shen Gong Wu Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Wonderland (McFly album) Goatse.cx Rais massacre Social rule Nose flute Mach kernel Philosophy of language The Marshall Mathers LP Spanking American Psycho Tlingit The Ashlee Simpson Show Lightning Sin City Characters of Lost Basic English Buddy Guy The Lovely Bones Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Suffering (game) Hearing impairment Vampire Bleeding Good Morning, Vietnam The Empty Child Trailer Park Boys GunZ The Duel Drowning Table tennis Friends Scenes from a Memory Trapping
