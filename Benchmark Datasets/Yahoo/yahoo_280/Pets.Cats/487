helping an adopted pregnant stray cat any advice about months ago a friendly stray cat started coming around the house she looked really thin and was super friendly so i decided to start feeding her and giving her water i guess you can now call her my cat cuz i have put a collar on her and she comes running when she hears my car pull up she has now grown a belly which i've noticed is getting bigger so i'm pretty sure she's pregnant my dad absolutely hates cats and will not let me bring her inside nor keep her in the garage i want to make sure she and her babies will be safe when they are born we have coyotes around and would hate for anything to happen to them i would like to keep her close to the house so i can find homes for the babies when the times comes which i've already found one home and spay her after the litter is born any advice on what i should do i don't want to call the animal control for she is now considered my cat i don't have a problem with taking the kittens to the shelter to find them homes but she leah is my cat and i'm not taking her to the shelter call the shelter and talk to them we had a cat that was pregnant and could not keep the kittens they agreed to keep her until the kittens were weaned then keep the kittens and give her back to us as it turned out the kittens didn't survive but she was so young and the kittens so big she wouldn't have survived if she hadn't been there with constant vet care Cat Kitten Feral cat Pet skunk Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Neighbours Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Jon Secada Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Manx (cat) Phoebe Buffay's songs Guinea pig The Inside Breastfeeding RuneScape quests Friends Hamster Socialization Knots Landing EastEnders Characters of Lost Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Atomic Kitten Big Brother UK series 5 John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Ferret Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Animal shelter Kurt Cobain Phoebe Halliwell Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Satchel Paige Care Bears Feral Scenes from a Memory Xiaolin Showdown Rais massacre The Amber Spyglass Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Microchip implant (animal) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Grandview, U.S.A.
