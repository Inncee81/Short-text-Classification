can i give cheese to my baby cat i have an adorable month old baby cat he is very healthy and he loves cheese spreading cream cheese is his favorite i'm just wondering if it's ok for me to give cheese to him everyday as a treat but cheese is kinda salty and too much salt is bad for kittnes the other issue that you're overlooking is the milk that is in the cheese cat's can't properly digest cow's milk and giving it to your kitty is going to do one of two things plug him up or give him serious diarrhea neither of which is a good thing at that age the only things your kitty should be getting are kitten dry food and possibly some wet food as a treat every now and again Milk Cheese Kitten Dairy Fecal incontinence Soy milk Genericized trademark Cat Guinea pig Diarrhea Yoghurt Phoebe Buffay's songs Butter Dairy product Tofu Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hamster Kosher foods Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Cuisine of the Philippines Domestic rabbit Pasteurization Livestock Jewish cuisine Chocolate Atkins Nutritional Approach Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Cheddar cheese Toilet humour Jersey Breakfast Veganism Stomach cancer Internet phenomenon French cuisine Happy Meal Ren and Stimpy Dairy cattle Polish cuisine Food Hello Kitty Dairy farming Omega-3 fatty acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bagel Tooth Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ricotta cheese Treecat Ice cream M__m__lig__ Breast milk Pet skunk Raw milk Ron and Fez Vegetarianism Basic taste The Beatles bootlegs Soybean Trailer Park Boys Cuisine of Denmark Salad Asiago cheese Nestl__ Organic food Garfield Socialization Meat analogue Nutrition Cuisine of Finland Muenster cheese Infant formula Poker jargon Water Quark (food) Hot dog German cuisine Biscuit The Super Milk-chan Show Cuisine of Norway Japanese cuisine In-N-Out Burger Carnivore Gorgonzola cheese New Zealand English Animal rights Vegetarian cuisine Basic English Codename: Kids Next Door Ulcerative colitis Cheesecake Joke Sea-Monkey Cats (musical) Brie cheese Insulin French fries
