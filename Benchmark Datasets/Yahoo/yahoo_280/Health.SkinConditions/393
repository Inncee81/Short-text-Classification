this sounds grosss how do you get rid of blisters my feet are covered in them from marching and i need to know how to get rid of themm help the most important thing is cleanliness sometimes small blisters can be left alone but if they're likely to rupture or become torn open it's better to do it yourself under clean conditions you'll need a pin or needle if you happen to be diabetic or otherwise have access to sterile needles this is best sterile gauze pads rubbing alcohol and band aids if it isn't sterile clean the needle or pin you can soak it in diluted bleach if you rinse it very well with water afterward soap and water is better than nothing but you can also pour some of the rubbing alcohol over it some people hold the needle in a flame until it is red hot and let it cool use pliers to hold it and use sterile gauze to wipe some of the black carbon accumulation off of it if you use this method clean your feet with soap and water and then wipe down the affected areas with rubbing alcohol all of this cleaning may seem excessive if you aren't used to it but an infection will be very painful and will delay healing by quite a while it's much easier and safer to take the appropriate precautions now gently press the fluid in the blister to one side and pierce that side with the pin or needle pierce it from the side not from the top so you don't risk stabbing the very sensitive skin below the blister that would obviously be very painful and would risk drawing blood which would only complicate matters use a sterile gauze pad to gently press the fluid out of the blister ideally the skin on top of the blister will protect the underlying area as it heals so don't cut it away cover the entire area with a band aid fluid may accumulate again so you may have to drain it again in a day or two it's a good idea to to put on neosporin or any other anti microbial ointment you have if it repeatedly refills or if there are any signs of infection increased redness in the area or increased pain a cloudy white ish fluid or possibly swelling or feelings of heat in the area you might have better success by carefully removing the covering layer of dead skin use medical scissors if you have a pair or nail clippers if you can maneuver them well either way clean them well first so you can apply the ointment directly to the affected area keep it covered with a bandage since the blisters are on your feet you might want to use some sort of padding in your shoes until they aren't so painful you can use moleskin molefoam lamb's wool or other padding you can find at a pharmacy or supermarket just be sure to put them over the bandage not directly on top of the blisters if necessary you can put the padding around the blisters rather than directly on top of them to reduce painful direct pressure First aid Body piercing First aid kit Psoriasis Menstrual cup Fecal incontinence Agar plate Brewery Pneumonia Textile manufacturing Breastfeeding Earring Decompression sickness Callus Aloe Traumatic brain injury Hiking Skin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Upholstery Equine conformation Vampire Manicure Sunburn Hydrogen peroxide Gout Scarification Knife Hyperthermia Bong Childbirth Bleeding Fire fighting Sexually-transmitted infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common cold Swimming Insulin Cocaine Diabetes mellitus Casting Naruto jutsu Tuberculosis Prostate cancer Acne Ultraviolet Penis Stroke Sento Motor oil Ulcer Urinary incontinence Coffee Diving Turner syndrome Epidural Malaria Professional wrestling holds Cephalic disorder Cellulitis Welding Safe sex Drowning Diabetic retinopathy Crohn's disease Herpes simplex virus AIDS Mattress Mouth ulcer Medical analysis of circumcision Disinfection Diseases of the honeybee Cirrhosis Domestic rabbit Blood donation Sterilization (microbiology) Nail (anatomy) Wok Fire extinguisher Clothing Violin Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Human sexual behavior Wart Seismic retrofit
