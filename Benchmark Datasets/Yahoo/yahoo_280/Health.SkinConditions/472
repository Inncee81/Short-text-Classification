picked a beauty mark off i always had a small beauty mark on the corner of my nose a couple of days ago i wasnt looking in the mirror or anything but i was feeling around there and i thought it was a pimple so i tried picking it but it didnt work except i think something happened to it today it felt that there was some sort of dead skin on it or something so i tried picking it and now the beauty mark is gone s theres still a spot where it was but its not brown anymore should i be worried what is this alot of ppl do this by mistake or on purpose and most of the time it just grows back dont worry about it its just a scab and it will be fine i picked a freckle mole off my arm and it grew right back and my friend did the same and hers grew right back too no need to worry Father's Day (Doctor Who) Smallpox Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Skin Kodocha Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Antichrist Superstar Jon Secada Cheetah Unreal Yoko Ono Characters in the Smurfs AFI 100 Years series Wood carving Avenue Q Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Waxing John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Marilyn Monroe H2G2 Joy Electric Ron Weasley I Want to Hold Your Hand The Comedy of Errors Shaggy dog story Tattoo Anti-Mormonism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Cliff Richard RuneScape quests Taxi Driver Haven (TNG episode) New York Giants Blacks and Mormonism Spice Girls St. Elmo's Fire (film) Irish Houses of Parliament Big Brother UK series 6 The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Empty Child Sin City Neanderthal A Day in the Life One Tree Hill (TV series) United Airlines Flight 93 John Frusciante Mystique (comics) Columbine High School massacre Captain Thunderbolt Dead Putting Society Doom enemies Salad Fingers Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mark Calaway Kim Possible: So the Drama Anderson Cooper Scenes from a Memory Kim Possible 1957 World Series K' Ranma __ characters Reading spark plugs for racing Les contes d'Hoffmann The Shining (film) Dead Like Me Goldberg Variations EastEnders Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Billboard Hot 100 Baroque chess Pittsburgh Steelers Battles of Lexington and Concord Therion (band) Housebreaking Blonde on Blonde 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Johnny 5 Identity and change Aerial (dance move) Zhao Yun Van Morrison Elis Prefecture 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Characters of The Sandman Roger John Brownlow Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes Torquato Tasso The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Happy Tree Friends 101 Dalmatians: The Series Sydney Riot of 1879 The Family from One End Street
