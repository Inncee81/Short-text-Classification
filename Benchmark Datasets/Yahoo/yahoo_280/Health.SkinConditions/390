strange rash resembles description of numular excema but no itching help about years ago i developed a head to toe rash literally that resembled chicken pox except there was no itching and i had already gone through chicken pox as a child ever since then i've been prone to periodic bouts of a rash that starts out like a few red bumps almost looks like acne except it isn't the bumps level out spread in diameter and the worst ones look almost like a cigar burn on my skin that can last for several weeks loads of fun let me tell you i've gone all natural or as natural as i can with laundry detergents and household cleaning products i don't do as well with my food as i should and that's one reason for this post if anyone else suffers from a rash that fits this description is there anything you can do to alleviate the symptoms are there certain foods to avoid that can excaberate the condition again it sounds pretty much like numular excema when i read the description but there is never any itching involved when i break out i go to my doctor who prescribes a steroid to rid of the rash etc we haven't been able to really figure out what is causing it she was assuming i had taken a medication i was allergic to but that wasn't the case she suggested to write down exactly what i eat each day and watch for signs of a rash i ate wendy's that day drank a smoothie from sonics ate homemade lasagna that night w mozzarella and ricotta cheeses just to see if i'd break out again i duplicated exactly what i ate that particular day and had no outbreak go figure i still don't know what causes it i've dealt w it for about the same amount of time sometimes it's just a tiny rash other times i wake up in the morning and have a head to toe breakout which is embarrassing when i go to work the steroid prescrip makes it go away pretty fast Acne Allergy Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence Conjunctivitis Lupus erythematosus Urticaria Cheese Scabies Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Smallpox Syphilis Rosacea Rash Insulin Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Ben Johnson (athlete) Crohn's disease Food Diarrhea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Hypoglycemia Mouth ulcer Cellulitis Candidiasis Ron and Fez Hamburger Anabolic steroid Dieting Doxepin Dandruff Menstrual cycle Multiple chemical sensitivity The Shining (film) Prostate cancer Common cold Asthma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Milton H.
