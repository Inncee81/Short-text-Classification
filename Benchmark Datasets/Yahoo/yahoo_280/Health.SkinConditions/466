i have one single raised bump on my lip it's exactly like a big bite because it became swollen and now itches or burns but the placement is so exact that i just can't be sure the bump is on the left side of my top lip exactly where a cold sore would be except it's completely different or at least i think i've never had a cold sore but i know they usually drain and this is just a bump its red and a little uncomfortable could it be that it's a bug bite and lips are really sensitive because it's been two days and the skin is still feels a tiny bit numb and slightly swollen any ideas of what it could be oh and by the way it's not herpes think raised bump thanks a cold sore usually tingles more when it is in the development phase what you are describing sounds more like a routine pimple except on the lipline you would feel some numbness because of the way the lip is wired in for sensation it's also not unusual for pimples on the lipline to cause swelling in the lip in the area it could be a bug bite but most bugs don't really care to get that up close and personal to you and the face is pretty sensitive so it's hard for them to do most biting insects prefer a less sensitive area i'd suggest applying moist heat to the spot use a damp clean washcloth heated in the microwave hot as you can stand as often as you can apply it it will make things look redder and more swollen at first as more blood supply shows up to fight you may also notice slightly more numbness and pain as well with heat if it's a pimple you should notice it begin to form the familiar whitehead in a day or so just keep applying the heat until it drains when that happens the pain numbness and swelling will usually go away pretty quickly in the meantime avoid lipstick and makeup in the area also fight the urge to poke prod or squeeze a pimple in that area can rupture beneath the skin quite easily and infect the inside of the mouth and lip you can also bruise that area a lot easier than other places and it will hurt like you wouldn't believe heat will also soothe it it if becomes obviously a cold sore it may take a day or so more before you can say with certainty which it's going to be if it seems not to be doing the usual pimple formation then you can find medicines that will help with a cold sore and if it's not identifiyable in a couple days then a trip to the doctor might be in order to determine exactly what is going on my money is on it being a pimple in an odd spot they do happen there just not as common as other locations on the face Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Acne Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Herpes simplex virus Oral sex Equine conformation Thermoregulation Mosquito Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection Penis Carpal tunnel syndrome Urinary incontinence Cocaine Poker jargon Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Tattoo Conjunctivitis Radiation therapy Erogenous zone Diabetic retinopathy Bruise Skin Dialysis Sento Body piercing Drill bit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diving Lyme disease Surveillance Aconitum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vacuum tube Lip balm Mattress Welding Pain Malaria Gout Fecal incontinence Glossary of partner dance terms Chronic fatigue syndrome Unreal Professional wrestling slang Fancy rat Stroke Aerial (dance move) Rosacea Violin Intravenous therapy Volleyball Common cold Snake Conspiracy (TNG episode) Social rule Hamster Smallpox Trumpet Massage Menstrual cup Keloid Hay fever Herpes zoster Theory of conduct Cellulitis Goose bumps 2000 Australian Grand Prix AFI 100 Years series Essential oil Loudspeaker Transmission (medicine) Pneumonia Sense Epidural Skateboarding trick Tick Cat Addiction Bong Virus Dairy Humphrey Bogart Dundas Square Boom Town (Doctor Who) Self-harm Domestic rabbit Time Out of Mind Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders
