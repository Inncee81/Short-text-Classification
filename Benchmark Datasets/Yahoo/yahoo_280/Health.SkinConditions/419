peeling off your skin after sunburn ok so i am doing this now but i have a question is there any health concerns with doing this because my skin now is brown and is so dry and it is just irresistable i just have to peel it if i knew it was very unhealthy then i wouldn't well the thing is the skin started it i didn't start it the skin just started peeling itself off and i thought i would help the process i had the sunburn about days ago by now my skin is very brown and i can peel away metres of skin and i don't feel anything so if i don't feel anything and it doesn't hurt then there is no harm also since i am peeling my skin i am thinkin to going to the beach in about days by what time do you guys think i would have some new dead skin can going to the beach and onto the sun again with no dead skin be really bad for the body since there is no protective layer of skin it isn't unhealthy because that skin is already dead you can peel it off but do it slowly so that the not burnt skin doesn't come off too i suggest using alot of moisturizer too to help the new skin it will also heal what you have damaged in the sun Sunburn Skin Psoriasis Sunlight Tattoo Human skin color Acne Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mummy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Fecal incontinence Ultraviolet Aloe Ozone layer Ozone depletion Scar Eczema Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dead Sea Diving suit Theory of conduct Ozone hole Swimming Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bon Jovi Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sperm Whale Piccolo Junior Saga The End of the World (Doctor Who) The Death Gate Cycle Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Characters of Naruto Treehouse of Horror XV Vampire Tai Chi Chuan Time Out of Mind Pain Soul Essential oil Sun Zinc Plame affair Herpes simplex virus Philosophical skepticism Rosacea The Suffering (game) Ex-gay Melanin Tenshinhan Transactional analysis Urinary incontinence Sacrifice (computer game) Tofu Robert Peel Banana Wound Capital accumulation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
