blackhead medication question k well yesterday i went to the doctor for the blackheads on my nose and she prescribed me the benzoyl perozide wash clindamycin phosphate topical lotion and tretinoin cream i really didnt think that my acne was that bad to be prescribed three medications but im not sure what to use first because i have sensitive dry skin i dont want this stuff to make it worse the best thing to do is use the benzoyl peroxide wash in the morning or whenever you take a shower and then apply the topical lotion at bedtime put the cream on if your skin becomes dry use the benzoyl wash every other day you dont have to use this every day you can do every other to keep skin from drying out your acne probably isnt that bad the doctors use this stuff because its like having a mild infection and your body cant fight it of so once you take care of it it wont keep coming back once your skin is really good and clear you should maybe only use the stuff twice a week Psoriasis Benzoyl peroxide Eczema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Rosacea Organic peroxide Scabies Manicure Stomach cancer Medical prescription Skin Tattoo Medicine Shaving Osteoarthritis Clindamycin Dialysis Scar Retinol Urinary incontinence Wart Allergy Group A streptococcal infection Dermatology Wound Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dandruff Doxepin Bleeding Cosmetics Urticaria Conjunctivitis Body piercing Aloe Pneumonia Tocopherol Androgen insensitivity syndrome Moisturizer Common cold Prostate cancer Clomipramine Hydrogen peroxide Jock itch Maprotiline Ethics Radiation therapy Homeopathy Childbirth Fibromyalgia Hay fever Halitosis Acetone peroxide Milton H.
