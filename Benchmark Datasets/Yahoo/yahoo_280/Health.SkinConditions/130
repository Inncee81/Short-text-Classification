is it possible to have a bug bite on my scalp i have this little very little bump on my head that hearts like crazy it seems to be a little bigger than a bug bite but i think it has a little puss like a bug bite would what could this be nits a raised bump and it hurts when i touch it it feels kind of burning could it be a blister it might just be a pimple oil in you hair causes it and because it is on you scalp and that is a sensative place it would hurt more that usual if there is puss coming out i suggest you drain it and then put on some rubbing alcolol or hydrogen peroxide keep your hair clean and dry until it heals up if it continues past days go to a doctor because you may have a cyst or something else it really is no big deal so just keep the area clean and dry and you should be alright Acne Head louse Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Hydrogen peroxide W.I.T.C.H.
