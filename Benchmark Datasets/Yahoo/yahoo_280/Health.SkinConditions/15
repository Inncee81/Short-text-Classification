psoriasis clears then comes back as another form i've read that the most common form of psoriasis is called plaque psoriasis but i came across a article that said when one clears another form can come back in place when another outbreak occurs has this happened to anyone is that the norm is it a longshot or more common i have plaque psoriasis and the only other form of psoriasis that i have gotten is guttate psoriasis which appears as tiny drops like raindrops all over i will get that after i have a strep throat for example so that's something i have to guard against that only happens to a small fraction of people with psoriasis there is also a form of psoriasis called inverse proriasis in the folds of the skin under breasts etc i've never gotten that and am very glad of that however with psoriasis even if someone is lucky enough to have found a treatment which lets them have clear skin for a time when it returns it's usually in the same form in the same places mine always start and return in the same places on my body Psoriasis Dandruff Group A streptococcal infection Zinc Psoriatic arthritis Vitamin D Radiation therapy Turmeric Rash Autoimmune diseases Creosote Urinary incontinence Lupus erythematosus Rheumatic fever Breast cancer Dermatology Cancer Propranolol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mycosis fungoides Psoralen Arthritis Smallpox Puberty Black Death Folic acid Echinacea Diabetic retinopathy Pneumonia Quaternion Alzheimer's disease Uranium Rainbow Eczema Scar Acne Metastasis Ultraviolet Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hay fever Callus Cephalic disorder Professional wrestling throws Prostate cancer The Dalek Invasion of Earth Scabies Immune system Harlequin type ichthyosis Rain Cloud Mesothelioma Breath of Fire III Breast Rugby union Erysipelas Lichen planus Omega-3 fatty acid P-adic number Malignant melanoma Syphilis H5N1 Division (mathematics) Genital wart Sword making Rais massacre Poker jargon Teen Girl Squad Transmission (medicine) Sexual fetishism Bermuda Triangle Herpes simplex virus Logarithm Henry IV of England Nail disease Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Naval mine Ebola Brassiere Carburetor Second Battle of the Atlantic AIDS Place of articulation Ninja Scroll Aerial (dance move) Dead Sea Crocodilia Genentech Vector (spatial) Social aspects of clothing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intravenous therapy Norm (mathematics) Trigonometric function Stomach cancer Photodynamic therapy Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cytomegalovirus Cell (biology) Compiler optimization
