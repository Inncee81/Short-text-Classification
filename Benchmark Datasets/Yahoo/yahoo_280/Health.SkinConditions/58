cold sores i've had cold sores before but not recently and i got one yesterday i put abreva on it and overnight it just got worse i've never even kissed a guy so did i just get it from someone i know my mom does used to get them so could i have gotten it from her a while ago it is caused by a virus you might have even been born with the virus it is very possible i was i got my very first cold sore within hours after i was born my mother suffered from the virus as well my daughter also gets them no one kissed her when they had one thats just silly but thankfully as i got older the frequency of outbreaks got fewer further in between we started to use abreva for the last few sores we have all had but we used to always use carmex if abreva seemed to make it worse it was because the sore was still in the spreading stage but honestly any over the counter cold sore medication works about the same for me my family carmex is so much cheaper i never noticed a real difference between that the waayyy over priced abreva stress also can be a factor in cold sore outbreaks Herpes simplex virus Common cold Influenza Virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Antiviral drug Spanish flu H5N1 Mouth ulcer Syphilis Marburg virus Chronic fatigue syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Poliomyelitis Avian influenza Stomach cancer Norwalk virus group Psoriasis Pharyngitis Computer virus AIDS reappraisal Ebola Infectious mononucleosis AIDS Breastfeeding Rabies Progress of the SARS outbreak Radiation therapy Mattress Hepatitis C Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gypsy moth Acne Chernobyl accident Multiple sclerosis Hip fracture AIDS conspiracy theories Black Death Diseases of the honeybee T'Pol Oral sex Pandemic Pneumonia Code: Lyoko Foodborne illness Smallpox Shrimp farm Bodyline Urinary incontinence Antibody Dengue fever Mosquito Divorce Asthma Broadband Internet access Coeliac disease Chancroid Page replacement algorithms Phase-locked loop Bodybuilding Childbirth Asian financial crisis Oh My Goddess!
