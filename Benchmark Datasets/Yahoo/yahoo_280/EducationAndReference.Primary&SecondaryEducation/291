school rules do not limit the students' freedom how far do u agree with this it's for my debate grand finals all opinions are welcome the nature of rules is to limit people's behaviour what you have to ask is not whether they limit students but whether those limits are justified for example if a school has a rule prohibiting hate speech this does limit students' freedom to freely insult and degrade each other but this is a good thing people's rights overlap so it's not logically possible for everyone to have total freedom in exercising my right to express myself all the time i impinge on your right to have a quiet library to work in so at the same time as limiting one person's freedom you are protecting another person's freedom put a spin on it depending on whether you're for or against if you're for say that they limit and that it's good or that it's bad if you're against say that they don't limit they protect Hate speech First Amendment to the United States Constitution Theory of conduct Civil rights Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Separation of church and state European Convention on Human Rights Democracy Separation of church and state in the United States Freedom of the press Copyright French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Libertarianism Right Liberalism Human rights Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 4 Lincoln-Douglas Debate Debate Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Theodicy Consensual crime Capitalism Stoicism School of Salamanca Copyleft Restoring the Lost Constitution Slander and libel Criticism of libertarianism Freedom of religion Scientology beliefs and practices Lawrence v.
