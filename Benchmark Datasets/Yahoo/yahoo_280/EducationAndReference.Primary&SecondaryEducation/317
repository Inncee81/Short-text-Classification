question about being and in the th grade well basically i'm and i've had hip surgeries i was homeschooled for years and i didn't do that well now i'm and in the th grade i lost my grandpa so i'm also suffering with that i'm going to be in the same grade as my brother and i'm gonna be around a bunch of year olds not with growing up i don't think this is gonna go so well and how am i going to deal with the teachers am i going to be ridiculed listen you are going to be fine you have been through a lot and you're still kickin' take a deep breath and think about what you want to get out of th grade well of course you want to get caught up academically and that may go better than you imagine hey brain biology is on your side i'm serious as you get each year older your brain is better able to handle the whole learning studying thing even if you haven't been in regular school so give that a chance next even though at you are a little older th grade is full of kids who are and not just you birthdays falling during the summer mean that some kids start kindergarten a year later than others so they will be older than i hope that as a family you guys have talked about this your brother should be thinking about ways he can make things easier for you like not advertising your personal business and by acting cool with the whole situation now hear this i am so sorry for your loss many of us have lost our grandparents and it stinks but think of your grandpa as watching over you now when you are in a pinch or feeling nervous think stick with me here grandpa and help me do this that's ok that's part of how you can honor his memory your teachers should not have any problems about your situation they should only be thinking about helping you learn and i think that's what you will see be a good listener show respect and you will win them over remember that your school has a counselor who you can talk to if you get to feeling overwhelmed but i think anyone who has stood as much as you have can take on th grade chin up stand tall and i know you will do fine Hey Arnold!
