what to do to keep my son interested in school my son will be repeating the same class in pre school this year he is four and a half he was moved up last fall my husband and i had him tested into a private school right near our home to start kindergarten he passed and they said he will be reading by his fifth birthday which is in january now i came across one problem i just found out that the school is not accredited so he may have to repeat kindergarten at public school if he attends the new school this year most schools around here are strict on the age children should start kindergarten we live in southern california i am stuck what should i do my son is getting into trouble at school because he is bored and already knows what is being taught can someone help me figure out what to do this is very important to me thanks as a teacher i hear questions like yours often my recommendation is to address the public school to ask for testing for learning differences you may have a learner who is classified as gifted this will allow you to help determine when and where he attends and the attendance will count towards the kindergarten requirement under the no child left behind legislation the public school is required to analyze each case individually regardless if you opt for the testing typically non accredited institutions will suffice as long as the child can demonstrate mastery of the required skills for entering the next grade level hope this helps Education in the United States Kindergarten Education in Australia No Child Left Behind Act Education in Germany Education in Romania Graduate school Gifted Education in Japan Education GED Education in Canada Second language acquisition High school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Law school Public education Education in Taiwan Charter school Scientology beliefs and practices Juris Doctor Equal Protection Clause Secondary education in Japan Culture of the United States Affirmative action Education in Malaysia Intelligent design movement Waldorf Education Dyslexia Education in Scotland National Certificate of Educational Achievement Martial art Physician Librarian SAT Education reform Education in India Bilingual education Primary education Secondary education in France Tripartite System Alexander Technique Glen Ridge, New Jersey Education in Austria Education in England Experiential education Education in Portugal Amateur radio A Course In Miracles Caulfield Grammar School Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Qu__bec Teacher Supreme Court of the United States College Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Intelligence quotient Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Medical school School choice Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Fair use Driver's license Social Security (United States) The Hidden Curriculum Miami-Dade County Public Schools Classified information Secondary education in the United States Military academy French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Boston Public Education in Sweden Baseball Brown v.
