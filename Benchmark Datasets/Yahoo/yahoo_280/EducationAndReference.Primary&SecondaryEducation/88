suspention from school i saw on the news that a kid had been suspended from school for a minor infraction honestly i do not remember what he did but it was trivial i think taking a child or making a child stay home from school is wrong i believe there are other alternatives such as putting them in a detention class during that time this class would be one that would make them read or study during this time and insist that they produce a paper on what they did why they did it and what they think would have prevented it suspending a kid from school is only asking for them to get into more trouble do you agree with me i agree children should not be suspended from school since there are no parents or adults home with the child these days they just look at it as a vacation not a punishment put them in school give them extra work to do have them do a report at least someone will be watching them not just letting them sleep all day 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Boston Public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart Recurring South Park characters Theory of conduct Pledge of Allegiance Punishment John the Baptist Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Homeschooling Detention Capital punishment The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Teachers (film) The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Catcher in the Rye Malcolm in the Middle Education in the People's Republic of China E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
