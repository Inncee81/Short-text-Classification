gcse hints my son will be sitting his gcses in june so this is a busy year for him has anyone out there got any tips for him in terms of revision and work as well as how to relax properly thanks as far as revision goes make sure that you know for sure that he is revising he should start revision around months before his exams starting at minutes a night it might seem like a long time before to start but i speak from experience when i say leaving it until the night before doesnt get you anywhere increase the time he spends revising as exams get closer bear in mind that he will need breaks as its shown that people lose focus and cannot work to their full ability after around an hour of constant revising encourage him to revise more frequently for those subjects he finds hardest but make sure he is still revising for the rest its also a good idea to draw up a revision timetable stating what subjects he should be revising for each day and for how long to help him relax try not to pressure him into revising all of the time he'll want time to go out and do things as well also dont constantly remind him of exams and how important they are he will know that already tell him that youll be proud of him whatever his results are as long as he does his best that means dont go telling him that you expect him to do come out with all a s good methods of revising include making flash cards questions on the front answers on the back of a card drawing up posters and sticking them around a room where he can see them all of the time sticking up motivation pictures quotes anything that will encourage him to do well going through notes written in class picking out key information writing this up and then continue condensing asking him questions from his work books Test (student assessment) Extreme Programming SAT Past teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon GED Education in Germany Consensus decision-making Milton H.
