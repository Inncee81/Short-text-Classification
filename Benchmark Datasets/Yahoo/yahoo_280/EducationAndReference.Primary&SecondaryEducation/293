making friends in high school hi so i finished my freshman year of high shool and i had a question for you all in my freshman year i had a really hard time making friends i stil do i personally dont think i do anything wrong to keep people away from me i'm laid back and very respectful towards everyone the problem is is that so many of my peers do drugs or drink or have 'it ' however as corny as it might sound i live above the influence i have never and never plan to do drugs or the stupid stuff my peers do but living above the influence comes with its hardships i often have to eat lunch alone i can't go to dances who would want to go with a 'loser ' according to them and i spend my weekends alone with no one to talk to but my parents and my dog well playing with the dog talking would be rather difficult wouldn't it the big question where do i go from here thank you to all contributors for any given advice i respect the above the influence thing its very understandable all id say is look for people you get along with and look past their decisions who cares if you dont have anyone to go to a dance with go by yourself at least you had the nerve to show up there are plenty of people out there like you you just have to dig for a common interest if you lived in my town youd have a friend right here dont give up just be yourself lol Social rule Hearing impairment Theory of conduct Garfield Can't Hardly Wait Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shit RuneScape quests Stomach cancer Philip J.
