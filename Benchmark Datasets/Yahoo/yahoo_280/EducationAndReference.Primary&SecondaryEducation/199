teachers what books should every sixth grader nationwide must read my son is entering middle school and i would like to get a jump start on any books that he needs to read or may have book reports on any other additional tips you can offer would greatly be appreciated if certain things only pertain to what area you live in then i can tell you that i live in the new york area instead of him reading the books that he will have to read in the future i suggest taking him to the library and letting him choose whatever books he wants to read now he'll have to read the other books later anyway at this age it's important that he develops a love of reading and learning not just getting things done he will be more enriched if he reads more than what he has to have him join a youth reading club at a local library he will meet others his age who love to read too Education in the People's Republic of China A Course In Miracles Homeschooling Jean-Luc Picard Hopkins School The Giver Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Graduate school Socrates Emanuel Swedenborg Librarian Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Dog agility Stuyvesant High School Education in Romania Education in Hong Kong Springfield Elementary School On the Road Lindy Hop J.
