tomorrow ia my college's first day actually college has already started y'day i e the st of aug so i dnt know whether iam scared or nervous or normal i dont want to express in front of my family coz they r really happy that finally i got admission in a reputed college plus i have got many friends over there so socialising wont be a problem i guess but i wont meet anyone familiar i think when i enter the coll and yeah the college's campus is realllllyyyy huge ragging is not an issue for me coz i know how to tacke that but the main problem is how to stay cool and calm on the first day when college has already started days before wow you brag quite a bit when you're happy you don't need to see anyone familiar when you enter because everyone just sticks to their own business you'll also meet new people in your classes just try to talk and make friends from different groups The Ashlee Simpson Show She Loves You Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Singlish The Emancipation of Mimi Blonde on Blonde Religious Society of Friends W.I.T.C.H.
