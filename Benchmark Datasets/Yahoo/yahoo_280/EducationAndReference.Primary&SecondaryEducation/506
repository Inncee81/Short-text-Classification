teachers beating students i live in dubai i study in a cbse school i can't mention the school's name the teachers supervisor and also the principal physically punish students here it is very common and done by many of the teachers usually they slap us or whack us on the head but sometimes they take it too far once the media was involved after a teacher kicked a student in the stomach so the principal stated that this was the first he is hearing such a thing he lied he later told us in assembly that we force them to beat us if we complain about the teachers then the principal firstly wont do anything and the teacher develops a grudge against you the thing is they hit us even for small things like if we forget to wear our belt or tie we don't have detention here the teachers usually get rough when the student doesn't complete his homework i don't want to go to the police because i haven't taken any hard hit recently any ideas to stop this we can't hit back or else we will be expelled changing school won't help they are mostly like this if i approach the media then i'll be turning the entire school staff against me and might get suspended to that's the major disadvantage of complaining physical punishment is not leagal here this should not be allowed i as a teacher in the u s can see a place for corporal punishment but there are limits and strict protocols and never can a student be hit or kicked never let me suggest this your best weapon is documentation begin compiling lists of these offenses be sure to record dates places time of day and the names of those involved be sure to get witnesses after you have a thorough list get it notarized speak with your parents about this and ask their advice if you need to go further find an attorney present them with the list and ask their advice depending upon what they say you can then go to the police or something like a public prosecutor's office in with your notarized list this is who needs to help you two important things you need to know first this will cause a large public scene be ready for this second be sure to have all of the documentation in order and be sure that everyone is willing to speak up in public about these abuses i don't believe there will be a quiet way of dealing with this very best of luck Columbine High School massacre Bristol Grammar School Domestic violence Plame affair Boston Public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Hogwarts Royal Assent Treehouse of Horror V Theory of conduct Spanking Recurring South Park characters Calvin and Hobbes Martial art Corporal punishment Schapelle Corby Attorney at Law Kodocha Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters EastEnders Charter school Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Unlawful combatant Aikido Piccolo Junior Saga Plame affair timeline Condon Committee Great Teacher Onizuka GED Guantanamo Bay Volkert van der Graaf Jean Charles de Menezes Education in Romania Criminal justice system of Japan Capoeira Education in the United States Ben Johnson (athlete) The Inside Negima Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Punishment Capital punishment The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Little Britain Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Education in the People's Republic of China The Star Wars Holiday Special Hearsay Unidentified flying object Beavis and Butt-head Status of religious freedom in Sudan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dilbert Roswell UFO incident Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Surveillance Education French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tennessee State Constitution Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Ty Cobb Knots Landing Education in Hong Kong Law & Order Avenue Q Alcoholics Anonymous Teachers (film) Camp Delta James Dobson Downing Street memo Code: Lyoko Social rule Sandy Koufax Age of consent Vivian Solon A Course In Miracles Sin City Jam (TV series) Probation officer Unreal Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Barrister Prime Minister of the United Kingdom One Tree Hill (TV series)
