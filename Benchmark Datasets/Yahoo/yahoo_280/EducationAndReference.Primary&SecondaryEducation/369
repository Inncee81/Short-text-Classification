attention kindergarten teachers what should my child know i have a little girl starting kindgergarten and i have no idea what she should know i've had everyone tell me that kindergarten's not like when you were a kid and kindergarten is the new st grade she'll be going to a highly rated school with high academic expectations i've tried looking on the school's website but there's nothing specific she knows her address still working on learning her phone number but then again i have trouble remembering my phone number she can write her name still has trouble with some letters she can count to by s counts to about unassisted working on counting backward from to she knows most of her letter sounds and we've been practicing reading beginner books every day we've been working with learning money values a dime is worth pennies etc she knows the days of the week but then i see kids her age who are rattling off stuff like the dinosaurs lived million years ago this one is a pleiosaurus she has some pre k and k workbooks i've stayed at home with her she's never been in daycare or preschool and they have things like maps of the us and skeletons with the bones labeled is this stuff i should be working with her on back in my day you needed to know your alphabet and colors i don't want her to be at a disadvantage your child will be fine a student will usually succeed in kindergarten if she knows the names sounds and can form most of her letters they will learn all of this in kindergarten but there is a huge difference in the children who can do some all ready and those who can do none it sounds like your daughter is on the right track counting is also important it's great that she can count to thirty and backwards from i don't think she will need to know all that much about money perhaps just identifying the coins and how much each one is worth that is a good place for her to start if they learn more than that in kindergarten she will have a good basis and be able to pick up on it more easily than a child who doesn't know anything about coins the only other things i think she needs to be able to do before being absolutely ready for kindergarten are social behaviors if she has not been in any kind of prek program this may be tricky for you to figure out but she needs to be able to interact with other kids follow directions sit still pay attention keep on task for about minutes maybe more and be able to separate from you and be comfortable in her new environment if she can do that she is going to be just fine it seems like you really care about how successful she is and have been working a lot with her don't worry about those kids who can spit out all kinds of facts about dinosaurs and the solar system they are typically boys and really interested in those topics so they have lots of books toys games etc about them and memorize all of that information it has no correlation to whether or not they are ready for kindergarten Kindergarten Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Education Avenue Q Microeconomics Education in Germany Education in Taiwan Second language acquisition Social rule Education in Hong Kong Homeschooling Dog training Dyslexia Extreme Programming Fischer Random Chess A Course In Miracles Grade (education) Computer JumpStart Asperger syndrome Aerial (dance move) Mnemonic Password Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Saved by the Bell Education in Australia CPU cache Theory of conduct Hikikomori Economics Entropy Surveillance Recess (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Objective-C Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cognitive science Contract bridge Infantilism Milton H.
