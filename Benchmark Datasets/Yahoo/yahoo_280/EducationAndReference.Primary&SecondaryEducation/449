i'm going into middle school help please have any advice about the beginning of middle im freaking out about making new friends since i mite transfer different schools fights i get really scared when i see fights cliques being made fun of not being liked getting beat up and scared of theft help me plz i dont wanna worry forever take a deep breath middle school will be fine almost everyone freaks out about middle school right before they start it and when they get to middle school they realize that there was really nothing to freak out about let's go quickly through your list of fears you mentioned transfering to a new school with middle school everyone is starting out at a new school the kids they spent their entire elementary school career with may or may not be at the middle school that they are going to think of it as an opportunity to make new friends talk to kids on the school bus or on the walk to school talk to kids in the hallway who you may have seen in class hey don't we have math together or whatever join a club or a sport team to make new friends there are so many ways to make new friends the great thing about middle school is that there are so many different types of people there that everyone fits in somewhere and once you find the place where you fit you will see that making friends is no big deal as for a new school try and go to an orientation at the new school if they do not have a formal orientation have your parents set up a campus tour visit the campus take a look inside the classrooms find out where the lockers are if they have them and that sort of thing get a map of the school and once you find out your classes circle where your classes are on the map if you have a chance to get a glimpse of the campus and meet the teachers before school starts you will find it much easier to be on such an unfamiliar campus one of the other concerns that you mentioned is fights unfortunately school violence is something that you can't escape from the simple rule when you see a fight break out is to tell a staff member teacher or otherwise immediately if one isn't already on scene and then walk in the other direction don't be an on looker and hang out to see who wins don't take sides or try and get involved if it doesn't involve you simply walk away most of the time the people fighting on a school campus especially in middle school have a beef to pick with each other if you are not the one that they are picking the beef with then stay out of it being made fun of happens to everyone whether it's your hair color your size whether or not you wear glasses or whatever else everyone gets picked on sooner or later the important thing to remember is to just be yourself and don't try and be someone you are not the same goes for fitting in with cliques if you try to pretend to be someone you are not everyone will think you are phony and no one will want anything to do with you at all and then they really will pick on you just be yourself and make friends with the people who like the real you as for everyone else don't worry about them there's no law that says you have to get along with everyone in middle school as for getting beat up don't start fights and stay out of the middle of fights that don't involve you if you do that oh and watch your mouth don't run potty mouth by calling people names cussing a lot and that sort of thing then you will not get beat up for the most part people in middle school only beat up people for a specific reason not just random poundings finally with the theft thing if you have a locker use it and don't give out your combination to anyone not even your best friend by yourself a master lock combination lock if the school doesn't provide one and make sure that you keep the combination written down in a safe place in case you forget what it is even if you keep your locker locked at all times don't keep money cell phone ipod palm or other expensive items in your locker instead keep these items in your backpack don't ever let your backpack out of your sight even for a moment and try not to take items to school that you don't need at school relax everything is going to be fine middle school is a whole new adventure compared to elementary school but it's certainly not the end of the world Columbine High School massacre Social rule The Inside The Amazing Race Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Saved by the Bell Professional wrestling match types RuneScape quests Great Teacher Onizuka Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Avenue Q Jon Secada Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Ed, Edd n Eddy One Tree Hill (TV series) Surveillance Aerial (dance move) Code: Lyoko Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegeta Ocean's Twelve Tag RuneScape Syphon Filter About a Boy Tai Chi Chuan The Catcher in the Rye Futurama (TV series -
