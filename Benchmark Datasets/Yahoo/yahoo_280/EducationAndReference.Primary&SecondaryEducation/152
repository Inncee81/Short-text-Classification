parents of middle school and high school students in what ways do you keep involved in your childs activities at school and do teachers still want parent volunteers to come and help out i guess the first is obvious but pay attention to their homework especially younger ones and contact the teachers every now and again especially attend parent teacher conferences you should also attend extra curricular activities your child is involved in it is so sad to see a one or two kids at senior night standing alone when everyone else has parents they may say you don't have to come and watch them play but you really do they may not even talk to you at all but they know you are there there is not as much in class volunteering at this level unless you have a particularly special skill or knowledge that fits into a particular curriculum and you can be a guest speaker however there is often still a need for an occasional chaperon make sure your kid is ok with that before volunteering however there are other places to volunteer at this level if your kid is active in sports check for a sports booster club if he or she is a musician check for a music booster club if he or she is involved in other things acting forensics etc call the sponsor and ask what parental support he she could use often those other activities are overlooked Education in the United States Homeschooling Education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology No Child Left Behind Act Lincoln-Douglas Debate Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Australia Education in Japan Caulfield Grammar School Scholarship Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Education in Taiwan Experiential education Education in England Culture of the United States Secondary education in Japan Boy Scouts of America Secondary education in France School choice Miami-Dade County Public Schools High school Education in Portugal Physical education Prom Education reform Whose Line Is It Anyway?
