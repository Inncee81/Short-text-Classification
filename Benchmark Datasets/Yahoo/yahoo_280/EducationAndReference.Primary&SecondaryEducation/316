does my ucla summer class grade go to my high school or college credit i'm taking pre cal and english class in ucla sumemr class english class grading scale is pass no pass but mypre cal grade is letter grade but the problem is i have a b right now and it's too late to change i'm aiming for engineering schoo so a b in math would really hurt me if it goes to my high school credit and it would be worse if it becomes a college credit and i'm taking pre cal to skip pre cal in my school so if the counselor asks me if i took pre cal over summer i would have to say yes and show her the transcript but i dont want a b in math in my record i'm sure ucla grade doesn't automatically go to my school but would the transcript say my letter grade if you are a high school student and you want the credit it goes on your hs transcript if you are not happy with a b take it again this fall semester your hs Grade (education) Education in Romania University of Southern California Education in the United States Graduate school Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Brown University Advanced Placement Program Kwantlen University College Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Taiwan Hunter College High School Grade inflation Secondary education in the United States SAT University of California, Los Angeles Academic term Education in Germany Law school Lynbrook High School National Certificate of Educational Achievement Cal Poly Pomona Worcester Polytechnic Institute Stuyvesant High School Affirmative action Yale Law School Swahili language North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Grove City College Theodore Kaczynski Medical school Education in the People's Republic of China California State University, Los Angeles Ontario Academic Credit Jaime Escalante New York State Department of Education Bowl Championship Series Education in South Korea Junior Certificate Saved by the Bell FoxTrot New Trier High School Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Pitaten College Houston Independent School District GED Miami-Dade County Public Schools Education in Malaysia Education in Singapore Education in Portugal Baccalaur__at Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science Beatmania IIDX Boston Public E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
