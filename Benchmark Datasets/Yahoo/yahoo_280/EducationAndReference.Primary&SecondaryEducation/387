deciding which high school i want to go to hey guys i'm in the th grade right now and i'm having a hard time deciding which school i want to go to i live in michigan i don't know if that's important or not but whatever the schools are novi high and northville high i want to go to a school where i know several people at northville my cousins go there but they are a year older than me or something like that there is a girl that's going to novi that i know but i don't really like her she's a girl who goes to my school right now my mom wants me to go to novi because she said that the bus could pick me up i live in novi but the northville bus comes by my house every day my cousin who goes there told me that my mom said that i could probably go to either one and that my brother could drop me off at northville because he can drive but he's three years older than me and when i'm in the th grade he'll be going to college sp and he might not be able to take me so where do you guys think i should go i say convince your mom to apply for northville tell her that your cousins go there and you'll be much closer to them the northville bus drives in your area right convince your mom again about the bus driving in your are to pick you up for school another good reason huh after your brother goes off to college you can still use the bus or have you mom drop you of at northville no worry there how's this sound The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kyle Broflovski Hey Arnold!
