so i start high school on the th and i've been home schooled since first grade and i don't really know anyone who is going to the school i am then ontop of that it's a freshmen academy so it's not at the real high school the only person i know going there is my ex girlfriend so yeah what do i do when i get there like during lunch do i just sit at my own table and wait for some kids to invite me to theres or what your best bet is to find the people you think you'd fit with i know it sounds weird but if you're wearing a floyd shirt and there's someone else with one go up to them and just say hey i'm new here mind if i sit with you it sounds like it might be tough but hey if someone actually says no to you there's plenty of other people there good luck Can't Hardly Wait Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hey Arnold!
