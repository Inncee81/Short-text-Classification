how do i get put into an advanced math class i take extra math tution outside of school i'm pretty good at it and i've learnt all the things i'm going to be learning in grade a few people in my grade are in an advanced math class i asked them how to get into one everyone agrees that i should go to algebra i and they said that their parents spoke to the teacher i'm not really best friends with my parents so i'm kinda confused as to how i should go about doing this it's just my opinion but i aced th grade math and i saw my friend's math book and i already knew it i think that it's a waste of my time to relearn things that i'm good at so how do i persuade my parents that i am good enough in math to go to the advanced math class and how do i go about speaking to the teacher about it i was in algebra i in seventh grade too i'm not sure how your school works but i was automatically placed in an advanced math class based on the state test scores i received i know people who had parents talk to the school though you can also talk to your math teacher and if she agrees she'll move you up Education in Romania Education in the United States Grade (education) No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public Education in Taiwan Stuyvesant High School SAT Jaime Escalante Great Teacher Onizuka Education Hunter College High School Education in South Korea Education in the People's Republic of China GED Murdock-Portal Elementary School Education in Hong Kong Lynbrook High School Secondary education in the United States Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Advanced Placement Program Dyslexia Kindergarten Pitaten Hogwarts subjects Friends Kodocha Education in Germany Charter school Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban New York State Department of Education Homeschooling Glen Ridge, New Jersey Graduate school Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy FoxTrot Primary education College admissions Swami Vivekananda Merchant Taylors' School A-level Theodore Kaczynski Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Teachers (film) Hogwarts Humphrey Bogart Mathematics education New Trier High School Waldorf Education New math Junior Certificate Bristol Grammar School Azumanga Daioh Education in Austria Learning disability Code: Lyoko Down syndrome Columbine High School massacre Socrates Education in Australia Graduate Record Examination Memorial High School (Hedwig Village, Texas) Multilingual Noam Chomsky Teen Girl Squad Algebraic geometry Al-Khwarizmi Teacher's Pet (Disney) Williston Northampton School The Catcher in the Rye Creation and evolution in public education Chess terminology Computer vision E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
