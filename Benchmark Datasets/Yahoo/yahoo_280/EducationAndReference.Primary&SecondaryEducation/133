how can i stay focused and motivated in high school i'm from canada so grade is the first year of high school i'm entering in september and i'm really excited however all throughout junior high it's like middle school but grades i would be really excited and pumped up for the beginning of the year but then lose all my focus and barely squeak by i'm a terrible procrastinator and i need some help so that it doesn't happen in high school where grades actually matter i'm gifted and i know that i could get really good grades if i only knew how to apply myself you procrasitnate well so do a lot of people in highschool specially the ones that get a's i procrastinate and i havent found a way to stop like now i've got two weeks and i have to finish a packet and i havent started but what i try to do is work with my procrastination i know i'm going to procrastinate so i just have a good time before i give my self a day to do my work but i make myself sit down focus and work i got close to learning my lesson but the due date was extended so dont worry since your not going to do it any just make sure you do it and get it in the teachers dont care when you started doing it just as long as its in to get good grades apply your self and not slip by you should surround yourself with people who will help you and when you have questions to just go ahead and ask and to help you get your hw done maybe even go to tutoring where you can finish right there and there and also get help if you need it you should also do a sport it creates a rhythem for you you'll learn alot from that sport and get dicipling which is liikely to help you in your ways of getting work done also you should keep busy get involved if you got involved so much to where you had something to do every hour it wouldn't give you time to procrastinate the busiest people manage their time better you'll know where each time is spent so your mor aware of whats going on and it may even get rid of your procrastination and you should also have a goal and not just go through your sophmore year make a goal to get a's or to get a through your whole year your gifted so you can do it challenge yourself get into ap honors gate dont take regular classes and waste your time and even though this makes it seem like you've got no time make sure you leave some to have fun dont over crowed yourself to where you are stressing sooo much and enjoy your years have a good time and get good experiences good luck and have fun Procrastination Graduate school Social rule Education in the United States Education in Romania Education in the People's Republic of China The Apprentice 2 Coin collecting High school Alexander Technique Education Extreme Programming Grade (education) New York Giants Pitaten Propaedeutic value of Esperanto No Child Left Behind Act Jumpstart 3rd Grade 2000 Australian Grand Prix Japanese tea ceremony Ben Johnson (athlete) Milton H.
