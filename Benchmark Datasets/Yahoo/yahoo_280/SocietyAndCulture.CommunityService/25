how do you get work in a hospice i'm interested in working in a hospice as i think it'd be real interesting working with people at the end of thier lives but i'm unsure about what jobs exist there and what qualifications you'd need i'm already a community worker with disabled youth due to my job i've been to many hospices from what i can tell the lowest training you can have there is cna certification the rest of the staff are rn's social workers etc there are exceptions of course such as the cooks receptionists etc i find those places very interesting as well because our society tends to just forget about death like it's never going to happen to us you might enjoy a book called the tibetan book of living and dying by sogyal rinpoche it goes into detail about this stuff ok i'm going off on a tangent here lol best of luck Palliative care King City, Ontario Unemployment Division of labour Tibetan Buddhism Social work Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Paralegal Education in the People's Republic of China Apprenticeship Law of the People's Republic of China Dead Like Me Nurse Tibetan people Anarchism and society Fight Club Graduate school Cultural Revolution Indian caste system Karmapa controversy Exploitation Employment Dzogchen Freeters Education in Australia Social Security (United States) Vivian Solon Miyamoto Musashi Ch__gyam Trungpa The Revolutions of 1848 in France Retirement Mother Teresa Labor theory of value Lucid dreaming New Kadampa Tradition Wage slavery Education in Portugal Copyright law of the United Kingdom Terri Schiavo Involuntary commitment Chaplain Peter Kropotkin Trigonometric function Professor Pitaten Buddhism in the United States Mo Mowlam Dilgo Khyentse Economic inequality Trade union College Buddhism Tara (Buddhism) Education in Germany Tourism Domestic worker Science fiction Shambhala Nursing Workers' compensation Human sexual behavior Peter Cook Amateur radio Lewis Carroll Qiang Mipham Jamyang Gyatso Karl Marx Social Credit Outsourcing Working class Bah__'__ Faith and Education Minimum wage Ages of Myst Employment in Hong Kong H-1B visa Hikikomori Lhoba Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Survivor (novel) 401(k) Anti-intellectualism Pharmacist Reincarnation Bureaucracy Ramla Labour economics Democratic Kampuchea Independent Living Chuck Palahniuk Mental Health Act 1983 Criticisms of socialism General practitioner London 2012 Olympic bid Social rule Affirmative action Utopia (book) W.
