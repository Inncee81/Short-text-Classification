what are signs of an ingrown toenail i need to kno i think i might have one but its not red doesnt hurt that bad only a little probably cause i just cut my toe but i guess ill find out tomorrow if it hurts even worse man if you have one you will know shortly it will just get worse this should be a test to see if you have one pour some hydrogen peroxide on it if the pain feels like just a cut and it doesn't bother you when you walk on it that's just a cut probably but if you feel something digging at you it is you probably won't be able to clean it if it's deep if you just ripped the nail to close to the quick and the side hurts bleeds it will probably grow into one if you see pus coming out of the side it's an infected ingrown which needs relatively quick attention you can remove them yourself but you can't get all of it ever you can just reileve the pain until it grows back i have had ingrown toenail surgery times both great toes what my doc did was use a local anesthetic injection lidocaine then he went in and cut the skin about a whole '' back from where i thought the toe nail ended and cut and removed the nail i was only removing just a little more than what i could see which left that '' to still make the problem come back the he used a chemical to kill the matrix the part where the nail grows to the side and up now it only grows up which is awesome it healed nicely and quickly because i did exactly what the doc said for recovery and never had the problem with the same toe again that guy was right about the md go to a podiatrist the doc will give you a coulpe of prescriptions and exam it and charge you more than for that great little procedure i just described above then send you out to have it done it's be like paying twice for it haha i love the medical sys Nail disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Callus Hydrogen peroxide Wound Acne Cocaine Malignant melanoma Epidural Local anesthesia Manicure Methamphetamine Anesthesia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Medicine Brachial plexus Tenshinhan Characters in the Smurfs High-heeled shoe Joker (comics) The Shining (film) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pedicure Sterilization (microbiology) Depilation Childbirth The Invisibles Nine Inch Nails Diving Tattoo Mouth ulcer Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Podiatrist Bone fracture Adjustable gastric band 1957 World Series Endometriosis Massage Tuberculosis Psoriasis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Autopsy Dialysis Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Piccolo Junior Saga First aid Theory of conduct LASIK Characters of Naruto Intravenous therapy Milton H.
