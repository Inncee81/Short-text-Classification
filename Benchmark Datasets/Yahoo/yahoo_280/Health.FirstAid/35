should i get stitches when i was swimming with my freind a few months ago he accidently hit me in the face with a flipper it bleed and didn't stop for like days it was a gash and know it doesn't bleed but it is still there and it is not closed a scab didn't form over it or anything it is just there and it isn't closing it doesn't hurt but i am afraid it will get infected what do you think it's a few months too late for stitches don't waste you time or the hospitals time by going to an er if it doesn't hurt there is no drainage or swelling along with reddness it is probably healing slow but you can't see the new growth of skin just in case i'd be putting on neosporin and bandaids watch the signs i mentioned above signs of infection and give it some time the only caveat to this is if your a diabetic or immune supressed you'd know what it was if you were go to a doctor if any of those Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Smallpox Childbirth Traumatic brain injury Wound Psoriasis Group A streptococcal infection Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Bleeding Cellulitis Diving Herpes simplex virus Otitis externa Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders First aid Leon White Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tuberculosis Poker jargon Dialysis Diabetic retinopathy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cephalic disorder Miscarriage Scarification Kim Possible Body piercing Wisdom teeth Crohn's disease Medicine Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Coeliac disease Ulcer Pneumonia Ebola Wound healing phases Cancer Sacrifice (computer game) Yarrow Intravenous therapy Humphrey Bogart Stomach cancer Tenshinhan The Wotch Leukemia Callus Time Out of Mind YuYu Hakusho Theory of conduct Jackass: The Movie Anthrax The X-Files (season 1) Fecal incontinence Plame affair Hip fracture Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Shark Haven (TNG episode) Tattoo Slayers Bon Jovi Acute myelogenous leukemia Joker (comics) Kodocha Gonorrhoea Vitamin C Erysipelas Radiation poisoning Breastfeeding Futurama (TV series - season 5) Eddie Guerrero Pok__mon Live!
