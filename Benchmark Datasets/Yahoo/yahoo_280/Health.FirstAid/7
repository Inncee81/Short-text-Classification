is this a brown recluse spider bite of something else okay tuesday morning around am i took my dog out i was still pretty much asleep and i felt a sensation on my stomach didn't really think much of it thought it was a mosquito or something i noticed when i got up to take a shower later that there was a very raised bump that was hard to the touch and was red all around about the size of a nickle i still thought it was just a bite until today the red area has expanded to about a quarter size and there is a blister in the center around the blister the skin is very hard is this something that i need to seek medical attention for or could it be a different kind of bite that looks like that i appreciate your answers whatever it is it's some kind of bite that your body isn't reacting well to i'd go see a doctor as soon as possible if it isn't a brown recluse bite at least you ruled out something bad better to be safe than sorry Spider Charles Darwin's illness Brown recluse spider Milton H.
