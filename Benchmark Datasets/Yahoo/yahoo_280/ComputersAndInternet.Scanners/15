when u get a dollar off coupon it has a barcode and it tells the computer and scanner to give you dollar s off so cant there be e barcode that will tell the computer to give you like dollars off so you can then just scan it and youll b saving well i want a barcode that can do that is there like abarcode person or can someone find it on the internet as you may know barcode scanners scan the white space between the black lines many people seem to think that it scans the black lines themselves but if u look the white space varies too and that is what is scanned every store uses there own barcodes on coupons that is why coupons are specific for the store you may be able to find something there are sites that give you discounts for doing surveys and such i am not positive but i believe one may be www coupons com surveys only take to minutes usually sometimes stores give you discount coupons if you complete customer satisfaction surveys that are printed on your store receipts but they are completely random so back to your question there is probably not something to trick the barcode scanner into giving you off or anything like that barcodes are not like computer programming you cannot really modify barcodes to make them do a certain output and i maybe mistaken but i believe it is illegal to modify barcodes that is why no one does that in the first place the best way to get discounts is as i said before try the survey sites that give you coupons for different stores give it a try you may just find something you like hope i could clear up this for you Universal Product Code Barcode Computer virus Barcode reader RFID Computer printer Aldi Loyalty program Optical character recognition Statistical survey Sales promotion Anti-virus software Enterprise content management ISBN CueCat Image scanner Bond Phishing Cash register Digital photography Automated identification and data capture Mail Price discrimination Management information system Commodore 64 Geographic information system Algorithm United States Postal Service Domain Name System DVD Halting problem Spyware Windows XP Wal-Mart Magnetic resonance imaging Computer Steam (content delivery) Monetary policy Port scanner Sudoku Charles Ponzi Electronic voting Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer forensics Sinclair ZX81 SETI Password MTR Subroutine Electronic commerce GNU General Public License Machine vision Software testing Computer hardware Canadian postal code Typewriter Business process reengineering Fixed income Scanner (radio) E-mail spam Floppy disk ZX Spectrum Bob and George LIDAR Arbitrage Killian documents PostScript Digital circuit Embedded system Expert system Fischer Random Chess Mobile phone Library (computer science) Rootkit Biometrics Color Gamut Chess terminology MapleStory National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey Kasparov versus The World TRS-80 ZIP Code British national identity card Retailer Nintendo Revolution C programming language Karaoke CPU cache IBM 1130 Gmail MP3 Secure Digital card Positron emission tomography ITunes Music Store End times Personal computer ITunes Octopus card
