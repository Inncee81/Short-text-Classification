harder better faster stronger remix theres quite a few different remixes for this song but im looking for one that i heard a while back im not sure how old it is but its pretty much exactly the same as the original version but theres an added breakdown towards the middle with this really evil sounding synth bass pounding along with the beat and the lyrics are cut out does this sound familiar to anyone and do you know what the remix is called or who made it thanks that sounds like a live mix if it was just an added bass riff then it yeah that makes sense the only one i know that makes sense for that description is the jess crabbe remix found on daft club House music Remix Trance music Music genre Sampling (music) The Emancipation of Mimi Led Zeppelin Pump It Up Drum and bass Shine On You Crazy Diamond 2Step Whip It Eurythmics Daft Punk Hip hop collaborations New Order Propellerheads The Chemical Brothers Time Out of Mind Honey (Mariah Carey song) Thank God I Found You Girls Aloud Jethro Tull (band) Freestyle music Queen (band) Kraftwerk Unreleased Madonna songs Placebo (band) Disco Hip hop music Nine Inch Nails Skinny Puppy Pet Sounds Missy Elliott Napalm Death Tommy My All Disc jockey The Waterboys Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song) Funk Buck Fever Nu metal Empire Burlesque KMFDM Everything Counts Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me) Raw Power The Fall (band) Anytime You Need a Friend Metalcore We Belong Together Aphex Twin Death metal The Long and Winding Road Bass guitar Emotions (Mariah Carey song) The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Van Halen Crazy in Love Rock (music) Bouncy techno Nirvana (band) Vocoder Tangerine Dream Loverboy (Mariah Carey song) Black Sabbath The Marshall Mathers LP Rush (band) Hole (band) Boards of Canada Grateful Dead Red Hot Chili Peppers Music of Jamaica Bohemian Rhapsody RZA Electronic music Roxette Joy Division (band) Blink-182 There's Got to Be a Way Fear Factory The Art of Noise Velvet Acid Christ The Beatles discography Manic Street Preachers In The Groove (game) Dreamlover Please Please Me Sound effect The Beatles A Day in the Life Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme) Focus (album) Oh Mercy Timbaland Quarashi The Who Through the Rain Def Leppard
