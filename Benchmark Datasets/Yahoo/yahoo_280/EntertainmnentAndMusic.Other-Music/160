who's album are you going to buy kanye's or cents' says he's quit his solo career if kanye outsells him good deal for anyone who can't stand i think it's all hype and is planning to quit already but he needs one more beef to sell an album since their album is dropping the same day what better than to throw beef kanye's way if you download your music free will you finaly buy kanye's album just to finaly get rid of let me know what you think i'm neutral for me personally i like kanye better so its only reasonable to support him i don't understand why likes to start beef and drama with everybody and everything yes selling a lot of records is important but when did it come down to ending your solo career but like you said he was probably already planning to retire anyways and just wanted to get a hype off his album release whatever he's a shallow prick who just wants all the fame and attention he needs to get over himself who knows he probably won't even keep his word its been common for people to supposedly retire and then years later come back with another album other than that i'm supporting kanye Kanye West Jay-Z Billboard Hot 100 Garth Brooks Oasis (band) We Belong Together 50 Cent Britpop The Emancipation of Mimi Spice Girls The Game (rapper) Nas (rapper) Usher (entertainer) Quarashi Canibus Grammy Award The Police Gold Digger ITunes Music Store MC Hammer TLC Roxette Hollaback Girl Pop punk Timeline of alternative rock Delta Goodrem John Mayer (musician) The Isley Brothers No Doubt Guns N' Roses Grammy Awards of 2005 Estelle (singer) Blonde on Blonde Therion (band) Matthew Good Weezer Bee Gees Herbie Hancock Hulk Hogan Genesis (band) Roc-A-Fella Records Common (rapper) Rich Mullins Sandy Koufax Bon Jovi Hilary Duff Hip hop collaborations Kylie Minogue G-Unit Single certification Aimee Mann Sting (musician) Modern Talking Pixies Phil Collins Jon Secada Boyz II Men N.W.A Lindsey Buckingham The Smashing Pumpkins Beastie Boys Peter Gabriel Live 8 Peter Banks Mobb Deep Rod Stewart Eagles Enrique Iglesias Kelly Clarkson The Beatles discography Benzino Toni Braxton Van Morrison Supply and demand Kenny Rogers The Jackson 5 Green Day UK Singles Chart Iggy Pop Yes Jethro Tull (band) Pet Sounds Fantasia Barrino KRS One Overkill (band) Time Out of Mind Eric Clapton Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Eminem Missy Elliott Rush (band) The Velvet Underground Radiohead Megadeth Microeconomics Let It Be George Michael
