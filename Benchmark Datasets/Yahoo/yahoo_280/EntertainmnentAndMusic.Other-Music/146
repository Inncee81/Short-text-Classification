i wanna be in a band when im older how to make it big like fall out boy okay so i'm very musically inclined and i want to be in a band but sadly i'm a girl so i am going to have to be in a band with boyz because i want my band to be listened to be boys and girls well people are telling me it is sooooooo hard to make it big well i wanna be really big like fall out boy but my singing will make your ears bleed i can play piano and i taught my self some rinky dink funny word songs on tha clarinet by only listeing to tha tones and soon i am getting into a guitar and or e guitar lessons woo but when i am older i want to be really good any ideas on how to get big and get recognized and do you know of any good music colleges i know i'm only and have my whole life ahead of me but i know this is what im meant to do and yes i do have a back up model ive heard im pretty but w e just please help the best advice i can give to you is very important for now the only thing you can do is to immerse yourself in music i wish when i was your age i would have been aware we had a school of the arts in my town ask your parents to please send to your towns local school of the arts they are usually one free public school in every city that will not cost your parents any money other than transportation apply to your city's public school of the arts and study guitar also when you get older it is very hard to become a famous musician but not as immpossible as i thought with what everyone was telling me now that i am and i know all about the music industry if i knew then what i know now about how it is not as hard as i thought i would have chased my dream like yours but i listened to everyone say how hard it was and did not realize it is very possible also you will want to move to a city that supports local live bands if your town does not have a good local live music scene with many bars that support live local musicians if you get famous it will most likely be because of who you met as you were paying your dues like friends you will make now at the shcool of the arts and the ones you will meet in college at a music school and lastly the ones you will meet while playing live in your towns local music scene good luck chase your dream but have an alternate plan to fall back on try to know as many friends as possible in the music industry the world is half who you know and half what you know you can improve both by attending a music school now and playing clubs and parties in years from now also keep asking questions like you did here was a good start on the right track also get a mentor someone that is ahead of you in the music world that will help you with advice in return for your protege' loyalty Brian Jones (musician) Therion (band) Blood on the Tracks Cliff Richard The Isley Brothers Avenue Q The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Humphrey Bogart Good Charlotte The Rutles Hip hop collaborations Tony Bennett Jazz Grunge music Clarinet Blues One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada A Day in the Life Big band Van Halen Music Marching band The Wall Blonde on Blonde McFly Journey (band) The Waterboys Charles Ives A-ha Jennifer Lopez EastEnders Missy Elliott I Want to Hold Your Hand Empire Burlesque Dream Theater Milton H.
