guitar help there is an yr old i know who plays left handed with a right hand guitar although she is right handed is this a major problem jimi took a regular rh guitar and turned it over stringing it lh he couldn't at the time find a lh guitar his big e string was still on the top like most people play mark knoffler of dire straits is lh but plays a normal rh guitar what this does for him is put his dominant hand on the fret board which makes total sense to me since there are more things to do there more notes to hit and more things to do with those notes i think what your friend is doing makes total sense particularly with what knoffler does also if the big strings are on the bottom she then has more power with her fingers to press the strings that will help by not making her spend too much time re interpreting chord diagrams also when she wants to test out a guitar later deciding if she wants to buy it it will already be set up right for her i kind of wish i had started learning that way but i am not going back to ground zero but the advantage knoffler had there is your right hand is more suited for doing rhythm since it is controlled by your left and more analytical brain as i understand the reason for how guitars are normally played if it works for your friend that is great i have often wondered Tablature Double bass Blood on the Tracks Violin Guitar Bass guitar Pedal steel guitar Slide guitar Jimi Hendrix Fret Mandolin Twelve string guitar Stevie Ray Vaughan Poker jargon Banjo Black Sabbath Musical notation Harmonica Time Out of Mind 1957 World Series Cello Stanley Jordan Fender Telecaster A Hard Day's Night (song) Electric guitar Sitar Blur Oasis (band) Tapping The Shadows Lap steel guitar Shaggy dog story Brian Jones (musician) The Yardbirds Rock (music) Chapman Stick Slow Train Coming Goldberg Variations Acoustic guitar Guqin Jethro Tull (band) Douglas Adams Eric Clapton String theory Dire Straits Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Classical music era Phil Collins Blonde on Blonde I Want to Hold Your Hand Clarinet Sonata (music) Normal distribution Piccolo Junior Saga Another Side of Bob Dylan Cheating in poker Professional wrestling attacks Badminton Django Reinhardt Rhythm guitar Power chord Philosophy of language Slapping She Loves You Tony Iommi Mouse (computing) Fischer Random Chess Guitar/synthesizer Shen Gong Wu Floyd Rose Salad Fingers Year of the Spider Self Portrait Roxette Formal grammar Therion (band) The Beatles 2005 English cricket season Nine Inch Nails Eddie Van Halen Tonality Archery Love and Theft Rules of Go Music of Ireland Chord (music) Musical mode The Time Machine Skateboarding trick Jazz Hurdy gurdy Please Please Me Red Hot Chili Peppers The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sampling (music) The Kinks PRS Guitars
