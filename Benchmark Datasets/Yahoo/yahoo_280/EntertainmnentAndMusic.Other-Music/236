about the video never too late by three days grace does anyone understand what its trying to say like the moral of the vid usually i understand the music videos but just not this one lol help anyone i'm not sure about the moral but to me the girl got molested by the guy in the sweater why not because i'm thinking wrongly but i guess when he touches her you get the idea that the touching was probably a bad thing if she had to go to the hospital for it in the future the parents had stuff over their eyes probably to show that they couldn't see the truth behind the girl's relationship with the guy in the sweater the girl grows up to be crazy and in a hospital and you see a clip where she's being held down by the sweater guy's hands another clip is when you see black handprints everywhere invasion of privacy and loss for self control then you see a black winged angel come along and i realize that angels have white wings but i guess coming from a rock band they wanted black so black it is and fight this guy off when no one else would maybe he was like the girl's guardian angel the girl remembers this and suddenly she's at peace which would be my interpretation but i mean if the girl was never molested in the first place then i'm completely wrong Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Doors About a Boy Blood on the Tracks Weezer Music video Angel Journey (band) Scenes from a Memory Earth Girl Arjuna Free will Humphrey Bogart Hey Jude Gwen Stefani Child sexuality The Human Stain Limp Bizkit Family Guy Homestar Runner Douglas Adams Sin Hardcore punk Cary Grant End times Buddy Guy Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Inside Lana Turner One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Street-Legal Stone Temple Pilots Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban KUKL T.A.T.u.
