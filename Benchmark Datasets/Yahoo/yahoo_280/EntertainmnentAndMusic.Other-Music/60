why do my parents hate it when i practice music i've been learning to play the guitar and they say it's a waste of time if i were them i'd be ecstatic that my child has the passion to learn something new i'm going to college in a couple weeks and i really want to trade my crappy yamaha acoustic and pay the difference for a better one my dad said that i shouldn't waste my time and to focus more on schoolwork but it's not like i'm going to be burying my face in books it's frustrating i don't know what to do i love music and i can't go a day without playing guitar keep playing your guitar having a musical interest is great and i hope you stick with it your parents aren't always going to be in agreement with you since you are going off to college you are old enough to make decisions on your own as long as they are smart ones get a better guitar keep practicing maybe hit some talent shows in the future and then when you visit your mom and dad have something prepared especially for them something they would like to show them it wasn't a waste of time just be sure that your school work still comes first because if your grades start slipping your parents will have a reason to keep telling you it's a waste of time Kurt Cobain Mr. and Mrs. Turner Blonde on Blonde Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes Time Out of Mind The Marshall Mathers LP Shaggy dog story Spice Girls The Fairly OddParents The Ashlee Simpson Show Hermione Granger The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Education in the United States Back to the Future Delta Goodrem One Tree Hill (TV series) Solomon Keal Roxette Friends Marty McFly Slow Train Coming Double bass Kyle Broflovski Hillary Rodham Clinton Rocko's Modern Life Rod Stewart Fathers' rights Grandview, U.S.A.
