what musical styles that we still have today origininated from the medieval and renaissance period thank you very much lol i meant originated what i really want to know is would a cappella be an acceptable answer i read it had its roots in gregorian chanting this has got to be a homework question right i guess medieval music saw the introduction of polyphony several voices overlayed singing harmonic tunes maybe with a drone in the background lots of devotional songs about god lots of story songs about winning battles with gods help lots of songs about my lady's beauty and lots of christmas carols much of the written music was created by monks and nuns like hildegarde von bingen a lot of the non religious music secular was not written down so it's difficult to assess its influence it was passed on orally and originated spontaneously as a reaction to events sometimes under the influence of ale if i had to pick something i'd say christmas carols choral and folk music renaissance music saw the introduction of more instrumentation like viols and lutes orchestral music and towards the end early operas see monteverdi who verged on the baroque a lot of music was written to amuse the court solo or a small group of singers with a lute singing secular music about love disdained love consummated beauty and death this sort of music and lyric translates easily into modern lovelorn ballads and even folk music try looking at people like thomas campion and john dowland admittedly at the latter end of the renaissance but stylistically belonging you could easily write an entire thesis on this as a lot of people have already i hope it gets you off to a start c Choir Medieval music Renaissance music Lute Baroque music History of music Figured bass Song Folk music Music genre Orlande de Lassus Timeline of trends in music to 1799 Music of the United States Music history of the United States during the colonial era Johann Sebastian Bach Opera Authentic performance Music of China Gregorian chant Hildegard of Bingen A cappella Claudio Monteverdi Giulio Caccini Motet Viol Music of Japan Music of Iran Trombone Music of England European classical music Metrical psalter Music history of France Music of Spain Music of Germany Music of Albania Blues Native American music Guillaume Dufay Music of Italy Music of Greece Gospel music Musical notation Christmas carol Igor Stravinsky Sacred Harp Mass (music) Benjamin Britten Music of Brittany High Middle Ages Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity John Dowland Jazz Ballad Tonality Classical music era Violin American popular music Roots revival Music of Hungary Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Italian Renaissance Music of France Philip Glass Psalms Music of Scotland Music of Nigeria Medieval literature Medieval poetry Music history of the United States Baroque Claudin de Sermisy Anglo-Saxon literature Fugue Heinrich Sch__tz Country music Old-time music Hymn Madrigal (music) Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Music of Croatia Bohemian Rhapsody Mandolin Jewish music Monody Double bass Christian music Music history of the United States (1940s and 50s) Leonard Cohen Guitar Henry Purcell The Velvet Underground Hurdy gurdy Gramophone Awards Renaissance
