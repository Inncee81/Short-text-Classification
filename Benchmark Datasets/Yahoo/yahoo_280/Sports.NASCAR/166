why does everyone cry about qualifying getting rained out i dont get why people get so mad that because qualifying got rained out that people who arent locked in the points have to pack it up and go home obviously there is a reason that they dont race every weekend so whats the big deal a better way to explain lets compare it to other sports lets say football baseball basketball hockey or even soccer had their practices rained out does that mean that people who are not good enough to be on the team throughout the whole year can then come out and try and play do you get what i am trying to say it doesnt make sense to me yea it gets old i agree with you there is a reason they don't race every week they aren't good enough to make the top and the people like boris said and others i don't feel a bit sorry for anyways because that's the risk they take coming in and only running races a year Playoff Baseball National Football League 2004-05 NHL lockout Sports timeline Atomic Kitten Sport in Ireland Football (soccer) Salary cap Ayrton Senna September 2004 in sports EA Sports Major League Baseball television contracts December 2004 in sports May 2005 in sports November 2004 in sports Norway national football team Sudden death October 2004 in sports Sports betting Sport World Football League Teen Girl Squad National Hockey League National Basketball Association Theory of conduct March 2005 in sports Rugby union Major League Soccer Major professional sports league Draft (sports) Bundesliga (football) Canadian Football League University of Denver Major League Baseball Atlantic Coast Conference Jupiler League Garth Brooks July 2005 in sports Relegation August 2005 in sports July 2004 in sports 24 Hours of Le Mans June 2005 in sports Los Angeles Clippers Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Michael Schumacher September 2005 in sports Sports in Canada 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Germany at the 2004 Summer Olympics Minnesota Golden Gophers The Football League 1986 World Series Sports in Puerto Rico Gambling Poker jargon Los Angeles Kings Troms__ I.L.
