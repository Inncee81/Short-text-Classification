why dont someone build a figure track with a ramp over the intersection equally banked turns at each end it seems like the more recent ovals are basically the same just think of the passsing while they were crossing from inside left turn to inside right and the seating possibilities are incredible look at the tracks like kentucky speedway they cant get a nascar event for what ever reasons and thats the heart of nascar land the track is beautiful and the most comfortable ive been to i think it would be a cool idea it wouldn't be any different than navagating a road course there would only be turns and the first straightaway would be the ramp which would have to be lower than a normal ramp and the other straightaway would have to be a little below ground level make it miles long so there'd be plenty of passing on the stretches kinda like the old hotwheels tracks but i don't know where they would pit that would be interesting enough Bristol Motor Speedway NASCAR Pocono Raceway Stock car racing Interchange (road) Darlington Raceway Indy Racing League West Side Highway Interstate Highway Craftsman Truck Series California Speedway Watkins Glen International U.S. Highway 91 Atlanta Motor Speedway Skateboarding trick Nashville Superspeedway Lane Paris Martinsville Speedway Dover International Speedway California State Route 85 Belmont Park Dale Earnhardt Darrell Waltrip Drag racing Las Vegas Motor Speedway Auto racing New Hampshire International Speedway Pulaski Skyway TGV Long Path Long Island Rail Road Dog agility Texas Motor Speedway Beverly Hills, California Sport utility vehicle Interstate 95 U.S. Highway 1 Dirt track racing Highway English cricket team Daytona International Speedway Dodge Charger Twin Ring Motegi Traffic light Freeway Riverside International Raceway Interstate 70 Great Pyramid of Giza Safety car Athletics Toronto Subway and RT Indianapolis, Indiana Talladega Superspeedway London Underground Charlotte, North Carolina Richard Petty Electrophysiology Fuji Speedway 2005 United States Grand Prix Wacker Drive Interstate 94 U.S. Highway 220 Infineon Raceway Drifting (motorsport) Interstate 24 Polo Grounds Bike lane debate Champ Car Interstate 64 Carl Edwards BMT Brighton Line Jughandle BMT Canarsie Line Transportation of Los Angeles Strap-on dildo NASCAR Realignment Car handling The Emancipation of Mimi Suzuka Circuit Ontario Motor Speedway Airport Bobby Hamilton Richard Childress Racing Racing flags Nuclear power Sydney Harbour Bridge California State Route 330 Michigan left Stonehenge Wrigley Field Zola Budd Level crossing
