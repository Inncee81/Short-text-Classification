what kind of cranks do the nascar engines have and who grinds their cams do they have to use a stock block if not what kind and what kind of rods do they use i know the heads are the secret but what about everythingelse i have been to nascar alot and have not seen anything that describes engine specs john go find a circle jerk and be the hub let me start by saying that nascar rules and regulations are always subject to change as are teams and the way they operate this information is accurate to the best of my abilities pretty much the only engine parts that come from the manufacturer gm ford dodge are the block and the heads and both are bare and not even remotely stock the gm block for example doesn't even have a place to mount an oil filter the displacement can be no less than ci and no more than ci virtually everything else is aftermarket usually designed exclusively for nascar for example chip gannasi racing's suppliers include mike bordeaux dyno cams comp cams trend and smith brothers pushrods del west and xceldyne valves jesel belt drives t d rockers lentz connecting rods sonny bryant cranks johnson oil pumps clevite engine bearings je pistons fel pro gaskets and bosch plugs and alternators every engine for every team uses a holley carb all teams have specs their common parts must comply to regardless of where they come from for example pistons can't weigh less than grams con rods grams and wrist pins grams the max compression ratio is and the max exhaust diameter is except for the tips they have an unusual spec because they are flattened out i don't remember what it is for sure but something like no more than wide each or combined different teams have different shops who do their machining for example joe gibbs racing sends their heads to cfe racing products in michigan and ganassi has ernie elliott in georgia do all their machine work the average lifespan of the parts are different and engines are torn down after every race so an engine used in one race may not have all the same parts in it as it did in an earlier race blocks are usually good for races heads races cranks races cams lifters and pushrods races connecting rods and rocker arms races and pistons valves and valve springs are replaced after every race carbs are rebuilt after every race and there is no average lifespan for them toyota is in a slightly different situation and my knowledge there is very limited toyota itself hasn't made a carbureted pushrod v in a long time so trd in california started from scratch and designed a new engine that was based on what they felt were the best features of the other manufacturers engines and then added their own tweaks it works well in the craftsman truck series but the cup engine is an even newer design with a slightly different block and heads only bill davis' triad corp and trd in california are building the engines which are all supposed to remain identical as far as hardware is concerned and then sell them to the other teams last i heard however toyota has been told they have one or more unfair advantages and are supposed to have a new engine next year but i haven't confirmed that Diesel engine Chevrolet Corvair engine Dodge Neon Indianapolis 500 AMC V8 engine NASCAR Four-stroke cycle Toyota Corolla V8 Toyota M engine Chevrolet Small-Block engine E85 Internal ballistics Poppet valve Oldsmobile V8 engine Ford Mustang Camshaft Motor oil Toyota A engine Harley-Davidson Internal combustion engine Dodge Charger Sleeve valve Turbocharger GM LS engine Toyota MR2 Connecting rod Fuel injection Motorcycle Displacement on Demand GM 60-Degree V6 engine Chevrolet Corvair Toyota Camry Wankel engine Automatic transmission Penske Racing Battery electric vehicle Variable valve timing Engine tuning Drag racing Chrysler K engine Pickup truck Toyota Prius Spark plug Volvo 200 series Honda Hydraulic machinery Gnome Monosoupape BMW M5 Cylinder head Nissan Skyline Indy Racing League Hybrid vehicle Toyota Land Cruiser Machine gun Screw Chevrolet Big-Block engine Ford Duratec engine Atari 8-bit family ATI Technologies Stirling engine Continuously variable transmission Tire Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster CPU cache Bill Davis Racing Chevrolet Corvette Auto racing Formula One M60 machine gun Hendrick Motorsports Gas turbine Volkswagen Passat Supercharger Roush Racing GM Family II engine Rail terminology 24 Hours of Le Mans Craftsman Truck Series BMW motorcycles Jet engine Evernham Motorsports Automobile Drill bit Aircraft engine NEXTEL Cup Multi-valve
