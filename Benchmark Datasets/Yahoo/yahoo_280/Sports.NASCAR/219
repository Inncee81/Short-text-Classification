do you think juan pablo montoya needs to give up nascar every race that juan is in he seems to spin out other drivers in my opinion he is unsafe to the other drivers in nascar every weekend i sit and watch and wait for juan to spin out someone cause an accident or wreck himself i personally feel that his he needs to park it for nascar and perhaps go back to doing what ever he used to do what do you think i think jpm needs to spend a few years in the busch series learning how to race a stock car and learning patience he could be a good driver in nextel if he learned patience and took the time to learn how not to wreck people and control his car better i don't dispure that he has done very well in other motorsports but he lacks a lot of qualities for nascar at this time NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Juan Pablo Montoya Auto racing Busch Series Hendrick Motorsports Indianapolis 500 Stock car racing Watkins Glen International Kyle Busch Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Richard Childress Racing Talladega Superspeedway Tony Stewart Kevin Harvick Evernham Motorsports Carl Edwards Penske Racing Lowe's Motor Speedway Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
