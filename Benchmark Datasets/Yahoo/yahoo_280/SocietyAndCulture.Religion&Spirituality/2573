where do some of these posters get the insane idea that people believe their religion just because they ask you don't have to believe it to be curious also there are many groups trying to write their religious beliefs into our laws i for one know the bible have read it entirely a couple times know the doctrines of most of the christian denominations and actually believe very little of it i ask questions to get different perspectives promote understanding or just because i'm interested in how people will respond i and thousands of others do not have any faith whatsoever in your belief system to claim that we believe because we show interest is ignorant and an intellectual insult my beliefs are humanist and naturalist which leaves very little room for your gods i was raised christian and did my fair share of preaching when i was younger at least untill my studies brought me to my current beliefs i always questioned and researched what i was taught wonderful i agree almost completely so the question is why do people assume we're believers just because we ask a few questions i suspect that many unsophisticated people believe pretty much everything they're able to understand the idea that someone may want to understand something but not believe in it is utterly alien to many superficial thinkers remember friend we are the ones who belong out there under the thinning extremes of the bell curve edit for those skeptical christians above i am also one of those who has read the bible cover to cover twice years after i decided i was an atheist it's about learning to truly understand your enemy do not make the simple minded mistake of assuming others think like you do Religion Creationism A Course In Miracles Fundamentalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Judaism Christianity The nature of God in Western theology Evangelicalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Intelligent design Atheism Creation-evolution controversy Sin Jewish principles of faith Church of Christ, Scientist Paul of Tarsus Socrates Trinity Evolutionary creationism Protestantism Cult Theology Predestination Intelligent design movement Urantia Nation of Islam Apologetics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Charles Darwin's views on religion Existence of God Ten Commandments The relationship between religion and science Christian apologetics Religious Society of Friends Religious conversion Apostasy Divine grace Church of Christ Book of Mormon Theodicy Baptism God Christian-Jewish reconciliation History of creationism Christianity and anti-Semitism C.
