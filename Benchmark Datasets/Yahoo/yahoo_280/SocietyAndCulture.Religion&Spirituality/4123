why is it that big time players in their youth become saints or preacher men in their golden years god has a plan do you really think they were happy as a big time player why does someone come to god it is because of hardships and struggles and even after it is not easy because people still see you as you use to be that is even more of a struggle persecution and opposition god calls you and another has a hard time believing it will that would be just ginger are should i say lemon but it is in those times it builds their character and lets us know that god is always in their defense why because that person can not help god chose him or her but it works to edify the church to tell the world that it nothing to hard for god i was never a pimp or player but i can tell you i was far from perfect and did somethings i myself am not proud of worse than a player i think so this is something you can take to the bank god gave me his spirit and struggles are real and just like the israelites i complained and just like moses in exodus i did not want to do it yet god was gracious to me and gave me time and continue to have mercy and love for me so when i still do somethings i used to do he chastens me as a father yet his great love brings me back to repentence there is no greater love like his there is no greater love of the show of god than he allows someone to come out of hells kitchen and preach not only in their golden years but any years god forgives and we should forgive god loves and so should we jesus was our example and we should study his words and let god do the work we pray and god changes the heart and mind of the one that prays and the one that is prayed for we must stay on our knees for change god bless you and yours this is a day of thanks such as any day thank god for his unfailing love towards men and women god is devine and we are his children he says my sheep know my voice and another they will not listen god raise people up for such a time as this now whom do you believe god's word or man Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sabbath Salvation Sola fide Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Repentance Baptism Priesthood (Mormonism) Ten Commandments John the Baptist Five points of Calvinism Charles Grandison Finney Divine grace Jacob Sin God A Course In Miracles Summa Theologiae Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Korban Roman Catholic Church Exodus Trinity Virgin Mary in Islam Book of Isaiah Church of Christ InterFaith Christian views of Jesus First Book of Nephi Christianity Prophet Original sin Opus Dei Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Coptic Christianity Paradise Lost Holy Spirit God and gender Prophets of Islam God the Father Idolatry Christian eschatology History of the Latter Day Saint movement Michael (archangel) Indulgence Purgatory Great Jubilee Qiyamah Great Apostasy Paul of Tarsus Soul Jan Hus Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Calvinism Jews as a chosen people Articles of Religion (Methodist) Joseph Smith, Jr. Alan Campbell (pastor) Infant baptism Amidah Mormonism Godspell Rich Mullins Religious Society of Friends Sant Thakar Singh Saint Hell Bhajan Blood atonement Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Martin Luther Gospel of Thomas Mary, the mother of Jesus Nontrinitarianism Contrition Ezekiel Three Secrets of Fatima Second Vatican Council Christian monasticism Khazar Correspondence Unification Church Moses Philipp Melanchthon Devil Jerusalem Mormonism and Christianity
