is islam a violent religion i am curious is it violent or has it been abused has it been politicized by a minority don't muslims christians and jews all worship the same god as an atheist i am curious thank you for this question well i am a muslim and yes islam has been abused by a group of delusional madmen to meet their political goals have you seen what happened in pakistan's red mosque what kind of imam would carry guns inside a mosque and say hate this hate that anyway i support action against such madmen jew christians and muslims worship the same god that is a fact the reason for the division is due to the belief in leadership christians believe in jesus and muslims believe in mohammad and in islam jesus is well respected and it does believe in the concept of the holy spirit and virgin mary the only difference between them is how the time of jesus ended christians believe that jesus was crusified and muslims believe that he was assended away to the heavens and that he is still alive in heaven and will return on the day of judgement to fight the anti christ just who the anti christ is is not exactly clear and no islam does not oppress women anyone who says that is a liar and a hypocrite islam simply tells women to be modest the definition of modesty would obviously vary in different times it certainly was different in the middle ages it can also differ in different societies not all muslim women wear the hijab and niether does my mother or any of my relatives they say modesty is the best and the koran does say not to look odd in front of any different society do as the romans do as they say and there are some muslim men who use the religion to take advantage of women respect for women is the most important thing i have come to think that many western societies do not respect the beauty and the integrety of women i have come to conclude that religion cannot be mixed with politics it does not represent all people in a nation relgion should be practiced in private i'd say countries like iran and saudi arabia have some way to go i'd say saudi arabia's religious leadership had done a poor job at handling all the affairs in the muslim world both social and political they don't do anything other than think about themselves that gave iran something to complain about the american leadership are victims of their own stupidity i know that we muslim opinions are not very well represented in the media even on news networks like al jazeera let alone the western media but this is the overall opinion of most muslims Christianity Sharia Nation of Islam Mary, the mother of Jesus Fundamentalism Religion Religious pluralism Hijab French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Women in Islam Discrimination God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saudi Arabia Anti-Semitism Islamist terrorism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Historical persecution by Muslims Criticism of Islam Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Al-Qaeda Ten Commandments Islamic world Jesus Dhimmi Soul Religious conversion Apostasy in Islam History of Islam Islam in France Jew Shi'a Islam Eastern Orthodox Church Abrahamic religion Islamism Religion and sexual orientation Neofascism and religion Yusuf al-Qaradawi Muhammad Arab-Israeli conflict Jehovah's Witnesses Persecution of Christians Religion and sexuality Polygamy Zoroastrianism Council on American-Islamic Relations Atheism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Osama bin Laden Religious perspectives on Jesus Mahatma Gandhi Religion in Israel Religious persecution Roman Catholic Church Jizya Trinity Islamic philosophy Ahmadiyya Muslim Community End times Marriage Divisions of Islam Idolatry Heresy Christian eschatology Creationism Isa Capital punishment Simone Weil Militant Islam Homosexuality and Islam Messiah Predestination Apostasy Status of religious freedom in Sudan Christian denomination Holy Spirit Satanism Chosen people Exorcism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Prophets of Islam Eschatology Religious Society of Friends Ordination of women Hamas Monotheism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Paul of Tarsus
