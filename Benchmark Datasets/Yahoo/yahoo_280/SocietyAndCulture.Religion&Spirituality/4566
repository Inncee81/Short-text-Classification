isn't it apparent that many people who are irreligious are that way for purely sociological reasons when i say irreligious i'm not in any way just speaking of philosophical skeptics truthfully when it comes to people who would be deemed irreligious people who are societal christians yet are not true seekers of christ outnumber philosophical skeptics almost twenty fold now to get to the meat of the matter i can't help but to see that people who don't take religion or christianity seriously very often fail to do so because they are too satisfied with how sociologically secure they are with their life to think that there is more to this life than the nominal piety they cling to i think that the quickest christian answer is to look at this as a so called spirtual test that is that it is with worldly comfort we may be blinded to god's calling for us it would really go hand in hand with jesus' proclaimation that it is easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to gain heaven but for me it is hard to accept that all these people are failing any sort of spiritual test i think that for a normal irreligious person or a nominal christian it is a fallacy to say that these people are failing god s test more people than not are of this variety and i think that it is really more of a theologically arbitrary situation if you are satisfied with your existence as many people are and you got what you feel you need on this earth things like basic needs feelings of belonging and to make this list shorter i am just going to name drop the concept of maslow s hierarchy of needs you just plain simply are not going to take religion much more seriously than the common man usually does please forgive me if you can see this post as only an attempt to discredit christianity as of course it partly is but surely you can empathize with me here and see that in some ways simple sociological mechanics dictate who are true christians and those who are not yes no for many their faith is a comfort zone something that they've known all their lives and are either unwilling to advance or abandon too many people are willing to accept what they've always known they don't question it the faith itself is irrelevant the box exists and too many are unwilling to look outside of it in fear of upsetting their own comfort Atheism Christianity Theodicy Resurrection of Jesus Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Opus Dei Religious pluralism Intelligent design Supernatural God Evil John Wycliffe Roman Catholic Church The nature of God in Western theology Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Reincarnation Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Free will Eastern Orthodox Church Jewish principles of faith Calvinism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ethics Presuppositional apologetics Theology Creationism Christian apologetics Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Existence of God Ontological argument Miracle Agnosticism Goodness and value theory Fundamentalism Biblical inerrancy Emanuel Swedenborg John Howard Yoder Heaven Philosophical skepticism Predestination Sant Thakar Singh Trinity Origin belief Sola fide Gospel of Thomas Justification (theology) Satanism Great Apostasy Merit Discordianism Idolatry Angel Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Prophet Anselm of Canterbury Who is a Jew?
