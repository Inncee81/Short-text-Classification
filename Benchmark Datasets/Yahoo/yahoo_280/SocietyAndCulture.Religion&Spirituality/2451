why is jesus portrayed as white why is jesus portrayed as white in almost all pictures of him i am an atheist but i have studied a lot of christianity and according to the place where jesus supposedly lived he would have skin very similar to the color that arabs have today are christians racist are they too ignorant to know the difference between skin colors i vote this become a drinking question up until the middle ages there were no pictures of jesus there is not even a description of him but as time passed and followers became more distant from jesus's time they wanted something to help visualize hence the great artists of the time after the byzantine times as they were mostly european then so was jesus it wouldn't have dawned on them to make him middle eastern they were living in italy Race of Jesus White (people) White supremacy Jesus Black (people) Middle Ages Jews in the Middle Ages Christianity Liturgical year Mary, the mother of Jesus Images of Jesus History of Christianity Bosniaks End times Religion Christian denomination Byzantine art Biblical Magi God Eastern Orthodox Church Byzantine Empire Anti-Semitism Orientalism Icon Bishop Easter Blacks and Mormonism Fundamentalism Western world Race Dionysus White nationalism Persecution of Christians Religious conversion Religious perspectives on Jesus Aramaic language Atheism New Testament Heaven Amman Biblical canon Lamanite Trinity Historicity of Jesus Middle East Renaissance Idolatry in Christianity Rosary Judas Iscariot Holy Grail Pope Soul Palestinian Tarot Secret Gospel of Mark Messianic Judaism Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity New Age Curse and mark of Cain New Testament view on Jesus' life Prayer Roman Catholic Church Baptism Religion in Israel Druze C.
