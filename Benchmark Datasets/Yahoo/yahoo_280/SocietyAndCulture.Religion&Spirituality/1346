if jesus came back wouldn't he just be another crazy person we make fun of i am a believer but sometimes i think about it our generation is ready for jesus' back our reality is so green i am talking about it because we are seeing so many atrocities around the world dear coxinha i believe that couldn't be possible because when jesus returns the bible says he won't be born like before he already did that and after ressurrection it says he has now a glorified body not like ours and in the book of revelation you can read that he will come in power not in humbleness like before when he first came he was like a lamb but when he return it'll be in power and glory and no one will be able to make fun of him but the ones that didn't believe him will have sorrow and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory this generation isn't prepared and it's gonna get worse until that day so we must make search for him while we have the chance isaiah verse god bless you coxinha see ya Christian eschatology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Rapture Book of Isaiah Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Holy Spirit Sabbath Slow Train Coming Book of Mormon Dispensationalism Jesus Soul Sola fide Mary, the mother of Jesus John the Baptist John Howard Yoder Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Revelation Second Coming Apostle Free will Justification (theology) Alan Campbell (pastor) Trinity Salvation Ten Commandments Heaven A Course In Miracles Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Revelation Mormonism and Christianity Isa Binitarianism Apocalyptic literature Mirza Ghulam Ahmad God Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Religion Godhead (Mormonism) Origen End times Urantia Abrahamic religion Bible Jehovah's Witnesses Messiah Virgin Mary in Islam Biblical inerrancy Last Judgment Mormonism and Judaism Chosen people Gloria in Excelsis Jacob Blessed Virgin Mary Names and titles of Jesus Liturgical year Jewish eschatology Mass (liturgy) God and gender Demon Korban New Testament Rosary Theodicy Pope Funeral of Pope John Paul II Athanasian Creed Intercession of saints Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Original sin Judaism Lucifer Moses Passover Christianity Joseph of Arimathea Creationism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Unification Church Sant Mat Matthew 5 Joseph Smith, Jr. Restoration (Mormonism) Devil Repentance Prophet Gospel Tribulation Shawn Michaels Paradise Lost True Jesus Church Adam-God theory Catholic Apostolic Church Apocalypse
