do you think it's ok for people to protest religions would you be mad if someone was protesting your religion i am lds and when i was driving by a local temple i saw people protesting outside it kind of made me mad because i think that even if you don't agree or believe in the same things as me you should respect my beliefs there are a lot of religions that i don't understand or believe in but i have respect for the individuals that do believe in it and i would never stand outside someone elses church or sacred place and protest brian it was at the salt lake city temple i get that america gives you the feedom to protest but that wasn't my question not really anyways i just wanted to know how individuals feel about protesting of religions not protesting in general how does it make you feel for all you athiests out there i completly respect that choice just because i believe something doesn't mean that everyone has to i've always thought protesters were a strange phenomenon i won't take part in protests because i don't like the herd mentality or mob mentality that i see and i don't think protesting is an effective solution i'm guessing that by protesting the lds they think that they can make all of you go away unless you actually saw god out there holding a sign and marching with them i would ignore them as best you can and go on doing your thing Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Fundamentalism Criticism of Mormonism Theory of conduct Temple (Mormonism) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Great Apostasy The nature of God in Western theology Mormonism and Christianity Supernatural Religion Goodness and value theory History of the Latter Day Saint movement Endowment (Mormonism) Evolutionary creationism Sexual orientation Mormonism and Judaism Biblical canon Reality Joseph Smith, Jr. Religious pluralism Blacks and Mormonism Book of Mormon Abortion debate Idolatry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious Society of Friends Dualism (philosophy of mind) Predestination Eucharist Exorcism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Provo, Utah Priesthood (Mormonism) Animism Christian view of marriage History of Salt Lake City Mormon Saint Theology Ten Commandments Baptism Liberal Christianity Religious conversion Mormonism Origin belief Soul Ramakrishna Nation of Islam Social psychology Baptist United States religious history Abrahamic religion Unitarian Universalism Voodoo New Age Determinism Temple in Jerusalem Simone Weil Historical persecution by Christians Sabbath Heber C.
