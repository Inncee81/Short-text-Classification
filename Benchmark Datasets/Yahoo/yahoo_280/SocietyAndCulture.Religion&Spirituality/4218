does god have a gender then why we call he no she or it i thought god has no gender and we should not called him or her maybe just it becuase it's neutral i think so ray of light god almighty is beyond our human comprehension but as far as a gender or position of reference it has been made perfectly clear as the father if you don't want to believe the bible's many many references then look around you at the nature of things the animals the plants all that he created their survival how they reproduce made in the image of god means more than his appearance his love of family values as to honor the father and the mother for generation after generation this in no way belittles the female does all men love all of their sons more than any of his daughters of course not does making most men physically stronger also offer more protection for the female in making the female more resilient also make the man stronger so therefore the strength is in the union god can and will be whomever he chooses whenever he chooses but you were told there is but one father and he is in heaven so honor him by acknowledging him Trinity God Athanasian Creed Meaning of life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Priesthood (Mormonism) Justification (theology) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gender-neutral language Idolatry Gender Urantia Eastern Orthodox Church Angels in Islam John the Baptist Ten Commandments Christian views of women Fallen angel Gautama Buddha The nature of God in Western theology Origin belief Angel Simone Weil Presuppositional apologetics El (god) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sex Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Human Maya mythology Bhakti Summa Theologiae Predestination Binitarianism Jacob 613 mitzvot Gender role Homosexuality and Christianity Nicene Creed Sexual orientation Creation according to Genesis Book of Isaiah Pysanka Devil Soul Grammatical gender Names of God in Judaism The Subtle Knife Sola fide Jews as a chosen people Book of Mormon Salvation Family Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Sant Mat Sabbath Divine grace Blacks and Mormonism John Wycliffe Incarnations of Immortality Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Philipp Melanchthon Sikh religious philosophy Same-sex marriage Isa The Amber Spyglass Homosexuality and transgender Religious conversion Human nature Religious perspectives on Jesus Woman Encantadia The Lovely Bones Hell Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Divine Providence Bene Gesserit Free will Human sexual behavior Anarcho-primitivism Patriarchy Son of God Philo Noah Merit Day-Age Creationism Social constructionism Adam and Eve Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions El (Canaanite god) Fundamentalism Genesis Bulgarian language Sub-Zero The Origin of Species
