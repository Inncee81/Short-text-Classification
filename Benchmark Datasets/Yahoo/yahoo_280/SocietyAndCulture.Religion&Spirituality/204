has religious fervor in the us increased since i think yes and the reason why i think this is so is because after people needed comfort and many found it in religion however since the war on terror started we have been in a state of perpetual war which is seen as a struggle against islam specifically by many christians in the us as such christians have fundamentalized themselves much more so to clearly have define an us vs them mindset this is similar to the mccarthy era when the us was at war with the godless communists and similarly embraced religion leading to things like adding under god to the pledge agree or disagree any thoughts luckily i think the unpopularity of the iraq war and the unpopularity of christian fundamentalism not to be confused with regular christians is swinging back the religious fervor meter back to pre levels agree or disagree with that yes did result in a initially large increase in church attendance and participation i've heard numerous studies to this effect cited on the news and even in a recent textbook i use in my classes i would also agree that some christians have fundamentalized themselves to support their fear of islamic terrorists seems like a natural reaction to being attacked but i've also seen a number of articles that have discussed rapid growth in less fundamental christian churches my own church is far from fundamental and has grown almost exponentially since and another huge and rapidly growing church in my city is also far from fundamental the mccarthy era is one possible historical similarities but i think you can find hundreds if not thousands of other times when people embraced religion for comfort in times of trouble last one sounds reasonable too i have seen recent studies that show that some of the mad rush to church that followed the tragedy of has died down and that some churches are again seeing declines in attendance i'm not sure whether this is good or bad so i don't know how to interpret the term luckily Religion Fundamentalism Supernatural Atheism Separation of church and state Pacifism Evangelicalism Sociology of religion Islam as a political movement Evolutionary creationism Intelligent design movement Theology A Course In Miracles Nationalism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Religious conversion Christian right Church of Christ Baptist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Democracy History of Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Islamic philosophy Protestantism Protestant Reformation Religious pluralism Logic Fundamentalist Christianity Clergy Cult Pledge of Allegiance Coercion Explosive material The Left and Opposition to War Homosexuality and Christianity Pharisees Yusuf al-Qaradawi Prophet Same-sex marriage Nazism Islamism Trinity Abington School District v.
