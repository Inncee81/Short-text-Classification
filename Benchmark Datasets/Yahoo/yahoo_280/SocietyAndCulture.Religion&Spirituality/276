why do people say that suicide is selfish when people commit suicide its only because their life up to that point felt worse to them than dying isn't it the ones that say suicide is selfish really the selfish ones because they expect someone whose life is so miserable they would rather die to stick around just so other people can still have them around ok so with that in mind the question is do people have the right not to live i've been suicidal and i've overdosed with the expectation that i would die i was not being selfish at the time i was sick with bi polar and pretty much in a confused state i get very angry when people have told me that it was a selfish thing i tried to do most people that want to die from suicide are either very ill like in my case or very desperate often because those around them have let them down the living are often the selfish and not the person who wants to die people don't just wake up and say i want to die today its usually the result of years and years of hurts done to them by selfish people when this subject comes up now i tend to ask people this question what have you done to someone that might have added to the burden in their life that may one day turn to suicide we are all guilty of hurting each other at times lets no all be guilty of judging those that choose to end their lives thanks for asking this question Suicide Theory of conduct Alignment (role-playing games) Prisoner's dilemma Coercion Milton H.
