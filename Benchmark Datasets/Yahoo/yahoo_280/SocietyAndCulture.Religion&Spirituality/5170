why do many anti abortionists oppose gays being able to adopt isn't that like wanting to have your cake and eat it too if they're going to say that women should not be allowed to have abortions they should be pushing for adoption rights for everyone who will give a child a loving home the only argument i've heard against gay adoption rights is that children should be raised in a godly home with a mother and a father does that mean that they believe that atheists shouldn't be able to adopt or single parents either atheists gays and single parents can give a child as loving a home as any christian couple you may not see it as the ideal environment but its better than the child ending up in foster care which will happen to many children if abortion isn't allowed because there's just not enough adoptive parents for all the children being put up for adoption it just seems like so many of the christians who don't believe in abortion want to force these women to give birth but then don't actually care what happens to the kids after they're born do you agree why or why not okay here we go i personally could never have an abortion but i will in no way tell another woman what is best for her i do however hate hearing about people who abort babies for trivial reasons examples of this are the girl i knew in high school who had three because she didn't like the feeling of condoms another girl i new who would have been inconvenienced because she had booked a holiday and didn't want to be pregnant on a beach people who abort because the baby is not the sex they want i know it is not my place to judge but it's a little hard in cases such as these that said the pro life crowd really confuse me in some ways most of them are against birth control which would prevent these unwanted pregnancies they want people to put their babies up for adoption and also want to dictate which home they go to if that's the case why aren't they stepping up and giving these children a good home i know a lot of gay couples who would make better parents than most of the straight couples i know and as for this bs that homosexuals are molesters wrong of child molesters and paedophiles are straight as for them raising gay kids obviously the sexual preference of the parent have no effect or why would so many gay children be born to so many straight parents i do not see gay parents as at least better than foster care i see them as wonderful options as a loving home for a child i see no difference between a gay couple who are wanting to adopt and a straight couple if they pass the rigorous testing they need to go through in order to adopt there is no difference your right their logic is truly flawed i have seen many successful gay adoptions i hope that in the future this will no longer be an issue Abortion debate Pedophilia Transsexuality Birth control Adoption Same-sex marriage Laura Schlessinger Marriage Friends EastEnders Condom Sex education Abortion in the United States Infantilism Theory of conduct Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Human sexual behavior Hillary Rodham Clinton Pro-choice Gender role Roe v.
