do sunnis feel the same way about yazid that shiites feel about hossein the fight for control of islam between yazid and hossein caused the split between sunnis and shiites right the shiites consider hossein to have been a great religious leader fighting the corrupt caliphate of yazid do the sunnis see yazid as a religious leader or as just a political leader do sunnis consider hossein to have been a great religious leader like the shiites do is there any reason to believe that hossein would have been a good political leader we sunnis hate yazid the tyrant for him causing the death of imam hussain ra one of two beloved grandchildren of muhammad saw yazid is also irrelegious and a known drunkard and womanizer commiting all the vices in islam you can imagine his father hadrat muawwiyyah ra has once prayed after electing his son yazid that if yazid is going to be an evil tyrant let his rule be short in fact rasulullah saw has foretold that muawwiyah's child would be the murderer to one onf his descendants i can't remember the exact words after which muawwiyah ra decided not to get married later on he contracted a disease whose cure was available only if he married yazid is simply a failed political leader that allah allowed to happen so that his decree qadha' will come to pass sayyidina hussain is the great spiritual heir or inheritor of sayyidina ali and rasulullah that's for sure we sunnis don't ponder or debate whether he'll be a great political leader or not but the answer should be yes him being the grandchild of muhammad inherits his grandfather's and father's secret among them leadership and doing just just like his son sayyidina ali zainal abidin which sufis and his numerous descendant look up highly upon Shi'a Islam Husayn ibn Ali Yazid I Sunni Islam Muhammad Caliph Ruhollah Khomeini Islam Succession to Muhammad Ja'far al-Sadiq Sufism Battle of Karbala Quraish Imam Alawite Muslim ibn Aqeel Ali ibn Husayn Islam in Turkey Ismaili Religion Hadith Apostasy in Islam Fatimid Muawiyah I Muqtada al-Sadr Al-Ghazali Islamic philosophy Muhammad al-Mahdi Tarika Safavids Aisha Abbasid Nahj al Balagha Jihad Sahaba's ancestors Bilal ibn Ribah Yusuf al-Qaradawi Nation of Islam Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Kharijites Abdul Qadir Jilani Mahdi Shi'a Imam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shura History of Islam Mohammad Ali Jinnah Basra B__b__s Divisions of Islam Muhammad Ali Saddam Hussein Nikah Mut'ah Imamah Umayyad Religious pluralism Dwight York Twelvers Aurangzeb Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Islamic conquest of Iran Qur'an Fatima Zahra Druze Zaynab bint Ali Aqidah Ba'ath Party Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations Isa Status of religious freedom in Iran Islam and anti-Semitism Zaiddiyah John the Baptist Sindh Islamic religious leaders Hajj Kain (Legacy of Kain) Muslim music Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr Homosexuality and Islam Religion and sexuality Messiah Iranian presidential election, 2005 Yemen Iraq Islam as a political movement Mahdi Army Saqifah Clergy Criticism of Islam
