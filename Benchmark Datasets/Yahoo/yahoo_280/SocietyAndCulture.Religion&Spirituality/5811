anyone seriously wanting to learn about christianity now that i know the goal of certain individuals within yahoo answers r s section http answers yahoo com question index ylt atkrifaqgtser f p i ujzkix qid aahdgsw i have decided to use my time talents and prayers on those individuals seriously wanting to learn about christianity please do not hesitate to ask and i promise to do my best to answer the best answer will be chosen from among those who are wanting to 'learn' about the christian faith all drinking game responses will be ignored by me no more wasting time on those people who are not really wanting to learn about christianity after all logically speaking that is the purpose behind r s questions answers the eternal condition of a person's soul is not a game and should not be treated as one kira it is not what i think feel believe want desire but about what g d says it is his kingdom not our laws i do not want anyone to go to hell that is why i reach out to people if it were up to me everyone on this planet who ever lived in harmony with those around them would be in heaven but it is not up to me you or anyone else it is his will his word his law g d father son and holy spirit is the only one qualified to judge all people he has the right to decide who is or is not a citizen of that kingdom his will be done on earth as it is in heaven notdamonbradley the bible is not a history book or a science book it is only a conduit to spark and build a relationship with g d there are sections of information missing because of that very reason it is not a sequencing of the history of man was meant to be used that way a myth is simply a culture which holds a creation story i think mythology is fascinating g d created all things but he used science to enable creation to take on and run its own course through time and history i do not presume to know the 'exact' amount of time it took for this world and all things in on and around it to form that is where my relationship with g d allows my to accept the discoveries made by scientists while i believe the bible is his truth and the only way to salvation i also know it is just a moral 'compass' not meant as an interference of science or politics faith is between the believer and g d father son and holy spirit his will be done jedi master i am not going to give anyone either thumbs up or down that will be up to others who read each of the responses now the scriptures that you pulled out very interesting that you think sarah is 'actually' abraham's blood relative just because he was passing her off as his sister does not mean she actually was but unfortunatly there are instances in the bible that point to things that can be misunderstood or confusing it is for the believer and nonbeliever to remember we read the bible like any other book through the entire chapter then we understand why those things are included just like in any other piece of literature labgrrl labninja yes this did start as a rant there is no excuse for acting in such manner and i will not attempt to offer up any i know it is not right or necessary to treat others in a manner for which i do not wish to be treated and i thank you for your straightforward honesty hogie a person does not have to be an ordained pastor or hold a degree in theology to answer questions or help others tenets of other denominations heresies and other such things can be found if one is willing to conduct the necessary research g d being the trinity that is an exhaustive subject there are as many differences in beliefs about this as there are christian denominations however there is also a way to search for and learn about all those differences kittykat i don t rely on just one translation having access to a variety including hebrew and greek texts as well as commentaries because i think it is important to gain an understanding of what others have gotten from scripture looking at scripture from many different angles allows for deeper understanding and comprehension i do not and have never relied solely on what my denomination says about the bible you ask a very tough question there are two ways to handle this continue communicating to him how you feel but do it in a caring and loving manner try to avoid making it seem like his way of life is of no value or that everything is his fault if it becomes necessary try taking him with you to talk to your pastor minister religious leader see if private church based counseling will help and finally pray and continue to pray because it is obvious that you love this man very much g d s blessings be with you and your family kitty there is a huge difference between bugs bunny and g d to those who believe in christianity it is not about fictional characters many people believe in g d and daily others come to belief in him if they are truly attempting to grasp an understanding of g d to believe that he is the creator and his son jesus the christ died for their sins what is wrong with me taking the time to answer those questions it is not as though i expect you to answer them jedi master i believe that your question needed further discussion and no i do not block or report others this is here not as a lesson on relationships like marriage but to show us the relationship between abraham g d and the promise given through abraham to all nations this promise is that believers in him g d have a covenant with through and by him that will never be broken and therein lies the meaning behind all of scripture it is not meant as an absolute history or science lesson but only to show situations in which g d gave promises and did not break them this does not mean that the people spoken of were never alive of course they were but an attempt to make connections were there are none is our fallacy once people learn to read the bible in the way it was firstly intended then that would bring about true faith however we all know this will not happen due to our desire to put personal opinions into every aspect of this life as well as the next slowly we are breaking through to some now i block or report people who can't answer without being rude i came here to learn more from christians on this site lately though i see less and less real questions on here and i find myself looking at profiles before answering to see if they are real i am a baby in my faith compared to some and i just enjoy reading answers now more then asking questions god bless
