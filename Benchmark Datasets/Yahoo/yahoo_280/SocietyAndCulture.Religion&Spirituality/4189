why do atheists spend so much time in the religion and spirituality section of yahoo answers if atheists don't believe in god or anything spiritual for that matter why is it they spend so much time asking and answering questions about god religion and spiritual matters this is a sincere question still waiting for an actual thought provoking answer yes i realize this question has been asked before but there are new members of yahoo answers who may have new answers rev tom your answer is more the kind of thoughts i'm looking for but as you can see from some of the answers already to this question a majority of the atheist answers in the r s sections are either glib pot shots or direct insults of believers it's obvious that many of them are not here to discuss opinions ideas etc so my question stands to dummy i've said this once just because this question has been asked doesn't mean all possible answers have been given isn't it possible there are new members to yahoo answers since the last time a similar question was asked and they may have more to offer than the typical atheist insults like yours this is a good question and perhaps those who do spend time here want to express their point of view some people just need to share their ideas and that is ok it helps us to realize that not everyone agrees with our theology that there are some who have not found the same path and have just given up on the whole idea because they have reasoned intellectually that god and his like can all be an unknown and people have given him or whatever a identity how do you explain where you come from besides your mother's womb all knowledge except experiences are based on concepts and beliefs we hold that our religion and our savior are our reality because we choose to believe it they have chosen not to and wish to share that with others if they are asking questions they are either trying to show you a point that they have reasoned out or they are not yet certain that they are right and are still searching for answers to confirm what they think rev tomcat Atheism A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Religion Agnosticism Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin God Meaning of life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Prayer Creationism Philosophy Intelligent design Trinity Friedrich Schleiermacher Infant baptism Philipp Melanchthon Simone Weil Jiddu Krishnamurti Jewish philosophy Christianity Religious pluralism Human nature Afterlife Theology David Hume Free will Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Existence of God Philosophy of language Reality Sexual orientation Heaven Bertrand Russell Jewish principles of faith Past teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Goodness and value theory Deconstruction Urantia Charles Darwin's views on religion Apostasy Human Philosophy of religion Abortion debate Atomism Plame affair Creation-evolution controversy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Strong atheism The relationship between religion and science Fundamentalism Origin belief Hinduism Cultural relativism Immortality Salvation Belief William A.
