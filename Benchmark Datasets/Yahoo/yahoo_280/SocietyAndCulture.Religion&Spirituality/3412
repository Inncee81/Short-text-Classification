does islam allow women to go to masjid salam alikom women are allowed to go to the masjid there is not a single verse in the qur an which prohibits women from entering the mosque and there is no single authentic hadeeth which i know of which states that the prophet pbuh prevented or forbade women from going to the mosque there is only one hadeeth which could be misunderstood to mean that women should not go to the mosque that hadeeth is as follows the prayer of women is better in their house than in the mosque and the prayer of women is better in their rooms than in their house if you base your conclusion only on this single hadeeth then you may wrongly conclude that it is not advisable or preferable for women to go to the mosque as i mentioned earlier your conclusion cannot be based only on one hadeeth neglecting or ignoring all the other ahaadeeth the context of the hadeeth is also very important the prophet pbuh said that if a person prays in the mosque he gets times more blessings sawab some women argued that they had infants at home and other household work and therefore could not go to the mosque thus the men have a greater advantage than women for receiving such blessings it is then that the prophet said the above hadeeth that the prayer of women is better in their house than in the mosque and the prayer of women is better in their rooms than in their house hence the conclusion is that in situations where women have infants and household work which too is an important duty that cannot be neglected women would not be deprived of the sawab blessings if they pray in their own house there are several ahaadeeth which prove that both men and women went to the mosque during the life of the prophet i the prophet said do not prevent the female servants of allaah from going to the mosque of allaah ii and husbands were specifically told by him when your women folk ask you for permission to attend the mosque do not prevent them sahih bukhari volume book of salaah chapter hadith no iii from the time the prophet pbuh entered madeenah after hijra till his demise he never prevented women from entering the mosque iv during the time of the prophet pbuh women not only went to the mosque for prayer but also for religious education and literary discussions as the mosque was the centre of community several ahaadeeth tell us that the prophet pbuh addressed people in the mosque and the audience consisted of both muslim men and women and women many a times asked questions to the prophet pbuh in the mosque v even at the time of hazrat umar r women went to the mosque the famous incident in which a lady from the back seat of the mosque objected to hazrat umar r considering an upper limit to meher is very well known vi during the prophet s pbuh time mosques had separate entrances for ladies women filled the mosques from behind while men had separate entrances and filled the mosques from the front in between the two sections were children who acted as a buffer zone vii it is reported by abu husainah that the prophet pbuh said the best row for men is the first and the worst for them is the last the best row for women is the last and the worst is the first muslim islaam permits women to pray in mosques ladies should have separate and equal facilities islam does not permit the intermingling of sexes otherwise there will be a similar scene in mosques like other places of worship where some people even come for bird watching and eve teasing in recent times women are not allowed in mosques in a very few countries especially in india and the neighbouring countries otherwise in most of the other countries women are allowed in mosques women are allowed in mosques in saudi arabia in u a e in egypt in u s a in
