if one wants to be euthanized what business is that of anyone else it is even legal in holland why don't we just mind our own business and stop judging how others wish to live or end their lives i've thought this way for a while now i believe that everyone has certain rights in their life and none of us chose to be born our parents did whether it was intentional or not since we were given this life we had no control over we should at least be given the option of medically assisted suicide if someone is in so much pain that they want to be euthanized who are we to tell them they shouldn't do it hundreds of people commit suicide on their own each day and hundreds of thousands more want to but don't have it in them should we really make these people suffer within themselves because they have to kill themselves strategically and privately i believe medically assisted suicide should be available of course it wouldn't be just walking into a clinic but if all else fails talking to a psychiatrist taking anti depressants or other medications talking it over and weighing out other options with the doctor why not Euthanasia Suicide Psychiatric hospital Murder Clinical depression Sigmund Freud Lethal injection Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Animal euthanasia Milton H.
