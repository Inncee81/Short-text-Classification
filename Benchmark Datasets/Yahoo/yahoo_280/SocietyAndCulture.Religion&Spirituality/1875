all the stories in the torah were told twice what's the name for this practice i learned this a while ago but forgot can somebody help me please i also cannot remember if it was all the stories in the whole torah or only genesis no that's not what i meant thanks for answering though i read about this in a relgious book i will just keep searching maybe you were write but u misunderstood me i didn't say they were completely dif stories i just said they were told twice and in dif ways but there is a name for it textual divergence i have seen this myself and wondered like a lot of other people what was intended by this almost as if it were a double reality but then most holy men like moses and others tend to have a shamanic split in their psyche it seems to be part of the 'creative' aspect of god and god's servants as far as what books contain the seemingly doubled incidents they are exodus and numbers numbers seems to be the more confrontational detailed and wrathful of the two deuteronomy seems to recombine exodus and numbers into one whole but does not attempt to harmonize the differences the incidents in leviticus are few and tend to be descriptive and specific genesis does not display this peculiarity Torah Bible Documentary hypothesis Creation according to Genesis Korban Biblical canon Judaism Jews as a chosen people Aaron Sukkot Priestly Code Ten Commandments Tanakh Exodus Sabbath Deuteronomy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Moses Kabbalah Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Genesis Midrash Pharisees Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical inerrancy Masoretic Text Guide for the Perplexed Abrahamic religion Shabbat God Names of God in Judaism Torah redactor Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Michael (archangel) Mitzvah Torah study Trinity A Course In Miracles Miracle Mishnah Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Angel Kashrut Witchcraft Karaite Judaism Tetragrammaton Zohar Jacob Religion Jewish views of religious pluralism Qur'an Blacks and Mormonism Jubilees Kohen Old Testament Ark of the Covenant Brit milah Scientology beliefs and practices El (god) Repentance Jeremiah Jacob Neusner Origen Balaam Passover Jewish eschatology Plagues of Egypt Halakha Purim Dispensationalism Sabbatical year (Bible) Sodom and Gomorrah Hospitality Human Maimonides 613 mitzvot Priestly source Divine grace Creationism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Dating the Bible The Bible and history Shamanism Noah Gospel of Mark Yeshu Altar Mishneh Torah Dissociative identity disorder
