christian's who are the nephilim i know the basic bible story but i was wondering what is their theological significance were they evil do you believe any people today are ancestors of these sons of god are they connected to alien activity thx that is a tough one as scripture isn't clear concerning them it seems that some angels in the beginning took on human form and mated with women and a race of giant men came from them the flood wiped them out but some of the strain remained in the genetic pool as goliath and the other sons of anak are recorded as being alive during king david's time there was recently found in israel a skeleton of a man who stood feet tall which bears out scripture references to goliath who stood about that tall the sons of anak were eventually destroyed putting an end to the last of the giants as for the angels who caused all of this jude refers to them when he said jude and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day so the angels that performed this forbidden act are chained in hell to await the great judgment being chained they cannot be part of alien activity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nephilim Angel Demon David Dispensationalism Genesis Apocalypse Fallen angel Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Isaiah Goliath Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Book of Mormon Baptist Deluge (mythology) Rapture Devil Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Abrahamic religion End times Creation according to Genesis Paradise Lost Christian eschatology Last Judgment Jubilees Satan Extraterrestrial life Christianity Giant (mythology) Heaven Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Bible Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions The Pilgrim's Progress Biblical canon Azazel Sodom and Gomorrah Theology Trinity Alan Campbell (pastor) Abraham Sola fide The Amber Spyglass Soul Gargoyles (animated series) Eschatology Priesthood (Mormonism) Book of Enoch Jewish principles of faith Isa Salvation Ten Commandments Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Sabbath King James Version of the Bible Philipp Melanchthon John the Baptist Sin Creationism Jehovah's Witnesses Gospel of Barnabas Leviathan (book) Names of God in Judaism Prophet Prevenient grace Noahide Laws Justification (theology) God Jewish eschatology Adam and Eve Cain StarCraft Secret Missions Judas Iscariot Athanasian Creed Noah's Ark Young Earth creationism Community of Christ History of creationism Race of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Blacks and Mormonism Atheism Thomas (Apostle) Terran (StarCraft) Dinosaur God and gender Apostle Moses Samaritan
