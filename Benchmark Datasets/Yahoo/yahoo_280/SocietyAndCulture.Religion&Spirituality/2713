so even if you aren't a christian can you think of anything nice to say about them any of them and yes there are or of you out there that are gracious enough to do this but really i was wondering even if you don't believe in god can you see any good in what christians are trying to do at all jesus loves you he does sure a lot of them live virtuous lives and try their hardest to make the world a better place most of them think that they are doing the right thing and more importantly most of them do do the right thing in most situations i'm not dismissing christians as bad people i would never do that all of the best people that i know share one thing in common they're christian i just can't reach the same conclusions that they do regarding christ's divinity and god's existence just because i don't agree with them doesn't make them bad people the ironic thing is that is the most common mistake that i've seen christians make still if that's the worst thing that you've done you're better off than a lot of people i love christians on the whole they are good compassionate virtuous people it's just a few bad seeds who sully the name Justification (theology) Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rich Mullins God A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nicomachean Ethics Sin Eastern Orthodox Church Soul Meaning of life Divine grace Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christian anarchism Trinity Eucharist Christianity Evil Gospel of John Biblical inerrancy John Howard Yoder Original sin The nature of God in Western theology Hell Miracle Gospel of Thomas Perseverance of the saints Saint Sola fide Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Aristotle Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Supernatural Moral objectivism Angel Religion End times Love Opus Dei Great Apostasy Fundamentalism Goodness and value theory Christian eschatology Ex-gay Heaven Abraham Ten Commandments Jesus Summa Theologiae Heresy Book of Mormon Josephus on Jesus Capital punishment Religious perspectives on Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christ Karma Christian views of Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus C.
