why do so many christians think that jews killed jesus isn't the bible perfectly clear that it was romans that actually beat him down nailed him to the tree and left him there to die how can you blame jews for this since when did conquored peoples rule the governments and judicial systems of their conquorers please explain this to me i've got my popcorn ready cause i know this should be good robin i am so glad i didn't close this answer earlier i would have missed your wonderful answer thanks you may just have the best answer all locked up yes the romans did all of that but it was pilate who asked the mob which should he let free jesus or oddly enough another jesus barabbas son of the father is what his last name means who was claimed to be a murderer the jews yelled to let the murderer go and crucify jesus the bible also says that the blood is on their heads and their descendants which is against the bible even by jewish standards old test because the son can't carry the sins of the father or can they it says both in the old test everyone uses this to claim the jews killed jesus and blame all jews for what is written one mob did can we now blame all germans for wwii or the italians for the mafia according to this we can the problem i have with this is crucifixion wasn't used as often as some would have us believe and it was only used for those who were traitors to rome not when there was a religious dispute within as you pointed out their conquered peoples thieves like the one crucified next to jesus were normally beated and hanged not crucified and the bible makes it appear that they did this on a lonely hill the romans crucified traitors on roads leading into their cities to warn visitors not to mess with them legend they usually have some truth to them but the truth has been embellished so much that it's hard telling exactly what part of it is truth and considering most of this was written decades after the event i wouldn't place too much trust on the writings to be that accurate anyway people of that time were known for their sensationalism Resurrection of Jesus Pontius Pilate Barabbas Historicity of Jesus Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crucifixion The Passion of the Christ Christian views of Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life Saint Peter Gospel of Barnabas Religious perspectives on Jesus Anti-Semitism Persecution of Christians Cultural and historical background of Jesus Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Chronology of Jesus Names and titles of Jesus Sabbath Creationism Judas Iscariot Herod the Great Joseph of Arimathea Book of Revelation Christian cross History of anti-Semitism Holy Spirit Capital punishment Historical Jesus Religious conversion INRI Antichrist Gospel of Mark Sola fide Unification Church and anti-Semitism Josephus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Messianic Judaism Miracle Book of Mormon Sin History of Greek and Roman Egypt Paul of Tarsus Free will Blood libel against Jews Prophet Apostles' Creed Dispensationalism Acts of the Apostles Yeshu Ten Commandments Judaism Epistle to the Romans Book of Isaiah Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Alan Campbell (pastor) Sin City The Last Temptation of Christ Church of Christ, Scientist Biblical canon End times Timeline of Christianity Historical persecution by Christians Sanhedrin David Trinity Josephus on Jesus Jerusalem Bible Apocrypha The Da Vinci Code Theory of conduct Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christian apologetics Divine grace Book of Daniel Apologetics Pharisees Slow Train Coming Jew Original sin Jews in the Middle Ages Second Coming God Odin Vlad III Dracula John Howard Yoder Michael (archangel) Christian anarchism
