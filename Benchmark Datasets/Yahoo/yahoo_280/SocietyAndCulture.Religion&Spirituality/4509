what if you were born to a dumb religion family and found out it's a dumb tradition will you still give the dumb cataloge and uniform to your children open minded parents who are certain of their own faiths let their children when they reach a level of maturity and start having interest in other religions to read and explore i lived in a conseravtive muslim family it never was in the way of reading about others or mixing with them i never felt threatened or confused when it came to religion as long as you avoid the weirdos who try to convert you by force and who actually make you hate their religions you'll be fine extremists from my religion or christians or jews or others are the ones i try to avoid as for dumb it is very much disrespectful and immature to call other religions as dumb just because you don't believe in them it also gives us a bad impression about your beliefs i'd rather be around those you call dumb if they are civil than be around the likes of you never liked rude people Ten Commandments Religious conversion Religion Judaism Messianic Judaism Nation of Islam Idolatry Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fundamentalism Christianity Islam Who is a Jew?
