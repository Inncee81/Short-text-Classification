a question for those who believe in a loving god do you ever give any serious thought as to why the natural order is based entirely on death all life on earth is forced to feed on each other it literally is a world of kill or be killed if the cheetah doesn't kill the gazelle the cheetah will starve to death one of them must die painfully there's no way around it where's the love in that you have some great logic to your thinking but what your thinking is that god is human please correct me if i am wrong if so god is not and his love is stronger more patient than we will ever know in our lives on this earth it is beyond us and why god choses the things he does is his way of guiding us to listen and trust him i personally don't see god as being mean or unfair this is my personal opinion of course but there are a lot of examples in the bible that may seem mean and harsh but are merely god's way of getting his point across because people aren't obedient i also think that what a person gives to god such as unconditional trust and love does come back to them all in due time i hope i have helped Theory of conduct Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meaning of life God A Course In Miracles Evil Justification (theology) Social rule John Howard Yoder Sola fide Current teachings of Prem Rawat Soul Creationism Scouting Past teachings of Prem Rawat Summa Theologiae Agnosticism Duties of the Heart Simone Weil Ten Commandments Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Charles Grandison Finney Krelian Sin Calvinism Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design Religion Epistemology Jewish principles of faith Biblical inerrancy Immortality Rich Mullins Goodness and value theory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Problem of Hell Capital punishment Alignment (role-playing games) Love Human Christian eschatology Book of Isaiah Urantia Incarnations of Immortality David Hume Leviathan (book) Divine Providence Paradox Euphemism Trinity Presuppositional apologetics Christian anarchism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salvation Altruism The Death Gate Cycle Ontological argument Socrates Free will Year of the Spider The Amber Spyglass George Fox Agap__ Friedrich Schleiermacher Infant baptism Religious Society of Friends Value system Ethics Utilitarianism John Wycliffe John Wesley Storytelling Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Muslim ibn Aqeel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Transcendental argument for the existence of God Origin belief Angel Sanctuary Cheetah Kain (Legacy of Kain) Time Out of Mind The Pilgrim's Progress Idolatry Perseverance of the saints Sermon on the Mount Historicity of Jesus Bhakti Property (ownership right) Aristotle
