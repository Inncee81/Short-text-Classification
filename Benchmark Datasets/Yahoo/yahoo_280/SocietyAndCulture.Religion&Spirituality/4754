if there is no hell in judaism why was it necessary for the biblical god to sacrifice himself to himself the existence of the afterlife is not stated explicitly in the torah itself because as human beings we have to focus on our task in this world though awareness of an eternal reward can also be an effective motivator so what does that tell you about the new testament could it be just man made fiction jesus is not the g d of the tanakh old testament and the idea of g d becomming a man is blasphemy along with g d getting sacrificed all this is from mithra and greek paganism as you pasted judaism focuses on this life while christians try to scare people with the idea that they will burn in hell unless they accept jesus jews believe that everyone goes to heaven jew and non jew and that there is a place similar to purgatory where you review your life and see your mistakes and how you could have lived a better life then enter heaven the books in the new testament were written long after jesus died and at times included more books and fewer books before it's current list of books so it is obvious the books were chosen for political reasons Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abrahamic religion Hell Jesus Jewish eschatology Judaism Christian eschatology Divine grace Old Testament Trinity Prophet Soul Afterlife Sin God Angel Christianity Ten Commandments Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Jewish principles of faith Heaven Sacrifice Genesis Pharisees Satan Christianity and anti-Semitism Religious perspectives on Jesus Jewish views of religious pluralism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Torah Religious pluralism Demon Salvation Historicity of Jesus Gospel of Thomas Bible and reincarnation Jews as a chosen people Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Reincarnation Purgatory Tetragrammaton Apocrypha Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Messianic Judaism Heresy Sabbath Noahide Laws Book of Revelation Cultural and historical background of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Religious conversion Historical persecution by Christians Justin Martyr Kabbalah Apocalypse Creation according to Genesis Atheism Tanakh Paul of Tarsus Predestination Korban Baptism Moses Resurrection Mormonism and Judaism Chosen people Creationism History of the English Bible End times Eastern Orthodox Church Capital punishment History of Christianity Merit Nahmanides Names of God in Judaism Christian Zionism Religious views of suicide Roman Catholic Church Islam and Judaism Theodicy New Testament view on Jesus' life Great Apostasy Samaritan New Testament Miracle Harrowing of Hell Jewish Messiah
