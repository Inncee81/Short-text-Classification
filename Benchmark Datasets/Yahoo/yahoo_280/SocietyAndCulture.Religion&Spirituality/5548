why don't baptists dance i am a member of a southern baptist church in midwest usa and have been for years i got married there dedicated my babies there but i still have one question that has gone unanswered what is the whole thing about baptists not dancing my personal church kinda talks about it as a joke but as we were planning our wedding we were told we could have our reception at the church but that we wouldn't be allowed to have dancing this was serious does anyone know what scripture baptist churches use to back up by dancing is wrong evil sinful is it their opinion that all forms are or just certain types i have attempted to research this on the internet but have come up short the bible doesn't give specific instructions on dancing so i'll point out some examples of good and bad dancing and then mention some biblical principles to build dancing standards on here goes exodus this is a disappointing part of israel's history while moses was up on the mountain talking to god the israelites built an idol in the process of the idol worship they began to dance this ended up in revelry v and being out of control v says naked in some translations in this case dancing led to very sinful activity in exodus mentioned above miriam was dancing to celebrate the victory god's power had brought at the red sea samuel david danced before the lord to celebrate the ark of the covenant being brought back to jerusalem every instance of dancing that is not considered sinful was done in worship or praise to god here are some more principles to keep in mind in considering dancing ecclesiastes there is an appropriate time to dance and inversely an inappropriate time to dance psalm both passages mention that we can praise or worship god through dance corinthians our bodies belong to god and are the temple of the holy spirit so everything we do must be honoring to him dancing to bring attention to yourself or your body therefore would be sinful corinthians the writer says it is good for a man not to touch a woman see new american or king james for this translation as niv says marry instead paul was acknowledging that men have a very strong sex drive that is easy to set off because of this many styles of pair dancing outside of marriage can be very tempting especially to the man timothy flee as in run away from the evil desires of youth any dancing that stirs up sinful desires in yourself or others participating is sinful matthew doing something that might cause someone else to stumble into sin is considered absolutely inexcusable dancing in a way that would cause someone else to lust would fall under this guideline thessalonians this is a great rule of thumb if you're not sure if a dancing situation is o k it says avoid every kind of evil if it even looks like it could be sinful don't do it in the end there is a lot of dancing that is inappropriate for believers who should be trying to glorify god with their lives and especially their bodies yet the bible acknowledges that you can dance in a way that does not tempt others does not tempt yourself and brings glory to god i hope these guidelines and examples will help you to set godly standards recommended resource balancing the christian life by charles ryrie Angel Baptist Book of Isaiah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian eschatology Baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Biblical inerrancy Infant baptism Roman Catholic Church Homosexuality and Christianity Mary, the mother of Jesus Mormonism and Judaism Sola fide Original sin John the Baptist Priesthood (Mormonism) Great Apostasy Prophet Abrahamic religion Eucharist Binitarianism Christian views of women Sin History of Christianity Alan Campbell (pastor) God and gender Book of Mormon Trinity Exodus Names of God in Judaism Holy Spirit Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pharisees Soul Evil Resurrection of Jesus Temple (Mormonism) Jewish principles of faith Endowment (Mormonism) Hell Salvation Temple in Jerusalem Creation according to Genesis Demon Noahide Laws Gospel of Thomas Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Mormonism and Christianity Christianity Jesus Authorship of the Pauline epistles Catechism Idolatry in Christianity Calvinism Divine grace Mass (liturgy) Covenant Theology Christian views of Jesus Rapture Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Noah Justification (theology) Korban Martin Luther 613 mitzvot Icon Rastafari movement Theology Jerusalem Apocalyptic literature Sukkot Apocrypha Catholicism
