what is the best way to ministe to the transgendered community the bible tells us to go and minister to every one how would you go about ministering to a person who is transgendered the bible says that we are to remain in the state of our calling but what if the person has taken the opposite sex's hormones and now looks like the opposite sex or what if all they have left is the gender reassignment surgery or what if they had gone through with the surgery how do you minister to them how do you deal with the marriage and family issues i am not looking for put downs or sarcastic comments this is how we can do it like jesus would in all love dueteronomy says a man is not to wear women's clothing nor is a woman to wear men's clothing all that do such are abominations to the lord everyone is a human being and deserving to be treated as one but everyone also has a soul and a spirit and because of this they require ministry just as the physical body does this presents a very sad state of affairs to minister to someone who is in this situation for when a person receives christ their spirit is reborn and made perfect in christ and their mind is to be renewed by the written word of god and they become the man or woman of god to which they are called to show forth the glorious work that god has done for them to the world but when one man or woman who has had these changes to their body and then have the right spirit place in them at salvation they begin to think and act as a normal man or woman yet in a different body sexually can they or should they try and undo what has already been done to their body i would in my own opinion say no but one must do as the holy spirit leads them after conversion maybe they will bring god glory by their own testimony in ministering to those who are thinking about such changes in their body and help them to understand that it is what is on the inside that matters most and to be made perfect in christ jesus there is no need to change anything but one heart Transgender Transsexuality Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Soul Homosexuality and Christianity Eucharist Church of Christ, Scientist Baptism Salvation Eastern Orthodox Church Gender identity disorder Sexual orientation Trinity Original sin God and gender Sabbath Church of Christ Merit Summa Theologiae Book of Mormon Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Priesthood (Mormonism) Transvestism Legal aspects of transsexualism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Angel Divine grace Ten Commandments Mortification of the flesh Holy Spirit Christian eschatology Athanasian Creed Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Articles of Religion (Methodist) Gay slang A Course In Miracles Charles Grandison Finney Religious Society of Friends Book of Isaiah Mass (liturgy) God Ordination of women Simone Weil Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Gender role Sin Protestantism Same-sex marriage in the United States Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Gender identity Children of God Adam-God theory Perseverance of the saints Mormonism and Christianity John the Baptist Calvinism Christ Catholicism Heteronormativity Prophet Infant baptism Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sex Richard Allen (reverend) Holy Orders Cross-dressing George Fox God the Father Binitarianism Jehovah's Witnesses New Testament Opus Dei Christian views of Jesus Free will Sex assignment Catechism Clerical celibacy Philipp Melanchthon Predestination John Wycliffe Christian mysticism Heaven Alan Campbell (pastor) John Wesley Paul of Tarsus Salvation Army New Testament view on Jesus' life
