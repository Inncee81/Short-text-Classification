atheists and non believers what is your definition of sin and are you for or against it no i'm asking for you to explain what you think sin is arn't crimes mistakes errors in judgment a way of defining the same thing why does the word 'sin' elicit such a negative response i'm no longer religious but i feel that at least from a religious viewpoint your question is very important why should we and indeed how can we obey a deity's rules if we do not understand their purpose similarly a parent does best if it explains its reasoning to its children when it develops rules sin from the perspective of many religions is that which gets in the way of our union with a higher force be it god allah krishna etc the rules are guidelines to help us make that connection more easily and to lead us away from so called deceptive paths that merely perpetuate the ego and that is another important aspect of sin the self if we are selfish we are not selfless which by the teachings of many religions is key to spirituality because it is inseparable from universal love as i have seen many sins are those things that keep one stuck within the sense of ego i e those that seek personal pleasure alone of course many rules do seem superfluous clearly products of their cultural upbringing but when people try to cast these away others get worked up citing infallibility of the text i wish people would see those books as guides rather than textbooks furthermore there is no proof for the supernatural outside of personal experience which most of us lack therefore the advantages of living a sinless life are hard to pin down i do recognize how the rules can be helpful but it is important to note how they can be harmful not only when they have blind adherents who refuse to question but when they are followed so strictly that compassion and understanding of others are lost as a non believer i don't put much thought into this sin business as it is almost always linked to some reward in the afterlife and or a god concept i am neither for it as i recognize that it can harm us nor against it as i also recognize that it can help us depending on which set of rules you're following Atheism God A Course In Miracles Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jewish principles of faith Theodicy Evil Supernatural Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Simone Weil Soul Religious pluralism Roman Catholic Church Friedrich Schleiermacher Coercion Meaning of life Idolatry Existence of God Predestination Resurrection of Jesus Goodness and value theory Moral objectivism Religious conversion Past teachings of Prem Rawat Satanism Karma Intelligent design movement S__ren Kierkegaard Judaism Human Intelligent design Reincarnation Theology Love Religious Society of Friends Devil Ten Commandments Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Creation-evolution controversy Charles Grandison Finney Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Duties of the Heart Eastern Orthodox Church Abrahamic religion Islam Buddhism Al-Ghazali Biblical inerrancy Baptism Yoga Immortality Happiness Merit Afterlife Divine grace Apostasy Jesus Prophet Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bhagavad Gita Meme Opus Dei Objectivist philosophy Cult Liberal Christianity Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Brahman Origin belief Evolutionary creationism Hell Patriotism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Evangelicalism Sufism Agnosticism Saint Spirituality Justification (theology) Young Earth creationism Transactional analysis Exorcism Deity Religion and mythology
