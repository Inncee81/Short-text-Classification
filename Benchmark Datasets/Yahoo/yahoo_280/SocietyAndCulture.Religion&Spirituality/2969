where in the bible does it state holidays like christmas i know many christians who observe this holiday which is pagan in nature but i can't find anywhere in the bible where christ says to celebrate his birth true christians wouldn't celebrate this holiday since god warned believers to not follow the traditions of man if you are fully convinced that you cannot in good conscience observe a particular christmas tradition do not observe it if you are fully convinced that a particular tradition is too steeped in paganism to honor god in any way by all means forsake that tradition at the same time if you are fully convinced that you can honor and worship god through a particular tradition honor and worship god romans for christians christmas traditions can be an important part of the celebration of the birth of our savior and they remind us of that momentous event that changed the world forever more importantly they bring to mind the miracle of new birth he created in us when he came into our hearts saved us from our sins and made us children of god by the shedding of his blood on the cross colossians it is this amazing truth that enables us to say with the angels glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men luke recommended resource god's gift of christmas by john macarthur Sabbath Christmas Jesus Christian views of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Salvation A Course In Miracles Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Prophet Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Liturgical year Dispensationalism Infant baptism Divine grace Christianity Biblical Magi Church of Christ Religion Book of Isaiah New Testament Holy Spirit Baptism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Justification (theology) Icon Santa Claus Sola fide Perseverance of the saints Abrahamic religion Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Roman Catholic Church Jehovah's Witnesses God Eucharist Christianization Binitarianism Easter Great Apostasy Miracle Religious Society of Friends Baptist Summa Theologiae Heaven Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Theodicy Sacrifice Mass (liturgy) History of Christianity Paul of Tarsus Religious perspectives on Jesus Idolatry in Christianity Canonization End times Repentance Catholicism Saint Nicholas Mormonism and Christianity Calvinism Jerusalem Book of Revelation Names and titles of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Herbert W.
