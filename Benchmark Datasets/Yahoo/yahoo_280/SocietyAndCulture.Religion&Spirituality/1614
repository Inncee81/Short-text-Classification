non christians what is your biggest problem with the bible please note this is to non christians so i really don't need to hear how it's a wonderful book perfect in every way i'm curious about fellow unbelievers was it something specific was it issues with internal contradictions or contradictions with science history etc did it have anything to do with the morality of the bible and if so which bits thanks for your responses the bible has manmade written all over it one of the obvious giveaways is yahweh's fixation on one little tribe to the exclusion of a whole world yahweh adopts that tribe as his special people and he leads them in bloody little wars against their neighbors that is to say yahweh acts no differently than chemosh the god of the moabites or baal the storm god of the canaanites or dagon or any of the other chief tribal gods in the neighborhood each of these primitive gods is concerned with one little tribe because each was manufactured by that tribe as a personification of nature it never occurred to the ancients to question the morality exhibited by their gods the fearful forces of nature spoke powerfully and man listened who could question the power of lightning or the thumping of giant hailstones or the strength of floods it never occurred to the ancients that a truly powerful god would not have to act in such clumsy ways for nature was the only god they knew it never occurred to the ancients that a truly wise and powerful god would communicate face to face with each man or woman rather than through nebulous dreams divinations or later vague scriptures and obscure answers to personal supplication the gods of nature never spoke openly but rather in whispers and dreams and omens or so the ancients perceived it never occurred to them that their gods should be concerned with the well being of all peoples including their troublesome neighbors gods in those days were tribal gods including yahweh they concerned themselves only with their particular tribes on taking the bible and noah's flood literally dave matson the oak hill free press on a clear night look up at the sky look beyond the stars and into the great void are those trillions upon trillions of galaxies out there stretching across inconceivable distances each bearing billions of suns that support countless worlds created for the sake of man alone would a rancher carefully prepare acres in order to house a few ants of course not but religious conceit and the human ego know no bounds and many people further believe that god is only interested in their little tribe or religious sect out of a whole world of humanity such conceit just boggles the mind a god smart enough to design a living world and powerful enough to set galaxies into motion would have interests as wide as the universe itself all of humanity would come equally under the caring hand of such a deity there would be no special people or sect and you would never catch such a god leading one tribe in vicious little wars against its neighbors as though he were a school boy at play since the new testament is based on the old at least according to the authors of the gospels and since the old testament is built around yahweh and since yahweh is clearly a tribal god the working brain immediately concludes that the bible is a manmade work God Angel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Creationism Tetragrammaton Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Creation according to Genesis Documentary hypothesis Prophet Biblical inerrancy Book of Isaiah Trinity New Testament Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Devil Jewish principles of faith Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Book of Revelation Biblical canon Christianity Noah A Course In Miracles Religious pluralism Bible Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Predestination Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Fundamentalism Genesis Sabbath Resurrection of Jesus Idolatry Young Earth creationism Abrahamic religion Book of Malachi History of creationism Homosexuality and Christianity Existence of God Friedrich Schleiermacher Abraham Religious Society of Friends Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prayer Evolutionary creationism Maya mythology El (god) Cultural and historical background of Jesus Names of God in Judaism Mormonism and Judaism Historicity of Jesus Henotheism Historical Jesus Hell Theodicy Roman Catholic Church End times Free will Origin belief Acts of the Apostles Canaan Simone Weil Leviathan (book) Taoism Witchcraft Book of Mormon Book of Amos Judaism Urantia Philo Charles Darwin's views on religion Nephilim The Bible and history God and gender Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Modern geocentrism Book of Joshua Jesus Legalism (theology) Theology Dispensationalism Soul Atheism Moses Satan Book of Zephaniah Magic (paranormal) Intelligent design movement Alan Campbell (pastor) Demon Deluge (mythology)
