bible question what was practiced back then when the bible was written and now we dont do that anymore example it was ok to have slaves we dont do that it was ok to stone people to death in america we dont do that women were not ordained or became ministers but today they are they used to sacrifice lambs for god today we dont do that who decides what we do and dont do hi and good morning mm first of all you need to remember that the laws back then and the peoples cultures were quite different than of today although in some middle east countries some of their laws have not changed thru the centuries their laws weren't guidlelines from the 'holy bible' but their own laws of the land so do speak god didn't believe in slavery why do you think he helped moses and his people jesus didn't condone 'stoning' why do you think he stopped the people from stoning mary magdelene this was the laws of the land not the laws of the bible now yes' god did perhaps have his people sacrifice lambs this was maybe like an offering to god but in today's world we offer money which was scarce in the biblical times god wrote down his 'ten commandments' for his children to obey in regards to have good morals and ethics in life to make all of us a better person and to worship our 'father' one has to realize that what occured back in biblical times will change through the sands of time cultures change laws change people change and with it the bible one must take the bible and read it with the conception of today's world there are gods laws and then there is the laws of man society had taken the 'laws of god' and made their laws for us to obey to where there would be order in the land we don't sacrifice due to the man made laws this would also include 'stoning' for punishment we use to stone the 'wicked' but society has changed and with it the laws have changed in america they did use to stone people to death during the 's now of course they don't you need to adjust the bible with today's era a lot of the laws and rules were due to the roman empire back then so you have to take that into consideration and because we live in a society today that has changed in views laws and cultures hope this has helped have a wonderful day Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pharisees Bible Moses Judaism Sacrifice Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Genesis Homosexuality and Christianity Divine grace Sin Book of Joshua Abraham Exodus New Testament Book of Isaiah Eastern Orthodox Church God Korban 613 mitzvot Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Sabbath Holy Spirit Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jehovah's Witnesses Old Testament Clergy Christianity Clerical celibacy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible End times Church of Christ Jewish principles of faith Separation of church and state Religious Society of Friends Religious conversion Religion Jeremiah Tithe Slavery Prophet Summa Theologiae Mary, the mother of Jesus Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Christianity Christian anarchism Resurrection of Jesus Halakha Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Baptism Mitzvah Prophets of Islam Marriage Cultural and historical background of Jesus Predestination Human sacrifice Jew Book of Mormon Satan Ethics in the Bible Fundamentalism Polygamy Dispensationalism Catholicism New Testament view on Jesus' life Binding of Isaac John Howard Yoder Priestly Code A Course In Miracles Religion and sexuality Eucharist Sola fide Repentance Goodness and value theory Temple in Jerusalem Shema Yisrael Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Zoroastrianism Jewish views of religious pluralism Capital punishment Nation of Islam Cain Blacks and Mormonism Samaritan Balaam Mission (Christian) Biblical studies Jesus Original sin
