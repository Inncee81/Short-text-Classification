atheists really agnostic to say categorically there is no god is to make an absolute statement for the statement to be true i must know for certain that there is no god in the entire universe no human being has all knowledge therefore none of us is able to truthfully make this assertion if you insist upon disbelief in god what you must say is having the limited knowledge i have at present i believe that there is no god owing to a lack of knowledge on your part you don't know if god exists so in the strict sense of the word you cannot be an atheist the only true qualifier for the title is the one who has absolute knowledge so wouldn't you be agnostic one who claims he doesn't know if god exists on the other hand i understand that christians to claim that god does exist for the statement to be true i must know for certain that there is a god in the universe no human being has all knowledge therefore none of us is able to truthfully make this assertion so now that you know that i know that my beliefs are questionable too please just answer the question so in the strict sense of the word you cannot be an atheist the only true qualifier for the title is the one who has absolute knowledge so wouldn't you be agnostic one who claims he doesn't know if god exists or are you all knowing please correct me if i am wrong i would really like to understand your platform patricia i never claimed that there were no atheists only searched for an explination of how atheist can claim to be atheist without being all knowing nobody has full knowledge christians atheist agnostics muslims nobody i'm not saying that only atheists lack knowledge excellent answer but notice how many don't really affirm what you are saying so they are holding onto some type of faith of their own you have managed to rip their logic to shreds and yet they continue on i haven't met a super human yet they all seem to be pretty much the same screwed up human form like me i have always said it atheism is just as much a religion as anything else because none of us has an answer that is indisputably true so they the anti religious and atheists are as militant as the religions that they bash Agnosticism Religion Strong atheism God The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Creationism Theodicy Christianity Fundamentalism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Jewish principles of faith Supernatural The relationship between religion and science Biblical inerrancy Predestination Afterlife Evolutionary creationism Nontheism Epistemology David Hume Charles Darwin's views on religion Nihilism Meaning of life Christian apologetics Goodness and value theory Separation of church and state Apostasy Alcoholics Anonymous Monotheism Creation-evolution controversy Religious pluralism Intelligent design Problem of Hell Deity Miracle Liberal Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philosophical skepticism Faith Jewish philosophy Ontological argument Pledge of Allegiance Philosophy of religion Summa Theologiae Truth New Testament Friedrich Schleiermacher Judaism Trinity A Course In Miracles History of creationism Theory of conduct Islamic philosophy Pascal's Wager Reconstructionist Judaism Apologetics Islam Intelligent design movement Belief Falsifiability Sin Kuzari Presuppositional apologetics Freethought Simone Weil Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions William A.
