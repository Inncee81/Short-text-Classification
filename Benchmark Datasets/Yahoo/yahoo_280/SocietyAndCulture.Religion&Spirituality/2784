creationists is this what you understand about mutation rates gene mutations result in new alleles and are the source of variation within populations gene mutations are ultimately behind the other mechanisms that provide variation due to dna replication and dna repair mechanisms mutation rates of individual genes are low but since each organism has many genes and a population has many individuals new mutations arise in populations all the time so mutations are relatively common and the mutation rate is an adequate source of new alleles high levels of molecular variation are common in natural populations although many mutations usually recessive are hidden the mutation rate varies greatly among species and even among genes of an individual mutations are caused by errors in dna replication chemicals or radiation large scale effects of mutation result only when mutation is combined with other factors that reshuffle the gene pool selection acts on individuals not their individual genes sexual reproduction increases variation by reshuffling the genetic information from parents into new combinations in their offspring mutations produce new alleles this is what you call evolutionists are actually talking about but is it the same as what you're talking about lol thanks for the laugh hypnopope a very apt analogy lol this is like explaining advanced theoretical physics to lemurs Reproduction Evolution of sex Species DNA repair Genetics Cancer Senescence DNA Neutral theory of molecular evolution Small population size Biology Genetic drift Genetic recombination Price equation Meme Genetic algorithm Androgen insensitivity syndrome Epigenetic inheritance Y chromosome Genetic engineering Lac operon HIV Carcinogenesis Junk DNA Biology and sexual orientation Heterozygote advantage Reverse genetics History of evolutionary thought Ionizing radiation Modern evolutionary synthesis Human Hardy-Weinberg principle Race in biomedicine Extinction Transposon Cell growth Meiosis Barbara McClintock Race Biodiversity Selection Cell (biology) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder P53 Francis Crick Genetic code Genetic disorder Prion Memetics Genetic linkage Alzheimer's disease Isozyme The Selfish Gene Human Genome Project Sexual selection Glucokinase Randomness Trait Recessive gene Gene therapy Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Colorectal cancer Sickle-cell disease Genetic screen Mendelian inheritance Haemophilia Intelligence quotient Scientific method Polycystic kidney disease Mesothelioma Cat coat genetics International HapMap Project Morphogenesis Ataxia telangiectasia Intelligent design Puberty Eugenics Determinism Human cloning Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids
