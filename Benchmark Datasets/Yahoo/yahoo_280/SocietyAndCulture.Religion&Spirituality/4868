i just read god is love because he gave his only son to you where is the logic here god either killed his son had him killed or let him be killed as a blood sacrifice for my sins whaaaoo partner there was no need for that biblical psycho babble aside where is logic can anyone give us a coherent explanation as to how god making a human sacrifice of his son would save the souls of all who worship him his creation please i asked for a coherent answer you're babbling spit out the marbles adorehim asks why would i say there was no need for god to kill his son what i meant was i don't want anyone dying a miserable death on my behalf especially if it doesn't make any sense if some guy walked up to me on the street poured gasoline over his head then told me he was about to light himself on fire to save my soul i'd do my damnedest to talk him out of it some of us atheists are nice like that exactly god first decides to make some strange laws that people have to follow and some even stranger ways to atone for breaking those laws killing animals in 'sacrifice' to him then he realizes that's not a very good way to atone so he decided to have one last big sacrifice and kills his son or himself depending on who is telling the story this god is supposedly perfect why did he go about this convoluted path that required this human sacrifice it only makes sense if you think like a primitive from the stone age believe that gods would be interested in blood sacrifice i'll only believe in such a god if it comes and proves itself to me i would need very solid proof to believe in such a twisted myth Sacrifice Sin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Korban 613 mitzvot Ten Commandments Justification (theology) Deluge (mythology) A Course In Miracles Salvation The Amber Spyglass God Infant baptism The nature of God in Western theology Original sin Jewish principles of faith Charles Grandison Finney The Death Gate Cycle Theory of conduct Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Blood atonement Divine grace Resurrection of Jesus God Emperor of Dune Reincarnation Origin belief Immortality Simone Weil Phaedo Religious conversion Limited atonement Sola fide Sin City Summa Theologiae Ontological argument Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Soul Angel Sanctuary Trinity Sabbath Moloch Eastern Orthodox Church Paradise Lost Articles of Religion (Methodist) Socrates Christian eschatology Miracle John Wesley Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Urantia Historical persecution by Christians Sant Mat Creationism Determinism Existence of God Noah Utilitarianism The Subtle Knife Supernatural Creation according to Genesis Amidah Atheism Causality Ethics in the Bible Plagues of Egypt YuYu Hakusho David Hume Abraham Purgatory Baptism Shaggy dog story Atomism The Lovely Bones David Animism Kain (Legacy of Kain) Odin Cultural and historical background of Jesus Age of Mythology Duties of the Heart Storytelling Christianity Jewish views of religious pluralism Predestination Calvinism Kohen True Crime: Streets of LA Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible
