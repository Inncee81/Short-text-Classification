jesus cannot save you only god can correct corinthians when all things are subjected to him then the son himself also will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him so that god may be all in all please don't follow paul follow jesus follow god the concept of the saviour is silly how can you believe that all the wrong that you do purposfully will be paid for you by jesus when jesus himself will be judged on judgment day the innocent doesn't die for the guily if you believe that god is a just god then you cannot believe that he sent his son to die and pay for our sins romans because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen worship god he is your creator not jesus he is your judge not jesus he is your saviour not jesus jesus wants us to worship god he doesn't want us to call him god but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father mark and matt but god knows all his knowledge is without any limitations that jesus of his own admission did not know when the day of judgement would be is clear proof that jesus is not all knowing and that jesus is therefore not god verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do john again he said i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgement is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me john but god is not only all powerful he is also the source of all power and authority that jesus of his own admission could do nothing on his own is clear proof that jesus is not all powerful and that therefore jesus is not god i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god john he is also reported to have cried out while on the cross my god my god why hast thou forsaken me matt if jesus were god then couldn't this be read myself myself why hast thou forsaken me would that not be pure nonsense when jesus prayed the lord's prayer luke was he praying to himself when in the garden of gethsemane he prayed o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt matt was jesus praying to himself that jesus of his own admission and by his own actions acknowledged worshipped and prayed to another being as god is clear proof that jesus himself is not god no man hath seen god at any time john ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape john he also said in john god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth that jesus would say that no one had seen or heard god at any time while his followers both saw and heard him is clear proof that jesus was not god my father is greater than i when someone referred to him as a good master in luke jesus responded why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god furthermore jesus drew clear distinctions between himself and god when he said i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me john jesus gave clear evidence of his subordination to god rather than his equality with god when he said in luke not my will but thine be done and in john i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me only you can save you Merit Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the
