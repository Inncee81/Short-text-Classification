muslims should i believe the words of the prophets or the qu'ran moses said a prophet must be in agreement with the prophets and the word of god moses said there was a tree of life in the midst of the garden moses said god said let us create man in our image then god created man with more than flesh but with an eternal spirit and these became a living soul abraham said the lord would provide himself a lamb isaiah said the messiah would atone for sin john the baptist said behold the lamb of god jesus agreed with the prophesy of isaiah and said he was this messiah and he would fufill this prophesy one muslim said to be a good muslim one must agree with the prophets of god and the qu'ran how can a man agree with the prophets of god and the qu'ran hello i quoted the prophets of god and these same words were available to muhammad if the qu'ran is in agreement with the prophets of god why do these prophets teach the very things the qu'ran rejects egypt t it is good to disagree with god's prophets i am sorry but not accoprding to the god of abrham that allah claims to be and i believe even the qu'ran claims to be in agreement with the prophets of god moses taught all prophets logicly would agree with each other how could a prophet disagree with god and still be a prophet of god hujan you are coming very close to saying muhammad is god now you say muhammad's message is making clear my bible and i say this can not be the word of god is not ina greement wiht the word of allah jesus is the son of god and says he is how does denying his words make his words more clear yaz you say that the mesage of the prophets is god is one this is not the only message of the prophets of god i have written some of the words of the prophets for you and tehse words are avialable to you and were avaialble to muhammad now how does muhamamd agree with these prophets does muhamamd and the qu'ran agree that jesus is the son of god who atoned for sin jesus said he was isaiah said he was and abraham said he was how does the qu'ran agree mallak glad you answered now again does the qu'ran agree with these words of the prophets zif not you can not be a good muslim as you answered a question saying a good muslim must agree with the prophets of god and the qu'ran this is what prompted this question do you agree with the words of moses abraham isaiah john the baptist and jesus if youd o not believe that the messiah atoned for sin you are not in agreement with these prophets humble god did not directly talk to muhamamd god does not need to directly speak to a prophet but all prophets must be in agreement and muhamamd and the qu'ran are not in agreement with the prophets of god humble read the words of the prophets you speak of they do not agree wiht the qu'ran do not simply believe because muhamamd says he agrees with them read their actual words and see if muhamamd is in agreement with abrham or moses or isaiah or jesus i assure you theya re not in agreement with muhamamd or the qu'ran all you ahve to do is read the words of the prophets bhola so i could claim to be a prophet of god and disagree with all scripture and yet still claim to be a prophet of god who is in agrement with the other prophets of god sir a prophet is required by god to be in agreement with god and the word of god and the prophets of god this is from the first scriptures god gave to man and is throughout the word of god allah is suposed to be the god of abraham right the god of abraham says a prophet must be in agreement did muhamamd over throw god and change the rules is it the god of abraham you worship or muhamamd merosh john jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him jesus spoke of false prophets but did not mention muhammad by name only that those who do not believe in him are of the spirit of anti christ sincere i appeciate your kind words but i do have a persaonla realtionship wiht the true god and i am in agreement wiht all fo god's prophets and do realize that the word of god is protected by god in its truth god does not allow man to make his word a lie and all the prophets of god thoughout thousands of years are in agreement and in agreement with the word of god the true god of abrham does not allow a prophet to deny his word or to disagree with his prophets now allahs says he is the god of abraham but does not follow the ways of the god of abraham if islam is correct then god is confused good point my friend the quran conflicts with many things the old testament prophets prophesied and as you can see from the muslim responses they clearly ignore that point they have to ignore that because if they said they recognize it then they would be admitting publicly that muhammed is a 'false' prophet and all their muslim buddies would kill them its a self preservation thing ya know Paul of Tarsus New Testament Perseverance of the saints Ezekiel Names and titles of
