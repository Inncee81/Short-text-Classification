in ancient jewish law were adopted children thought to have the same right to inherit were they considered to have come from the line of the adoptive father i would like to know about ancient jewish law thank you no a child is considered to be a son of his natural father only there is no concept of adoption in judaism this is very clearly illustrated in the talmud in the areas where it discusses who can eat the various types of holy offerings only edible by the kohanim priests descendents of aaron and levi'im rest of the tribe of levi not descended from aaron thus kedoshim and terumos are only allowed to be eaten by a kohen his children and his kosher wife a kohen who marries a divorcee or convert loses his right to eat terumos and kedoshim as does his wife even if she was born a kohen if she had children from another marriage that lived with them those children unless their father was a kohen were not allowed to eat terumos and kedoshim similarly they did not inherit any portion of the mother's husband only from the estate of their own father similarly for levi'im and the eating of m'asoros we also see it in the laws of land inheritance where the land is divided between the natural sons of the father only and not any others another area where this is highlighted is that in the shmittah year all land reverted back to the ownership of the original family if it had been sold out of it or to the tribe the family came from a child from a different tribe that had been gifted land by their adopted father lost that land in the shmittah year if they were not of the same tribe these laws highlight that it doesn't matter whos ehouse you grow up in or whom you call father you are always considered the son of your natural father and part of his tribe you cannto change your father or tribe as for wills there is a way around the strict rule sof inheritance in the torah the bequests can be given as gifts to the inheritors before the person dies contingent uopn their deaths thus they are deemed to have become the property of the inheritor before the person died and only items not bequeathed in such a manner are part of the estate for distribution by the laws of inheritance if you want to set up a kosher will speak to a competent halachic authority as there are specific rules as to how such bequests should be worded Kohen Judaism Korban Mormonism and Judaism Y-chromosomal Aaron Kashrut Pharisees Israelite Who is a Jew?
