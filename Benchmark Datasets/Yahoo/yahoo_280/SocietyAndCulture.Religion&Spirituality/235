if judas iscariot hanged himself out of remorse for betraying jesus did he go to heaven or hell i've asked this before but no one had a real answer i am very curious and i'm not sure myself it's hard to answer questions about judas he has been so demonized that his mere name implies the sin of sins and yet wasn't jesus' purpose for being here to die on that cross did jesus not know his fate and didn't jesus tell judas that he would betray him revealing someone's future especially one of betrayal how could a person betray another if both knew it was going to happen and discussed it before hand doesn't seem like true betrayal to me to die for the sins of man and give them promise of eternal salvation in paradise wouldn't people be lined up to turn him in why criminalize and damn judas he helped set us all free no it never made sense to me to shed a negative light on judas when it was his action that supposedly set in motion the events on which the rewards of the entire religion are based Judas Iscariot Salvation Eastern Orthodox Church Predestination Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Sin Merit Christian views of Jesus Sola fide Hell Free will God Godspell Justification (theology) Immortality Soul Summa Theologiae Jesus Religious perspectives on Jesus Abrahamic religion Religious views of suicide Historical Jesus Trinity Apostle Religion Gospel of Thomas The Divine Comedy Satan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Angel Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Problem of Hell Baptism New Testament view on Jesus' life Resurrection of Jesus Heaven Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Infant baptism Demon Christian eschatology Paul of Tarsus Gospel of Barnabas Incarnations of Immortality Plame affair Catechism Theosis The Last Temptation of Christ Qiyamah Religious pluralism Theory of conduct Secret Gospel of Mark Contrition The nature of God in Western theology Moral objectivism Devil Urantia Jehovah's Witnesses Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Jewish principles of faith Afterlife Original sin Isa Aramaic of Jesus Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Death Gate Cycle Blood atonement Lord of Light Purgatory Bible and reincarnation Apocrypha The Amber Spyglass Holy Spirit Acts of the Apostles Fallen angel Perseverance of the saints Charles Grandison Finney Christianity and anti-Semitism Harrowing of Hell Creationism Christianity John Wycliffe Catholicism Alan Campbell (pastor) Karma in Hinduism Capital punishment Legacy of Kain Jewish eschatology Paradise Lost
