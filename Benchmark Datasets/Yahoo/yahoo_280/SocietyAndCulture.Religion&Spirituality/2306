another of my questions concerning the exodus if this event took place where did the millions of gallons of water and millions of pounds of food come from to sustain the over israelites in the desert at over degrees in the shade did they drink gatorade and chase bees around for honey or just resort to chasing around dung beetles the millions of gallons of water and milions of pound of food was just to sustain them each day blue i wonder why i even try myself many times but there is still hope i think anybody with firing synapses can conclude that the story of the exodus was just that a story there's no proof that it ever happened no evidence in egyptian ancient writings of slaves being taken out of egypt by a hebrew the name moses doesn't exist in any ancient writings and it's my understanding that the ancient egyptians were notoriously careful at documenting important events in their history The Exodus Miracle Exodus Plagues of Egypt History of ancient Israel and Judah Ten Commandments The Bible and history Creation according to Genesis Judaism Documentary hypothesis Passage of the Red Sea History of ancient Egypt Ancient Egypt Noah's Ark Egypt Kuzari Tetragrammaton Bible Passover Seder Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pharaoh Passover Sabbath Honey Golden calf Jewish history Names of God in Judaism Abraham Mormonism and Judaism Pharisees Mount Sinai Economy of Egypt Palestinian exodus Tabernacle Historicity of Jesus Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Slavery Sukkot The Two Babylons Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Zionism Genesis Beetle Idolatry Shavuot Young Earth creationism God Biblical inerrancy Biblical scientific foresight Characters of Lost Egyptian mythology Torah Aaron Scarab beetle Jew Abrahamic religion Baptism Israel Midian Hyksos Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Ammon (nation) El (god) 613 mitzvot Jeremiah Deuteronomy Ancient history Manna Elohist Edom Israelite Ten Lost Tribes Biblical canon Apocrypha Tutankhamun Egyptian language Acts of the Apostles Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Book of Numbers Solomon's Temple Dating the Bible Book of Daniel Korban Agriculture History of the Jews in Egypt Habiru Musa (prophet) Book of Joshua Great Pyramid of Giza Hebrew language History of Africa Reformed Egyptian Arab Ezekiel Kadesh Makuria
