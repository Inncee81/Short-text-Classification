is it just me but are most of the atheists on here right now being especially militant what's up with all the hate from atheists why not answer or not questions without being confrontational calling no names there seems to be many on here right now who need to go back to sleep obviously i'm right from the responses so far jack p you're a hoot lol oh am i still blocked lol it's a running theme i'm afraid there may be 'spikes' in performance but i don't believe there is any great increase in general also this behaviour is always canceled out by the equally disturbing behaviour of some christians and balance is naturally restored although i have noticed the majority of this ignorance and intolerance is constantly between christians and atheists it seems very rare that any of the rest of us get confrontational and start name calling don't get me wrong i've seen it happen but nowhere near the same scale i only hope that it all dies down and people become peaceful with each other from my opinion religion should not be an excuse for arguments it certainly should not be a weapon of war may peace go with you throughout your life Agnosticism Religion Supernatural Atheism Theodicy God Apostasy Teach the Controversy Problem of Hell Evolutionary creationism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Intelligent design movement Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Strong atheism Simone Weil Creationism Afterlife Democracy Ethics Pacifism Atomism David Hume Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin Charles Darwin's views on religion Fundamentalism Arab-Israeli conflict Abortion debate Creation-evolution controversy William A.
