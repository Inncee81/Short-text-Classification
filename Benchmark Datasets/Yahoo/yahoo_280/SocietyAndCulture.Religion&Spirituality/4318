learning how to hesitate before reacting this may seem like a weird question but over the years its a simple principle that i have found to truly help me to stay with the lord through all kinds of situation when we are faced with a situation where we can react right away in ourselves from our flesh from our mind from who we are naturally many times the result is that we are not walking and having our being according to the spirit indwelling us but rather we are in our flesh or the self but learning how to simply hesitate when faced with things to just turn to the lord saying oh lord jesus i want to deal with this in you or to simply pray or call upon the name of the lord has a way of switching on or ushering us and directing us to the spirit its a matter of seconds but it works these few moments gives the lord a way to be our way truth and life in that circumstance i just found this to be such a help and wanted to know if any of you have ever tried this or have learned this from the lord it is called walking in the spirit of god and this is where we should all be walking you explained it very well it is even called crucifying the flesh we want our spirit and soul following the holy spirit within us sometimes i ask the holy spirit to please don't let jean show up Soul Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holy Spirit A Course In Miracles John Howard Yoder Resurrection of Jesus Eucharist Sola fide Urantia The Amber Spyglass Eastern Orthodox Church Godhead (Mormonism) Animism Ten Commandments Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Binitarianism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Theology The nature of God in Western theology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abrahamic religion Friedrich Schleiermacher Religion Mortification of the flesh God Origen Angel Evangelical Presbyterian Church Book of Mormon Mary, the mother of Jesus Athanasian Creed Christian mysticism Catechism Philosophy of language Jesus Adam-God theory Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian views of Jesus Bhajan New Testament view on Jesus' life Simone Weil Saint Michel Henry Religious perspectives on Jesus Christian eschatology Idolatry in Christianity Sant Mat Religious pluralism Dog training Apostles' Creed Meaning of life Clement of Alexandria Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Holy water Emanuel Swedenborg Roman Catholic Church Opus Dei Tertullian John Wycliffe William M.
