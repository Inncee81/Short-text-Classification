i was brought up a catholic and then i became a born again christian help me to understand something i am not really sure about what the sabbath is but now one of my girlfriends is practicing the sabbath and wanted me to come along one saturday instead of a sunday which is when i go to church so she says you can come but you must wear a skirt or a dress i told her i don't think so god does not care what we wear to church as long as we are there for him am i right or wrong she tells me men have changed everything about woman how they dress how they think what they should or should not wear she says a real woman wears skirts and dresses and heels what a crock i told her nobody tells me what the heck to wear i told her i did not want to go and she says ok you can wear pants what let me point you to some scripture to help you out on this one always check anything people tell you with what the scripture teaches rom one person regards one day above another another regards every day alike each person must be fully convinced in his own mind rom he who observes the day observes it for the lord and he who eats does so for the lord for he gives thanks to god and he who eats not for the lord he does not eat and gives thanks to god rom for not one of us lives for him and not one dies for himself rom for if we live we live for the lord or if we die we die for the lord therefore whether we live or die we are the lord's what it is saying here is that it really doesn't matter what day we worship or what clothes we wear as long as what we do is done to bring glory to god there are many churches that forget that glorifying god is the point and will make many rules and doctoring in an attempt to be holy but they often will end up only putting a new burden on people instead of allowing them to freely worship god i would be very careful about a church that worships on saturday and forces its women to wear skirts and heels as fare as the sabbath goes the jews worship on saturday because it is the last day of the week and the day god rested it is an old testament way of worshiping after christ came believers began to worship on sunday because they were celebrating the resurrection of christ which was on sunday Ten Commandments Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Christ Trinity Mormonism and Judaism Book of Isaiah Sola fide Christian eschatology Fasting God Sunday Christianity Easter Roman Catholic Church Book of Mormon Baptism Mary, the mother of Jesus New Testament Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Liturgical year Original sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pharisees Divine grace Religious Society of Friends Church of Christ, Scientist Resurrection of Jesus Catechism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Angel Mass (liturgy) Paul of Tarsus Abrahamic religion History of Christianity Saint Jewish services Mormonism and Christianity Judaism John the Baptist Alan Campbell (pastor) Jehovah's Witnesses Salvation Religion Prophet Apostle Heresy Merit John Howard Yoder Holy Spirit God and gender Infant baptism Seventh-day Adventist Church Catholicism Eucharistic discipline Protestantism Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Genesis Messianic Judaism Soul Articles of Religion (Methodist) Biblical inerrancy Canonical hours Lent Coptic Christianity Justin Martyr Historical persecution by Christians Gospel Opus Dei Epistle to the Romans Herbert W.
