why is it so hard for man kind to do the right thing and find it so easy doing every thing wrong before moses law man did not know right from wrong man did as he seen fit moses llaw was to let man know when he was doing wrong with out the law there was no wrong doings god said he would put it in every mans heart to know when he was doing wrong so now man knows when he is doing wrong he has no reason for doing it for he knows it is wrong before he does it we should be doing the right thing all the time well the bible says that the road leading to salvation is narrow and cramped and few are the ones finding it but the road leading to destruction is broad and spacious so which would you choose cramped or spacious furthermore when adam and eve sinned everyone born thereafter was born with sin so i guess you can say it is easier for us to do bad it is our natural inclination just think about it this way which is easier to do hanging up your clothes neatly every evening when you take them off the good thing to do or throwing your clothes into a growing pile on the floor when you take them off the bad thing i have to admit i have a closet full of hangers cause most of my clothes are on the floor the wrong thing to do is usually the easiest thing to do which is why i understand and agree with many bible teachings but i don't practice them it's just a matter of having the discipline to do what is right Original sin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Justification (theology) Infant baptism Theory of conduct Divine grace Theodicy Sabbath Genesis Homosexuality and Christianity Baptism Calvinism Eastern Orthodox Church Church of Christ Maimonides Religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Predestination Ten Commandments Articles of Religion (Methodist) Sola fide Evil Moses Merit Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Plagues of Egypt Perseverance of the saints Trinity Theosis Biblical inerrancy John the Baptist Ethics Charles Grandison Finney Salvation Halakha Prevenient grace Gospel of Thomas Abrahamic religion Karma Noahide Laws Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Evolutionary creationism Paradise Lost Total depravity Miracle Leviathan (book) Satan Heresy Philo Soul Kuzari Virgin Mary in Islam Duties of the Heart Jewish principles of faith Book of Isaiah Blood atonement Endowment (Mormonism) Eucharist Ethics in the Bible Blacks and Mormonism Dispensationalism Great Apostasy Time Out of Mind Rule of St Benedict Baptist Capital punishment Repentance Meaning of life Alan Campbell (pastor) History of Christianity Devil Pharisees Church of Christ, Scientist Paul of Tarsus Philipp Melanchthon Antinomianism Religious pluralism John Howard Yoder Urantia Evangelicalism Presuppositional apologetics Jewish views of religious pluralism Apocrypha Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theology Moral objectivism Day-Age Creationism Slow Train Coming Adam-God theory
