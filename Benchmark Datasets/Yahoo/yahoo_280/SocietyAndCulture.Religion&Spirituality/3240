shia muslims and sikhs is there any similarity between shia muslims and sikhs as i have chatted with some sunni muslims they told me that shia are like sikhs even shia muslims are controlling the gurdwaras sikh temple in iraq and sunni muslims are destroying gurdwaras in afghanistan even pakistan many sikh shrines are ignored for your question i have to go back to history of guru nanak dev ji guru nanak dev made four great journeys to all over the world he spoke before hindus jains buddhists parsees and muslims at every place in temples mosques guru nanak dev spoke out against empty religious rituals pilgrimages the caste system the sacrifice of widows against other social evils he asked the muslims to be true muslims and the hindus to be true hindus during this time although his followers still remained hindu muslim or of the religion to which they were born they became known as the guru's disciples when guru ji visited persia which has majority concentrations of shia muslims shia muslims also learn their teachings but remain in their religion they have great regards towards guru nanak dev ji now they are reconstructing gurudwara of guru nanak dev ji which get damage during recent attacks in iraq now this is the true story which one can say similarity besides this the other points which you can say similar but they have become by chance which are that shia 's have or more imans who they believed are holy figures sikhs have gurus their history is filled with brutal matyrdom as does the sikhs appearance wise they wear turbans also but different style of tying it and they keep beards Guru InterFaith Aurangzeb Islam Nankana Sahib Pakistan Punjab (Pakistan) Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Amritsar Punjab region History of the Punjab Sikh religious philosophy Shi'a Islam Diwali Gurdwara Bhajan Sant Mat Muhammad Hindu Hinduism Zoroastrianism Mahatma Gandhi God Religion in Hong Kong Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Kashmir Central Asia Pashtun Abrahamic religion Delhi Sunni Islam Idolatry Religion in India Mohammad Ali Jinnah Harmandir Sahib Advaita Vedanta Persecution of Muslims Saint Narayana Guru Guru Gobind Singh Khalistan Japji Sahib Religion History of India Status of religious freedom in Afghanistan Jerusalem Ali Guru Granth Sahib Pilgrimage Sectarianism Iraq Yoga Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Afghanistan Jainism Gurkha History of Hinduism Kaaba Islam in Bangladesh Kurdish people Gurdwaras in Pakistan Kabir Hindutva History of Islam Vaisakhi Aisha Buddhism Magic (paranormal) Indian caste system Five Pillars of Islam Mughal era Swami Vivekananda Religious perspectives on Jesus Hajj Nation of Islam Islam as a political movement Religious conversion Ambala Dasam Granth Muqtada al-Sadr Past teachings of Prem Rawat Islam in Pakistan Najaf Mughal Empire Religious pluralism Dhimmi Operation Blue Star Abraham Bihar Hindu Rashtra
