in the eyes of a roman catholic what do you think purgatory is like and how many people go there i say that about of us go there and it is like studying god and purification of sins others say it's just like hell without the devil and we must stay there for thousands of years please this is a serious question i'm curious only of roman catholic thoughts the question of purgatory is more serious than the present answers on this thread suggest it has to do with god's love and the purpose of human existence the other thing to realise is that although it is not mentioned in the bible it is a reasoned deduction from the basic principles of christianity and therefore is a concept worth thinking about the reasoning works like this you assert as basic principles certain beliefs about christianity god created mankind as an act of love his intention for us is that we should be united with him 'in jesus' the incarnation unites man and god in jesus and we as mankind are called to share the same god human unity god is wholly good and total holiness there can be no sin or evil in him it follows that to be united with god in christ we must become free of sin and perfectly holy like god himself human life is given to us so that with the help of the holy spirit we can grow towards this god like state all people fall into sin in their lives and despite being forgiven by god through sacramental confession and forgiveness we remain in an unholy state in the sense that we continue to have a tendancy toward sin and constantly fall short of the saint like quality that god hopes we shall achieve the reformation of character that is required to become truly god like is only rarely achieved by saints most of us die in a state where we are insufficiently reformed to take our place 'in christ' this being the case there are two possibilities for those who truly are on this path a you fail b you have a second chance in case a you go to hell along with those who have actually rejected god and turned away from him completely in case b you continue to grow towards complete holiness and god likeness in 'purgatory' you can see that case b is an assertion of the mercy and love of god god is seen as as being so overflowing with love that he will not accept a condition where one of his creatures is separated from him but at the same time this paints a picture of a god who does not compromise his complete moral goodness and holiness it is a way of bridging that gap if you delete purgatory how can you resolve these otherwise incompatible attributes of god it also presents a very high interpretation of our calling as christians we are expected not simply to be 'good' but to become totally united with the utter holiness of god Soul Christianity Christian eschatology Trinity Merit Great Apostasy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theodicy Justification (theology) Heaven Catholicism Mary, the mother of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Hell Eucharist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Infant baptism Ten Commandments Evil Free will John Howard Yoder Perseverance of the saints Holy Spirit Protestantism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Catechism Devil Religious pluralism Theosis Christian anarchism John Wycliffe Martin Luther Charles Grandison Finney Christian views of Jesus Angel Philipp Melanchthon Moral objectivism Church of Christ Jesus New Testament Book of Mormon Creationism Judas Iscariot Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reincarnation Nontrinitarianism Calvinism Opus Dei Existence of God Demon Total depravity Resurrection of Jesus Young Earth creationism Apostles' Creed Homosexuality and Christianity Religious perspectives on Jesus Binitarianism Sacrifice Articles of Religion (Methodist) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Augsburg Confession Biblical canon Immaculate Conception Jewish views of religious pluralism Origin belief Christian Second Vatican Council God and gender Problem of Hell Meaning of life Idolatry Satan Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Coptic Christianity Simone Weil
