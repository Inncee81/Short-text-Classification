question for christians about speaking in tongues i was wondering about speaking in tongues did speaking in tongues die out with the apostles someone told me that however i disagree any opinions thanks this is a very controversial topic mainly because people are confused by what it really means speaking in tongues is one of many spiritual gifts it is not dead it just isn't really needed speaking in tongues did not mean that you suddenly could speak gibberish but back then there were a lot of languages and someone with that particular spiritual gift could communicate to a group of people about the message of christ in a language they had never spoken before in this day and age we are able to get around more and have more people that are multilingual that this particular spiritual gift isn't as needed as it was back in the day how did jesus promise to help his disciples preach the gospel to all the world mark they shall speak in tongues note in the bible the word tongue simply means language jesus' disciples were bright men but most were uneducated in order to help them take the gospel to the world jesus promised to give them a supernatural gift to speak foreign languages they had not formerly studied or known what did the foreign jews experience when the holy spirit was poured out acts we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god what does the bible say about speaking in a tongue that is not understood corinthians except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken corinthians i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue note paul repeatedly explains that the purpose for a tongue language is to communicate or to teach truth a greek word for unknown is not found in any original bible manuscripts but was supplied by translators to indicate that the language was foreign to the majority present the church at corinth was a melting pot of many different nationalities and sometimes the services became confusing when members would pray testify or preach in languages unknown to the others present this is why paul commanded them to keep silent if speaking in a tongue unknown to the majority unless someone was there to interpret corinthians the lesson for us is that we should not speak or pray in a tongue that others present cannot understand Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Glossolalia Church of Christ Apostle Book of Mormon Baptism New Testament view on Jesus' life Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Historical Jesus Paul of Tarsus Christian eschatology Gospel of Thomas Dispensationalism Eastern Orthodox Church Christianity Acts of the Apostles Biblical canon Aramaic of Jesus Charismatic Gospel of John Apocrypha Soul Salvation Sola fide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Christian views of women Trinity John Howard Yoder Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Saint Peter Jesus Didache Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Alan Campbell (pastor) Mormonism and Christianity Biblical inerrancy Book of Isaiah Catechism Christian views of Jesus Divine grace Gospel Opus Dei History of the English Bible Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Thomas (Apostle) Second Vatican Council A Course In Miracles Cultural and historical background of Jesus Linguistics and the Book of Mormon God Agap__ Prophet Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Gospel of Matthew Joseph of Arimathea Abrahamic religion Pentecostalism Gospel of Mark Mormonism William M.
