it is ok to get a distant attunement in reiki what's the difference please tell me all the info you know thank you the reiki attunement that i want to get it's free so i have nothing to loose i feel that i trust them but i wanted to see your opinion too if you know that the person doing the attunement is legit then a distance attunement will be absolutely as effective as a hands on one beware of any distance attunements that immediately come with the manuals and the certificate all at once as soon as you make your payment you get no training and no support and often you don't even get an attunement there are some really great reiki distance training classes out there though i actually teach reiki i online through my campus the lotus academy of spiritual arts the reiki i class is months in length and includes really intensive hands on practical work with in depth feedback provided after each assignment and constant support for all questions and concerns both during and after the course i've seen several other great distance classes too so you have a good deal of choice if you do your research make sure there are actual lessons regular consistent support from the master and that you are held responsible for successful completion of the assignments before you are issued any certifications YuYu Hakusho Aikido Alexander Technique Tai Chi Chuan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pretty Good Privacy Martial art Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Education in Portugal Education in the United States Apprenticeship Kazuma Kuwabara Appeal Scientology beliefs and practices Credit card Rabbi A Course In Miracles Predestination Consensus decision-making Education in Japan Education in Germany Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Determinism Explosive material Graduate school New Age Ludwig Wittgenstein C plus plus Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Community college Physician Boy Scouts of America IB Diploma Programme Ethics Hypnosis Columbia University GED Opus Dei Extreme Programming Yusuke Urameshi Alternative medicine Education in the People's Republic of China Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Domain Name System Summa Theologiae United States Naval Academy Education in the Republic of Ireland Teacher Meditation Dog agility RuneScape Neuro-linguistic programming Separation of church and state Corporate governance Tonality Education Theory of conduct Sant Thakar Singh Toastmasters International Faith healing Theodicy PLATO Cinematography Church of Christ, Scientist Anarchism and capitalism Philosophy of space and time Driver's license Risk management Authentic performance Literacy Microsoft Education in Australia Software testing Religious pluralism Friedrich Schleiermacher Software engineering Identity theft Nurse Copyright law of the United Kingdom Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Guild Wars Public transport Church of Christ Human nature United States Army Quantum mechanics IBM PC compatible Air Education and Training Command Normal distribution Confucius Chiropractic Copyleft Microphone Drama Parallax Mixed martial arts Operational amplifier
