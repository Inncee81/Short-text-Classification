christians do you consider this wrong do you think it is wrong for people to change the bible to fit their own needs and desires and if yes do think it is wrong for people to follow these people and read from these bibles i have many christian friends who say that the bible has been changed so they can eat pork and do other things that originally they could not do i am muslim and it is haram very bad to change the word of allah so i was wondering if it is bad for christians too because for us once you change the word of god it is no longer the word of god do you agree i don't want to debate the quran or bible itself i just want to know the christian stance on people changing it because i know thomas jefferson wrote his own bible so did king james i can't remember the reason why he did but i do know he did and so did king henry i can't remeber which one but people still read from these books and consider them god's word event though these people have changed it omg you guys just don't get that i am not talking about dietary laws i am talking about changing it so you can get divorced and stuff like that i don't want to read a quote from the bible either read the questions that i asked i am not talking abotu translations because the quran is translated and i don't see a problem w that i am talking about changing it not translating i didn't know that all king james did was translate it my world history teacher in the th grade who was catholic said that he changed it you're right it is wrong to change the bible i'm not christian but i know that the original bible came from africa and the whites translated the bible to fit them whites and blacks in america try to change the bible to fit them which is wrong people change but god's words remain the same edit he translated the bible but as years went by the bible was constantly changed by whites not king james and they claimed that king james wrote it many books of the bible were destroyed by whites when they went to ethiopia as well many years ago you might disagree with me but i've read the qoran and bible and they both have same meaning just different wording christan's always act like they have to change things to fit them look at an old bible from the 's and a bible from in the old bible it states jesus had hair of wool and burnt skin now it says jesus had white hair and brass skin this is just an example till this day the bible is still being changed Nation of Islam Bible Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Qur'an Biblical canon Book of Mormon Jesus Biblical inerrancy Creationism New Testament Old Testament End times Tetragrammaton Fundamentalism God Sabbath Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Mary, the mother of Jesus Original sin Arab Abrahamic religion Religious conversion Chosen people Ten Commandments Prophet King James Version of the Bible Rastafari movement Apostasy in Islam Holy Spirit Christianity Book of Daniel Historicity of Jesus Sharia Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Homosexuality and Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Noah Christianity and anti-Semitism Gospel of John New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Apocrypha Sin Alan Campbell (pastor) Apologetics Young Earth creationism Idolatry Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Book of Isaiah Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Blacks and Mormonism Moses Religion Virgin Mary in Islam Supernatural Abraham New Testament view on Jesus' life Temple Mount Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Devil Islam Martin Luther Christian eschatology Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Judaism Prayer Miracle Allah Prophets of Islam Criticism of Islam Historical Jesus Genesis Psalms Isa Separation of church and state Gospel Church of Christ, Scientist John Howard Yoder Great Apostasy Nontrinitarianism John Wycliffe Origen Tanakh Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Talmud David Hume Predestination Jizya God and gender Resurrection of Jesus William M.
