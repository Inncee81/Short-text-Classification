curious questions what do you think or know about about the destiny of the unevangelized and the nature of hell you are touching upon a deep theological debate that's been going on for centuries the book of romans talks about human destiny romans for those whom he god foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son christ and those whom he god predestined he also called and those whom he called he also justified and those whom he justified he also glorified as far as i know there has been many interpretation of these verses but the gist of it is that god is in control of everything including our relationship with god while some interpret foreknew a little differently than i do i take it as being god's foreknowledge of what we would have done in every possible circumstances i e when we play chess we play out in our mind as much as we can and as imperfect as it is all the different scenarios before we decide on our move but for god all the different ifs are as real as the reality we experience i believe god knows what everyone of us will do with the message of the bible god doesn't have to test it out to see as humans would have to and thus with such foreknowledge of all the circumstantial possibilities he does not need to live each one out to make his move if he is god as we claim he is he really is omniscient and does things based on his omniscience this means those who did not have the opportunity to hear of god would not have mattered either ways john jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me esv edit hi chasn i relate to what you are saying but unfortunately i doubt i could fully satisfy your curiosity especially in this limited space i dont claim i understand it all and may be that is why i still believe god is god after all if i could figure him out with my human brain i would seriously question his godliness but it makes most sense to me although it's near impossible for us to get away from thinking in perspective of time for god past present and future all happen simultaneously if you will so unlike us where we only have the past to lead to the full comprehension of the present and the future for god his comprehension of the future can just as well influence the past as for the freewill it all fits into the above concept and that our freewill was god's will for us to have and god said only way to him is through his son ignorance is no excuse God Theodicy A Course In Miracles Trinity Christian eschatology John Wycliffe Supernatural Biblical inerrancy Salvation The nature of God in Western theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Creationism Theology Problem of Hell Meaning of life Existence of God Justification (theology) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Presuppositional apologetics Intelligent design Sola fide Resurrection of Jesus Divine grace Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bible and reincarnation Jewish principles of faith Philipp Melanchthon Merit Time travel Book of Revelation Ontological argument Apocalyptic literature Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Philosophy Open Theism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Pharisees Human nature Nontrinitarianism New Testament Immanuel Kant Creation according to Genesis Alan Campbell (pastor) Infant baptism Judas Iscariot Epistemology Sin Jehovah's Witnesses Perseverance of the saints Charles Grandison Finney Human Determinism Calvinism Eastern Orthodox Church End times Opus Dei Philosophy of language Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Qur'an Cyberspace David Hume Religious pluralism Soul Eucharist Biblical canon Binitarianism Angel Gospel of John John Howard Yoder Antichrist Dispensationalism Judaism Historicity of Jesus Origen Prophet Original sin Baptism Sant Mat Atheism Causality Objectivist philosophy Priesthood (Mormonism) Jewish philosophy Evolutionary creationism Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Bible Protestantism Paul of Tarsus
