the prodigal son is on his way home would you give him instructions on how to be saved this is a puzzle of course so does he need the christian message i love your question ok so when the prodigal came home first he came to himself he realized that he had done wrong then he went home to his father with a humble attitude he was even willing to be a servant but his father restored him and welcomed him back as a son not a servant we also see that the father had longed for the day when his son would return and when he saw him at a distance he ran towards him to welcome him so the prodigal in the story didn't need instructions he did what he needed to do to be restored he repented of his rebellion and he returned having faith that the father would receive him and the father welcomed him as a son once again so in a way the prodigal in the story doesn't need the christian message but he illustrates it we are all like the prodigal we have rebelled against god and gone our own way sinned when we realize this come to ourselves we can turn away from our rebellious life style this is called repentance and run to our father daddy and he forgives us and makes us members of his family we come to him through jesus who told us no man cometh unto the father but by me he is the way the truth and the life so yes the prodigal of today does need the christian message because it is through it that we can be restored to our father there is a beautiful painting by rembrandt called the return of the prodigal son find in google and a really good book by the same title by henri nouwen found here http reviews alibris com reviews htm Repentance Prodigal Son Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Divine grace Salvation Sola fide Justification (theology) Baptism Paradise Lost Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church John Howard Yoder Sin Book of Mormon Mormonism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Articles of Religion (Methodist) God Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Contrition Church of Christ Christianity Charles Grandison Finney Gospel of Thomas Jesus The Brothers Karamazov Eucharistic discipline John the Baptist Prophet Godspell Trinity Book of Isaiah Ten Commandments Infant baptism First Vision Urantia Martin Luther Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Chosen people Mormonism and Christianity Antinomianism C.
