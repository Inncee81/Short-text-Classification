can you describe the covenential relationship between the jewish people and god let me know if this answers your question very good question by the way many people wonder the same thing the last book of the torah teaches that the jews are god s chosen people for you are a holy people unto the lord your god the lord your god hath chosen you to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers deuteronomy from all the nations and people on the earth why exactly did god choose the jews john gill in his exposition of the entire bible says the jews were chosen for special service and worship and to enjoy special privileges and benefits civil and religious though they were not chosen to special grace or eternal glory the jews were chosen to be a blessing to all the nations of the earth genesis the jews were chosen to be a light to the gentiles so then are all jews saved just because they are jews according to many modern rabbinical scholars the christian concept of salvation from sin has no equal in judaism judaism does not believe that man by his nature is evil or sinful and therefore has no need to be saved from an eternal damnation in fact most jews today do not believe in a place of eternal punishment or a literal hell the hebrew root word for sin is chayt which literally means to miss the mark it is a term commonly used in archery of one who misses the mark of the bulls eye when a jew misses the mark and occasionally falls into the sin of failing to fulfill the laws of god the belief is that one can obtain forgiveness through prayer repentance and doing good deeds the book of leviticus the third book of the torah clearly gives the prescription for forgiveness for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul the temple sacrifice was always the centerpiece for jewish atonement once a year on the day of atonement yom kippur the levitical high priest would enter the holy of holies in the temple and sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the mercy seat through this yearly act atonement was made for the sins of all israel but the holy temple was destroyed in ad and for almost years jews have been without a temple a sacrifice and a means of atonement the brit chadasha the new covenant or new testament teaches us that the jewish messiah jesus christ came to the lost sheep of the house of israel matthew precisely at the time preceding the destruction of the jewish temple in jerusalem but when messiah arrived as a high priest of the good things to come he entered through the greater and more complete tabernacle not made with hands that is not of this creation and not through the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood he entered into the holy place once for all having obtained eternal redemption for if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been made common sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh how much more shall the blood of messiah who through the eternal spirit offered himself without blemish to god cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living god hebrews the new testament teaches that all of us jews and gentiles have missed the mark romans all of us are under the consequences of sin and the wages of sin is death romans we are all in need of salvation from our sin we are all in need of a savior the new testament teaches that jesus the messiah is the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through him john and most importantly there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which it is necessary for us to be saved acts for the jews jesus the messiah has come as high priest and through his once for all sacrifice for sin offers complete atonement to all people for there is no distinction between jew and gentile romans yes the jews are god s chosen people and through them come the jewish messiah to bless all the nations of the earth and it is only through jesus that jews can find god s complete atonement and forgiveness to god be the glory
