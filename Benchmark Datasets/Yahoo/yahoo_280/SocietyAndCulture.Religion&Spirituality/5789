judas iscariot death passage i read in matthew chapter about the death of judas by suicide hanging however i remember that somewhere in the other gospels there was a passage where he fell and split open i have not been able to find this passage in the new testament bible detailing the alternate scenario of the death of judas iscariot any ideas about its location judas hung himself and after a while he fell and split open coz that's what a rotted body does when it hits the ground mat then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field to bury strangers in therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day first of all notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of hanging all it says is that he went and hanged himself luke however in acts tells us that and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out this is a pretty clear indication along with the other details given in acts peter's speech the need to pick a new apostle etc that at least after judas' fall he was dead so the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highly probable but not clear cut therefore if i were to take a radical exegetical approach here i could invalidate your alleged contradiction that there are two different accounts of how judas died in addition the greek word apagcho used to describe judas's hanging of himself was only used one other time in the bible it's only used in samuel now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his city then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and he was buried in his father's tomb notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself but it explicitly adds and died here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we are not explicitly told judas died also there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure it simply means hang oneself Apostle Historical Jesus Saint Peter Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life Apocrypha Acts of the Apostles Resurrection of Jesus Gospel of Thomas Aramaic of Jesus Paul of Tarsus Baptism New Testament Gospel of Mark Mary, the mother of Jesus Bible Biblical canon Joseph of Arimathea Thomas (Apostle) Gospel Gospel of John Gospel of Matthew Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Saint James the Just Sabbath Historicity of Jesus Dispensationalism Book of Mormon St. Simon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biblical inerrancy Gospel of Luke Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Abrahamic religion Pontius Pilate Moses Christianity and anti-Semitism Saint Jude Book of Isaiah Authorship of the Johannine works Mary Magdalene Pope Didache Chronology of Jesus Authorship of the Pauline epistles Soul Cultural and historical background of Jesus Sanhedrin Origen Christian eschatology Gospel of Barnabas Book of Daniel History of the English Bible Creation according to Genesis Secret Gospel of Mark Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Apostolic Succession The Pilgrim's Progress King James Version of the Bible Harrowing of Hell Eastern Orthodox Church Pharisees Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sola fide Plame affair Matthew 2 Priesthood (Mormonism) Bible and reincarnation Biblical Magi Divine grace Angel Nazarene Jude Thomas Mark 16 Ebionites Modern geocentrism Hell Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Barabbas Matthew the Evangelist Q document Young Earth creationism Apostolic Constitutions Trinity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Holy Spirit Microeconomics Judas Priest Canonical hours Christian views of women David Book of Joshua
