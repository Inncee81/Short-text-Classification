a sincere question for those who consider themselves to be atheists or agnostics the heart of the christian faith is john for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life if someone were to quote this text directly to you sincerely kindly and non agressively how would you respond honest and thoughtful answers will be greatly appreciated thank you to those of you who say that it would depend upon the context i can understand that to m it's something of an experiment thank you for answering to meshugga and others yes there's obviously much more to the passage and to christianity in general i was interested in reactions to one very familiar and pivotal text to the gentleman who cleverly eluded the censors by changing the position of a single consonant in his pen name really my dear man isn't this going a bit too far you would conclude after hearing me quote a single verse that i have nothing to contribute to your life to humanity or to the future of the human race without knowing anything else about me my life my family my work etc fascinating my first inclination is toward argument my cynical response might be what kind of a god would want an innocent son to be brutally murdered and how does that show love for the world or rescue people from mortality and death your god sounds cruel and might have a psychotic disorder have you ever met anyone who died and returned from the grave because this alleged son of an alleged god died why do you believe that crap when i am in my more tactful mood i am able to reply you appear to be comforted greatly by that thought there isn't really any right answer short of agreement i've had hundreds of conversations like this where i attempted to show respect for the messenger without pretending to agree with the message it just doesn't work the messenger gets it and they won't accept anything short of agreement as a reply Salvation Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sola fide Trinity Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Book of Isaiah The nature of God in Western theology Agnosticism Nation of Islam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Justification (theology) Theodicy Gospel of John Meaning of life Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Resurrection of Jesus God God Emperor of Dune Biblical inerrancy Supernatural Past teachings of Prem Rawat Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Maimonides Bible and reincarnation Merit Christianity Immortality The Pilgrim's Progress Book of Mormon Creationism Repentance Evolutionary creationism Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Gospel of Thomas Historical Jesus Simone Weil Nontrinitarianism Abortion debate Existence of God Goodness and value theory Teach the Controversy Soul Ten Commandments Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Transcendental argument for the existence of God Judaism Bertrand Russell Jiddu Krishnamurti Alcoholics Anonymous Sant Mat Vlad III Dracula Free will Charles Grandison Finney Young Earth creationism Creation-evolution controversy Intelligent design movement Homosexuality and Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Names and titles of Jesus Reincarnation Christian eschatology Sin Criticism of Islam John Wesley Islam Sabbath Gospel of Barnabas Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Book of Job Celsus Ontological argument Philipp Melanchthon Christian apologetics John the Baptist Jewish principles of faith Phaedo Alan Campbell (pastor) Internet troll Angel Church of Christ, Scientist Predestination Catechism Afterlife New Testament Religious pluralism Christian anarchism Existentialism The Amber Spyglass King James Version of the Bible
