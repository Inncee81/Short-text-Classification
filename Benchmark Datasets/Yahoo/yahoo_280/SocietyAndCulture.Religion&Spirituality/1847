i received jesus christ as my savior should i expect applause for this after all i am kind of proud of my decision ha ha that's the age old lie of the pseudo christian church you are chosen you are not the one who chooses had you truly been born again you would recognize that god deserves all praise honor and glory you would fall to your knees and bless his holy name you would most assuredly not be taking any credit for his work in you nor would you have any pride about it for you would know it did not come of your own effort when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom you would get applause if you recognize that fact at least from me it grieves me often to see poor souls that have a zeal for god and a desire of eternal welfare kept captive through the power of lying teachers who are themselves deceived into a false and outward worship and service of god they have many endeavors for mortification of sin but an ignorance of the righteousness of christ and the work of the spirit if god ever shines in their hearts to give them the knowledge of his glory in the face of his son jesus christ they will see the folly of their present way Original sin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Ten Commandments Justification (theology) John Howard Yoder Salvation Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Christian eschatology Divine grace Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Isaiah Church of Christ, Scientist Mary, the mother of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Merit Jesus Book of Mormon Holy Spirit A Course In Miracles Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Soul Summa Theologiae Predestination Priesthood (Mormonism) Mortification of the flesh Abrahamic religion Trinity Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Heaven Revelation Baptism Roman Catholic Church Charles Grandison Finney John Wycliffe Devil Messiah Sin Funeral of Pope John Paul II Harrowing of Hell Salvation Army God Dispensationalism Free will Theosis Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Duties of the Heart Mormonism and Christianity Sabbath Antichrist John the Baptist Christian and Missionary Alliance Angel Adam-God theory Simone Weil Resurrection of Jesus Opus Dei Binitarianism Requiem Saint Calvinism Pope Baptist Jewish principles of faith God and gender Infant baptism Endowment (Mormonism) Eucharist Godhead (Mormonism) Holy water Gospel of Barnabas Satanism Religious Society of Friends Temple (Mormonism) Creationism Origen Catechism Amidah Hell Justin Martyr Martin Luther Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Coptic Christianity Mary Magdalene Athanasian Creed Papal Infallibility Prophet Christ God the Father
