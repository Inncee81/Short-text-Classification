atheists will use logic to try and disprove god's existence but in so doing they are assuming absolute laws of logic and borrowing from the christian worldview a the christian worldview maintains that the laws of logic are absolute because they come from god who is himself absolute b but the atheist worldview does not have an absolute god so we ask how can absolute conceptual abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter energy and motion in other words how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical energy or motion if the atheist states that the laws of logic are conventions mutually agreed upon conclusions then the laws of logic are not absolute because they are subject to vote how does the atheist account for the laws of logic not shoving beliefs just trying to understand and come to a greater level of knowledge if you are interested in educatedly discussing this please feel free to e mail me anardri the laws of logic are not dependent upon different people's minds since people are different therefore they cannot be based on human thinking since human thinking is often contradictory joe f man being made in god's image is capable of discovering these laws of logic he does not invent them the laws of logic are conceptual realities they only exist in the mind and they do not describe physical behavior of things since behavior is action and laws of logic are not descriptions of action but of truth the atheist regardless of how pure they feel their logic is can not disprove god if you can not logically prove there is a god you can not logically prove there is not a god god is a matter of faith faith is not a matter of logic atheists while planting their beliefs in logic are actually using faith faith that there is not god Religion Philosophy God The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Human Creationism Determinism Friedrich Schleiermacher Falsifiability Agnosticism Supernatural Evolutionary creationism Predestination Summa Theologiae Philosophy of mathematics Atomism S__ren Kierkegaard Simone Weil Strong atheism Theory Immanuel Kant Ontological argument Quantum mechanics The relationship between religion and science Objectivist philosophy David Hume Aristotle Meaning of life Physics Critique of Pure Reason Soul Evil Jewish philosophy Scientific method John Wycliffe Victor Cousin New Age Resurrection of Jesus Reality Western philosophy Modern geocentrism Moral objectivism Human nature Sin Intelligent design Fundamentalism Free will Truth Argument from morality Neuro-linguistic programming Nihilism Apologetics Contradiction Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Scientology beliefs and practices Antony Flew Creation science Mathematics Universal pragmatics Miracle Idealism Faith Intelligent design movement Cosmology Deconstruction Christian philosophy Ten Commandments Moral relativism Phillip E.
