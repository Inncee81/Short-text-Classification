muslims why must women cover themselves this is related to my other question which was not meant to offend but why do only women have to cover themselves why not the guys why not show their beautiful smiles and hair i ask because i see all the time muslim families the guys wearing cool comfortable clothes while the women are hidden and wrapped up like mummies head to toe in the middle of summer in the desert sorry but it doesn't seem fair that the woman has to hide her beauty whats wrong with sharing her beauty with the world why shouldn't the men hide their er beauty this is something that is always misunderstood by a lot of people and i can tell your just curious and not being offensive thanks well women don't have to cover themselves i mean to a certain extent they do but they don't have to wear headscarves and cover their faces with just their eyes showing it's a matter of choice i don't do it i wanted to at one time really bad and i still want to but my parents advised me against it bc we live in a mostly christian dominated area and they didn't want ppl offending me or anything in islam men and women are supposed to cover themselves to a certain extent like men shouldn't go shirtless and have to wear pants or shorts that come to atleast their knees obviously in public and women shouldn't wear any thing shorter than capris that's a little iffy and shouldn't wear low necks show their stomach or wear tank tops or anything smaller i think for men the reason is to mostly be respectful to themselves and really ppl around them and to women it's to be respectful and also to protect themselves like a woman wearing slutty clothes would definitely attract more attention and put herself in more danger than a woman who is dressed modestly and i'm not gonna deny it some men do force women to cover themselves up from head to toe and in islam that is wrong but you are supposed to dress modestly hope this helped Hijab Veil Headgear French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Islam and clothing Undergarment Social aspects of clothing Little Britain Avenue Q Social rule Women in Islam Aerial (dance move) Shoe Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Diving Sharia Sin City Sento Teen Girl Squad Comanche Professional wrestling holds The Apprentice 2 Yoko Ono Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Volleyball Sauna Predestination Jennifer Lopez Ann Coulter Theodicy Swimsuit Sharon Tate Strap-on dildo Skirt and dress Spanking The Ashlee Simpson Show Status of religious freedom in Sudan Nation of Islam Dhimmi Plame affair Gay slang Nudity Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Islam as a political movement Mummy Head Toplessness Kimono Cross-dressing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Figure skating Softball Scarface (1983 film) Separation of church and state Salute Equine conformation Brian Close Skinhead Paul Is Dead Japanese tea ceremony Shirt Cowboy Characters in the Smurfs Kilt Islamic world Saudi Arabia Swimming pool Capital punishment Bon Jovi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kender Gender role The Smoking Room Opus Dei Jackass: The Movie Ice hockey Domestic violence Anti-Defamation League K' Pitaten Marriage Islam in France Mud People Professional wrestling match types Human sexual behavior Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Marilyn Monroe Abortion debate Sexual orientation
