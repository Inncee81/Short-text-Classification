what can you eat that will not kill anything to those who do not think it possible think harder it is possible i am not counting germs here or micro organisms which we would not be able to avoid by drinking water even i am speaking of things which we can eat which we don't have to directly kill to eat for sustenance and maintenance this is a serious question wow sweetbreeze this is a long list more than i even thought certainly we could live without killing if we wanted to i also agree with you on the part about killing animals is more like murder only in certain dire circumstances would it be ok to take the life of an animal who loves plays hides runs screams bleeds etc for maintenance of human life it is very different to kill plants and seeds for food it is first of all the natural diet for people to do so for tigers dogs lions jackals i see no problem for them to eat meat because that is their natural diet for people we are meant to eat vegetation etc so it is not very sinful to do so even so sin is incurred like deito also packinrat and some others has alluded to that is why we offer all of our food to god and stick also to the diet that god has meant for us also it would be nice to consume more of the non killing foods mentioned by sweetbreeze and few others it is also true that nothing can live without killing tiny things like microbes germs other microscopic organisms even drinking heck even breathing theats you bring up a nice point of karma and the foods that are natural to many animals it is true their natural foods are often times killing other animals but animals do not incur karma they only go through it the human form of life is the only one which has the chance to create good or bad karmas or to go beyond karma and join the spiritual world with god after going through more than million species of life we have finally gotten to the human form of life so that is why it is said that this human form of life is so rare and we should utilize it for a higher purpose in the animal forms of life we cannot ask who am i why am i here etc in this human form of life it's possible to do so much or also equally possible to throw yourself back in the cycle of birth and death and your future life is unknown whether human or animal species then how much longer will you be in this cycle this world is a vicious cycle of karma and you can't escape it so easily every little thing you do will bind you and has karmik reaction either good or bad and you will be compelled to suffer or enjoy it in this world so instead of worrying over much about karma we just follow the rules of god and he has ordained for us to eat the foods which are meant for human life like grains beans veggies all alive and fruits milk etc as devotees of krsna we only eat the foods he accepts and we honor the purified remnants of our offerings to him which is his mercy and called prasad i don't even like to say i'm a vegetarian because really i am a prasadarian if we follow the principles of god and offer everything to him he takes our karma away all the karma good or bad we don't want either for karma only binds you to this world eventually we come to his lotus feet in pure loving service this is our real goal bharat vanshi brings up an interesting point jada is like the elements that make up anything chetan is the life that inhabits jada and animates it makes it alive the thing is plants etc have chetan in them or they would not live although the consciousness is covered thickly it is still there therefore it can't be called jada however it is much better to eat the deeply covered consciousness than more conscious humans are most conscious so that's why we it's the worst to kill eat humans foods which are given to us usually will not need killing for example a tree covered with fruit which are dropping to the ground fruit come in all kinds of tastes and flavors breadfruit or ulu is like a potato on a tree but it is a fruit jackfruit can replace meat it is so meaty the texture and everything honey dew persimmons peaches mangoes lichees cherries cantalope pumpkin squash bittermelon plums nectarines starfruit soursop cherimoya custard apple apple dates apricots watermelon and pineapples are a few examples of some of the fruits that don't require you eat the seeds however figs tomatoes zuchini and kiwis are some examples of fruits which are consumed with the seeds because the seeds are so small or immature all nuts except cashews are alive and are seeds coconuts are also immature seeds the only part of a fruit that is alive is a mature seed the seed is a dormant tree or plant seeds are alive so they don't count seeds grow into plants and trees whereas fruit simply rots milk does not require any killing or mistreating to obtain milk is not alive though it is filled with pran therefore milk and all milk products made without killing and mistreating can be eaten cheese curd icecream yogurt butter ghee buttermilk whipped cream kefir etc are all things which can be obtained from a cow without killing honey can be taken nicely without killing any bees maple syrup also can be taken without killing the tree leaves of lettuce spinach arugala mustard parsley etc can be taken without killing the plant in fact taking the older outside leaves is beneficial to the growth of the plant cauliflower and broccoli are the flowers of plants i am not sure about unfertilized flowers perhaps they are ok that brings into consideration the unfertilized egg of a chicken the egg is not obtained through killing but it's ingredient is ovum half the ingredient required to make a chicken an unfertilized egg is literally the menstruation of a chicken guess that would count i am not sure if eating bamboo shoots kills the bamboo does it grow a new shoot after you cut it i think chayote squash needs the entire fruit in order to grow all legumes beans and grains will be killed when you eat them and of course the more conscious creatures like dogs hogs goats cows sheep and even fish etc must be killed but i would call it murder since they bleed and cry and scream in pain to consume so
