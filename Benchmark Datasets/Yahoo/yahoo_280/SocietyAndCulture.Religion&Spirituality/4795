if i was alive years ago and i had the power to save christ from being crucified i would have after all nobody deserves to be nailed to a couple of boards just for speaking their mind does this make me an evil man perhaps you could learn a valuable lesson that took place during the reign of king david it involved an individual named uzzah who like you wanted to step in and render assistance we have an example to guide us in the occasion of david s attempt to bring the ark of the covenant to jerusalem rather than having the ark transported on poles on the shoulders of the kohathite levites according to the law it was placed in a wagon at a certain point the cattle pulling the wagon nearly caused an upset and a man named uzzah reached out and grabbed hold of the ark what resulted jehovah god struck him down there for the irreverent act so that he died there close by the ark sam what was wrong god s law specifically prohibited any but the authorized priestly representatives from touching the sacred ark on pain of death the law was publicly known and as uzzah was undoubtedly a levite but not a priest he should have known better than others god s express command he chose to violate that command perhaps assuming that circumstances warranted it he may have felt that if he did not act to steady the ark it was sure to fall if so he lacked faith in god s power to care for matters in such a way that none of his servants need disobey his express commands on the other hand he may have thought he had an opportunity to make a hero of himself gaining lasting fame as uzzah the man who kept the sacred ark from falling either way he showed disrespect Ark of the Covenant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eastern Orthodox Church 613 mitzvot Abrahamic religion Sabbath Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Roman Catholic Church Religious pluralism Baptism Tabernacle Judaism Theodicy Jehovah's Witnesses Sin Jeremiah Jewish principles of faith Kohen Knots Landing Documentary hypothesis Book of Numbers Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Solomon's Temple British monarchy Resurrection of Jesus Samuel Deuteronomist Sukkot David Capital punishment Church of Christ Professional wrestling holds Christianity Appeal Genesis Church of Christ, Scientist Religious perspectives on Jesus Religion Book of Joshua Jewish views of religious pluralism Grimke Sisters Angel Priestly Code Acts of the Apostles Heaven Noahide Laws Book of Mormon Calvinism Pope John Paul II Jewish symbolism Satanism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Shadow the Hedgehog Joseph (Hebrew Bible) God Names of God in Judaism Noah Mitzvah Prophet Biblical canon Mortification of the flesh Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Homosexuality and Christianity John Howard Yoder Royal Assent Charles Grandison Finney Rastafari movement Power Rangers Joseph Smith, Jr. Megatron Flood geology Mormonism and Judaism Predestination Vulcan (Star Trek) Victor Cousin Hell Bah__'__ divisions Homosexuality and Judaism Book of Isaiah A Course In Miracles Crucifixion John Wycliffe
