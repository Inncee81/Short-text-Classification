how do you know you have chosen the right god goddess faith i have spoken to people from lots of different faiths and asked them all the same question how do you know your god is the right one what do you think will become of you if one of the other major world religions were right all along surely only one of you can be right i ask of christians what if you're wrong and it's allah you're going to be facing or the jewish people were right and there was no jesus and for muslims what if the christians are right where does that leave you after a lifetime of following the wrong faith and the only answer i ever get is i know it's the right one because i do and for me that's not good enough i'm not religious obviously some religions are exclusive too and if you're not a member of their gang you're doomed how can that be right when there are so many different faiths in the world lets just hope it's the buddhists who've got it right because siddhartha is so forgiving he'll let us have another crack at it o devi spring your answer was wonderful and i agree with you because i already subscribe to the 'it is for each man to find his own god' belief myself but it's not really what i'm asking i want to hear from the zealots i want to know have they ever considered just for a second their religion might not be the 'right one' and that they may be condemned in the afterlife to what they fervently condemn other religions to i want to know how they know their god is the one who created everything not just blind faith or because that's the religion they were raised into that's a cop out fred you've hit the nail on the head you seen to understand where i'm coming from o just a bit luckier than everyone else in the world who was born to the wrong parents and came to believe devoutly in the wrong god Religion Salvation God Abrahamic religion Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Idolatry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Soul Mary, the mother of Jesus Chosen people Christianity Qiyamah Afterlife Nation of Islam Prayer Magic (paranormal) Religious conversion Sin Gautama Buddha Saint Isa Infant baptism Ten Commandments Atheism Theodicy Satanism Prophet Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eschatology Justification (theology) Resurrection of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Paul of Tarsus Heaven Separation of church and state Trinity Sola fide Abraham John the Baptist Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Evolutionary creationism Islam Hell Religious pluralism Baptism Fundamentalism Meaning of life Judaism Divine grace Noah Apostasy in Islam Origin belief Philosophy of religion Church of Christ Apologetics Book of Isaiah Rich Mullins Creationism Jewish views of religious pluralism The nature of God in Western theology Second Coming Maimonides Monotheism God the Father Moses Calvinism Revelation Messianic Judaism Bible and reincarnation Holy Spirit Ethics in religion Supernatural Devil Religious Society of Friends Virgin Mary in Islam Theology Original sin Evil Urantia Religious perspectives on Jesus Baptist Religion in Israel Islamic philosophy Christian apologetics Witchcraft End times Eastern Orthodox Church Angel Demographics of the United States
