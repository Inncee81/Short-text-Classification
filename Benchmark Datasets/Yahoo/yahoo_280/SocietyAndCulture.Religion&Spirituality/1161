prayer requests i see people ask for others to pray for friends family and strangers who are sick or injured how does that work is god able to help them but unwilling to do it unless enough people pray does his perfect plan involve not healing them but he's willing to switch to a suboptimal plan if enough people ask for it also if prayer works why not be preemptive and ask that nobody get sick or injured ever again can't god do that doesn't the bible say that he'll do whatever people ask elaine so the only problem is that out of over two billion christians nobody has enough faith personal prayer to me has always seemed sickeningly selfish there are people starving living in squalor attrocities are going on around the world religions try to commit genocide on each other and people are praying for the weather to clear up or some such nonsense or even worse the surrivors prayers i lived because god wanted me to never mind the baby that burned to death next to me or the other people in the crash who died horrible deaths god loves me best god says he will give you anything through prayer so why doesen't he in matthew i tell you the truth if you have faith and do not doubt not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain 'go throw yourself into the sea ' and it will be done if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer in john chapter jesus describes just how easy prayer can be truly truly i say to you he who believes in me will also do the works that i do and greater works than these will he do because i go to the father whatever you ask in my name i will do it that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it Sola fide Church of Christ, Scientist Prayer Theodicy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Baptism John the Baptist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Salvation Holy Spirit The nature of God in Western theology Urantia Justification (theology) Gospel of Thomas God God and gender Christian eschatology Ten Commandments Jesus Confession John Howard Yoder Evil Mary, the mother of Jesus Mass (liturgy) Love Idolatry Sin Sermon on the Mount Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Trinity Canonization Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Charles Darwin's views on religion Eucharist Miracles of Jesus Book of Isaiah Christianity Merit Hell Sabbath Rosary William M.
