high point church why may i ask is everyone so offended because the homosexual man didn't get his funeral i am an active member of highpoint and no one on this website seems to even know the whole story there were many complications arriving with this story all of which i am on pastor gary's side we discreetly say that we do not support homosexuality we do not support anything about it but we do love them hate the sin not the sinner we were unaware that the man was gay until we saw pictures promoting his homosexuality which yes included kissing pictures we were also unaware that the service would not be run by us but by a openly gay choir and gay speakers why does everybody have such a problem with this yes yes he was a veteren but no that is not the reason we aren't allowing the funeral so seriously what's the problem kiki sorry but i'm not ashamed i'm proud yes jesus loves the man yes it's god who judges the man but does that mean we have to let him have that service there we don't support it no one would judge us for not allowing a satanist to come in here and have his funeral service worshipping satan because well what christian church supports satan no i'm not comparing satanism to homosexuals so don't start a big hooplah about that high point church rocks i agree with everything you've posted Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Church of Christ Ex-gay Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexuality Lutheranism Religion and sexual orientation Anglican views of homosexuality Homosexuality Same-sex marriage Original sin Paradise Lost Fred Phelps Baptist Family First Party Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Roman Catholic Church Seventh-day Adventist Church Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anti-gay slogan Criticisms of Christianity Marriage Uniting Church in Australia Recurring South Park characters Homophobia Homosexuality and Judaism Sexual orientation Sin Jerry Falwell Exorcism LaVeyan Satanism 613 mitzvot New Testament Evil South Park Satan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Calvinism Holy Orders Salvation Reinhold Niebuhr Pope Paul VI Hell Christianity Sodom and Gomorrah Slow Train Coming Fallen angel Homosexuality and Scientology Orson Scott Card Christian Death Alan Campbell (pastor) Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Angel God Kyle Broflovski Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Christian anarchism Sun Myung Moon Mormonism and Christianity United Methodist Church Devil Apostles' Creed The Da Vinci Code Ascetical theology Eastern Orthodox Church Humphrey Bogart Homosexuality in China Slash fiction Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christian Identity Clerical celibacy Satanism Separation of church and state Chick Publications Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible North American Man/Boy Love Association Antichrist Rich Mullins Prophet Angels in America Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Salvation Army Metropolitan Community Church Bisexuality Justification (theology) Great Apostasy Criticism of Mormonism Judas Iscariot Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Minister of religion Avenue Q Sabbath Reparative therapy History of sex Mennonite Excommunication
