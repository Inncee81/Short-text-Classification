when did you first realize the bible for the most part is ludicrous fiction didn't it just always make no sense i remember when i was young and a christian the story of noah was especially hard to swallow for over years i was able to believe jesus was the son of god and also see the bible as only metaphors and parables i never took the bible to be as literally as my folks did i took this one year bible study course just on the ot and that s when i found out that the parts i thought were historical facts don t even line up like the wrong prophet with the wrong king at the wrong battle and it was first written down years after the fact that s when i learned about historical fiction the setting maybe a historical fact but what they said happened is fiction that really got the doubting started and the next year i took the same course on the nt and found out the same thing plus more like we don t know who wrote the gospel the first one mark was written at least to years after jesus died matthew and luke had a copy of mark with them when they wrote their books john was deliberately written to fill in the gaps and the arguments that the new christian faith was having these are stories passed on for years and years before written down none of these are first hand accounts even though they are written that way every religion has their spin on it but try to find the facts the conclusion i came up with is that there is little in the bible old or new that is fact it mentions places that are real but that s about it you can walk the streets where jesus carried his cross but did he really carry a cross i try to find sources out side the bible that mention the same thing the bible does like the census that was talked and why joseph went to bethlehem no record of it ever happening outside the bible this is not the stone age there was all kinds of trading with other countries something should have been mention somewhere about this massive disruption of the economy anyhow we base our faith on the stories of jesus in the gospels it they can not be proven as fact even by the roman empire then my faith is based on fiction what is my foundation well i learned that my foundation is not on a book but in a feeling i have the love of jesus christ fictional character or not is a real love it s a unconditional divine love i just decided to let go of the dogma and go with my feeling believe what i want to believe on faith no one can know that mind of god so why try the only thing true in the bible is that we should love one another as fill in the blank with any loving divinity has loved us shorty after this i embracced the witch within me and the goddess within the divine and became wiccan Resurrection of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Historicity of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Gospel of John Gospel of Thomas New Testament Mary, the mother of Jesus Gospel of Mark Book of Mormon Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Prophet Sabbath Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Biblical canon Historical Jesus A Course In Miracles Christian views of Jesus Apocrypha Christianity Nontrinitarianism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Cultural and historical background of Jesus Fundamentalism Idolatry Sin God Gospel of Matthew Abrahamic religion Names and titles of Jesus Acts of the Apostles Bible Trinity Holy Spirit Gospel Joseph of Arimathea Eastern Orthodox Church John the Baptist The Bible and history Baptism Book of Revelation Book of Isaiah End times Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Urantia Great Apostasy Alan Campbell (pastor) Soul Noah Book of Daniel Church of Christ The nature of God in Western theology History of the English Bible Religion Divine grace John Howard Yoder David Opus Dei Dispensationalism Moses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Apocalyptic literature Barabbas Bible and reincarnation Tribulation Apostle Jewish principles of faith Theodicy Hell Paul of Tarsus Christmas King James Version of the Bible Christianity and anti-Semitism Mythology Charles Darwin's views on religion Baptist Chronology of Jesus Gospel of Barnabas Aramaic of Jesus Judas Iscariot Charles Grandison Finney Sola fide Mormonism and Christianity The Pilgrim's Progress
