christians would you ever go to a pagan festival why or why not my answer is yes if we're both still around r s next year i'm going to go to wiccafest with riegan my reasons being not only do i think it would be fun but i also think it would be interesting and very educational i don't know any pagans in real life yeah yeah i know christians have adopted pagan traditions i mean a certain weekend where all sorts of pagans get together to celebrate their beliefs and dance around the fire i'm pagan and i hope that there are some open minded christians out there who would come to one of our gatherings they would see that we are not satanists or baby sacrificers i would love to see more christians meeting us and learning what we believe rather than believing in lies and stereotypes that have nothing to do with who we are as a pagan i've been to many christian churches synagogues etc why should those other religions not want to learn about us too Great Apostasy Christianity Christianization Midsummer Satanism Trinity Religious pluralism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Paganism Saint Sabbath Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Messianic Judaism Bl__t LaVeyan Satanism Religion Neopaganism Saint George Church of Christ Christmas Book of Revelation Sabbath (witchcraft) Salvation God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Satan Historical persecution by Christians Halloween Easter Witchcraft Kyle Broflovski A Course In Miracles Roman Catholic Church Priest Jewish views of religious pluralism Jesus Germanic Neopaganism Carnival Altar Heresy Tertullian Margaret Murray Roman mythology Christianity and anti-Semitism Ambrose Wicca Christian eschatology Evangelicalism Bible and reincarnation Historicity of Jesus Nontrinitarianism Devil Anti-Catholicism Religious Society of Friends Scientology beliefs and practices Judaism Jon Secada Prophet Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian-Jewish reconciliation Christian anarchism Christian cross Cultural and historical background of Jesus Procession Yule Religion in the United Kingdom Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Witch trial History of Christianity Idolatry Abrahamic religion Julian the Apostate Germanic paganism Celtic polytheism Goddess Ancient Greek religion Divine grace Justinian I Syncretism Freemasonry Eucharist Church Theology Clergy Resurrection Separation of church and state Church of Christ, Scientist Sacrifice End times Apologetics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin True Crime: Streets of LA S__ren Kierkegaard Abraham Clement of Alexandria
