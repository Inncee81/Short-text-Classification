how can christians say that the story of jesus christ is true when there are so many similar stories that predate christ decades and even centuries before buddah born of a virgin called the light of the world osiris died on a tree and was resurrected horus born of a virgin considered lord of lords and king of kings there are many others mithra sungod of persia krishna of india prometheus of greece the thing is is that christians think that christ's story is unique and that there were no others like christ however as you can see there are a lot of similarities among the different religions which leads me to conclude that the story of jesus christ is not original but is the compilation of all of these other stories to make it sound like one person never mind the fable mongers anyone who had ever bothered to study the christian religion and the bible had discovered that there is nothing original in christianity it's a mixture of pagan rituals and plagiarized myths of other religious writings if we are to accept religious stories as evidence we will end up with contradictory evidence there are many different religious stories from many different religious traditions and these stories contradict each other religious stories cancel each other out for every story there is another equally credible story that contradicts it and contradictory evidence is self defeating it is like having no evidence at all Resurrection of Jesus Historicity of Jesus Jesus Resurrection Religion Origin belief Book of Mormon Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Sabbath Horus Christmas The Two Babylons Trinity Religious Society of Friends Supernatural Christianity Mary, the mother of Jesus History of Christianity The Bible and history Creationism Religious perspectives on Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Saint Baptism Ten Commandments Christian eschatology Legend of Osiris and Isis Biblical inerrancy Binitarianism Abrahamic religion Christ Soul Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Religious pluralism Urantia Paul of Tarsus Prophet A Course In Miracles God Religion and mythology New Testament Heresy Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ, Scientist Theology Catholicism Eastern Orthodox Church Idolatry Liturgical year Biblical canon Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Restorationism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptist Existence of God Atheism Evangelicalism Church of Christ Nontrinitarianism Satanism Immortality Icon Cultural and historical background of Jesus Idolatry in Christianity The Da Vinci Code Mithraism Moses Neopaganism Apologetics Life-death-rebirth deity Sin End times Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Gospel of Thomas Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Secret Gospel of Mark Christian apologetics Gospel Greek mythology Book of Isaiah Pharisees Christian cross Religious conversion Jehovah's Witnesses Intelligent design Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints First Vision Holy Spirit Authorship of the Pauline epistles Eucharist Book of Daniel Gospel of Mark
