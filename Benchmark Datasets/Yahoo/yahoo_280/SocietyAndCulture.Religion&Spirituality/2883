i have a question for muslims hi i have several friend who are muslim ranging from very devout to in name only yet none of them have ever expressed they support the suicide bombings or yet there are some muslims out there who do http www vanityfair com politics features hitchens my questions to you is what are your thoughts on those actions do you know anyone who thinks they are justified what do you say to them when they express that opinion how do you personally attempt to show the public that islam is actually a peaceful religion have you ever been labeled as an extremist sorry there are several questions i've asked my friends this as well and wondered at what some r s'ers would say thanks in advance the sleestack cometh you are reported grow up fez fresh tea like that is a good question i really don't know what's your assumption my honest answer i've never understood that no matter how much i've tried no i don't know anybody who thinks that way haven't been in that situation i live my life everyday the best way i know how just like everyone else yes mostly online by fools that don't know me edit why is it you see so much more of this in europe than in the us i think that is a great question that needs to be answered i have my assumptions as i have lived in europe as a muslim i also work at an airport that has british flights come in every day and now this just makes me wonder what all the passengers think of me when they see me i've gotten a lot of questions from europeans before at the airport and inshaallah they have gone away with a better idea than what they came with edit i don't want to post them all here but honestly immigrants in america tend to adjust much more easily we are also larger as a country and therefore immigrants although they gather in certain areas are much more spread out i think we also have more restrictions on immigration although we have more immigrants we often look for skilled immigrants more than many other countries do so this means many are more educated our welfare system is not as large as many other nations one has to work to really make it here in america and i think that pushes ppl to work and they in turn become a part of society more than a group of marginalized people even though religion is not dead in europe it is definitely different than here in america their idea of secularism is different too it almost leaves religion to be a hobby only our history pushes us to believe that people come here for a better life and or more opportunities we have strong beliefs in relgious freedom due to our history many ppl may not agree but they hold onto this belief and until recenly we have never really felt threatened that we are being invaded many european countries have long histories of constant invasion and this clouds their perception of foreigners or things they perceive as foreign this is just a part of what i have observed Separation of church and state Fundamentalism Arab-Israeli conflict Yusuf al-Qaradawi Theory of conduct Patriotism Sexual orientation Religion Supernatural Nationalism Liberalism Religious pluralism Epistemology Islam as a political movement Philosophy State Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The nature of God in Western theology Religious Society of Friends Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Meaning of life Predestination Democracy David Hume Goodness and value theory Racism Judaism Scientology beliefs and practices Post-September 11 anti-war movement French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Islam in France Homophobia Bosniaks Jew Cult Ethics Philosophy of science Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Left-wing politics Freedom of speech Social psychology Anti-Americanism Status of religious freedom in France Intelligent design Pacifism War on Terrorism A Course In Miracles Evil Anti-Zionism Confucianism Creation-evolution controversy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism History of Islam Origin belief Sharia Islamic world France Zionism Sociology of religion Jiddu Krishnamurti Kemal Atat__rk Reality John Wycliffe Theology Cyprus dispute United Airlines Flight 93 Internet troll God Anthroposophy Theodicy Status of religious freedom in Iran Christianity Extreme Programming Conservatism Culture of France Media bias Supply and demand Ontological argument Polyamory Islam in Turkey Christian right Partition of India Social justice Morality Republic Scouting Existence of God Immanuel Kant Black (people)
