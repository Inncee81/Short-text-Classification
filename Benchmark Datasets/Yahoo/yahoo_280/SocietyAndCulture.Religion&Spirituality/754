christians this one is for you how many of you christians get some kind of pleasure or enjoyment from the belief that people who argue with you about religion or disagree with your religious beliefs will someday burn in and and know that you were right please if you are a christian and this is not you i do not care to hear from you this time i am only interested in hearing from the christians who get some type of amusement from the idea of people who oppose them burning in hell pastorart get used to it life is offensive imjstbob yes i do have some thoughts though you may have good intentions when you witness there are many people christians or not who are more interested in being right and having people admit they are right even some christians who start out with good intentions get caught up in the argument and lose focus on their point s they end up hating the person who disagres with them and wishing hell upon them why ask such a sadistic question well many people are sadistic honestly it seems to me that the relationship between christians and their god is very sado masochistic if god created hell and if he is the only one with the power to send people there christians say people send themselves but god made the rules didn't he it seems as though god is quite sadistic himself it only makes sense to ask a sadistic question to a group of people who worship a sadistic god i don't get pleasure from it but i often think about it i mean it's not great knowing some good people who don't accept the word will suffer but i mean i don't really feel sorry for those who reject it they'll get what's coming to them same for bad christians they'll get what they deserve Evil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theory of conduct Religion Sadism and masochism God Ten Commandments Goodness and value theory Christianity Sin The nature of God in Western theology Pascal's Wager Christianity and anti-Semitism Religious Society of Friends Atheism Fundamentalism Predestination LaVeyan Satanism Infant baptism Religious pluralism Divine grace Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Trinity Theology Hell Utilitarianism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ Theodicy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christian eschatology Islam Meaning of life Liberal Christianity Philosophical skepticism A Course In Miracles Great Apostasy Afterlife Chosen people Religious conversion Evolutionary creationism Abrahamic religion Gospel of Thomas Jewish views of religious pluralism Confucianism Judaism Capital punishment Baptist Heresy Satanism Leviathan (book) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an George Fox Karma Philosophy of religion Heaven Young Earth creationism Justification (theology) Morality Twelve-step program Nontrinitarianism Creationism Patriotism Jehovah's Witnesses Zoophilia Restorationism Faith Sexual orientation Abortion debate Ethics Ontological argument Socrates Eastern philosophy Christian anarchism Confucius Atomism Holy Spirit Mary, the mother of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Spiritism Existence of God Sacrifice Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Prophet Pacifism Church of Christ, Scientist Same-sex marriage John Howard Yoder Kyle Broflovski Genesis Historicity of Jesus Sharia
