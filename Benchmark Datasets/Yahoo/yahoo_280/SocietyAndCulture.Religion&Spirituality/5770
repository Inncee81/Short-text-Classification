a man from the homeless shelter asked this question why is it that only the christians comes out here to help us and feed us so i'm wondering is it true does any other religions help the homeless and other people in needs the majority of the worlds religions promote the practice of charity to those less fortunate in some religions charity is well organized in others it is on a more personal basis while more visible to the world the impersonal soup kitchen is probably less effective in promoting change than the personal touch of an individual giving directly to another i suspect this comment came from an individual living in a predominantly christian community probably in the united states it would be interesting to know more about the source of the comment in the meantime at a personal level i would encourage all to be charitable to others in every circumstance Mother Teresa Homelessness Religion Altruism Roman Catholic Church Charitable trust Opus Dei Evangelicalism Pacifism Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Coercion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Spiritism Health care in the United States Predestination Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Christianity Constitution of Ireland Sociology of religion Jehovah's Witnesses Unitarian Universalism Rudolf Steiner Islam in the United States Scientology Friedrich Schleiermacher Liberal Christianity Church of Scientology Christian ecumenism Baptist Affirmative action Utilitarianism Saint Council on American-Islamic Relations Sharia Paternalism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Homeschooling Christian right Supernatural Subud Alcoholics Anonymous Reparative therapy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Religious conversion Economic inequality Gift economy Simone Weil Judaism Marriage Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prem Rawat God Zoroastrianism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Prophet Fundamentalism Vegetarianism Rastafari movement Michel Henry Trust (Law) USA Poverty Property (ownership right) Meaning of life Conservatism Tzedakah Atheism Polygamy Freedom of religion Sexual orientation Anthroposophy Monk Homelessness in the United States Fasting United Methodist Church Public relations Mail fraud Landmark Education Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticism of Mormonism Tax Salvation Army Religion and sexual orientation Sant Thakar Singh S__ren Kierkegaard Culture of the United States Human sexual behavior Politics of the United States Trinity Religion and abortion The relationship between religion and science First Amendment to the United States Constitution Urantia Secularization Jiddu Krishnamurti Theology
