if people claim that atheists have no morals then what was the moral justification for the inquisition surely if someone who was religion and therefore had morals the inquisition would not have occurred so what was the moral justification for it key word is moral the reason why i said that is because i recently see a youtube clip from cnn abut atheism and this so called profesor of journalism said that atheist do not have morals that is what i am referring to she should as a journalist should have done some research before making such claims poster no home day so in short what you are saying is that divine command theory is more important than common sense meaning if god said i command you to kill people you will do it you're right but remember there is no moral justification for what stalin atheist did either or ziou xhang etc both were morally wrong edit retodd lol care to explain why what's good for the goose isn't good for the gander bkrak exactly you cannot claim all christians agree with what happened and are prepared to defend the inquisition on an individual basis i find it abominable does that count to you or am i being grouped together in your generalization Atheism Religion Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Strong atheism Existence of God Morality Philosophy David Hume Satanism Fundamentalism Young Earth creationism Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Moral objectivism Utilitarianism Antony Flew Philosophy of religion God The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Apologetics Witch-hunt Argument from morality Divine command theory Pledge of Allegiance Separation of church and state Jewish principles of faith Evil Free will Causality Goodness and value theory Charles Grandison Finney Objectivist philosophy Apostasy Patriotism Creationism Agnosticism Freemasonry Discrimination Philosophical skepticism School of Salamanca Charles Darwin's views on religion Naturalism (philosophy) Teach the Controversy Intelligent design movement Friedrich Schleiermacher Theology Problem of Hell Ten Commandments Problem of evil Justification (theology) Deism Occam's Razor Internalism and externalism Moral relativism History of creationism Value system Epistemology Philipp Melanchthon Church of Christ, Scientist Altruism Peter Singer Deity Chosen people Creation-evolution controversy Philo Criticisms of Christianity Roman Catholic Church Galileo Galilei Religious conversion Falsifiability Creation science Persecution of atheists Predestination Bertrand Russell Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Biblical inerrancy Intelligent design Divine grace Flood geology Salvation Book of Mormon Mother Teresa Economics History of philosophy Philosophy of science
