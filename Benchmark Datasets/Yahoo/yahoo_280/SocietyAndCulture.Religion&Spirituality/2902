why are yahoo atheists obsessed with things homosexual behavior a distorted and largely ignorant view of the book of genesis a distorted and largely ignorant view of revelation honestly at least of their posts are on those topics i put atheists in quotes because what they're more properly called christian haters and narrow minded ones at that come on atheists try coming up with new material we already know that you crave homosexual sodomy and don't understand genesis and revelation a lot of the ones that i met are so short on agruments that they resort to calling all theists especially christians stupid and ignorant that the only reason any one could believe in g d is by having a small amount of brain power to my knowledge the theories of science that atheists cling to are in no way support by facts there are no examples of evolution at work in fact most atheists have more faith in their theories then some people have faith in g d rather ironic when you think of it a lot of the ones that i met also claim to have read the bible and know all about it in reality they pick what they feel are the 'flaws' the 'bad parts' and then attack those thinking that it will unravel the whole thing personally i don't think it's just christians they hate but anyone that has faith in g d period christians just get targeted more because they are the majority in this country and you're right the majority of their posts are on these subjects and even with their prolific writing they still have no arguments that can hold water Atheism Religion Supernatural God Existence of God Soul Evolutionary creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion Phillip E.
