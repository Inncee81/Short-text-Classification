david and jonathon were homosexual the bible endorses homosexual behaviour and we shall provide one such example which is exemplified in the story of the relationship between daniel and the prince of the eunuchs the verse is vayiten ha elohim et daniyel lekhesed u'lerakhamim lifnei sar hasarisim daniel i e now god had brought daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs kjv the hebrew words which describe the relationship between daniel and the prince of the eunuchs are khesed and rahamim the first of these indeed means goodness kindness faithfulness the word rahamim however derives from the semitic root r h m which refers to a womb the kjv's rendering of rahamim as tender love would therefore entail and indespensible element of physical love or love which is manifested through physical contact now look at our two characters the prince of the eunuchs is of course an eunuch daniel in the opinion of the jewish commentators was also an eunuch hence an affair between them involving physical love would correctly be termed as a homosexual affair i e between an eunuch and another eunuch of course there is no twisting done to the sense or material of the verse which are presented as they stand some may object that it is quite impossible for an eunuch to have any sexual contact i would like to highlight this argument by pointing out an even more elementary matter the deprivation of the testes or external genitals in a man or boy does not result in the change of sex of the same to a woman or girl hence the tender love between daniel and the prince of the eunuchs would nonetheless remain a homosexual affair secondly the terms eunuch and castration are invariably spoken of male subjects the correct corresponding term for females is spaying thirdly why should one entertain the possibility that the eunuch as in daniel's prince of the eunuchs would have to be the a active sexual partner when the common sense assigns to him the passive role fourthly it is also abundantly clear that this is not the only homosexual affair from the bible it is also believed that jonathon and david too according to the biblical account were more than just the closest of friends they were passionate homosexual lovers hence from this brief exposition it is inconceivable that the word of god would condone such a horrible and unnatural sexual act as the bible obviously does samuel new international version new international version niv copyright by international bible society i grieve for you jonathan my brother you were very dear to me your love for me was wonderful more wonderful than that of women copied these from previous posts because they merit more discussion your thoughts so david and daniel david and jonathon hmmmmm since god creates homosexuals why would he not want his creations to find love it's just common sense you will recall how eunuchs were sexual outcasts in the ot but peter was guided to an understanding in the nt that eunuchs are also children of god the same is happening today with gay people as the holy spirit leads thousands and thousands of christians gay and straight to the understanding that homophobia is a sin i believe jonathan and david were much more than friends if you read the entire story there's no other conclusion how does one's love for a man pass the love of women that means it was stronger and more intense that doesn't sound like any heterosexual males i know in addition we can read these verses in samuel why would jonathan's father be so angry at the relationship then saul's anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die samuel
