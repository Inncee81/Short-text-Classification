my dear non believers have you really examined the bible i have had many non believers reply to my judeo christian centered questions in the negative but i wounder how many of you have really studied the bible and come to the conclusions of non belief that you have or are you just repeating someone else's logical arguments and calling them your ideas how many of you understand the validity of ancient's stories for all cultures are word of mouth story telling and how critical it was to know that the many stories and prophecies outside of the hebrew culture are based on the same principles of story telling many of you say that you are athiests and i wonder how many of you have read books by athiests that have come to a change of heart based on the scientific irrifutable facts of the study of ancient document keeping and the way ancient scociety preserved it's history the scientific process is the same for all archeologists faith based or not lee strobel the case for christ is a good start any thoughts i would hate to think that many of you would give up a chance to know for certian the extaordinary relationship you could have with god because scociety in the last years or so has done all it can to down play the importance of god in our national life and our personal life as well what do you do in the midst of personal tradgey the loss of a loved one or like the incident where do you turn to find answers to these questions to find peace in the midst of despair this world this nation has become so sinful and i personally don't believe that all athiests and non believers are a bunch of amoral people just doing what feels good how do you cope without god in your lives maybe this question is rhetorical but i know some of you sould reevaluste your lives and i hope this question is a catlyst to do just that my lord answers in mins i really like your points and appreciate your question i think you're getting at some good stuff and hopefully at least challenging believers and non believers to think Ten Commandments Religion Apologetics Book of Isaiah God Infant baptism New Testament Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Intelligent design Bible Resurrection of Jesus Jacob Neusner A Course In Miracles Trinity Christianity Biblical inerrancy Fundamentalism Judaism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Salvation Supernatural Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sin Meaning of life Church of Christ, Scientist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sola fide Intelligent design movement The Bible and history Theodicy Socrates Justification (theology) Origin belief Book of Mormon Reincarnation Kuzari Nation of Islam Apostasy Evil Jewish principles of faith Creation-evolution controversy Old Testament Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Young Earth creationism Goodness and value theory Baptism Messianic Judaism Sabbath History of creationism God and gender Aristotle Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Homosexuality and Christianity Revelation Free will William A.
