a question for the truly humble if humility is you basic demeanor why do you believe you have you much to be humble about or just no special gifts quakers ask humble i do not believe it is either an act or self delusion many saints and heros are said to have been humble but others were not why i hardly qualify to answer this one but i'm going to whack on it anyway lol i never have had any respect for all this humility thing i have no respect either for so called christians who actually make a virtue out of self humiliation and self denigration i am nothing but filthy rags i've heard some say i am worthless and i know nothing and can do nothing unless it is given to me from above bs every person was given a perfectly marvellous computer in his noggin and it can and has been used to accomplish amazing things sure that same brain has been used to accomplish great evil too but guess what down through all the pages of human history no greater evil has ever been perpetrated by man against his fellow man and against the planet that we all inhabit than what has been done in the name of this or that religion i think a vast number of people have been indoctrinated into the belief that the more they can prove they have suffered in this life and the more misery and hardship they have endured the better bit of prime real estate they will qualify for when they die and go to their heaven and if they think that maybe they aren't showing the signs of suffering enough they try to put their own foot on the scales on that side by ragging on themselves and declaring what worthless miserable wretches they truly are i'm proud of me i like me i admire me i made the average number of screwups in life by reason of my human status but i got up every time i fell down i dusted myself off and i keep on walkin' i survived and am damn proud of it i am not a wretch or a filthy rag lol and anybody who wants to argue the validity of my human status with me had better bring a whole sackful of vocabulary with him because i guarantee i can give tit for tat all day long and never break a sweat reaching for more i admire those who acknowledge their faults when they faulted and their failures when they failed but i admire even more those who are not afraid to stand tall and say darned if i didn't do a great job of that darned if i'm not proud of myself if people got more in the habit of being proud of personal accomplishments perhaps they would strive a lot harder to get some Theory of conduct Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eastern Orthodox Church Nicomachean Ethics Immortality Soul Humility Summa Theologiae Evil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Religious pluralism Paradise Lost Merit Abortion debate Altruism Religion Duties of the Heart Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Clothing Ten Commandments Babe Ruth Patriotism Reincarnation Angel Devil Atheism John Howard Yoder Meaning of life Rule of St Benedict Scientology beliefs and practices Hell Paul of Tarsus Intelligent design Book of Job Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Original sin Mojave people Objectivist philosophy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Alex Ferguson Alignment (role-playing games) Book of Mormon Roman Catholic Church Norway national football team Chosen people Supernatural Humphrey Bogart Philipp Melanchthon Capital punishment Evolutionism Charles Grandison Finney Opus Dei Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Moral objectivism Wang Mang Socrates Resurrection of Jesus Baptism John Wycliffe Urantia Surrender of Japan Epeli Ganilau Free will W.
