can the original gospel and the sermon on the mount be used to justify a war just personally i don't think the original kingdom gospel be used that way but i think the more popular pauline gospel can be and has been used that way my source http gospelenigma com but what do you think and isn't this an important question to be asking these days absolutely not when jesus says that we are to love our enemies that does not include spraying them with bullets or bombs we are to rise above our enemies and give them a change to change their hearts voluntarily by showing a better way if we sink to their level and use force we will see the hate violence breeding hate and violence cycle we see throughout our world today jesus tells us to overcome evil with good and he was willing to show us the way even though it involved the cross yes in the old testament the law was given at the level of do not murder and an eye for an eye but jesus clearly raised the bar on morality in his sermon on the mount when he said you have heard of old time 'an eye for an eye' but i say unto you 'love your enemies' in the old testament god was working through a particular nation and the concept of church and state were linked however jesus taught that the kingdom of god is within you and those who follow him are united into one kingdom no matter what earthly nationality they are from does it make sense then that christian brothers from different nations kill each other just because their earthly nations are at war Sermon on the Mount Sola fide New Testament Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Matthew 5 John Howard Yoder Christian anarchism Roman Catholic Church Salvation Paul of Tarsus Resurrection of Jesus Gospel of John Antinomianism Holy Spirit Legalism (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Merit Divine grace Jesus Evil Original sin Mary, the mother of Jesus A Course In Miracles Apostle Pacifism Didache Gospel of Thomas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Book of Isaiah Dispensationalism New Testament view on Jesus' life Apostolic Fathers Ten Commandments Sabbath Rapture Historical persecution by Christians Christianity Gospel Trinity Great Apostasy Christian views of Jesus Demon Theodicy Theory of conduct Cultural and historical background of Jesus Mary Magdalene Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Turn the other cheek Charles Grandison Finney Old Testament Fundamentalism Capital punishment John Wycliffe Pharisees New Testament apocrypha Book of Mormon Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Gospel of Mark Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Secret Gospel of Mark John Wesley Gospel of Matthew Ebionites End times Joseph of Arimathea Agap__ Nontrinitarianism Biblical canon Religion and abortion Soul Mass (liturgy) Gnosticism Rich Mullins John the Baptist Kingdom of Heaven Saint James the Just Calvinism Bible Aramaic of Jesus Council of Jerusalem Easter Liberal Christianity United Methodist Church Heaven Philipp Melanchthon Evangelicalism Mormonism and Christianity God
