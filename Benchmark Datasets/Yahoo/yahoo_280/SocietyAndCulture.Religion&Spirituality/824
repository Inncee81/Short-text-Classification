had anyone noticed that the overall process here is overwhelmingly nihilistic lets see here religion and spirituality christians piping on about how great god and jesus are blessing people and trying to convert them with fingers firmly lodged in ears atheists either futiley trying to deconvert christians or just mocking them for minutes of amusement eventually leading to account bans new accounts being made and the process repeating muslims trying desperately to convince everyone that they aren't out to blow up the world while whining about how hard done by they are all of it falling on deaf ears include also a dose of proselytisation in some meek attempt to out do the christians pagans wiccans trying to be mediators all playing the mild pacifist card and trying to foster respect and care between people but ultimately getting nowhere yet in their endless optimism they continue regardless and where does any of it lead nowhere this board is just a bluster of noise and self righteous fury in perpetual repetition no more and what difference can any of us make to this nothing people come and go but always fit into exactly the same positions as those who left no change no point no purpose any of us could be here or not and it would make no difference at all so if anyone was wondering why a nihilist like me hangs around here there is the answer for you this board proves me right silly humans flapping around in circles like stuck record they say a human never notices the glass bowl they're stuck in because by the time they have done a full circuit they don't remember being there before Religion Religious conversion Wicca Saint Atheism Nation of Islam Christianity Trinity Salvation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The nature of God in Western theology God Supernatural Predestination Nihilism Magic (paranormal) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Fundamentalism A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church Immortality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Soul Reincarnation Historical persecution by Christians Gesture Great Apostasy Jesus Free will Justification (theology) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philipp Melanchthon Witchcraft Afterlife Resurrection of Jesus Christian eschatology Persecution of Christians Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Goddess Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Charles Darwin's views on religion Noah John the Baptist Creationism Prayer Jewish views of religious pluralism Dianic Wicca Mother Teresa Christianity and anti-Semitism Mahatma Gandhi Gospel of Barnabas Theory of conduct Violin Islam and anti-Semitism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Creation-evolution controversy Eschatology Sant Mat Hearing impairment Church of Christ, Scientist Anti-Semitism Sola fide Religious pluralism Abrahamic religion Sin Origin belief The Shining (film) Existence of God John Howard Yoder Nontrinitarianism Pacifism Ancient Greek religion Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Moral objectivism Emanuel Swedenborg The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Iconoclasm Book of Mormon Spiritism Book of Isaiah Sant Thakar Singh Demon Proselytism Hebrew calendar Philosophical skepticism Perseverance of the saints History of Christianity Goodness and value theory Opus Dei Easter Original sin Revelation
