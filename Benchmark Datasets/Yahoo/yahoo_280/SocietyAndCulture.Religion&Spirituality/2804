what do you christians think of this be careful to observe only that which i enjoin upon you neither add to it nor take away from it if there appears among you a prophet or a dream diviner and he gives you a sign or a portent saying let us follow and worship another god whom you have not experienced even if the sign or portent that he named to you comes true do not heed the words of that prophet or that dream diviner for the lord your god is testing you to see whether you really love the lord your god with all your heart and soul follow none but the lord your god and revere none but him observe his commandments alone and heed only his orders worship none but him and hold fast to him as for that prophet or dream diviner he shall be put to death for he urged disloyalty to the lord your god who freed you from the land of egypt and who redeemed you from the house of bondage to make you stray from the path that the lord your god commanded you to follow thus you will sweep out evil from your midst deuteronomy ch ch i think that this passage tells the world pretty clearly exactly what jesus was and why he should not be worshiped jesus if the christians are correct in reading his message pointed to himself as another god ie i am the way the truth and the light and the torah first books of the bible is gods law and jesus seemed to fight against it tooth and nail he was a prophet who performed signs that came true for which people worshiped him unless you deny the underlying validity of the torah then there is no denying that this passage speaks cryptically of jesus and others like him if jesus came to fulfill the law why did he order his disciples to eat without washing their hands and make himself out to be the god incarnate which is blasphemy in the jewish tradition why if he came to fulfill the law didnt he do many of the things set out for the messiah to do such as becoming king of israel rebuilding the temple heck it wasn't even destroyed back then and winning military victories for israel over her enemies christian logic is of the time completely ignorant of the real bible the old testament tanakh rated j jesus said all who come to me shall have eternal life he was pointing to himself as another god speaks for itself spooky Jewish principles of faith Book of Isaiah Bible John the Baptist Korban Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Trinity False prophet Jeremiah Biblical canon Old Testament Resurrection of Jesus Dispensationalism Christian eschatology Cultural and historical background of Jesus Messianic Judaism 613 mitzvot Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Miracle Religious perspectives on Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church New Testament Moses Torah Chosen people Religion Holy Spirit End times Tetragrammaton Jewish views of religious pluralism Great Apostasy Biblical inerrancy Abraham John Howard Yoder Baptism Jewish eschatology Fundamentalism Repentance Ezekiel Christianity and anti-Semitism Nation of Islam Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Gospel of Barnabas Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Kabbalah Names of God in Judaism Amidah Monotheism Sin Christian views of Jesus Book of Ezekiel Mormonism and Judaism Religious conversion Isa Devil Divine grace Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Eucharist Names and titles of Jesus Maimonides Islam Heresy Satan Religious pluralism Book of Revelation Deuteronomy Book of Daniel Summa Theologiae Daniel Original sin Jerusalem Eschatology Paul of Tarsus Samaritan Sukkot Genesis Alan Campbell (pastor) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism
