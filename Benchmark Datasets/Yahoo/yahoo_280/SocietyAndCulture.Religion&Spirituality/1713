why do some xians keep insisting i'm a sinner i'm going to take one more stab at this sigh the standard rationale seems to be based on a bible verse claiming that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god i'd like to take issue with that there are many gods even the god of the bible admits this and i follow other gods applying biblical ideas of sin to me is like hindus blaming you for not burning enough incense to krishna or something isn't it or condemning artists for not being engineers doesn't fallen short of the glory of god seem like an unrealistic standard given that the god in question defines himself as perfect this seems like a classic catch to me he creates an inferior species and then blames them for his shoddy handiwork would you think a boss was fair who assigned you tasks for which you did not have the tools every human honest trait somehow gets redefined under this system as sin why i have to ask should i feel guilty about pleasure sin is for people who believe in it the rest of us are just making choices and living our lives that means that we are not 'all sinners' but good luck getting that across to a victim of brainwashing Sin Original sin Religion Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Salvation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Justification (theology) Theodicy Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Trinity Summa Theologiae Jewish principles of faith Religious conversion Hell Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Repentance Creationism Sabbath Divine grace Sacrifice Homosexuality and Christianity Reinhold Niebuhr Ten Commandments Demon Legalism (theology) Reincarnation Theology Merit Evil Ethics Charles Grandison Finney Prevenient grace Karma Calvinism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Devil Criticisms of Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Paradise Lost Problem of Hell Apostasy A Course In Miracles Moral objectivism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Christ Infant baptism Urantia Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Moloch Mortification of the flesh Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian apologetics Soul Free will Hindu Capital punishment Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Religious pluralism New Testament Cult Meaning of life Duties of the Heart Origen Presuppositional apologetics Intelligent design History of Christianity and homosexuality Theory of conduct God and gender The Fall of Man Vishnu John Howard Yoder Bible and reincarnation Confession Jewish views of religious pluralism Advaita Vedanta Miracle Halakha Alcoholics Anonymous Immortality Jesus Supernatural Opus Dei Mary, the mother of Jesus Fundamentalism Scientology beliefs and practices Christian eschatology
