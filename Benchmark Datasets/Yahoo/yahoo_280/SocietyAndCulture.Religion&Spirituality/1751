does god care about what kind of music you listen to for example what if you listened to a musician and he she has songs that may contain sexual content but then that same person has other songs that contain lyrics that are about life or love or having fun or whatever is it still wrong to listen to their music all together or is it alright to listen to certain songs your input would be very much appreciated note if you have nothing nice to say please refrain from answering thank you yes he does care about the type of music you listen to the bible says that god wants no man stealing his glory when you are listening to music that was not created for his glory then you are giving his glory to someone else the devil is the father of sin right fornication cussin etc are sins right therefore when you listen to music like this you are giving the devil glory the bible says that cain and abel both brought god sacrifices god accepted abel's but rejected cain's god accepted one and rejected the other what was the proof god's glory came down in the midst of the sacrifice he accepted god's glory was not reveal in the midst of the sacrifice he rejected the bible says to offer a sacrifice of praise therefore by this verse we see one thing if you are listening to music and god's glory is not reveal to you in the midst of the music then god has rejected it now why would you want to subject yourself to something god has rejected psalm says that people hide their hidden agendas within music paraphrasing the music today has many backwards messages within them this is why so many young females are getting pregnant and do not know why in a book called thought processes am scientist discovered that music is the only thing in the world that can make you do something you don't want to do music has the ability to teach you something you don't want to learn now answer me this song the best part of waking up now did you purposfully sit down and learn that foldgers commercial jungle now but it was taught to you by the music the music you are listening to are teaching you how to fornicate and get pregnant let the holy spirit lead you into all truth sis god bless you Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Original sin Sola fide Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses God Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Genesis Book of Isaiah Paradise Lost Religion Christian eschatology A Course In Miracles Salvation Roman Catholic Church Creationism Sin Holy Spirit Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Mary, the mother of Jesus John Howard Yoder Past teachings of Prem Rawat God and gender Sabbath Angel Book of Mormon Virgin Mary in Islam Great Apostasy Mortification of the flesh Prayer in Christianity Mass (liturgy) Repentance Predestination Abrahamic religion Psalms New Testament Revelation Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Divine grace Perseverance of the saints Korban Bible Adam and Eve Rastafari movement Chosen people Mission (Christian) Merit Cain Confession Church of Christ, Scientist Evolutionary creationism Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Religious Society of Friends Soul Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Opus Dei Religious perspectives on Jesus Binitarianism Jewish principles of faith Summa Theologiae Resurrection of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Slow Train Coming Anselm of Canterbury Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish views of religious pluralism Supernatural Satan Nontrinitarianism Rich Mullins Current teachings of Prem Rawat Blacks and Mormonism Leviathan (book) Spiritism Urantia Catholicism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Jehovah's Witnesses Apocrypha Biblical canon Baptism Purgatory Gospel of Thomas Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Articles of Religion (Methodist) Maimonides John Wycliffe Christianity Backward message Presuppositional apologetics George Fox Evil
