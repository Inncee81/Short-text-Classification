how do i get rid of this thought it keeps re playing over and over yes i am asking this question again i'll tell you why at the end ok so usually every night when i am laying in bed i start thinking what happens when we die and i usually end up imagining coming back as another person and so on then this though comes that is like this if we do come back as a different person every time we die then one day in the not so near future the world will end because the sun will get bigger and we wont be able to stand the heat so basically like what happens there will be no more earth for us to come back to we will be forever dead and it scares me really badly because i love life it's so hard to explain basically im so scared of the day that i die or the day when humans can no longer inhabit the earth scared the reason i am asking again is because the people who answered seem to know me so well saying such things as you really really need a girlfriend or time for bed kiddie well since you know me so well i would like to tell you a little about myself i am not a kid i am years old my occupation is real estate i sell luxury condos and private estates i make roughly dollars per year i have a fianc we have been together since our senior in high school i also have a degree in business as you can see i have my life pretty well in order so please do not include your childish remarks as they are completely inaccurate and you re just making yourself look foolish i appreciate anyone that can give me advice and when i say imagine coming back i don't mean imagine coming back as someone famous or anything i mean like i imagine coming back because that's what god has planned josh this is just such a complex question it would take a small book to answer it properly first you might want to consider just what is it that is reborn it sure isn't physical then you can see that there is absolutely no compulsion on whatever it is to be reborn on this planet there are plenty of others actually we may not need to be reborn in the gross physical at all maybe there are heavens and hells where we can go for a while if we think we deserve them s you can see that if we were to blow this planet to smithereens tomorrow and we could it would not make the slightest difference lastly consider this if you believe in god then he creates the whole universe multiverse from nothing not once but constantly the whole universe is coming constantly and wonderfully into existence moment by sparkling moment and that's not just me it's quantum mechanics as well there is nothing absolutely nothing which is not constantly held in creation by the loving action of god if god stopped loving every single tiniest part of this creation even for a split second the whole lot would instantly collapse in on itself and vanish so really what can possibly go wrong The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Intelligent design God Immortality Origin belief Supernatural Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Soul Reincarnation The nature of God in Western theology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Free will Christian eschatology Multiverse Theodicy Sin City Philosophy of space and time Quantum mechanics Determinism Time travel Many-worlds interpretation Sant Thakar Singh The Subtle Knife Physics Justification (theology) Atomism Phaedo Shaggy dog story Entropy Angel Summa Theologiae Pitaten Extreme Programming Cliff Richard Luminiferous aether Space opera in Scientology doctrine Merit Meaning of life Jon Secada Bah__'__ Faith and Science Property (ownership right) Religion Simone Weil Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Flood geology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Discworld gods Avenue Q Capital accumulation Heaven Cosmological argument Unicron Rich Mullins Vacuum EastEnders Sola fide End times Urantia Tenchi Muyo!
