any psychics out there can you tell me if i have any good news in the near or distant future thanks you so much no psychics aw well here's the i ching answer for your question consultation on friday august at am present mutual attraction question any good news for this person in the near or distant future the attraction of opposites is a powerful and fundamental force the image of this reading is that of the attraction between a young man and a young woman in the courtship stage in response to the magnetic attraction between them the masculine principle the creative outgoing seizes the initiative and submits to the feminine the receptive sensitive when the assertive is able to defer to the receptive and when the receptive accepts responsibility and exercises quiet leadership an exciting and profitable union is the result this brings good fortune for all success depends upon the effects of mutual attraction consistency is important in matters of mutual attraction for this is what separates courtship from seduction if you are by nature an instigator it is good to take the initiative but you must remain sensitive and highly principled and avoid the temptation to be manipulative let the power of mutual attraction pull you along if you are the receptive one keep your mind innocent and free of pride so that you may remain open to good advice or helpful assistance when your influence arises from innocence a powerful magnetic force is at work for you remaining open to the forces of attraction brings good fortune closing yourself to them heralds the death of the soul learn to yield to the natural tugs and pulls of the heart you cast several changing lines which indicates a number of changing possibilities in the situation the first changing line is line beware of knee jerk emotional reactions when the legs are ruled solely by the heart there is a tendency to rush off in all directions plan your moves carefully so that your energy is not dissipated and you are not harmed by an impulse to act the second changing line is line when the spirit moves you it is of no use to attempt to stand still avoid conscious plotting and manipulation for this will choke off the source of true feeling follow your heart the third changing line is line your will remains firm and wayward influences do not lead to confusion this indicates the resolve of someone whose beliefs are strongly held there is no cause for remorse in this however your dogged ambition to make progress could become so preoccupying that you no longer listen to positive suggestions or assistance do not allow impatience or fear to cause you to lose your ability to accept help or listen to good advice future the receptive this hexagram represents the quality of likely opportunities and challenges arising from changes that are in process now great receptivity attracts exceptional results a natural responsiveness brings about success through support and perseverance rather than through bold action thus the wise person demonstrates strength like a powerful but gentle mare this hexagram consisting of all yin lines represents a power of the feminine principle no longer honored in our modern world but such receptivity is most auspicious the receptive force is sensual as well as powerful and it can be missed by too much talk and planning when spring comes does the grass plan to grow this is a time to concentrate on realities rather than potentials with how to respond to a situation rather than how to direct it the mature mare lets herself be guided by a higher power and is skilled at graceful acceptance in a strong spiritual way her quiet contribution is most effective and brings success do not be too assertive at this time for if you try to direct things you are liable to become confused or alienated take your time draw strength from carefulness and you will be doubly fortunate focus more on feeling than on action be broad and deep in your attitudes so that you can accept everything that comes your way with grace and equanimity be receptive and spacious like the ocean let the river of changing developments flow to you allow others to take the lead for
