if there was anyone in the world you would want to be who would it be and why it may seem odd since i am a year old with various health problems but i honestly cannot think of anyone i would rather be there is enough that i do like about my life that i cannot imagine giving it up to go hustle and bustle in the way anyone does who is famous and i could not describe the specifics of some non famous person i envy except to imagine i would like to have children and grandchildren but then many people find their relatives a burden and a trial and i know i had a sufficiently strange life that my children probably would have a lot of emotional problems around having a mother like me the fact is it really is better to be the person you are than to envy others The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Polyamory Who is a Jew?
