do all the prophets say none will come after me surely we have to clean this up once and for all inshallah i call upon all religious people to please help in understanding what all that means surely we can't all be right or can they be all saying the very same thing about each other in succession as allah swt described in the quran years ago in perfection i thank you very much for all that and you know i am going to ask everyone to come in cause there is some brothers out there and sisters that just don't know they are believers but they really are thank you salam thanks for posting your evil we make questions like this with clear proof just to expose you but we just gave away our secret on the battle field we have this discussion coward not before the inocent and the women moron dj god bless and peace i always appreciate scripture peace unto you brother salam first you are assuming muhammad is a prophet of god deut if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul a prophet of god must be in agreement with the words of the prophets and the known word of god john who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father john beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god anyone who claims to be a prophet of god must agree jesus is the christ the son of god who is our savior john for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist gal but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed if an angel or a man preach a different gospel he is not of god the word god gave to moses aproximately bc the gospel ad this is the word of god available to muhamamd in ad all prophets must be in agreement and in agreement with the word of god and the prophets of god any angel must be tested to see if he is in agreement with god muhamamd claims to have spoke to an angel who was not in agreement with the word of god nor the prophets of god the allah of the qu'ran says he is the god of abraham and yet disagrees with the god of abraham the qu'ran says the word of god can not be changed yet disagrees with the word of god Qiyamah Sabbath
