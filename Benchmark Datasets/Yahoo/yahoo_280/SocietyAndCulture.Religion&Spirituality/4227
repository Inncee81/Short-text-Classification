i wonder why when people put questions on here about their not being a god and wanting proof when you answer their question they block you from answering any more of their questions i guess they maybe afraid that they would actually get an answer to some of their child like statements but hey that's what i get for thinking that these were sophiticated questions about god and not some that a child may ask by bad in a word confrontation the predominate question posed by atheism is 'how can you prove that god exists' and the application inappropriate and or lame scientific methodology scientists appreciate the disparity between science and faith the uninitiated spoof the scientific method in an attempt to lend it's credence to denial of god in the vernacular these types go by various labels some of the least offensive including 'high school harry' and 'betty bigot' but i diverge the fundamental issues is acceptance of disparate belief systems and religious people have their own problems in this area as well as a person who works in the scientific community a number of my colleagues and close friends are atheists we regularly converse dine and engage in a multitude of social interaction without issue because we engage each other in meaningful diversions value the opinions of each other and even seek each other out for advice from time to time never has one of these atheist friends of mine confronted me over my decline of an invitation to attend church services or some religious meeting and a number of us remain lifelong friends the 'proof' that god exists is in the heart and the soul of man not the rigidity of the scientific method if this offends some then so be it i am available to chastise for my beliefs most week days at this address i only block the profane not those who differ with my belief system Atheism Religion Existence of God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Supernatural Creation-evolution controversy Creationism The relationship between religion and science Intelligent design movement Scientific method Biblical inerrancy History of Christianity Protestantism Intelligent design Christianity Sexual orientation A Course In Miracles Teach the Controversy Falsifiability Young Earth creationism Cultural relativism Philosophy of mathematics Jewish principles of faith Meaning of life Phillip E.
