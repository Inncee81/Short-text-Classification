a question about pro life deuteronomy this day i call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that i have set before you life and death blessings and curses now choose life so that you and your children may live how can you say with this scripture that god would not want us to be pro life god created people who throw away babies in trash cans' so that makes it ok to abort before birth help me understand that a jewish view or a christian's view of when life begins is not necessarily when god says life begins where is scripture does it say life begins at birth i want to see the passage please anjel i am so sorry to hear that you had to go through a rape and at the age of how horrible please know that my question was not meant to offend anyone either god bless you theresathegreat i totally understand that this passage of scripture does not just mean abortion but how could you say it doesn't relate choose life and your children will live you are right saying god gave us free will and therefore god is pro choice is ridiculous free will is our right to choose god or not when we choose abortion we are exercising our free will to choose against god and against life god is not pro our right to choose an abortion he creates and cares for each life the bible also says 'before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you i have appointed you a prophet to the nations jeremiah this tells us two things god is the one that forms life in the womb and that god has a plan and purpose for that life it is by design that a child is conceived and grows in it's mother's womb this is divine because each of us is created in god's image but it is also natural in that our nurturing instinct is inate a pregnant woman and mother will do anything to protect her offspring yet with abortion we see women daily going against their instinct and against their divine calling women should stand up for their rights their right to not be duped by the feminist skewed view i was part of that movement at one time i thought pro choice was pro woman i thought abortion gave us the ability to be equal to men after all men were not the ones saddled with babies and day care etc i thought if men can run around having sex without consequence then women should be given that same right oh how very wrong i was it's not about our right to have sex sex is not a right it is a gift it purpose is procreation and the gift of love is children new beings created in the image of god god is pro life god knows when a sparrow falls how much more must he care and love each one of us Abortion debate Ten Commandments Mary, the mother of Jesus Free will Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Original sin God Trinity Virgin Mary in Islam Religion and abortion Roman Catholic Church Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Angel Summa Theologiae Priesthood (Mormonism) Predestination Justification (theology) Dispensationalism God and gender Eastern Orthodox Church Biblical inerrancy Prophet Soul Book of Isaiah Christian views of women Judaism Christianity John the Baptist Birth control Christian eschatology Fundamentalism Religious conversion Urantia Repentance Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sin Book of Mormon Christian views of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John Howard Yoder Sola fide Sabbath Grimke Sisters Satan Hell New Testament Abrahamic religion Genesis Holy Spirit Idolatry Salvation Religion and sexuality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Blacks and Mormonism Opus Dei Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abortion Jacob Same-sex marriage Children of God Chosen people Feminism Duties of the Heart Creationism Philo Abortion in the United States Names of God in Judaism Reincarnation Demon Human Creation according to Genesis Religion Jeremiah Moses Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Socrates Mormonism and Christianity Divine Providence A Course In Miracles Pro-choice Separation of church and state
