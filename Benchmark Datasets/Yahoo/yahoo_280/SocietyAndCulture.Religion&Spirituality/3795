christianity to atheism many have gone this route but have any because of the influence of this forum this forum is an eye opener i know the general remark stick around and you'll learn the real truth eventually but really has anyone given up on christianity from influence from the r s forum forums like this help people to understand other people they only reinforce behavioral patterns of believers and non believers people get more inclined on how these people behave in forums forums are too limited to have a more complete discussion about christianity and atheism so i don't think issues really have an effect to people who enters this forum so i guess what influence people in this group is more about people reactions and their social behaviors rather than the issue about atheism and christianity itself Atheism Social psychology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.
