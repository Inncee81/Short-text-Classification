what does speaking in tongues mean my neighbor told me she quit going to church because one day she spoke in tongues and it really scared her what exactly does this mean what happens thanks what do you mean language of god is it supposed to be a language nobody knows but god why does it happen she didn't want to talk about it do you believe it happens speaking in tongues differs depending on who you talk to to pentecostal charasmatic churches it is a spiritual language that needs to be translated and that the holy spirit can understand wikipedia gave a good example of the most common thought on tongues in mainstream christianity in the new testament the book of acts recounts how tongues of fire descended upon the heads of the apostles accompanied by the miraculous occurrence of speaking in languages unknown to them but recognizable to others present as their own native language the phenomenon described in the book of acts is variously interpreted either as religious xenoglossia the speaking of an actual foreign language or as the gift of interpretation being given to those present the ability to understand the tongues each person in his own language some of the orthodox hymns sung at the feast of pentecost which commemorates this event in acts describe it as a reversal of what happened at the tower of babel as described in genesis in other words the languages of humanity were differentiated at the tower of babel leading to confusion but were reunited at pentecost resulting in the immediate proclamation of the gospel to people who were gathered in jerusalem from many different countries although the apostle paul commands church brethren do not forbid speaking in tongues cor and that he wishes those to whom he wrote all spoke with tongues cor and claims himself to speak with tongues more than all of the church at corinth combined i thank my god i speak with tongues more than you all cor paul discourages simultaneous speaking in tongues directed at people rather than god lest unbelievers think the assembled brethren mad cor tongues says paul is speaking to god rather than men mysteries in the spirit cor edifies the tongues speaker cor is the action of the praying of a person's spirit cor and serves to bless god and give thanks cor in cor and cor paul indicates that not all christians speak in tongues although some churches interpret paul to be talking about church meetings there are many that believe that all believers have the ability to speak in tongues mark as a form of prayer based on cor eph and jude paul also refers to the prophecy of speaking in tongues written by isaiah isa biblical descriptions of persons actually 'speaking in tongues' occur three times in the book of acts the first two coupled with the phenomenon of the baptism with the holy spirit and the third with the laying on of hands by paul the apostle at which time they 'received the holy spirit' which embued them with the power of the holy spirit god is the god of order and beauty i try very carefully not to judge how other people worship but when you have whole congregations speak unintelligably and to the benefit of no one around them if not to the detriment because of the distraction it just strikes me as odd if suddenly i felt possed and words started popping out of my mouth that i could not understand and therefore was no benefit to me spiritually and actually caused fear i would not attribute that to god and would drop to my knees in prayer paul used the gift of tongues to be able to teach many people across many nations and not to jump around and fall into convulsions while screaming Mass (liturgy) History of Christianity Resurrection of Jesus God Apocrypha Divine grace Origen Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Mormonism and Christianity Bible Jehovah's Witnesses Abrahamic religion Christian denomination Apocalyptic literature Great Apostasy Saint Peter Original sin Didache Protestantism Historical Jesus Merit Idolatry Names of God in Judaism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Prophet Christian views of Jesus Urantia Salvation Easter Justification (theology) End times Religious Society of Friends Religious pluralism Coptic Christianity Biblical inerrancy John Wesley Jerusalem Restorationism Martin Luther New Testament view on Jesus' life Catholicism Prayer in Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Predestination Supernatural William M.
