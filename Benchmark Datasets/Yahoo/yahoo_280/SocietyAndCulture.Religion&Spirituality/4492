isnt there a real good chance that religion was all made up dont wanna offend anybody but think about it religion started long ago and it could have been just made up to give people something to have faith in and have something to look forward to after death it also helped give guidelines on how to live within a society dont kill respect your parents dont lie dont steal hmm maybe something a governement would want eventually people created new religions b c they didnt wanna follow these rules anymore also the koran has many similarities to the bible so whoever created the koran could have chose what they like from the bible and kept it in and then added what they wanted after people also didnt have good ways of keeping records so maybe thats why theres all these different interpretations of certain things im just writing stuff here dont take it too seriously or anything im just wondering ive never studied religion and im not very religious so i dont know much about it this is just a year old being curious i asked this before but i just want to see more views on it thanks long ago it was discovered that peasants wanted to know the answers to all sortsa things some scamming bastards got together and realised there was a dollar to be made if they could con the gullible with outlandish claims of an invisibleman in the sky it worked they made up more and more elaborate stories and the gullible feasted on them and continue to feast on them cos they never got over losing their security blanket or their teddy bear if you're interested in religion have a read of the bible xian tales qur'an muslim tales and bhagavad gita hindu tales you will realise they all tall tales the gullible feed on although you will wonder why anyone would subject themselves to such insanity have fun but don t take anything they say seriously cos it s easy to get lost in temptation of fellowship with other slaves Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Hinduism Bhagavad Gita Origin belief Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Islam Qur'an Fundamentalism Hindu Idolatry Nation of Islam Separation of church and state Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dhimmi Mary, the mother of Jesus Religious conversion Supernatural Holy Spirit Magic (paranormal) Resurrection of Jesus Mahatma Gandhi A Tale of a Tub Church of Christ, Scientist God Reincarnation Status of religious freedom in Afghanistan Moses Yusuf al-Qaradawi Abrahamic religion Christianity Confidence trick Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Monotheism Soul Prayer Theology Alcoholics Anonymous John Howard Yoder Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Theodicy Evolutionary creationism Prophet Noahide Laws Chosen people Theory of conduct Mythology Creationism The Amber Spyglass Rastafari movement French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Saint Hindu philosophy Meaning of life Jewish views of religious pluralism Apostasy Devil A Course In Miracles Ocean's Twelve Vegetarianism and religion Krishna Marriage Religious perspectives on Jesus Buddhism John the Baptist Cultural and historical background of Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Adam and Eve Indian caste system EastEnders Charles Darwin's views on religion Great Apostasy Gospel of Barnabas Islam and anti-Semitism Gandhism Abortion debate Discordianism Simone Weil Jehovah's Witnesses Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Sin City Religious Society of Friends The nature of God in Western theology Bible Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Sin Sabbath Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ottoman Empire Guru Twelve-step program
