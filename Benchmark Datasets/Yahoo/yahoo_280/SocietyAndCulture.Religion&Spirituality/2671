was he wrong science without religion is lame religion without science is blind albert einstein i don't really agree with him on this but maybe the high school science geniuses will find a reason to moderate your 'people who believe in religion are stupid' pronouncements devampyregod i don't believe in either part of it i don't believe science needs religion i believe it needs to be religious to the laws that govern it open mindedness about its own limitations and the limitations of scientific theory i agree with einstein's s statement about a law giving god but not with the implied need for any religious doctrine by science nor by anyone else i've not come across this before but i think he was correct there is an essential balance that is needed where the scientist needs to keep his feet on the ground or maybe 'in it ' even i know little but i believe that a geneticist is just possibly 'monkeying about' with something that is likely to endanger us in some way and be more dangerous that a fool with a loaded gun no disrespect to 'geneticists ' by the way sash Supernatural Falsifiability Scientific method Intelligent design Albert Einstein Religion Science The relationship between religion and science Creation-evolution controversy Gravity Meaning of life Isaac Newton Bah__'__ Faith and Science Creationism Phillip E.
