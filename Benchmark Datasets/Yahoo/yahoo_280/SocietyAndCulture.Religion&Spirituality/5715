can wicca perform magic i'm not a wicca expert i just found this article on the web some people call wicca the old religion although it is of fairly recent origin it is based on the goddess and a god worship religious practices of our pagan ancestors it offers a viewpoint on life that gives an awareness of our place in the universe and a structure of worship through which people can partake in the mysteries of nature and fulfil their needs for shared human activity by doing this with others natural magic and an understanding of nature is an integral part of the religion the religion believes as is common with pagan religions that we have within all of us powers that can be used actively to make things happen this is termed magic it differs from other religions in the status that it accords its members all initiates who enter are priests and priestesses with the authority to perform for themselves the rituals and spiritual exercises necessary for their spiritual development wicca doesn't offer entry into a congregation of followers rather an initiation into the priesthood in offering this form of entry it gives a form of spiritual training which develops self knowledge and understanding so that we can in turn facilitate the spiritual growth of others true wicca is not a religion which goes out and seeks to make converts instead it provides signposts for those who wish to find it those who enter the path are also initiated as witches as well as priests and priestesses using a form of worship and spiritual system that draws on three main customs that of the original fertility cult that of the occult practice in general and that of the pagan mysteries training as a witch involves a system for developing and using psychic and magical power the practice also opens up an awareness of one's own spiritual needs and those of others and it has a profound influence on human consciousness this has just been a short introduction there are more resources about macick in the other sections of the site and at our online store you will find magical incense and a growing selection of spells and magical items Neopaganism Dianic Wicca Shamanism Religion Satanism Magic and religion Voodoo Eastern Orthodox Church Paganism Priest Church of Christ Animism Eucharist God Ancient Greek religion Christianity Stregheria Esotericism Judaism Taoism Hinduism New Age Shinto Yoga Religion and mythology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman Catholic Church Opus Dei Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sacrifice Hecate Human Religious conversion Trinity Anarchism and religion Iglesia ni Cristo Witch-hunt A Course In Miracles Roman mythology Urantia Mythology Jehovah's Witnesses Lady Frieda Harris Spirituality Gerina Dunwich Religious pluralism Ten Commandments Neuro-linguistic programming Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mithraism Cult Discordianism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Horned God Jean Houston History of Christianity Priesthood (Mormonism) Protestantism Idolatry Baptism Spiritism Saint Psychology of religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Gnosticism Chaos magic Subud Supernatural Calvinism Pharisees Messianic Judaism Meaning of life Eastern philosophy Great Apostasy Eleusinian Mysteries Anthroposophy Heresy Rudolf Steiner Mormonism and Christianity Unitarian Universalism Fundamentalism Sociology of religion Exorcism Abrahamic religion Idolatry in Christianity Mysticism Soul Religion in Japan Goddess Celtic mythology Historical persecution by Christians RuneScape gods Sabbath Endowment (Mormonism)
