is grace really unfair the wonder of grace i am told is that it is unmerited several people including philip yancey in his well known book what's so amazing about grace described it as unfair because it is given to us despite the fact the we don't deserve it particularly as some are selected over others the others seem to be rather glossed over now if i saved one person out of many from a natural disaster i would not be unfair because i chose one and not another however suppose i have an unlimited budget time and resources but still chose to only save a few of the survivors and left the rest to starve would that still not be unfair the problem with such human analogies if that we have limited power limited time limited ability i would not be unfair only because i can't do it for everyone choosing is morally neutral only because of this so grace is called unfair but for a being with unlimited power to be unfair is ipso facto unethical romans only states that god is powerful and we're not skirting the ethical issue entirely does unfair grace make god morally deficient let us examine this from a different perspective if the united states were to state that anyone willing to abide by its laws could become citizens is that unfair is it unfair that some men recieve pardons or stays of execution on death row in prison christ has stated that both belief and obedience is necessary for salvation reception of the merciful unearned gift or grace now the punishment for sin is death correct therefore all mankind is on death row so to speak because of the acts they have committed since all mankind has sinned at least once from the littlest lie to the brutalest act ever committed all fall under one term sin since they all stem from corruption in the spirit what would be truly unfair is if god was unmercifull for all mankind would shurely perish even though it would still technically be fair since he has warned mankind from the beginning not to do these things and that his vengeance would be against those who do knowing this is grace then unfair or is it rather a demonstration of love toward those whom have not earned it as a parent i can say that it is easy to forgive the child which tries to be obedient and hard to forgive the child which is outrightly and defiantly disobedient i manage however to do both since i love all of my children yet if i watched my child obedient or disobedient be brutally torturered by those who hate me i truly do not know whether i could restrain my wrath let alone forgive them though i would try yet god is greater than i and has done just that when his obedient son was torturered and then murdered right in front of him god allowed it and his obedient son willingly undertook this act so that even a remnant could be found worthy of life instead of the death they had personally and individually chosen by their own words and actions yes together they acted to give pardons fairly to those on death row that were willing to change their ways from the way of death to the way of life murderers still willing to murder will receive their punishment but murderers that refuse to do or think murder are pardoned the first still desires spiritual corruption and its consequences the second seeing the evil within tries to weed out the same corruption with the help of god therefore finding grace in god's sight for obedience demonstrates love yes i find that god is eminently fair paul Summa Theologiae Calvinism Baptism Predestination Theodicy Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church Merit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evil A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Charles Grandison Finney Free will Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Infant baptism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Abrahamic religion Hell Paradise Lost Christianity Moral objectivism Jehovah's Witnesses Repentance Christian anarchism Socrates Alignment (role-playing games) Five points of Calvinism Jewish principles of faith Legalism (theology) Religious pluralism Heaven Torture Problem of Hell Property (ownership right) Indulgence Confession Perseverance of the saints God Opus Dei Religion Goodness and value theory Prevenient grace Eucharist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Karma in Hinduism Abortion debate Ethics Rule of St Benedict Appeal Trinity Ascetical theology Christian eschatology Altruism The Pilgrim's Progress Sin City Dispensationalism Purgatory Urantia Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Mary, the mother of Jesus Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Soul Book of Isaiah Church of Christ School of Salamanca Total depravity John the Baptist Heresy Apostasy in Islam Atheism Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religious views of suicide Separation of church and state Sub-Zero
