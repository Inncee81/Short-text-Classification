this whole story of people saying they are christians and acting like they aren't can i tell you my story afraid someone will call this a rant i have been working for a realtor who hired me after the motel i managed was sold out from under me i managed it two years so this realtor says she is a catholic and believes in god appreciated me praying for her to prosper and she had tripled her income or maybe more since i came to work there i worked for way less than i'm worth until she could afford more and now that she is prospering she replaced me with her daughter who was out of work with no apology now i say this is a real life example of someone saying they are christian and not acting like one does this make me not believe in god certainly not do you think i should just throw in the towel on christianity now or do you think i should pray and forgive her and move on and trust god for justice sometime in the future christians i know the right answer still what would you do in my shoes i was used and thrown away like an old milk jug what do you think it may seem trivial unless you have experienced the same injustice time and time again thanks isis for the compassion the reason it was faith shaking is i worked hours for free spent my own money painting and fixing her office because i believe we will reap what we sew therefore when i give all i have i believe i will reap a harvest see and sometimes it's in your face that is not true as quickly as we would like attention i am not planning to abandon my faith in god i was asking a thought provoking question okay and i just wondered have some of you put your heart and soul into something never to do it again because you have been hurt like this i plan to forgive pray and go put my heart and soul into something else believing god to bless me thanks for those who offered encouragement some of you the reason we don't take our masks off and how ourselves vulnerable to you is you kick us in the face when we do god bless you and peace out have a bless ed day i can't file for unemployment i was working as an independent contractor the sooner you let go and forgive the better for you if you don't forgive she has the ability to keep you in bondage to your hate feelings and it will keep the blessings of god locked up my advice forgive quickly and move on and pray for god to have mercy on her because if you know the word then you already know that she has it coming if you know what i mean and then praise god for the new job he has lined up for you so that you can move into your blessing it is on the way god bless you Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Divine grace Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Isaiah Merit Muslim ibn Aqeel Indulgence Amidah Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sola fide Sin Summa Theologiae John Howard Yoder Simone Weil Mary, the mother of Jesus Fiddler on the Roof Roman Catholic Church Christianity Repentance A Course In Miracles Salvation Qiyamah Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Martin Luther John the Baptist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God Christian eschatology Religion Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Ten Commandments Mass (liturgy) Abrahamic religion Saint EastEnders Avenue Q 613 mitzvot Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Dead Like Me Cliff Richard Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Soul Genesis Infant baptism Opus Dei Ayyavazhi mythology John Wesley Jacob Anselm of Canterbury Holy Spirit Religious Society of Friends God Emperor of Dune Trinity C.
