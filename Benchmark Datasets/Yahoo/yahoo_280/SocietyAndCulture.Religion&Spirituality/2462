finding peace with theology okay i'm going to post this in both the mental health section and the religion and spirituality section since i don't really know which it belongs in i've always been obsessed with theology i started becoming completely taken in by it when i was about and was amazed by the different belief systems and religions of the world i hopped from church to church and from religion to religion on the one hand wanting to 'settle down' into the 'true religion' and on the other hand just wanting to learn and see as much as possible i've just turned and it's starting to seem like a burden the problem isn't just 'finding the right religion' although undoubtedly that's a part of it but rather an unceasing power it has over my life even my dreams are religious my whole life it's been an almost schizophrenic thought pattern and i never seem to be able to escape thinking about it it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just who i am and i've learned a lot but i can't switch off and it's exhausting even though i can see the world around me it seems to have almost lost it's value worldly things stop mattering when all you can think about is what's beyond that what should i do you sound far more spiritual than many people have the privilege remind yourself that you are still alive still human and still need to delve into the well explored facets of living in a addition to pondering upon the unknown come down to earth on occasion just don't be afraid to spend the majority of time as you are now with your head in the clouds Meaning of life Theology A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Opus Dei Religious pluralism Alcoholics Anonymous Reality Human Soul Max Weber Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friedrich Schleiermacher Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Immortality Animism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sexual orientation Simone Weil Reincarnation The Amber Spyglass Emanuel Swedenborg Justification (theology) The nature of God in Western theology John Howard Yoder Protestantism Theory of conduct Sant Thakar Singh Gospel of Thomas Supernatural Scientology beliefs and practices Duties of the Heart Jewish philosophy Roman Catholic Church Religious Society of Friends Theodicy Creationism Satanism Predestination Atheism Church of Christ, Scientist Sikhism Abortion debate Abrahamic religion Religious conversion Infant baptism Ontological argument S__ren Kierkegaard Christianity Procrastination Buddhism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sant Mat Christian apologetics Belief Afterlife Scientology Joseph Campbell Shaggy dog story Francis Crick Trinity George Fox Religion and sexual orientation Force (Star Wars) Extreme Programming Human nature Eucharist Property (ownership right) Jehovah's Witnesses Development of religion Ten Commandments Separation of church and state Gnosticism Alchemy John Wesley Bertrand Russell Causality Past teachings of Prem Rawat Christian-Jewish reconciliation Spirituality Deism Jiddu Krishnamurti Intelligent design Cult LaVeyan Satanism Bosniaks Meme Existence of God Origin belief Anthroposophy Summa Theologiae Urantia Brahmanism Survivor (novel)
