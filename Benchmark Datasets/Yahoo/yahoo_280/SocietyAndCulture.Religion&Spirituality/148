islam and christianity sister faiths many people say that they are sister faiths that they should just get along because they are the same this is soso wrong this couldnt be more opposite the bible is all about love the quran is about hate christians are told to love thy neighbor to show christs love through there love islam teaches that if they dont accept islam that you need to fight them to rage jihad holy war until they are either dead or accept islam whats your opinion ok i see i pushed some buttons where do i start ok first off please call me dan not dan shambah cus that just sounds weird lol ok please dont try and tell me the history yes i know that all three stem from abraham i know the family line i could explain to you how christianity begun how it spread from jews to gentiles ad wen the separation was but to be honest i dont have the time now i read that christians jews are told to be cursed by allah being apes and pigs pagans and inferiors is this true 'fight and slay the pagans where ever you find them' surah proof enough ok here is why i cannot accept islam judaism and christianity as being sister faiths islam denies the core of christianity i will write it in the next post that they said we killed christ jesusthe son of mary the messenger of allah but they did not kill him nor crucified him but it was made to appear to them and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no knowledge but only conjecture to follow for a surety they did not kill him surah christians believe that christ died for our sins on the cross this is the core of our beliefs and islam directly denies this yet they still manage to be sister faiths and please tell me anywhere in the bible that incites to death and violence i will either put it back into context for you or explain what it was talking about please tell me and i like to think i know my bible very well so give me some scriptural evidence you cannot make a statement like that and leave it unsupported no i do not know how disrespectful it is and report me all you like in short im not ashamed of the god i serve the bible is not all about love its full of smiting and hate and bigotry rape murder war the same with islam and judaism the three most awful religions ever contrived by humankind imo there was a few of these answers saying the bible is about hate etc please give me some scripture reference for this and i will gladly explain it to you ok you can talk to me all you want in lament terms you can look at my picture and think oh his young i can just use big words i know my bible well i know my history well so talk to me like a normal person do not try and look down upon me and put yourself in a position of power above me because you do not have any power over me talk to me like a normal person lets have a mature debate ok i am not saying that all islamics are terrorists or that they all want to kill christians and rule the world dont get me wrong yes there are many extremists yes you get them in all religions and yes you could call me an extremists because i can feel the fire i can feel the love that god has for everyone and i just want to tell everyone yes for a matter of fact i do watch the news just last night i was watching a program about coalition forces working together with military insurgents to fight the extremists who blow up stuff this is why the leader of one of the groups saw a man on his property he was planting explosives for the us army that was going to pass by soon he confronted him and asked what he was doing and he was told straight out he said that there was enough explosives there to kill his entire family in the blast and the reply he got was yes but its ok because is jihad now if this doesn't make you shudder ten what does ok i ran out of room again lol another thing i watched on the news when the terrorists were rampaging the streets praising allah celebrating that they had struck america so deeply that they had killed so many innocent people and if you actually watched this you would notice that there wasn't just a few there was thousands all over the place it was such a sad day i am catholic let me first state that islam is not all about hate let me guess you have listened to news reports on terrorists and never looked into what muslims actually believe haven't you you must understand that every religion has it's extremists islam is no different in saying that i thoroughly disagree that islam and christianity are sister faiths i will agree that the muslims are closer to christianity along with the jews than any other religion in using the term sister faith it implies that they are of the same family but they're not unless you want to be really broad and just put them under the title of monotheism the massive difference between the two faiths which makes them not even related to each other is that in islam you have the unseen god certainly you have the names of god which tell you he is merciful and there is no type of really detailed prophecy or miracle to validate it catholicism puts you in touch and helps you realize how much god actually does love us as always in any type of teaching a physical example is much more potent than just being told jesus is that infinitely humble example the massive difference between the two faiths is the god who gives himself to no end rather than just reveal himself as is the case in islam in catholicism you have jesus who obviously did not let the shame of the cross stop him from giving himself but also jesus is with us always physically present in the tabernacle under the form of the eucharist and in every mass he gives himself to us in an act of love and also as a source of grace and blessings which is unheard of in islam furthermore christianity has detailed prophecies and solid miracles to validate itself and essentially complete themselves i think it was st augustine that said the old testament is revealed in the new and the new is hidden in the old the christian revelation is complete certainly you could call islam and christianity somewhat related through their common ancestry of abraham but the act of giving on god's part to his creatures is so much more full and complete that it makes every other religion seem shallow i really mean no offense by this remark it's just the best way i can explain myself peace good question by the way
