what's so bad about hate hate is everywhere human beings generalize all the time ahead of time about everyone and everything a large part of it may even be hard wired at some point in our evolution being able to know beforehand who was friend or foe was not merely a matter of philosophical reflection it was a matter of survival and even today it seems impossible to feel a loyalty without also feeling a disloyalty a sense of belonging without an equal sense of unbelonging we're social beings we associate therefore we disassociate and although it would be comforting to think that the one could happen without the other we know in reality that it doesn't of course by hate we mean something graver and darker than this kind of lazy prejudice but the closer you look at this distinction the fuzzier it gets much of the time we harbor little or no malice toward people of other backgrounds or places or ethnicities or ways of life but then a car cuts you off at an intersection and you find yourself noticing immediately that the driver is a woman or black or old or fat or white or male or you are walking down a city street at night and hear footsteps quickening behind you you look around and see that it is a white woman and not a black man and you are instantly relieved these impulses are so spontaneous they are almost involuntary but where did they come from the mindless need to be mad at someone anyone or the unconscious eruption of a darker prejudice festering within what do you think about these two paragraphs what's so bad about hate by andrew sullivan http www racematters org nytarchjb htm i really like this question to contribute i think things that are automatically awarded tend to have no real value friendship should be earned not required and telling me it's not okay to hate someone is in many cases going to make me think that i might have good reason to hate that person especially if people had to go so far as to put rules in play before i even met them although i usually tend to try to get to know people individually anyway i tend to dislike people generally and like people individually i think people should also worry a lot less about earning my approval and more about what they think of themselves if enough people hate you that you have to go to great measures to get them to stop either you're doing something wrong or need to associate yourself with different people and no one else's opinion of you should matter as much as what you think about yourself let people hate you or like you all they want they're not living your life you are that aside i think hating people can also inspire you to try to be better than them i think part of our survival instinct drives us to attempt to be stronger smarter richer and in cases where it helps survival ethically better than our enemies we always want to be the good guys and the only way to do that in reality is to compare ourselves to the villians in our lives and succeed where they fell short i think hating people is just as important as liking people Theory of conduct Human Abortion debate Homophobia Utilitarianism Mojave people Patriotism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule Goodness and value theory Nicomachean Ethics Black (people) Sexual orientation Supernatural Modernism Ethics David Hume Transactional analysis Human nature Economic inequality Atheism Evil Alignment (role-playing games) Transsexuality Religion Baroque chess Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Friedrich Schleiermacher Microeconomics Determinism Slander and libel Peter Singer Little Britain Soul Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Aristotle Fight Club The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Art The Subtle Knife Ontological argument Rudolf Steiner Karen Horney Racism Aesthetic Realism Rei Ayanami Ranma __ characters Science One Tree Hill (TV series) John Howard Yoder Daredevil Victor Cousin Sigmund Freud Prejudice Nature versus nurture The Death Gate Cycle Artificial selection Religious Society of Friends Deconstruction Prior restraint Simone Weil Vernon Schillinger EastEnders Opus Dei Rape Consensus decision-making Reservoir Dogs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Speciesism Cultural relativism Nationalism Avenue Q Arthur Schopenhauer Predestination Humphrey Bogart CPU cache Altruism Morality Bernard Williams Ludwig Wittgenstein Merit Free will Prostate cancer Love Infantilism Objectivist philosophy Jean-Jacques Rousseau Alcoholics Anonymous Force (Star Wars) Equal Protection Clause Incarnations of Immortality
