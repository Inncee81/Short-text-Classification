is god what they say ok i believe gid is real but im not sure he made every of us im mean would a true god make a killer what do you think but what kind of person would let people die so young it says he is forgiving well what if a killer asked for forgiveness would he grant it or not let them into heaven if god is the creator of all things then he also created lucifer think on that for a while and ask yourself how loving all knowing being could create something that would introduce sin into the universe and create the need for an eternal hell for humans to suffer in not possible and god is either not real or not loving if god exists he does make killers because he has a foreknowledge of how each man will turn out just like he had a foreknowledge of how lucifer would turn out he created him anyway therefor allowing sin to enter the world and creating the need for hell free will is a fallacy because it cannot exist without sin so stating that god created humans with free will is also saying that god created sin because without it there is no other choice Predestination Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Original sin A Course In Miracles Theodicy Free will Heaven Paradise Lost Fallen angel Satan Devil Justification (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hell Angel Sanctuary Merit Urantia Eastern Orthodox Church Divine grace Problem of Hell Sola fide Apostles' Creed Indulgence Roman Catholic Church Characters of The Sandman Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Purgatory Trinity Religious views of suicide Limbo Origin belief Judas Iscariot John Howard Yoder Jewish principles of faith The Amber Spyglass Incarnations of Immortality Soul Moral objectivism God the Father Charles Grandison Finney Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Duties of the Heart Athanasian Creed Demon Simone Weil The Divine Comedy Sin City Blood atonement Confession Repentance Seven deadly sins Calvinism Church of Christ, Scientist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Abrahamic religion Contrition Virgin Mary in Islam Creator God Book of Mormon Godspell Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero Maimonides Reinhold Niebuhr Angel Infant baptism Christian views of Jesus Pascal's Wager Catechism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Karma in Hinduism Resurrection of Jesus Sant Thakar Singh The Fall of Man Sabbath Zohar Meaning of life Castlevania: Lament of Innocence Jewish eschatology Theosis Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Genesis Church of Christ Belial Qiyamah Immortality Endowment (Mormonism) Open Theism Evolutionary creationism The nature of God in Western theology Sacrifice Baptism Al-Ghazali Religious pluralism
