when jesus stated only ttwo commandments did he not make it known then that no human being makes the grade to enter heaven except those who try think about it nomatter how perfect some of us think we can be none of us can resist all the temptations of the flesh nomatter how much some deluded themselves to think they are perfect the one answer many will reach for is the in my house are many mansions bit but this only applies to those found worthy and to be found worthy means you have adhered to the two commandments he gave did not jesus state a parable through all this to make a statement that all are acceptable to the lord for he knows we are not perfect and the examples of peter john and james exemplified this point in their shortcomings remember these three were the ones he took up on mount when he was transformed by the lord and shows me he chose the worse of his apostles to make a point even the worse of us in faith is acceptable isn't trying seen as a reward from the lord do you see the same thing in my faith is the belief unlike that which follows in the doctrines of judeo christian principles that god is not this vengeful entity nor was jesus i see all these religions who look forward to see those they judge as evil or wrong immature and emotionally lacking in compassion all people are worthy of god's love from the least amongst us to the greatest salvation does not make man sinless but it does make it possible for him to sin less and all are acceptable to the lord if we believe in him and try to live by his word and as long as we ask forgiveness of our sins i don't believe he will forgive us if we repeat the same sins over and over and knowing in our hearts it is wrong we all have short comings and even the worse of us in faith is acceptable but we have to accept the lord first and only the lord knows if we are trying lets say two different people do the same sin one knows it is wrong and the other doesn't i believe god will deal with them different and if the lord knows you are really trying then yes the lord will see it and you will be rewarded Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Baptism Sin Justification (theology) Soul Repentance A Course In Miracles Trinity Roman Catholic Church Abrahamic religion Catholicism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Christianity God Summa Theologiae John Howard Yoder Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mary, the mother of Jesus Heaven Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Jewish principles of faith Evil Sabbath Gospel of Thomas Infant baptism Jesus Original sin Christian anarchism Biblical inerrancy Hell Church of Christ Holy Spirit Perseverance of the saints Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Book of Isaiah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Predestination Merit Urantia New Testament Jewish Messiah Jehovah's Witnesses Baptist Calvinism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Eucharist Rich Mullins Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Atheism Athanasian Creed Mormonism Reincarnation Prophet Angel Dispensationalism John Wesley Religious pluralism John the Baptist Legalism (theology) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Fundamentalism Priesthood (Mormonism) Satanism Charles Grandison Finney Evangelicalism Maimonides Religious perspectives on Jesus Alan Campbell (pastor) Zohar Moral objectivism Nontrinitarianism Contrition Biblical canon Church of Christ, Scientist Great Apostasy Free will Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Satan Blacks and Mormonism Opus Dei
