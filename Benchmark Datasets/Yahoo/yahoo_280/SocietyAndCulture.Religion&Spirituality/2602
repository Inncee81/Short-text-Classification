my fellow muslims what to do when someone has gone astray one of my close friends who became a very devout muslima is now very intolerant of others and has become very strange in her way of thinking she still loves islam and embraces it fully but is no longer tolerant towards anyone muslim or otherwise i have tried speaking with her e mailing her and she gives the same answer that she thinks the way she thinks now is best i have a feeling this is because she's a new muslim and is quickly frustrated by the discrimination she says she faces i also know that she lost her job after wearing hijab how can i bring her back to her peaceful manner and convince her things will be ok inshallah she comes back even a brighter muslima ameen as salaam aleikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh i think some reverts get into islam so hard and for them everything is black and white haram and halal i am not sure how long she has been a muslim but you can read this article on what happens to so many new muslims convertitis or the case of the insta scholar http www islamfortoday com ummzaid htm as for being intolerant it does seem that sometimes as people become more into their religion some people start to get intolerant not only with people outside of their religion but even more so with those who are following the same religion they are so busy trying to be the perfect muslim they put too much pressure on themselves to change too quickly but while they are trying to be perfect muslims they will see all the weakness in how others fall short of being perfect at following islam and will be critical of it when in reality we are all on our own journeys and have to take our own steps to learn to be better muslims all of our journeys to being better muslims is not the same because we all come from different societies beliefs cultures etc during this time they think they are being strong but they are most likely going to get burned out after a while for some they will give up on islam hopefully temporarily thinking it is too hard and for others they will just decide to start over from step one again as for the discrimination she is facing it can get very stressfull depending on where we live as in some places the discrimination is not so bad while in other places it is another thing too is when we are still new the discrimination is so new that we sometimes feel it is all around us but after a while you get used to the staring and such and you start to not even notice it you may want to show her that article if you read it and think it applies to her and hopefully inshallah it is something that can help when she is being intolerant of others just keep reminding her that one of the responsibilities of a muslim is to set an example for others to want to be a better muslim being intolerant will only push others away Islam Fundamentalism Women in Islam Religion Yusuf al-Qaradawi Discrimination Nation of Islam French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Hijab Zoroastrianism Religious conversion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Criticism of Islam Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Dhimmi Religious pluralism Sunni Islam Islam as a political movement Religious Society of Friends Predestination Anti-Semitism Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Social rule Sectarianism Separation of church and state Mahatma Gandhi Alcoholics Anonymous Alawite Islam in France Sexual orientation Atheism Criticisms of Christianity Cultural relativism InterFaith Feminism Shi'a Islam Muhammad Jizya Racism Persecution of Muslims Daniel Pipes Gender role Historical persecution by Muslims Islam and Judaism Sharia John Wesley Judaism Apostasy Apostasy in Islam Evil Status of religious freedom in Iran Jewish principles of faith Reality Status of religious freedom in Sudan Transactional analysis Islam in Malaysia Devil Characters in the Smurfs Talaq (Nikah) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Vishva Hindu Parishad The nature of God in Western theology Magic (paranormal) History of Islam Sikhism Strategic management Islam in Egypt Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Islamic philosophy Christianity and anti-Semitism Ten Commandments Avenue Q Post-September 11 anti-war movement Caliph Rastafari movement Slavoj __i__ek Council on American-Islamic Relations Status of religious freedom in France The relationship between religion and science Feminist movement Hebrew calendar Hinduism Narcissism A Course In Miracles Scenes from a Memory Asperger syndrome Yehuda Halevi Islam and clothing Homosexuality and Islam
