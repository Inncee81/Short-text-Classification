why would detecting coded radio waves from space be considered proof for the existence of intelligence while the coding of dna is considered a random accedent why wouldn't coded radio patterns not just be the random accident of billions of years of random radio wave noise mypublicident so you agree that purpose cannot arise from randomness this brings us right back to the evolutionist argument that says that it can fourmorebeers a single unvarying pulse is not a coded message nor is it anything that could be used to sustain an argument for accidental being of the incredable complexities of even the smallest and most simple single cell creatures evolution explains this the various arrangements and combinations of letters in dna provide all the information needed to instruct a single human fertilized egg to grow multiply and shape itself into a fully recognizable baby each of the cells in that baby contains a copy of that dna with all the information to operate the human body for a lifetime dna is the most compact information storage system in the world no computer of human invention can approach the quantity and complexity of information it contains dna even contains the instructions to devise the cellular machinery to decode its instructions without a mechanism to decode the information the dna blueprint would be useless even if dna had managed to evolve the decoding mechanism to read it would have had to evolve at precisely the same time this scenario is impossible because the instructions for building the decoding unit are contained in the dna itself a vicious cycle Computer Cell (biology) DNA CPU cache DNA repair CPU design Compiler optimization Central processing unit Morse Code Intelligent design Origin of life RISC Gene Francis Crick Quantum mechanics Bioinformatics One-time pad Artificial life Error correction and detection Fermi paradox Specified complexity Cray-1 Meiosis Cell growth Compact disc Evolution MP3 Self-replication Computer virus Polymerase chain reaction Apollo Guidance Computer Cellular automaton Cellular network Phase-shift keying Global Positioning System Emergence Code Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace History of evolutionary thought Many-worlds interpretation Surveillance Radio Lisp programming language Information theory Reproduction Artificial neural network Brainfuck Federal Standard 1037C Redundant array of independent disks Digital Audio data compression Species Turing machine Quantum cryptography Biology DVD Y chromosome Microprogram Information Airport Bayesian inference Junk DNA Teleological argument Stem cell Conway's Game of Life Evolutionary creationism Cryptography Sociocultural evolution Phase-locked loop Apoptosis Virtual memory Buffer overflow Xenomorph Embedded system Modem Randomness Renewable energy Artificial consciousness Unicode Algorithm Immortality Chlorophyta Dynamical system Gramophone record Assembly language INMOS Transputer Senescence Atari 8-bit family Synthesizer Cancer
