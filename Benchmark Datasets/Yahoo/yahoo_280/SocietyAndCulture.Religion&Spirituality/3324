an apology to athiests i have been reading for sometime now some of the statements that so called christians are saying to you and though i do not personally owe you an apology still i give it to you every time i read these questions toward athiests it is always in a disrespectful manner they are always bashing you with their you will burn in hell and other misguided bible beliefs peter says but sanctify the christ as lord in your hearts always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect obviously from this scripture many of these proclaimers do not know gods word and have failed to use it right in discussing their belief in it i am one of jehovah's witnesses and i respect you and your beliefs if ever you are approached by a jw they will try to engage in a conversation with you and try to reason in dignified manner we will not threaten you with hellfire or condesend you i hope that you will extend this same courtesy to jw's if ever you are approached by them dear gelfling although in you do not believe in the divine word of god there is a command from jesus christ at matthew which states go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit it does not say wait for them to come to your church we are here to give a witness we do not convert that is something you do if you decide to worship jehovah and if you decline then i will respectfully accept it poor jack he got lost lol i appreciate good manners but i'm afraid it doesn't change my mind when it comes to christianity of any brand and i'm sorry but people who have the audacity to knock on my door to tell me about jesus as if i hadn't heard get it slammed in their faces as for the people for whom you're apologizing yeah it is rather annoying to be told i'm going to hell all the time because although i obviously don't believe in it for these people who supposedly do it's got to be the worst insult they could possibly hurl at somebody and they do it with the most cavalier indifference half the time they actually gloat over it to me that just further establishes that they're morally insane Ten Commandments Trinity Holy Spirit Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Christianity New Testament Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Jehovah's Witnesses Christian eschatology Resurrection of Jesus Justification (theology) Salvation Charles Grandison Finney Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Merit Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Catholicism Religious conversion End times Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Divine grace Eucharist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sola fide John the Baptist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant baptism Church of Christ God Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Catechism Christian Nontrinitarianism Restorationism Christian views of Jesus A Course In Miracles John Howard Yoder Protestantism Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Saint Homosexuality and Christianity Prophet Dispensationalism Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses Tertullian Apostle Unitarianism Opus Dei Church of Christ, Scientist Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Book of Isaiah Second Vatican Council Christianity and anti-Semitism John Wycliffe Mormonism and Christianity Priesthood (Mormonism) Community of Christ Mormonism Transubstantiation Paul of Tarsus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Apostolic Succession Salvation Army Heresy Theology Biblical canon Criticism of Mormonism Names and titles of Jesus Arianism History of Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Mass (liturgy) Religion Jewish views of religious pluralism Fundamentalism Biblical inerrancy Qur'an C.
