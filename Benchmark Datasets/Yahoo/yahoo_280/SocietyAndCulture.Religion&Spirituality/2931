christians do you believe in science if so what science facts are there that prove the validity of the bible i cant help but feeling both enraged and humored at the same time by questions like these and responses like annamichele such generalizations like these only server to make you look moronic most christians do not have a problem with science expect in the realm of historical science or science that is conducted for the purpose of proving our origins and how we stemmed from there to become what we are today example would be evolution scientists making claims regarding how things evolved without ever being able to actually observe these changes of course this deals with macro evolution and not micro evolution adaptation most christians will not argue against adaptation or small changes in a species to help them adapt to their environment especially since these changes can be observed i need to back track for a second and reword your question or at least my answer to what you asked do i believe in science no i believe in god i do believe though that through science we can answer many questions and develop a higher level of understanding regarding the things around us we answer they questions of how a supernatural god can create something and allow it to function in what we know of as our natural world we understand not only how but why it functions in that particular manner through science we discovered gravity how it works why it works the purpose it was designed for etc through science god allows us to discover how things are done so that we can recreate it ourselves in the natural world regarding historical science i believe that people who do not believe in god have made extraordinary claims regarding how we have gotten to where we are now without empirical proof to those claims and have passed them on as fact your second question i don't believe that science will ever prove the validity of the bible it will only confirm what the bible has already proven the bible years ago the earth is a sphere isaiah innumerable stars jeremiah free float of earth in space job creation made of invisible elements hebrews each star is different corinthians light moves job air has weight job winds blow in cyclones ecclesiastes blood is the source of life and health leviticus ocean floor contains deep valleys and mountains samuel jonah ocean contains springs job when dealing with disease hands should be washed under running water leviticus science then the earth was a flat disk only stars earth sat on a large animal science was ignorant on the subject all stars were the same light was fixed in place air was weightless winds blew straight sick people must be bled the ocean floor was flat ocean fed only by rivers and rain hands washed in still water science now the earth is a sphere innumerable stars free float of earth in space creation made of invisible elements atoms each star is different light moves air has weight winds blow in cyclones blood is the source of life and health ocean floor contains deep valleys and mountains ocean contains springs when dealing with disease hands should be washed under running water science through archeology has already confirmed many events that have taken place in the bible as being events which actually occurred how many more things need to be confirmed for you to take notice Supernatural Intelligent design Origin belief Human Biblical inerrancy Flood geology Religion Young Earth creationism Creation science Science Meaning of life Determinism God Gravity Creation-evolution controversy Evolutionary creationism Extraterrestrial life Free will Sabbath Noah's Ark Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Fermi paradox Atomism Soul Teach the Controversy Biodiversity Baptism Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ozone depletion Tropical cyclone Deluge (mythology) Evolution Resurrection of Jesus Black hole Church of Christ, Scientist Bible Water Ecology Theodicy Biblical scientific foresight Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Angel Roman Catholic Church Earth Teleological argument Answers in Genesis Intelligent design movement Coriolis effect Scientific method Presuppositional apologetics Existence of God Jewish principles of faith Homosexuality and Christianity Causality The nature of God in Western theology Moon Atheism Species Biblical canon Biology End times Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Unidentified flying object Scopes Trial Meme Korban Scientology beliefs and practices Devil Alan Campbell (pastor) Economics Sun Eastern Orthodox Church Sociocultural evolution Christian eschatology Psychology Miracle Charles Darwin's views on religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Infant baptism Jehovah's Witnesses Christian apologetics New Testament Judaism Phillip E.
