where is the line drawn between going to heaven and going to hell some say it's murder but it can't be just killing or all the soldiers would go to hell obviously this is a hypothetical q that assumes there is a heaven and hell this is where the study of ethics comes into play in my background the belief is that if you end up in hell it's because you knowingly made the choices to get there for example suppose you killed a bug and believed that if you killed that bug you would go to hell you die and you end up in hell because of your belief but if you hadn't believed that killing a bug would send you to hell you wouldn't go to hell because you didn't choose to go there catholicism is the only religion i know of that makes a distinction between choosing to commit a big sin and accidentally or unknowingly committing a big sin Hell Heaven Ten Commandments Sin Demon Problem of Hell Church of Christ Immortality Religious views of suicide Divine grace Abrahamic religion Reincarnation Pascal's Wager Religion Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Justification (theology) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roman Catholic Church Theodicy God Christian eschatology Catholicism Cult suicide Moral objectivism C.
