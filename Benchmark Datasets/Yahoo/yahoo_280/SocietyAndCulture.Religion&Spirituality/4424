is it true that martin scorsese has now admitted to directing the fake moon landings from a studio in area although my wife's father performed fuel calculations for the original apollo landing i'll spare you that speech instead i will encourage you to watch two programs the first show is called conspiracy moon landing that it currently showing on the national geographic channel and it pretty much obliterates all of the popular conspiracy theories i would also encourage you to watch a movie called capricorn one made it it is a fictional story about a fake mission to mars although it is a science fiction story it is a good example of how utterly impossible it would be to fake a moon landing for any length of time men walked on the moon from to and we have neither the resources nor the technology to pull off that big of a hoax for so long hundreds of thousands of people have worked on the space program it would be far easier to put someone on the moon than to try and fake it and keep it secret for nearly years the landings came at a time when our space program was ultra competitive with the former soviet union remember how big of a deal it was when sputnik was put into orbit they had the technology to monitor our moon shots and transmissions don't you think they would have called us out if they had evidence that it was all fake perhaps the most definitive proof of our trip to the moon is what we left behind for the last years scientists have been beaming lasers to the moon and measuring the return times how are they doing this the beams are reflected back by equipment left on the moon on at different locations case closed Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Space Race Moon Apollo 11 Project Apollo National Aeronautics and Space Administration Exploration of Mars Apollo 8 Space exploration Soviet space program Moon landing Colonization of the Moon Crew Exploration Vehicle Faster-than-light Capricorn One Fermi paradox Interstellar travel Space elevator Sergey Korolyov SETI Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes Jupiter Extraterrestrial life Luna programme Space colonization Apollo 15 Timeline of solar system exploration Apollo 13 Cassini-Huygens Project Orion Apollo 17 Opportunity rover Asteroid Speed of light STS-62 Solarquest Roswell UFO incident Apollo Lunar Module Project Gemini Interplanetary travel Alternative 3 European Space Agency Spacecraft propulsion Wernher von Braun Apollo spacecraft Huygens probe History of nuclear weapons Buzz Aldrin Apollo 14 Falsifiability Thomas Stafford Science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey Soyuz spacecraft Science fiction on television Far side (Moon) Titan (moon) Neil Armstrong Conspiracy Navigation Planet Unidentified flying object Sputnik 1 Global Positioning System Laika Satellite Conspiracy theory Human spaceflight Pluto Laser applications Tank Space disaster Parallax Apollo Command/Service Module From the Earth to the Moon (HBO) The Truman Show Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Space Shuttle program STS-114 Shuttle Buran Extraterrestrial hypothesis GunBound Astrodynamics Geodesy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March
