christians what internal problems does christianity face hypocrisy political and worldly attachment denominational divisions etc etc etc probably the crazy radicals that are convinced they're right and everyone else is wrong including other christians who believe different the ones who stand outside abortion clinics and gay ceremony areas and protest yelling about how god hates them to me those guys are the worst problem we christians face they're the ones who make the news i mean how much more do you hear about fred phelps than a group of christians who operate a homeless shelter the reason i think they're the worse internal problem we have is because they give us and our god a bad name people think that all of us christians are just simple minded yokels that hate everyone and will lecture you to death if we think you're wrong and that's just such a terrible misconception people don't realize that we rational minded christians dislike those guys' actions just as much as everyone else and i think this encompasses a few of the things you listed namely hypocrisy every christian is a hypocrite are we not for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god we christians sin and it's our job to acknowledge that we do and yet we seek forgiveness yet these guys act like they're perfect and that sins bear different weight in god's eyes all sins are equal in the eyes of god denominational divisions again these radicals believe only their denomination is right and while thats really the case with anyone they force it on you they preach to those who are already saved for crying out loud it's called belief for a reason radicals just hurt far more than they help not only do they scare people away from christianity but when they blow money and time and effort on protesting a gay parade they could be ya know feeding the hungry or clothing the naked but all of this aside thank you for acknowledging that there are problems sounds simple i know but there are so many of those people out there who want to act like everything is so perfect in christianity another way of making people think we're just stupid god bless Ten Commandments Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sola fide Homosexuality and Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Christianity A Course In Miracles Original sin Divine grace Calvinism Evangelicalism Mahatma Gandhi Justification (theology) Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Eastern Orthodox Church Sin City Salvation Soul Religion Great Apostasy Simone Weil Religious pluralism Baptism Trinity John Howard Yoder Jehovah's Witnesses New Testament Avenue Q Sabbath Mormonism and Christianity Theodicy Fred Phelps Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Indulgence Evil Book of Isaiah Repentance Mother Teresa Anti-Americanism Abrahamic religion Family Guy Heaven Puritan Criticisms of Christianity Gandhism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Christian right Christian views of Jesus Fasting Recurring South Park characters Infant baptism Charles Grandison Finney Jon Secada Merit Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Christ Church of Christ, Scientist Social rule Paradise Lost Richard Allen (reverend) God John Wesley Priesthood (Mormonism) Summa Theologiae Protestantism Restorationism Capital punishment Religious Society of Friends Fundamentalism Christian eschatology Hell John Wycliffe Unitarian Universalism Homosexuality Pacifism Moral objectivism Shaggy dog story Religious conversion Friedrich Schleiermacher Satanism United States religious history Paul of Tarsus Creationism Blacks and Mormonism Mennonite Rich Mullins Exorcism Anselm of Canterbury Seventh-day Adventist Church Jewish views of religious pluralism
