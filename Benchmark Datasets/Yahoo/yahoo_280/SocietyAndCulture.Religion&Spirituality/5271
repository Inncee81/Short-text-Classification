do you believe that diseases are the will of god some people believe that god puts diseases in some people's lives to fulfill his purpose do you agree do you think that some people have illnesses because of their own sins why do you think that someone gets diseases obviously i am really directing this to my fellow christians but anyone can answer of course ps hope everyone is having a wonderful day i really mean that well when i was a christian i thought that diseases are here because god created them just like the other pests of the world i e mosquito's rats etc i didn't think it was because of someones sins or because he has a plan just that he made them now that i'm an atheist i believe that they evolved to do what they do now to live and create more of themselves no higher mystery to that one also i would think that anyone who thinks that diseases are caused by peoples sins are very close minded i mean i was born with pneumonia and two inner ear aches as in i could have almost gone deaf and i was born with that what god's gonna punish me for original sin again sounds a bit unfair if you ask me it was just because i swallowed the amniotic fluid or something when i was being pushed out and stuff as for a plan i would really like to know what gods plan for my gfs brother who is c p and pretty much any other mental disease in the book is i mean he's not doing anything other than being kicked around in school and then being a burden to his family in a manner of speaking so good plan god really good plan and what about the kids who die very young from illness what did they do wrong what are their sins Original sin Evil God Rich Mullins Book of Isaiah Theodicy Mosquito Justification (theology) Repentance Supernatural John the Baptist Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Moral objectivism Problem of Hell Abortion debate Birth control Social rule Predestination Theory of conduct Summa Theologiae Eastern Orthodox Church Alcoholics Anonymous Salvation Atheism Ten Commandments John Howard Yoder The Pilgrim's Progress The nature of God in Western theology Sinfest Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pneumonia Simone Weil John Wesley Satanism Christianity Religion Duties of the Heart Hearing impairment Soul Immortality Divine grace Anselm of Canterbury Sickle-cell disease Jewish principles of faith Intelligent design movement Indulgence Korban Snake Common cold Sin City Mental illness Book of Job Irenaeus Merit Plagues of Egypt Influenza S__ren Kierkegaard Capital punishment Sola fide Magic (paranormal) Demonic possession Meaning of life Friedrich Schleiermacher Church of Christ, Scientist Kain (Legacy of Kain) Charles Darwin's illness The Amber Spyglass Angel 613 mitzvot Sant Mat Charles Darwin's views on religion Hinduism Religious Society of Friends Purgatory Alan Campbell (pastor) Jack (comic) Teach the Controversy Jewish eschatology Infant baptism Holy Spirit Reinhold Niebuhr Mother Teresa Prayer in Christianity Goodness and value theory Mortification of the flesh Eucharist Noah Clement of Alexandria Jon Secada Legionellosis Abrahamic religion Sant Thakar Singh C.
