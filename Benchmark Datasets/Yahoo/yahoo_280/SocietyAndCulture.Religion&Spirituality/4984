what do you guys make of this spiritual philosophical quote wise and do you know where it is from for this reason then we do not sleep nor do we forget the nets that are spread out in hiding lying in wait for us to catch us for if we are caught in a single net it will suck us down into its mouth while the water flows over us striking our face and we will be taken down into the dragnet and we will not be able to come up from it because the waters are high over us flowing from above downward submerging our heart down in the filthy mud and we will not be able to escape from them for man eaters will seize us and swallow us rejoicing like a fisherman casting a hook into the water for he casts many kinds of food into the water because each one of the fish has his own food he smells it and pursues its odor but when he eats it the hook hidden within the food seizes him and brings him up by force out of the deep waters no man is able then to catch that fish down in the deep waters except for the trap that the fisherman sets by the ruse of food he brought the fish up on the hook in this very way we exist in this world like fish the adversary spies on us lying in wait for us like a fisherman wishing to seize us rejoicing that he might swallow us for he places many foods before our eyes things which belong to this world he wishes to make us desire one of them and to taste only a little so that he may seize us with his hidden poison and bring us out of freedom and take us into slavery for whenever he catches us with a single food it is indeed necessary for us to desire the rest finally then such things become the food of death from authoritative teaching found at nag hammadi it has some good material for reflection in it Fishing Gospel of Thomas Angling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tlingit Seine (fishing) Shaggy dog story Anchor Futurama (TV series - season 2) Snake Trapping Link (Legend of Zelda) The Marriage of Figaro Book of Isaiah Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Professional wrestling throws Pok__mon Abilities Stoicism Oral sex Shark Cat Heretics of Dune The Subtle Knife Fish farming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Two Treatises of Government Characters of The Sandman Whaling Magical objects in Harry Potter The Amber Spyglass Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Suplex Bong Apocryphon of John Great Lakes Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jon Secada Ayyavazhi mythology Trawling Simone Weil Fitz Hugh Ludlow Happy Tree Friends Sin City Smelt Dam Professional wrestling holds Kain (Legacy of Kain) Socrates Nag Hammadi library Tofu Tag Poker jargon Drowning Trolling for fish Victor Cousin Coral reef Albatross Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Carp Japanese tea ceremony RuneScape quests The Dalek Invasion of Earth Striped bass Original sin Te Kooti's War Walleye Sukkot Happiness God Emperor of Dune Fugu Ron Weasley New Testament Volleyball Tetrapod Michel Henry Cyanide Seabird Ramen Goodness and value theory Ten Commandments Socrate Spidey Super Stories Lutefisk The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Evidence of evolution Luminoth Biblical canon Kingdom Hearts Gnosticism Dragon Booster Catch and release Bottlenose Dolphin Phoebe Halliwell Saruman Milton H.
