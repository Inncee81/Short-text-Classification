how many mormons here know that mormon temple rituals are knock offs of masonic temple rites an unknown visitor is usually required to produce a dues card or other documentation of membership in addition to demonstrating knowledge of the masonic signs grips and passwords freemasons use signs gestures grips or tokens handshakes and words to gain admission to meetings and identify legitimate visitors freemason literature hmmmmm does this sound familiar to any of you mormons i myself have gone through the salt lake city temple and it certainly rings some bells for me my father went through the temple for the first time in the 's and it was the last lds function institution he ever visited again he told me they made him take an oath of self mutilation if the secrets of the temple were ever to leave his lips when i went though the temple i asked about this and i was told that this has not been practiced for years in the temples anymore because some people thought it was too graphic it is odd that the masons had this ritual as well huh it is somewhat of a coincidence that joseph smith was a master mason as well as his brother hyrum his father and grandfather were also masonic members how does a year old come up with a religion better question how does a year old with a familial history in a secret organization create the most lucritive religion in history hmmmm it wasn't a self mutilation oath it was an oath that god would perform the mutilation if they divulged the secrets years is an overestimate they officially stopped practicing it on april exactly years months and days ago when they closed all of the temples for maintenance and when they reopened weeks later the gory parts were gone oh and mormons generally tend to assume that the freemasons got the stuff when they excavated solomon's temple after it was destroyed they assume that the signs and handshakes were all on the walls or something the difficult part about this theory is that the freemasons postdate the excavation by about years joseph smith when he was first accused of plagiarism said that it had been maintained from true signs of god and that many things are perfect the problem is though that masonic signs and tokens handshakes from the s and s are far different than nauvoo masonic signs and tokens in the s joseph smith's endowment more closely resembled the latter and the current endowment does too that means that the lds temple ceremony if anything would be leaning on a more corrupt version of the signs and tokens and not a true restoration as smith claimed Book of Mormon History of the Latter Day Saint movement Priesthood (Mormonism) Criticism of Mormonism Mormonism and Judaism Mormonism and Christianity Anti-Mormonism Mormonism Mormon First Vision Blacks and Mormonism Nauvoo, Illinois Succession crisis (Mormonism) Danite Latter Day Saint movement Joseph F.
