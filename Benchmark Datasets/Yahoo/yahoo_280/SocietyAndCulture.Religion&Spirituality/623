a question about christianity help please i am not trolling so i really do not want troll answers please okay i was told that if you die and do not accept jesus as your savior you will go to hell but what about children who are like or or even like i would think that something as complex as christianity would take a good bit of your lifetime to understand into i am going to guess that something like percent of children do not fully understand chirstianity what it means to be christian or be able to understand what it means to accept jesus in your life so how does it work all people are accountable to god whether they have heard about him or not the bible tells us that god has clearly revealed himself in nature romans and in the hearts of people ecclesiastes the problem is that the human race is sinful we all reject this knowledge of god and rebel against him romans people tend to assume that children are innocent even if their parents are doing bad things the assumption is unfounded for example palestinian muslim children are officially taught in grammar school to hate their jewish neighbors they are so well indoctrinated that some of them give up their lives in suicide bombings as children corruption literally does breed corruption sin breeds new sin and the sins of fathers and mothers can be passed on to their children for a generation or more but to get back to your main question just because someone has died not knowing jesus does not mean that god in his wisdom and mercy is not able to grant them a pardon anyway i wouldn't want to count on it for an adult because for an adult ignorance of the law is no excuse but i think in the case of babies and very young children god will cut them a lot of slack and compare what they have or haven't done against their level of understanding in other words he knows their hearts and he can tell a future hitler from a future mother theresa if nothing else the bible assures us that god is fair and just but he will judge by his standards and not by ours in samuel king david s newborn son fell terminally ill after seven days the child died in verses and the bible records that david said while the child was alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether the lord will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he is dead why should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me it is clear that david s dead infant son would never return to this earth but david also said that one day he would go to be with his son through inspiration david documented that his own eternal destination was going to be in the house of the lord psalm therefore we can conclude that the house of the lord would be the eternal destination of his infant son to whom david would one day go king david was looking forward to the day when he would be able to meet his son in heaven absolutely nothing in this context gives any hint that the dead infant son s soul would automatically go to hell jesus christ himself in the new testament stated that little children retain the qualities that make a person eligible to inherit the kingdom of god luke jesus remarked let the little children come to me and do not forbid them for of such is the kingdom of god assuredly i say to you whoever does not receive the kingdom of god as a little child will by no means enter it i think everyone will be judged fairly and those who are worth being saved will be saved those who deserved death will also be saved if they repented and accepted jesus or if there are by god's standards and wisdom extenuating circumstances and finally millions of unsaved unrepentant sinners will go to hell and pay for all the bad they have done if that's not fair and reasonable then i don't know what is Merit Summa Theologiae Soul Christian views of Jesus Purgatory Charles Grandison Finney Alan Campbell (pastor) Catechism Roman Catholic Church Articles of Religion (Methodist) Jehovah's Witnesses Heaven Satan Angel Noah Indulgence Jewish eschatology New Testament view on Jesus' life Apostles' Creed Book of Mormon Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mormonism Biblical inerrancy Jewish principles of faith Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions New Testament Mary Magdalene David Book of Revelation Pharisees Binitarianism Qur'an Gospel of Barnabas Immortality Paul of Tarsus Nation of Islam John Wycliffe Virgin Mary in Islam The Pilgrim's Progress Great Apostasy Religious pluralism End times Religious views of suicide Judaism Problem of Hell Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Historical Jesus Bible and reincarnation Apocalyptic literature Baptist Genesis Amidah Aramaic of Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Capital punishment Theodicy Judas Iscariot
