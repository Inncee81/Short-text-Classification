why do born again christians still celebrate christmas this question is out of season anyway this is my concern because christmas originated from paganism and there are no biblical precept on the celebration of christmas and early christians never celebrated christmas at all you are absolutely right it is a pagan festival it occurs nine months after easter for a reason and is to celebrate the birth of baby baal the sun god born to ashtoreth the queen of heaven dec is four days after the winter solstice for that reason for that is when the sun starts to return to the northern hemisphere the whole business of decking up a tree with silver and gold was criticized by jeremiah see jer that may have been rolled in from western european pagans who were into tree worship people today knock on wood to wake up the tree god what the roman catholics did was to take the paganism they'd always had and simply paint some christian looking titles over top they've always done that and they still are except for the shepherds who witnessed the original birth and the wise men a year or two later nobody in the new testament had any kind of a celebration of the lord's birth the exact date is not even given there is no instruction in any of paul's epistles to recognize it peter and john and james had nothing to say about it and there's no mention of it in revelation still it remains the one time during the year when unsaved people are loosely open to the gospel i know lots of very conservative fundamental christians who do celebrate it on dec so its not something i'm really going to worry about Christmas New Testament Biblical canon Liturgical year Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Sabbath Biblical Magi Chronology of Jesus Dispensationalism Easter Jesus Idolatry The Two Babylons Biblical inerrancy Book of Esther Resurrection of Jesus Salvation End times Mary, the mother of Jesus Book of Revelation Gospel of Thomas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sol Invictus Bible Historicity of Jesus History of Christianity Yule Acts of the Apostles Roman Catholic Church Infant baptism Christianity Trinity Book of Mormon New Testament apocrypha Ten Commandments Abrahamic religion Holiday Messianic Judaism New Testament view on Jesus' life Sermon on the Mount Religious pluralism Eastern Orthodox Church Christian views of Jesus Pope Bible and reincarnation Apocrypha Gospel Holy Spirit Saint Peter Midsummer Saint Book of Joshua Baptism Paul of Tarsus Great Apostasy Candlemas Church of Christ Apologetics Wheel of the Year Timeline of Christianity Irish calendar Apostle Apostolic Fathers Lent Jehovah's Witnesses Slow Train Coming Didache Mithraism Evangelicalism Eucharist Mary Magdalene Yalda God Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Catholic Gospel of Mark Justin Martyr Saint James the Just Binitarianism John Howard Yoder Icon Christian eschatology Pharisees Priesthood (Mormonism) Martin Luther Baal Theophilus of Antioch God and gender Angel Epistle to Galatians
