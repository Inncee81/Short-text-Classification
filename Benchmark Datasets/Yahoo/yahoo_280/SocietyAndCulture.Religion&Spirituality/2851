do people that insist we did not have a common ancestor with the ape also deny the similarities between our species do you deny that we are in the same scientific class do you deny that are dna is almost identical do you deny that we are at least related if you do well blind faith indeed you are beyond hope if you agree with most of this but still say there was no common ancestor then my question would be why did your god create apes and monkeys to be so similar to his children what was the point why give us near identical dna and then put the apes at the level of animals which according to genesis are ours to do with as we please are apes his back up plan but then doesn't that also mean that the divine plan isn't perfect and he knew before he even created adam eve that it would all end in tears oh and good morning to everyone helllooo anyone sir offenzalot you yourself said we were similar but you didn't attempt an answer as to why your god would do this but people then why did you god make us so similar hello sweet persephone good morning to you hugs i say this in love and not sarcasm if i brought a cousin human to a public school to register them they would be accepted but it i were to bring an ape to register in school they would laugh at me and say you cannot register an animal for school the same would happen if i was to bring my cousin an ape on an airlines to sit next to me this has been tried that is why i am mentioning it if we are ancestor with the ape then why do they not have the same advantages as our selves are we not being unfair to their evolutionary process so they can have the same opportunity's as us to evolve we should stop putting our ancestors in cages and treat them with the respect that is due them in jesus most precious name with love in christ Creationism The Origin of Species Theodicy The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Original sin Origin belief Justification (theology) Evolutionary creationism Human History of creationism Evolution God Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Darwin from Orchids to Variation Human evolution Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Trinity Evolutionism Adam and Eve Sin Ape Hominidae Charles Darwin Free will Intelligent design Chimpanzee Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Day-Age Creationism Biblical inerrancy Summa Theologiae Jewish principles of faith Young Earth creationism Aquatic ape hypothesis Created kind A Course In Miracles Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Planet of the Apes (1968 film) Infant baptism Genesis Species Sociobiology Mitochondrial Eve Biology Teleological argument Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Religion Charles Grandison Finney The nature of God in Western theology Sola fide Predestination Inception of Darwin's theory Eastern Orthodox Church Scopes Trial Biblical canon Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Meaning of life Supernatural John the Baptist Teach the Controversy The Mind of an Ape Perseverance of the saints Evidence of evolution Richard Dawkins Book of Isaiah Royal Assent Salvation Cradle of Humanity The Amber Spyglass Satan Publication of Darwin's theory Abrahamic religion Theosis Prophet God Emperor of Dune Incarnations of Immortality Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Monkey Beneath the Planet of the Apes Animal rights Animism Reaction to Darwin's theory Alan Campbell (pastor) Human skin color Blacks and Mormonism Binitarianism Mortification of the flesh Creation science Noah Charles Darwin's views on religion Creation-evolution controversy Mary, the mother of Jesus Answers in Genesis Numerology
