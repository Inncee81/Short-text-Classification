creationists do you think scientists are universally stupid or universally corrupt for ye creationists only please at some point ye creationism leads to the conclusion that all scientists who accept evolution which is pretty much all of them are either a universally stupid so stupid they have overlooked evidence or arguments so obvious that anyone with high school level biology on an internet forum can stump them with why are there still monkeys questions or b universally corrupt so corrupt they are willing to betray their profession and participate in an unprecedented conspiracy involving tens of thousands of scientists for generations over years and note that we're not just talking about biologists paleontologists geneticists and others involved in evolution but all sciences geologists physicists chemists astronomers astrophysicists etc etc who accept e g an old age for the earth and universe in either case why why do you have such a dismal opinion of science and scientists just saying both doesn't say much please note the last part of my question why on what basis do such a low opinion of science and scientists what evidence what past experience with science or scientists anne p thoughtful points kudos but to say that science is driven by people who don't believe in god misses the fact that about of scientists do science is open to other theories but none have been proposed id is not a theory it is a set of questions some of them good questions challenging darwinian evolution but not evolution itself but a set of questions is not a theory ghispilon cites scripture about truth in unrighteousness in the same breath with the baldfaced lie that darwin admitted his theory was wrong and regretted it how's that for hypocrisy wrapped in irony how righteous is that bit of both you have to remember they are forced to be politically correct too whether they like it or not look at global warming plenty of scientists want to debate global warming and they're being shunned by the scientific community look at all my thumbs downs they spiked after i added the global warming part prime example of the pressure to be politically correct look at this i have thumbs down thing is i know i'm right anyone who disagrees with me needs to watch glenn beck on cnn evolution doesn't go against the bible according to the catholic church in peter it says that one day to god could be thousands of days to men Creationism Creation-evolution controversy Intelligent design Teach the Controversy Creation science Intelligent design movement Phillip E.
