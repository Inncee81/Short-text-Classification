what does power mean to you is it something to aim for i met this guy once he was into tai chi he told me his master was so powerful he could burn your skin with his finger tip i remember thinking to myself is that what spirituality is about i thought it was a bit pathetic really is potency or effectiveness or a sense of agency the same thing as power what about dominance even cruelty what about the flip side weakness people don't like the idea of being weak but it could mean gentleness or receptiveness or openness or vulnerability if you can't be vulnerable how could you be intimate how could you connect how could you even get out of bed in the morning without blocking out a great deal of reality do you want to be safe even suffering enlightenment could be the end to suffering but is that the most important thing so why do you practice what do you want to be enlightened for what you going to do when you are enlightened teach why will enlightenment benefit the people you teach for myself i know i can have a dominant cruel side also a side a side that feels weak and unacceptable i would genuinly like to be able to be kinder that is why i practice mostly hiya sunman i do try to reach out in my own way but i have a fickle heart and need to grow up a bit more too before i can be really effective well i like you i have always set the standard that i wouldn't take on more power until my character could handle it without the crushing ego driven need to perform how many times have we've seen someone be slave to their 'genius' it makes me happy to be 'run of the mill' working from the inside out openness to me is the first skill of a warrior of heart soaking in the abstract that is life kindness is also a practice as it gentleness ahem mv i'll get there receptiveness and vulnerability it is always in our power to be exactly who we wish simply by acting in those things to chose that when the situations arise for they are indeed skills for me to chose is to be unfettered by those who would chose for you to live in freedom then watch power fly from your fingertips now when i'm pretty sure that i wouldn't if able let fly a lightning bolt aimed towards the oval office i'd say that i had emassed enough character to truly control myself in that particular gift until then i would rather build me using everything that you've stated above and serve the one and allow my power to build accordingly imagine being a free unfettered being living your dreams all of them as you wilt so shall it be imagine you knew this every moment of your life and accepted that those around you did the same collective agreements were not necessary no one enslaved to dogma memes or political agendas imagine we celebrated each other and accepted that one was for all intents and purposes simply here to express itself and everything here was 'opportunity' to do so your choices expressed your spirit there are times when i am here when i can literally taste the possibilities of all that or it couldn't even be written tagged by the cosmic task force for the spreading of pureness of power Immanuel Kant Force (Star Wars) Theodicy Milton H.
