why are the christians doing this anyway never can you expect a straight forward but in depth answer from them just look at this link http answers yahoo com question index qid aavohyz r w pa fzpthwf

sinful we are what does your concience say if we are really all sinners why did god sent us in this world and why did he cleanse us of all our sins is there any point to create human beings all sinners forgive them and then grant them eternal happiness or is it more logical that this world is a testing place meant by god to see who follows us and who don't and reward us accordingly if the pious and the sinners both get heaven would it be fair for the pious who are trying so much to follow him if there's a real christian out there he she will answer honestly so far it isn't the case except katalina and i can't understand what she's saying as for johnny remember that we inherit faith from our parents but god has given us logic and sense to find the truth if you suggest ignoring logic then me and you are animals optimus you've done it again you said god gave us all a choice to either follow him or not did i say no it's apparent that everyone will make a decision in the end will we not of course we have made the decision now he knows that not everyone will choose to follow him he said that in his word duh why are there so many religions honestly the answer to all of your questions are in the bible you say it again why don't you just tell us instead of referring to the bible what if i say i read the bible but it doesn't resemble the christian beliefs can you prove me wrong fullofideas u god did not create sinners he created man man that had free will my point's exactly but christians say we are all sinners along with the idea of original sin you wanted to put me in a situation similar to god's but remember god has created all of us we are his creations not his sons and daughters suppose i created five robots who had free will give them logic and see if they obey me as the creator three of them obey my orders and follow my principles two of them acknowledge me but preach to the others that i am linked with an unmarried woman and i have a son and misinterpret my sayings will i be kind enough to look at all of them as equals certainly not but i would reward the good robots and punish the bad the obedient robots would not cry its not fair but they would be disheartened if i treat five of them as equals besides this is the system i envisioned before creating them what is the use of logic if we can't apply by robots i did not mean machines or things without logic if you put anything else instead of the robots its stays the same we are not the sons and daughters of god mind you we may be part of his family but to bind relations with god this way is shirk god is one and only we are the sons and daughters of adam and eve a fact mentioned in both the quran and bible if you can let me know me where you have got that verse as for the sinning part everyone has committed a sin in some part of their lives even jesus and our prophet sm god cannot sin because the sinning system he established is null and void in the heaven and hell after this life but remember that god is also the greatest judge so he has developed a special system for us if we commit a sin we can beg to him for forgiveness sincerely repent and expect his mercy this way we can clease ourselves of sin god will forgive those who repent instead of everyone including murderers rapists etc sir not everyone who professes to be a christian is one a christian would have no reservations about answering your questions in depth fortunatly god has declared that if you seek you shall find your answers therefore must be on their way since you are obviosly seeking i hope to be one that helps answer them i will not ramble on about how we are all sinners but since sin is a fundamental part in your own questions it will have its place in my response to you have you ever lied deception is at the heart of every sin and we both allready know one thing about eachother we have both lied christianity shows that god did not creat any sinful people or angels sin is disobediance to god he gave us a choice between obediance or disobediance you can figure out how that went listening to your concience can be a dangerous thing since all fall short of the glory of god most people even if they do not have a realtionship with god instinctivly know they are bad running around with a guilty concience can lead people to insane acts of supposed redemption or a downright apathy toward life though the majority of people chose to just not think about it you are clearly not in that last luke warm group jesus thank god taught us that we were incapable of redeeming ourselves we can never ever earn our place in his kingdom when you chose to be a part of gods family you try to please god which you can do but you are not saved by these actions you still have a sinful nature only now when you sin it is a family matter god covers it and perhaps protects you while you get through it and he may even chasten you now when you feel guilty it is because you have disappointed your father this changes your attitude about sin because if you disapoint your father you can say sorry and try harder he is the discerner of men souls and minds he knows if you mean it repentance is no hollow apology god created us for the same reason we use his creative power to procreate i am certain that you can answer the question why do people create more people i did not have children so that they would disobey me i can say for sure that i don't want robots i want kids that will make their own choices and i will mimik my father in heaven by teaching them right from wrong i like him hope they chose the right if they mess up and they are sorry i will forgive them in my eyes they will be cleansed of their wrongs that is why god cleanses us of our sins god does test us or more accuretly tries us so that we may learn from our failers and be strengthend by our victories it with all do respect is not logical that god created us for testing to chose those who by there own strength and power could be worthy and those whom he created unworthy to be throwen away we were all created with the same worth you my friend are not more valuable then me nor am i better then you none are worthy there is no pious in the sense that you use it as an antonym for sinner even the pious are undesearving of gods grace god didn't need to make us for some award ceromony he could award the dogs and elephants what he asks us to do in reverance to him is not in its self importnant it is importnant because it creates a situation where we need to make that first choice and chose obediance about your fairness question please read the story of the prodigal son it will give you a more in depth answer then what i a sinner can give what you seem to be missing is the knowledge that god created and loves you god is not the universe he is its creator the creator of the heavens and the earth the giver of life loves you to him you are importnant unique and special google kent hovind go to his downloads and watch video that will blow your mind oh and forgive him he is in prison for some tax crap we are all sinners mabey he should be there mabey not but watch his videos peace
