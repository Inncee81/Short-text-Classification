fundamentalist christians why do you want to rob faith from gay people i am told over and over again that i cannot be gay and be christian however there is no doubt in my mind that when i die that i will go to heaven regardless of what you or your church says god is the ultimate authority on not only scripture but on one's heart so why do you pretend to be all knowing i am not welcomed in the religion i was raised because i am a non repentant gay man so you were able to steal my religion from me but know there is nothing you can do that will steal god from my heart famine persecution peril sword nor even the fundamentalist christian can separate me from the love of god so why do you try to condemn homosexuals your opinion of interpretation of scripture may lead you to believe it to be sin but for the homosexual that feels led to worship with you work with you praise with you why wouldn't you welcome him with no judgement as you do so many other people with perceived sins it seems that only a few are trying to answer your question so my brother if you love the lord you are welcome to worship with me i also am a sinner and only through the grace of god have i found greedom and hope as i am a preacher i would ask one thing of you would you ask me to be unfaithful of my interpretation of the scriptures or can i speak the truth in love while welcoming you as a brother in christ that is my dilemna god has taught me that he loves you but he has also taught me that the practice of homosexuality in incompatible with scriptural teaching can you worship at my side knowing that i was listening to the phelps family last night on tyra such unmitigated hate overwhelms me i don't understand how a person can claim to be a christian and yet have such hate for another i don't want to ever be like that yet i have been called to preach the truth is it possible to preach the truth as i know it while still welcoming you as a child of god i am not talking of condemning you i am more worried about my own soul a merciful god will judge yours and he doesn't need my input i'm also not talking about preaching this every week when this question comes up in bible study can i speak the truth while still caring for you as a brother sometimes i feel like the homosexual community is telling me that unless i change my own belief on scripture that they are unwilling to worship with me can the truth be spoken in love while we worship together it sounds to me like you really love god so i welcome you georgia peach i thought you were atheist pastor john Sabbath God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief New Testament Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Baptist Charles Grandison Finney Religious Society of Friends Sola fide Roman Catholic Church Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity George Fox Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Christian eschatology Fundamentalism Liberal Christianity Calvinism Alan Campbell (pastor) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religious pluralism Trinity John Wycliffe Heresy Judaism Justification (theology) Book of Mormon Soul Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus History of Christianity Merit Book of Isaiah Sin Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Lutheranism Baptism John the Baptist Anglican views of homosexuality Mary, the mother of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Paul of Tarsus Mormonism and Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Biblical canon Eucharist Dispensationalism Philipp Melanchthon Summa Theologiae A Course In Miracles United Methodist Church Rich Mullins Prevenient grace Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Articles of Religion (Methodist) Noah Infant baptism Biblical inerrancy Repentance Expository preaching Idolatry Mormonism Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Christian anarchism Predestination Catechism Homosexuality Evil Christian-Jewish reconciliation Criticisms of Christianity Prophet Evangelicalism Catholicism Holy Spirit Rastafari movement Purgatory Blacks and Mormonism Angel Anabaptist Nontrinitarianism Hinduism United States religious history
