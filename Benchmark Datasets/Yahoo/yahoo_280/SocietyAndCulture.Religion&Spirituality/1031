behaving christ like as compared to christ living his life out in you i know they seem close when we look at it but do you think that there is a difference between trying to do what jesus would do or where you are one who allows the lord to live his life out in you in all that you do say think and are what do you think gives the lord a way to actually be expressed out from you i heard it said that you are what you eat could it be that the more of christ we take in through our fellowship and communion with him in the word and in prayer that there is a metabolic spiritual infusing of christ into us that spontaneously gives the lord a way to be lived out from us i have pondered this matter and i do not believe that the lord just wants us imitating him but according to gal we can have a life where the lord who indwells us actually impacts upon us inwardly so much so he is spreading and transforming all our inward parts according to who he is i'd really love some sharing on this deeper view on the christian life scott ty for the verse and i appreciate also your take on this but my angle is more on life having the life of god as children of god allows us to live out that life we have the human life and as such we express as we live as human beings this human has its senses its function and its operation in the same way we have been begotten not mere to know something regarding god and try to copy it according to right or wrong but this question has a lot to do with the inner operation and gradual transformation of the believers being of allowing the divine life that we have been born of to grow and be expressed out from us it is not something taught but rather by taking care of this life to feed nourish cultivate and develop the lord in us is expressed out from us in our life and living before god and others god's divine attributes with his love and life and light is expresed through our human virtues cor hi sandy i think there are a lot of christians that have the ability to imitate the life of christ through behavior but not necessarily be transformed by the indwelling presence of the holy spirit jesus dealt with this behavior during his time on the earth he said that you honor me with your lips but your heart is far from me christ said in john that he is seeking after those who will worship him in spirit and in truth therefore when i put on christ this means that i will subdue self and exalt christ throughout my life my thoughts words deeds and actions will be conformed to his will it is god who works in me both to will and do of his good pleasure i cannot live a christ like life apart from christ i must choose him and die daily to the flesh god is able to keep me from falling and keep me until that day when i shall see him face to face Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology God Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Eastern Orthodox Church Justification (theology) Original sin Salvation Baptism Divine grace Church of Christ Summa Theologiae Theosis Soul John Howard Yoder Urantia Sola fide Charles Grandison Finney Religious Society of Friends Religion Sabbath Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Transubstantiation Adam-God theory Merit Meaning of life Angel Apostle Resurrection of Jesus Mary, the mother of Jesus Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions John Wesley Sin Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism Church of Christ, Scientist Book of Isaiah Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Abrahamic religion Christianity Christian and Missionary Alliance Islam Mormonism and Christianity Binitarianism Religious perspectives on Jesus Human nature Protestantism Predestination Perseverance of the saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mortification of the flesh Christian mysticism Religious pluralism Paul of Tarsus Christ Hell Great Apostasy Jesus Second Vatican Council Catholicism Philipp Melanchthon God the Father God and gender Athanasian Creed Atheism Evil Moral objectivism Idolatry in Christianity Christian views of Jesus Satanism Mormonism and Judaism Mormonism Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Theology Friedrich Schleiermacher Confucius Baptist Justin Martyr Rastafari movement Dispensationalism Rosicrucian Fellowship Gospel of Thomas Rule of St Benedict
