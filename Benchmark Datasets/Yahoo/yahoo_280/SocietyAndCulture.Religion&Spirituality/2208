what is deism i've heard it mentioned a few times but am not up to speed with it is it one belief or a class of beliefs hope you will excuse my ignorance deism is not as widely know as other beliefs i have a great cut and paste i'll be right back one who believes in the existence of a god or supreme being but denies revealed religion basing his belief on the light of nature and reason in deism a cult is an embracing of unreasonable beliefs by a group of people based on this definition judaism christianity and islam are all cults because their members suspend their god given reason in order to believe or accept the unreasonable dogmas and teachings such as god giving real estate as a gift to the jews the resurrection and ascension of jesus and mohammed among many more false and unreasonable claims because deism always promotes free and independent thought and reason it is impossible for deism to become a cult deism is the recognition of a universal creative force greater than that demonstrated by mankind supported by personal observation of laws and designs in nature and the universe perpetuated and validated by the innate ability of human reason coupled with the rejection of claims made by individuals and organized religions of having received special divine revelation faith this word has been so terribly abused by revealed religions that it has come to really mean the suspension of an individual s god given reason in order to accept or at least to tolerate an unreasonable claim made by a revealed religion it is the only way revealed religions can get people to accept such insane and unreasonable claims and ideas as original sin walking on water healing the sick without medical care splitting the red sea etc deists prefer to use the word trust instead of faith due to the twisted meaning the word faith has acquired after centuries of abuse from the revealed religions one key difference between deism and the revealed religions is that deists don't believe faith is required to believe in god this quote from voltaire sums it up what is faith is it to believe that which is evident no it is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary eternal supreme and intelligent being this is no matter of faith but of reason god the universal creative force which is the source of the laws and designs found throughout nature intelligent design intelligent design refers to the structures in nature such as that of dna which can be observed and the complexity of which required an intelligent designer in this context structure means something arranged in a definite pattern of organization in deism intelligent design has absolutely nothing to do with the unreasonable biblical myth of creation natural religion belief in god based on the application of reason on the laws designs of nature as opposed to revealed religion which is based on alleged revelations Miracle Heresy Sin Sabbath Satanism Separation of church and state Trinity Hell Sola fide Religious conversion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prophet The nature of God in Western theology Creation-evolution controversy Salvation Ten Commandments Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish philosophy Great Apostasy Creation science Roman Catholic Church Freemasonry Maimonides Soul Cult Summa Theologiae Fundamentalism Church of Christ Age of Enlightenment Holy Spirit Young Earth creationism Justification (theology) Pharisees Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Divine grace Baptism Theology Jehovah's Witnesses Unitarianism Moses Historicity of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Original sin Eastern Orthodox Church Paul of Tarsus Determinism Intelligent design movement Mormonism and Christianity New Testament Islamic philosophy Religious perspectives on Jesus Creator God Biblical inerrancy Reconstructionist Judaism Jews as a chosen people History of Christianity Heaven Christian eschatology Evil Angel Mormonism and Judaism Apologetics Philosophy of religion Nation of Islam Qur'an Human Hinduism Zoroastrianism Merit Book of Mormon
