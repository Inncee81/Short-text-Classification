why am i being pushed by family and friends to have another in addition to my other two i'm not ready for one but i also feel this urge my family keeps asking when the next one's to be expected and they normally don't push this with most of the family just the setlled ones my friends both online and offline keep asking me and hoping for it and on both sides the majority are not muslim so it's not a population increase thing i'm also hearing that this urge that i'm also having to have another is god's way of telling me to get going on it so why are most of the people i know encouraging me to have another this is confusing i also just got remarried in may it hasn't even been a year why start so soon in this new life is it a spiritual thing for them for me for who because everyone loves babies especially when they don't have to change the diapers buy the diapers wake up in the middle of the night clean up baby puke or i love it when you get puked on especially when you're bouncing the baby above your head looking up and it goes in your mouth come on parents you know what i'm talking about i've gotten it from all three of my sons you'd think i'd learn but and all the other little things that go with a baby when they can hand them back dirty diaper stinky and needing a bath people just love it when people tell me and my wife you should have another or when are you going to try again i tell them oh right away but we'll let them stay with you til they get out of college ok and that usually stops them cold of course there are benefits to having kids close together my three sons are months apart from each other one was in april one was in july and the baby will be in october they have the same interests play with each other well etc Infantilism Milton H.
