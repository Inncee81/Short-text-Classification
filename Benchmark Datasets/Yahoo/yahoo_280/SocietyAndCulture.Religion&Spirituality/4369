christians its not that i dont like christians they can do or believe in whatever they want but the christians at the church that i used to go to wouldnt let anyone date kiss hold hands no make up pericings no gays no nothing but i see other christians arent like this im confused so tell me how christians are really like christians come in all kinds most don't care about makeup and piercings and dating kissing and holding hands is usually a parental thing for instance i think i would have a problem with my daughter kissing guys until she were at least or so but i doubt i would know if she were doing it earlier as for homosexuals some churches are more liberal than others generally it's seen as a sin and someone who is a practicing gay who comes to jesus should make an effort to stop at some point and most would never accept a gay preacher minister priest but most churches wouldn't turn them away from being in their service as long as they weren't being offensive Homosexuality and Christianity Church of Christ New Testament Religion and sexual orientation Roman Catholic Church History of Christianity Infant baptism Christianity Holy Orders Uniting Church in Australia Clerical celibacy Eastern Orthodox Church Baptism Religious pluralism Sun Myung Moon Theology Same-sex marriage Gospel Religion and sexuality Minister of religion Baptist Separation of church and state Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Biblical canon Mormonism and Christianity Marriage Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Homosexuality Catechism Eucharist Catholicism Theodicy Christianity and anti-Semitism Presbyterian Church (USA) Criticisms of Christianity Friends Unitarian Universalism Gay rights Unitarianism Ex-gay Heresy Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist History of Christianity and homosexuality Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Anglican views of homosexuality Priesthood (Mormonism) Martin Luther Didache Anal sex Resurrection of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Idolatry Recurring South Park characters Seventh-day Adventist Church Sabbath Rick Santorum Traditionalist Catholic Protestantism Celtic Christianity Sexual orientation Messianic Judaism Religious Society of Friends Pope Benedict XVI Gay Jesus Fundamentalism History of sex Paul of Tarsus Transsexuality Opus Dei Mennonite Gender role Russian Orthodox Church Disciples of Christ Excommunication Boston Public Nicene Creed Christian view of marriage Evangelical Lutheran Church in America John Wycliffe United Methodist Church Saint Peter Gospel of Thomas Restorationism Bible and reincarnation Calvinism Evangelicalism Richard Allen (reverend) Liberal Christianity Homosexuality and Judaism Temple in Jerusalem Catholic sacraments Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Acts of the Apostles Mormonism and Judaism Original sin Purgatory
