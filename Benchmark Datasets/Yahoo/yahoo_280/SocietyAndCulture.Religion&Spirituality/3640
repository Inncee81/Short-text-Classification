trinitarians do you hold the original belief of the trinity the athanasian creed do you believe this whoever wants to be saved should above all cling to the catholic faith whoever does not guard it whole and inviolable will doubtless perish eternally now this is the catholic faith we worship one god in trinity and the trinity in unity neither confusing the persons nor dividing the divine being for the father is one person the son is another and the spirit is still another but the deity of the father son and holy spirit is one equal in glory coeternal in majesty what the father is the son is and so is the holy spirit uncreated is the father uncreated is the son uncreated is the spirit the father is infinite the son is infinite the holy spirit is infinite eternal is the father eternal is the son eternal is the spirit and yet there are not three eternal beings but one who is eternal as there are not three uncreated and unlimited beings but one who is uncreated and unlimited almighty is the father almighty is the son almighty is the spirit and yet there are not three almighty beings but one who is almighty thus the father is god the son is god the holy spirit is god and yet there are not three gods but one god thus the father is lord the son is lord the holy spirit is lord and yet there are not three lords but one lord as christian truth compels us to acknowledge each distinct person as god and lord so catholic religion forbids us to say that there are three gods or lords the father was neither made nor created nor begotten the son was neither made nor created but was alone begotten of the father the spirit was neither made nor created but is proceeding from the father and the son thus there is one father not three fathers one son not three sons one holy spirit not three spirits and in this trinity no one is before or after greater or less than the other whobut all three persons are in themselves coeternal and coequal and so we must worship the trinity in unity and the one god in three persons ever wants to be saved should think thus about the trinity it is necessary for eternal salvation that one also faithfully believe that our lord jesus christ became flesh for this is the true faith that we believe and confess that our lord jesus christ god's son is both god and man he is god begotten before all worlds from the being of the father and he is man born in the world from the being of his mother existing fully as god and fully as man with a rational soul and a human body equal to the father in divinity subordinate to the father in humanity although he is god and man he is not divided but is one christ he is united because god has taken humanity into himself he does not transform deity into humanity he is completely one in the unity of his person without confusing his natures for as the rational soul and body are one person so the one christ is god and man he suffered death for our salvation he descended into hell and rose again from the dead he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father he will come again to judge the living and the dead at his coming all people shall rise bodily to give an account of their own deeds those who have done good will enter eternal life those who have done evil will enter eternal fire this is the catholic faith one cannot be saved without believing this firmly and faithfully you are mistaken the catholic athanasian creed does not contain the original belief of the trinity tertullian c to c e was the first to use the latin word trinitas tertullian proposed that god is one substance consisting in three persons this does not mean however that he had in mind three coequal and coeternal persons tertullian s concept of father son and holy spirit was a far cry from christendom s trinity for he was a subordinationist he viewed the son as subordinate to the father theophilus triad was made up of god and his word and his wisdom those early concepts of the trinity are quite different from the trinity as described by the athanasian creed Heresy Protestantism New Testament Origin belief Mass (liturgy) Second Vatican Council Devil Al-Ghazali Theodicy Mortification of the flesh Perseverance of the saints Paul of Tarsus Charles Grandison Finney Sacrifice Idolatry Trimurti Unitarianism Baptist John Howard Yoder Meaning of life Adam-God theory Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Buddhism Pre-existence Restorationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theology
