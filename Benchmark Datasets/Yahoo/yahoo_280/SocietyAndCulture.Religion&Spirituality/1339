when in his lifetime did jesus pbuh ever say worship me for i am your god also where in the bible does it say that the religion of the followers of christ is christanity from what i know christ was not even his name nor was it jesus the name christ comes from the greek word christos which means the annointed that is christ is a greek translation of the hebrew title messiah the name jesus on the other hand is a latinized version of the hebrew name esau your right prophet jesus isa did not say that and for the guy who answered jesus is worshiped because he is god he and the holy spirit pointed to god even though they were also god straight out your wrong first of all jesus is not god neither the son of god god does not resemble the creation whatever you imagine in your mind god is different from it jesus was a person he lived just like we do he was in need meaning he needed food clothing etc god does not need any of his creations you understand god is not like us because we are in need we live we die we get sick how can you say such things god is attributed with an eternal and everlasting life which does not resemble our life god is one not meaning a number because a number can be taken away from it means the one who does need anything yet everything else needs him his existence does not end everything that exists except allah the creator is created by him the words he his and him used in reference to allah must not be construed to refer to gender allah has full power over every bit of his creation allah is not created he existed always having his attributes allah will never perish nor will his attributes diminish the attributes of allah are uncountable among which are he has knowledge of all his creation he sees the seeable things and he hears the hearable things his knowing seeing and hearing are in no way similar to ours allah's kalam speech is not made up of language or sound nor does it resemble the speech of man in any way allah does not need any of his creation for his existence and he does not resemble any of his creation in any way this means that allah is not a man or a woman he is not a father or a mother allah does not have a wife a mother a father a son or a daughter he has no equal or partner allah does not divide into parts no creation has a part of allah in him nor can any creation become like allah he is the only god Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jesus Trinity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Angel Mary, the mother of Jesus God the Father Isa Abrahamic religion John the Baptist Salvation Sin Ten Commandments Prophets of Islam Christian eschatology Names and titles of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Idolatry Islam Prophet Book of Mormon Athanasian Creed Christ Sola fide Chosen people Justification (theology) God and gender Religion Origin belief Soul Christianity Genesis Satan Linguistics and the Book of Mormon New Testament Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Eastern Orthodox Church Tetragrammaton Qiyamah Creationism Book of Isaiah Adam and Eve Predestination Sabbath Baptism Mormonism and Judaism Nation of Islam Religious perspectives on Jesus Names of God in Judaism Jewish Messiah Saint Priesthood (Mormonism) Binitarianism Horus Christian views of Jesus Qur'an Virgin Mary in Islam Nontrinitarianism Repentance Catholicism Gospel of Thomas Muraqaba Original sin Love Creed Demon Gospel of Barnabas Gospel of John Religious Society of Friends Antichrist Church of Christ, Scientist Resurrection of Jesus Theology Islamic philosophy Sharia Roman Catholic Church A Course In Miracles Christian Origen Moses Historical Jesus Nicene Creed Mormonism and Christianity Christian denomination Godhead (Mormonism) Duties of the Heart Jehovah's Witnesses Apostles' Creed
