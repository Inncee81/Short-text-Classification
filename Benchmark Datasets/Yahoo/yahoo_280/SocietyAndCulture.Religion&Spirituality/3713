what do you do with perception do you try adjust transform it if so how is there a way to get beyond it am eager to hear your considered and experientially verified opinions surely we're not stuck with the way we think now the only ones who don't change their minds are the dead mr david baird what's the right way to channel things am starting to think it's got something to do with attachment and letting go recalled post posting will keep an open mind though there may be something between the two extremes though such things've been described as rivers streams our perceptions guide our thoughts and our thoughts then guide our actions our actions then are guided by our perceptions our perceptions misguide us our perceptions are a pile of things in pali a khandha there are such khandhas this particular pile of things is made up of things which filter our reality one such filter is the perception of permanence of all experiences this is the one which we should examine closely because when we perceive all things and experiences as permanent it causes us to be deluded about our reality and causes us to be deluded about ourselves let us examine our reality from this perspective then to see how accurate this perception of permanence really is firstly do we consider ourselves permanent the answer is no we know that we age and will die yet we perceive that we are permanent how is this so what actions are evidence of such thoughts remember the first paragraph above our perceptions guide our thoughts and then our thoughts guide our actions well it follows that although we know that we age we perceive ourselves quite differently examine the evidence of how much money is spent on beauty products plastic surgery prosthetic breasts and implants purchased to enhance youthful looks and to maintain the appearance of youth the beauty industry is enormous and growing these actions are done specifically because folks perceive that they are permanent and that when they notice that they are getting older their thoughts turn to surgery and beauty products to maintain their previously youthful looks their perceptions are of permanent youth yet they know that they age this is dukkha this is suffering this is the suffering of being apart from something they like that is youth this dukkha this suffering this anguish over lost youth is caused by a perception of permanence which can be fixed as it were it can be fixed by changing this perception of permanence to a perception of impermanence how is this done then it is done by observation of things and experiences which will highlight this characteristic of impermanence in all things and experiences for example think of something else other than ourselves or aging which would be considered permanent but is in fact impermanent what about a simple pretty flower then we know a flower ages and its beauty will fade we know that it is impermanent right why is it then that we think it a sad sight when we see such a faded flower it is not the knowing which is the delusion it is the perception which is the delusion we all know that things are impermanent yet we always perceive permanence the faded flower is the case in point as well as the aging mentioned above there is a reason why we think the way we do we always become the participant in our experiences when this happens we pick up the feelings from these experiences we become part of the experience and we then own these feelings this ownership is the delusion and it is because of this ownership that we suffer to not become a participant does not mean that we do not feel anguish over lost youth or not feel sad at the sight of a faded flower on the contrary we continue to feel these feelings they are natural and part of the experiences we experience however to change our perceptions we need to become the observer of such feelings and such experiences when we do this our stance as it were changes in relationship to these things because we are no longer participants we no longer pick up these feelings we still feel them but they remain with the experience itself when the experience fades then so do the feelings associated with it when these feelings fade we notice that these feelings are impermanent only lasting for the time the experience lasts thus begins this process of change for our perceptions no longer will be worried about aging because we not only know we age but we also perceive it in our thoughts knowing and thus thinking thus perceiving thus that aging and its associated feelings of loss are part of the experience of aging leaving these feelings of loss with this experience of noticing that we have aged yet again similarly with the experience of seeing a faded flower similarly to any other experience we thus experience thus do we become the observer thus do we change our way of thinking thus do we change our way of acting thus do our changed perceptions change the way we act this changes everything thus do we begin our journey towards enlightenment when we become aware of the truth of all experiences that they are impermanent unsatisfactory because they are impermanent empty because they are impermanent so they should be seen with wisdom for what they are and so we shall see that these feelings should not be clung to and our suffering caused by clinging to them ends clinging is the buddhist term for picking these feelings up in pali upadana the suffering inherent in life does not end but we see this suffering with wisdom for what it is thus do we understand it thus do we observe it thus do we feel it and thus do we note it with such training we can watch it fade as it always does thoughts on impermanence perceptions delusion and suffering from a buddhist
