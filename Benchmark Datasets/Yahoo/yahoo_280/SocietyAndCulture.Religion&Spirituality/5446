catholics and whoever wants to answer this one can someone explain to me why catholic churches have statues of mary outside their churches schools ect when there is this in the bible you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down to them or serve them for i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments or am i taking this out of context please explain yourmomisaviolationn i did not say statute i said statue a statue is a sculpture depicting a specific entity usually a person event animal or object its primary concern is representational a small statue is called statuette a statue of just a head and shoulders is a bust dont correct something that is correct thank you to all who has answered so far i was very interested to see everyones opinions on this it is a learning experience for me stephen l no i find the music i listen to very beautiful in its own special way mary is the mother of the church jesus gave us her as our mother when he gave her to john's care john mary reminds us to always do whatever he tells you to do john a statue of mary is not a god we don't believe the statue has any power or value other than artistic value therefore the statues are not idols or graven images they're art catholics like art because it's a form of creativity making art is acting in the image of god which is what we were created to be we don't bow to the statue we bow to god the statue reminds us to bow to god so it's there when we're bowing to god but we aren't bowing to the statue or worshiping it it's just art that being said there are a handful of catholics who go way overboard on mary i think it's safe to say that there really are some catholics who actually worship mary but we're not supposed to worship mary we are taught it would be a sin to worship anyone other than god same as you are so these folks who do worship mary are mistaken befuddled in error they need merciful correction you see there are sinners in the catholic church we're not all perfect we all have something wrong that we can correct improve so if you really want to judge catholicism you can't go by what people do because nobody's perfect you have to judge the catechism and in the catechism we're taught not to worship anyone other than god Idolatry Ten Commandments Catholicism God Original sin Baptism Sin Salvation Holy Spirit Trinity Idolatry in Christianity Catechism Sabbath Icon Roman Catholic Church Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity New Testament Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Apostles' Creed Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Meaning of life Justification (theology) A Course In Miracles Michael (archangel) John the Baptist Church of Christ Sola fide Book of Revelation Opus Dei Religion Book of Isaiah Mary Magdalene Martin Luther Virgin Mary in Islam Fallen angel Christian views of Jesus Prophet 613 mitzvot Christianity Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Biblical inerrancy Lutheranism Horus God and gender Alan Campbell (pastor) The Two Babylons Nontrinitarianism Jesus Qiyamah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Infant baptism Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Mortification of the flesh Angel Merit Devil Satan Rich Mullins Mass (liturgy) Eucharist Book of Mormon Charles Grandison Finney Hell Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Calvinism Gospel of Thomas Church of Christ, Scientist John Wesley Abrahamic religion Second Vatican Council Repentance Mormonism and Judaism Confession Philipp Melanchthon Purgatory Origin belief Christian eschatology Paradise Lost Soul Paul of Tarsus Contrition Vishnu Resurrection of Jesus Noah Prayer in Christianity Binitarianism Israel ben Eliezer The Passion of the Christ Heaven Protestantism
