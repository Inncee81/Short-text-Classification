am i a bad atheist i am an atheist i know that as atheists we are not supposed to bash people for their beliefs in religion anyway i get very irritated when i hear people talking about their beliefs in a certain god i usually respect peoples beliefs but when it comes to religion i can't hold back the fact of trying to disprove their beliefs am i a bad atheist lol to all those who are saying i am an annoying person i do it in a nice way and try to converse about it at least atheists aren't angry people so piss off xhellant please don't preach your faith on me ever again the term atheist refers only to the fact that you fail to have a belief in a god or gods it has nothing to do with how to behave you can't be a good or a bad atheist however consider why you get so irritated i must admit to feeling the same way at times it's the futility of the entire thing i feel the most frustrated when people i care about and respect believe in invisible entities for no good reason i e faith it's hard to swallow take your time step back and let them have their fantasies if they make foolish decisions based on their ancient text illogical immoral both etc then step in as the voice of reason and ask them what their own heart and mind tells them one other really terrific thing to do is to ask them to look at first peter in their bible it tells them they must be prepared to explain their faith there is no possible legitimate answer for this as you well know most often they simply use a circular argument that the bible is the word of god and they know this because of their faith and they have their faith because of the bible tells them if they can't support their faith then they aren't doing what the bible asks check out the atheist community of austin they have a podcast and or google videos with their president matt dillahunty among others who is brilliant on their audience call in show public access show the atheist experience they also have another podcast show called the non prophets they've really helped me to clarify and solidify my discussions with believers good luck ya lousy fellow atheist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Religion Existence of God God Theory of conduct Supernatural Strong atheism Soul Creationism Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biblical inerrancy Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Intelligent design movement Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity History of creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion Afterlife Biblical canon Prophet Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Evolutionary creationism God Emperor of Dune Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christianity Devil Freemasonry Separation of church and state A Course In Miracles Idolatry Apostasy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Alcoholics Anonymous Sola fide Slow Train Coming Jewish principles of faith Evangelicalism Moral objectivism Twelve-step program Phaedo John Howard Yoder Bible Intelligent design Creation science Apologetics Sin Presuppositional apologetics Dispensationalism Nation of Islam Goodness and value theory Evil Religious Society of Friends Argument from morality Baptism Criticism of Mormonism Trinity Religious pluralism Jesus Alan Campbell (pastor) Theology Discordianism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Messianic Judaism God and gender Predestination Infant baptism Phillip E.
