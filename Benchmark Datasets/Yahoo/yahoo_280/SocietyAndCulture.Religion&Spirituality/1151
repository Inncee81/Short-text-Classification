in laws not respecting my religious beliefs my in laws are methodist they just recently started back to church my husband was baptized methodist but has not been to church in years he is not practicing nor does he have any religious affiliation i myself am roman catholic practicing and my husband and i decided together that our children will be raised roman catholic here come the in laws they know i'm roman catholic yet they send their preacher to my home unannounced to convert me into their church they repeatedly ask to take my son to their church these people are not godly they do not represent christianity in the least they are a bunch of rowdy rude individuals with no respect for my religious beliefs nor any tolerance for others who differ from themselves spiritually or even racially what would you do would you limit the contact with your child and yourself from these whacko's i don't have any problems with other religious beliefs whatsoever it was very hurtful that they felt the need to do this thank you for your answers non sensical and otherwise i still appreciate it i am not here to attack i have no desire to attack others we as a married couple have decided to raise our child with morals and dignity and it just so happens it will be in a roman catholic church as we have decided our son is months old i have given his family respect in their beliefs and they have not done thus with my own they ridicule it and never ask questions of understanding i tell them if you want to know please ask don't assume knowledge is a powerful tool that many should learn to use thank you you and your husband continue to raise your children in the catholic faith what the recent document from rome addresses is the more subtle question of the relationship between the catholic church and other christian churches and ecclesial communities the church fathers of the second vatican council taught in lumen gentium article that the church of christ subsists in the catholic church rather than is the catholic church this means that the church of christ is found in the catholic church and is comprised of all those rites that confess the church to be one holy catholic and apostolic as proclaimed in the creed and recognize the pope as the successor of peter this distinction also recognizes that while the catholic church possesses all the constitutive elements of the church founded by christ other christian communities that have broken communion with the catholic church retain many of these same elements of sanctification and truth including baptism and the transforming presence of christ in scripture as such the means of salvation in the lord jesus are available to non catholic christians since they too have been baptized into the lord's death and resurrection this distinction also reminds us as members of the catholic church that while we have maintained unity with the apostolic church established by jesus christ we are always in need of conversion and repentance both as individuals and as a community of faith this observation leads to another important distinction that the document tries to clarify what is the difference in meaning and application between the terms church and ecclesial community in order to understand this distinction we must remember that there are two essential elements that are necessary to constitute the existence of the church they are a validly ordained priesthood that is a necessary prerequisite for a valid celebration of the eucharist validly ordained bishops i e those who are in the line of apostolic succession validly confer the three degrees of the sacrament of holy orders catechism of the catholic church if these two essential elements do not exist in any community of christian believers they do not form a church but rather an ecclesial community of christian faith thus many of our protestant brothers and sisters whose communities were formed after the reformation of the th century are called ecclesial communities because they did not maintain apostolic succession many do not celebrate all of the seven sacraments or believe all that is maintained in the creed as handed down to us by the apostles they remain however communities that are vibrant alive with faith in the lord jesus and committed to the gospel message to evangelize the world it is unfortunate that many have understood these recent documents from rome as representing a retreat in the work of ecumenism nothing can be farther from the truth pope benedict xvi in his first encyclical deus caritas est had this to say about ecumenism and the progress needed to be made union with christ is also union with all those to whom he gives himself i cannot possess christ just for myself i can belong to him only in union with all those who have become or who will become his own communion draws me out of myself towards him and thus also towards unity with all christians article the clear desire that jesus had at the last supper was that all would be one perhaps the lord foresaw the divisions that would occur among those who would follow him how important it is for us today to work for this unity and understanding among ourselves unfortunately human words and theological concepts seldom bring us together it is the lived relationships of love and acceptance that make us one in christ and recognize that our faith in jesus christ many times goes beyond our theological understanding the work of ecumenism which seeks unity among christian churches and ecclesial communities is something that we cannot shy away from it is to put out into the deep and recognize our isolation and work toward the unity that christ sincerely desired pray with me that the work for ecumenism in our own diocese here in brooklyn and queens will bear fruit as we witness the mutual love concern and respect for all who bear the name of christian source s bishop nicholas dimarzio
