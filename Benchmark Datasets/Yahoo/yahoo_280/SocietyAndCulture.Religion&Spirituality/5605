for christians only a question about the truth of the bible there are many people here that say that you can be a practicing homosexual and be a christian and it is ok with god i don't think so granted we all as christians fall and are not perfect however if the sin that jesus died on the cross to save me from i was still practicing how could god be pleased with that he died to give us freedom from sin not freedom to sin didn't he thanks for saying that we cannot continue to sin when i mentioned the homosexual sin i was also talking about any sin that we do not repent of so please those people that practice homosexuality do not think i am pointing fingers just at you because when i point a finger at someone else there are pointing back at me i am praying that all of us who call on the name of jesus would desire to live lives that please him saying that if g c happens to read my question i want to thank him openly for his discussion with me about this subject he knows what i am talking about it is so wonderful to have a civil conversation that may not necessarily agree with me flannelpajamas i am far from judging that is not my intention at all in fact i thought i made that clear by saying all sin including myself judging and saying what scripture says about life are two entirely different things i believe sorry if you were offended all sins are the same before god all is an abomination to him who is holy it is not ok to practise any kind of sex outside of marriage because it is fornication i think we are the ones who make homosexuality look sooo much worse that any other sin when to god it is all sin and it is all unrighteousness to him Homosexuality and Christianity Sin Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Merit Baptism Eastern Orthodox Church Evil Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Predestination Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Christ Repentance Theodicy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Confession Alan Campbell (pastor) Infant baptism Religion Abrahamic religion Roman Catholic Church John the Baptist Sola fide Charles Grandison Finney Holy Spirit Homosexuality Salvation A Course In Miracles God Christianity Trinity Mormonism Purgatory Anglican views of homosexuality Religious pluralism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theology Sabbath Original sin Resurrection of Jesus Mormonism and Christianity Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Sacrifice Book of Mormon Philipp Melanchthon New Testament Religious conversion Tertullian Perseverance of the saints The Amber Spyglass John Wycliffe Rich Mullins Noahide Laws Great Apostasy Opus Dei John Howard Yoder Calvinism Urantia Sodom and Gomorrah Summa Theologiae Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Church of Christ, Scientist Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Martin Luther Contrition Mass (liturgy) Indulgence Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Religion and sexual orientation Fundamentalism Ex-gay Biblical canon Religion and sexuality Slow Train Coming Liberal Christianity Prophet Infantilism Anselm of Canterbury Judaism Book of Isaiah Coptic Christianity Separation of church and state Clerical celibacy Sexual orientation Homosexuality and Islam Idolatry in Christianity Homosexuality and Judaism
