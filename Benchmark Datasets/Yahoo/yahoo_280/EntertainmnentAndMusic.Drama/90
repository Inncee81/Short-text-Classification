i have a question about a csi or law and order episode it was an episode where the star character is catching a guy who was a rapist and he is hanging on to an apparentment building window and he feels to the ground and dies and when the woman was talking to him the song played it was something like will you remember me when im dead and gone what song is it please i cant find it and its driving me nuts i can tell you right off the bat it's not from law order criminal intent or csi from season's as i have seen all of them i highly doubt it's from law order they don't deal with rapists if it's not the episode i have suggested below than it's most likely from one of the csi's the csi's play music in the episodes the l o's very very rarely play music if it does turn out to be a csi episode i suggest this website to you elyse's csi music http members aol com jrd csi music htm she has a list of music from all three csi show's so that would be your best bet if it does turn out to be a csi episode it could be dependent from svu http imdb com title tt follow that link in the episode elliot stabler the main character is running after a rapist and he catches up to him while the guy is trying to jump on a fence elliot grabs the rapist in a choke hold and the guy dies i cant remember if there was a song or not it's a possibility because i do remember music but l o's are not known for having songs in there episodes unfortunately i dont know any l o sites that list songs that have been in the episodes as there wouldnt be much of a point since there are such few songs on the l o's but if it does turn out to be that episode you would be able to find it easier so i hope that helps you Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Law & Order CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Quentin Tarantino CSI: NY The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Fictional crossover Timon and Pumbaa Theme music CSI: Miami Crossing Jordan The Shining (film) Code: Lyoko Luke and Laura Spencer Friends New York Giants The Who discography Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skateboarding trick Memento (film) Undergrads Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Brian Griffin Aerial (dance move) Christopher Meloni Baseball Law & Order franchise The Lovely Bones Andy Kaufman Characters of Lost Stewie Griffin The O.C.
