canon inkjet printer reviews i'm wanting to purchase a good quality color printer i'm a graphic designer so i'll use it alot also what kind of maintenance is required any pros cons to canons or can you recommend any i have customers who are very pleased with their canon's print quality canon tank model printers multiple cartridges that are just tanks printhead is not part of the cartridge but part of the machine are preferred for the inexpensive cartridges as well as the ability to manage each color independently they don't have to replace an expensive tri color cartridge they just switch out the yellow if that's the one color that's gone the problem with most tank model machines canon epson brother is that they don't have huge monthly duty cycles they are more likely to die for two reasons lack of use and the printhead plugs apparently not something you'll have to deal with or printhead burn out from over taxing the printer two suggestions consider a color laserjet hp and samsung prices have dropped to reasonable level or if you require an output closer to photo quality i recommend the business inkjet series from hp my reasoning is the same for both individual cartridges durable and readily available consumables drum unit for the laser printheads for the inkjet if you are already comparing models make sure you look at the specs found on the manufacturers' websites you'll want to pay close attention to the duty cycles Computer printer Atari 8-bit family Konica Minolta Typewriter Laser printer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital photography Photocopying Epson Seiko Corporation Atari ST Commodore 64 Centronics Apple Macintosh Sega Saturn Gramophone record Printer Control Language Hewlett-Packard Nintendo Entertainment System Loss leader TRS-80 Color Computer Firearm Nintendo 64 Video game crash of 1983 Fountain pen Inflation Super Nintendo Entertainment System Bulk vending Tax Airsoft PostScript Light-emitting diode Amstrad CPC Commodore International High-definition television Phonograph Common Unix Printing System CPU design ZX Spectrum Windows XP Energy development System/36 M60 machine gun Laserdisc Laser engraving Nintendo Ammunition Revolver Apple II family Cartridge (firearms) LaserWriter Central processing unit Gross domestic product TRS-80 Cartridge (electronics) Neo-Geo Razor and blades business model Carburetor Audiophile Diesel engine Beretta 92F/FS Tank Multifunction printer Corporate governance AK-47 CPU cache Atari 2600 Color printing M16 (rifle) Color X Window System Sega Industrial engineering Image scanner USB flash drive Embedded system IBM PC compatible 3dfx System/34 ATI Technologies Texas Instruments TI-99/4A GDI Bicycle lighting Nuclear power Economics Commodore Plus/4 IPod Keynesian economics Heinkel He 112 Aluminium
