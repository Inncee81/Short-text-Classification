whats better xbox or ps you see i have a wii already but i'm looking for something different and i'm having some trouble deciding between xbox and a ps so could i get some help well it all depends on what type of gamer you are right now i have a ps and i loooove it both are good though but i think the ps is the bigger bang for your buck here is my recommendation if you want a multimedia console that has online gaming movie downloads etc overall focus on intense gaming like mature and teen games and great exclusives ex gears of war halo tenchu z etc then get the xbox some xbox s have hardware problems my friend is on his rd xbox red rings of death which he bought his first one at launch but also my one friend who recieved his last christmas hasn't had any problems microsoft now gives a year warrenty so just incase it does happen your going to be protected for a while if you want a multimedia console that has freee online is well balanced with all types of games good exclusives as well heavenly sword lair ninja gaiden sigma little big planet resistance etc and many other features like web browsing and ps home then get the ps ps doesnt have rumble in the controllers though which is one part i hate about it around christmas rumble controllers will be released though i like the ps because it comes with wifi blue ray gb and rechargeable controllers also if you wanted this same amount of power except for more gigs on your xbox elite it would cost around total for the wifi hd player year of xbox live charge kit this would save you around bucks ps price estimated cost around with hdmi chord plus microsoft only allows the to be compatible with microsoft equipment ex hardrive and headset so if you like wanted to upgrade you ps or buy a mic you could go to ebay and find one really cheap i found a mic for bucks and have found gb hardrives on ebay for around bucks still making it cheaper than the but then again you might not use these extras so you might wanna go for the wii or xbox since of the price difference many people also compare the ps to the xbox and say that the xbox is better based on present facts duhh the has been out a year longer than the ps the ps hasn't even been out for very long to release all these great games and present all of its great features by christmas the ps will have great games along ps home and xbox will only have the overated halo dont get me wrong halo is a great series but it is just overated again like i said it all revolves around what you like and what you can afford if you can afford anyone of the consoles and like anything then i would go for the ps ps also all these next gen systems will be good in the long run they will last for around years so saving up for the ps is the wisest choice the ps will get tons of exclusives by christmas lair warhawk heavenly sword ratchet and clank future tools of destruction the getaway white knight story afrika tekken etc and many of these exclusives are new unlike previous exclusives like the metal gear solid series go for the ps its the way to go if you cant between both yes the is a good console but the ps is more superior and will be better in the long run Halo: Combat Evolved Xbox Live Computer and video games Halo (video game series) Wipeout (game) Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Dead or Alive (video game) Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Revolution Video game music Machinima PlayStation Portable First-person shooter Counter-Strike Nintendo DS IBM PC compatible Microsoft Ninja Gaiden Sega Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Console wars History of video games (Sixth generation era) Gradius History of computer and video games Game controller TurboGrafx 16 Need for Speed Windows XP DVD Modchip The Sims Microsoft Windows Lightsaber Timeline of computing 1990-forward Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh MMORPG Console game Phantasy Star Online Sonic the Hedgehog Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Computer and video game genres Game Critics Awards Marathon (computer game) Computer role-playing game Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal Game Boy Advance Sega 32X Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Windows 2000 Universal Serial Bus Pump It Up Nintendo 64 Bungie Studios History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo Entertainment System Final Fantasy Mouse (computing) NVIDIA Super Robot Wars IPod MAME PowerPC Intellivision FIFA Series Blue screen of death Resident Evil Voice over IP Madden NFL Radeon Ninja Game Boy Star Wars: Battlefront Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Grand Theft Auto III Nintendo Power History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) MechAssault Electronic Arts Shen Gong Wu Game programming Yu Suzuki DirectX DualShock
