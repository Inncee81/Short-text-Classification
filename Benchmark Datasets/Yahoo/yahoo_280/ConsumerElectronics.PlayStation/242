ps repair the controller port is broken on my ps therefore i really can't play any games does anyone know how to go about getting this repaired if it can be fixed is it expensive thanks for any help you can give me it is possible to get the ps repaired but depending on what's actually wrong with it it might just be cheaper to buy a new unit i'd call sony or go onto their website to find an authorized repair shop near you and call them about an estimate however i'm guessing they'll opt to replace the entire mainboard which will cost you most of what a brand new ps would cost if buying a new unit sounds too expensive you could also buy a used one from game stop or ebgames and save a few bucks they'll give you a warranty too Warranty Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Digital photography Land Rover Modchip Personal rapid transit MAME Binoculars $ale of the Century Paintball Sound Blaster Loss leader Nintendo Entertainment System Space Shuttle program Videocassette recorder Auto insurance Wheel of Fortune Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Mutual fund Neopets Gross domestic product Sega Pinball Floppy disk Sony Commodore 64 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Poker jargon Best Buy Nintendo FairTax MOS Technology Ericsson Mattress Annuity Motherboard Xbox Arbitrage Regional lockout Atari 8-bit family Planned obsolescence Airbus A380 Computer and video games Pebble bed reactor Sega Dreamcast Capacitor plague Leasing Insurance Inkjet printer TurboGrafx 16 Bulk vending Zerg Computer workstation Atari 2600 Card Sharks Bicycle lighting Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Sweatshop Family Feud Dynamic random access memory Arcade cabinet PlayStation 2 RuneScape weapons Intellivision Intermediate consumption F-16 Fighting Falcon Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Sega Saturn Violin CPU design Parable of the broken window USS Walke (DD-723) IPod CPU cache Disc brake Bicycle brake systems Video game crash of 1983 Windows 2000 1919 World Series Scrabble (game show) Amiga Space elevator Cruising (maritime) Counter-Strike Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis United Artists Bob and George Inflation BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Extreme Programming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Outsourcing UK Singles Chart Social Security (United States) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sears Holdings Corporation R46 (New York City Subway car)
