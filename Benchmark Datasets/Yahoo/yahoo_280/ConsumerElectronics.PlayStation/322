on the ps when you download demos videos etc and delete them do portions stay on your hard drive i was wondering if the ps acts like a typical pc with windows in that if i download trailers videos demos etc and i delete them are there still portions of these files present on the hard drive or once a demo is deleted once a trailer is deleted it's truly deleted almost in the same way a mac deletes its files no it does not keep things like a pc once its deleted then its gone and in order to access any part of it you would have to re download program it ITunes Computer virus Linux Java programming language Macintosh Finder File system Microsoft Windows Commodore 64 HyperCard PlayStation 3 File Allocation Table The Sims 2 Mac OS X v10.4 Library (computer science) ITunes Music Store Internet Message Access Protocol BitTorrent History of Microsoft Windows Gmail Mac OS X Wget Trusted computing DOS Xbox 360 Virtual memory TiVo Online music store IPod WordPerfect Microsoft Office Windows Me Malware Mozilla Firefox NTFS IBM PC compatible Game demo Microsoft .NET Kazaa LiveCD Hard disk NeXT Anti-virus software PlayStation Portable Spyware Object Desktop Symbolic link Windows XP Diablo II: Lord of Destruction JavaScript System 7 (Macintosh) Nintendo DS Demoscene Halo 2 Amiga ZX Spectrum Guns N' Roses H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Windows registry MS-DOS QuickTime Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Filename extension Warez Screenshot HP BASIC for OpenVMS OpenOffice.org Internet Relay Chat Mouse (computing) GIF Concurrent Versions System Defragmentation Video game music Digital audio player Linked list Apple IIGS Computer security Mac OS 8 Peer-to-peer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer and video games Web crawler WordStar Battlefield 2 NTFS junction point History of operating systems CIH virus The Beatles bootlegs MDAC File system permissions Mac OS X v10.3 Steam (content delivery) Nine Inch Nails MSN Messenger Python programming language Myst V: End of Ages Mach kernel Theora
