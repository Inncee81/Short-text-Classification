what's the best but cheapest headset to use for ps besides the black logitech ones those are crappy also are there any wireless ones there aren't any wireless headsets that work with the ps at least that i am aware of the only one's supported by sony are the logitech and sony versions of the ps headset your best bet is to stick with these and just buy an extra warranty so if they cut out or break you can replace them free of charge i've gone through many headsets myself but i prefer the logitech one over the sony brand Xbox Bluetooth PlayStation 2 Mouse (computing) Sony Nintendo DS Xbox 360 PlayStation Portable Tungsten Handheld Karaoke Revolution Logitech BlackBerry Headphones Nintendo Wipeout (game) PlayStation 3 Handheld game console Walkman Ericsson Warranty Crappie Sound Blaster Sony Pictures Entertainment USB flash drive Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal Headset (bicycle part) EyeToy Verizon Wireless Poker jargon Final Fantasy IX Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple Computer Apple Macintosh Opera (web browser) Xbox Live Treo 650 Mattress Resident Evil (video game) Console wars Floppy disk Wi-Fi N-Gage DualShock Garth Brooks Universal Serial Bus Viacom Sobeys Voice over IP Copyleft Memory Stick Telephone Ad hoc protocol list ITunes Music Store Nintendo GameCube PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Dell Axim Craps Octopus card Sony Ericsson T610 High-definition television Videocassette recorder Regional lockout Sony Computer Entertainment Versions and ports of Doom Nintendo Revolution Computer and video games Wireless network IBM PC compatible The Beatles' influence History of radio PowerBook Outsourcing Gizmondo Columbia Pictures Television Aztec Call centre Skype Rebranding Implied warranty Connectix ThinkPad Game controller Vodafone Atari Jaguar Videoconferencing Wireless Application Protocol Freeview Pok__mon (video games) Instrument Landing System AT&T Wireless Kenny McCormick World Championship Wrestling Modchip Vorbis Final Fantasy (video game) Yamigo Sony Ericsson P900 AT&T
