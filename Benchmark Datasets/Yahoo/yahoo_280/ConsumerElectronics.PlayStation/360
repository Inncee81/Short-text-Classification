do those slim line ps 's break down like the old ones i was thinking of getting a newer ps and ran across the slim line brand i had an old ps that died pretty quickly from that infamous disc read error crap and would like to avoid that if at all possible its really reliable compared to the old model ps 's but i never bought the dollar stand for the slim model and so it fell over all the time i put magazines near it so it fell on a less hard surface than my wooden floor it lasted me years of falling over constantly then died also don't lay it flat on a floor especially carpet because it will heat up very quickly and you'll kill it in short just get the stand attachment and it'll work for a very long time Craps Hard disk Mattress Floppy disk Drill bit Laserdisc PlayStation 2 Bicycle brake systems Laptop IMac Oscilloscope Eminem GunZ The Duel Aerial (dance move) Fielding (cricket) Trish Stratus Die making Anchor Wind power Rathfarnham Seismic retrofit Nine Inch Nails Naval mine Audiophile Kitesurfing Disc brake Apollo 8 Wood carving Gramophone record Electrophysiology Bicycle lighting Enron Corporation Global climate model Shit Station wagon Kill Bill Burma Campaign The Amber Spyglass Guns N' Roses Walkman Mountain bike Terminal ballistics Glossary of climbing terms Sailing Carpet Avalanche Wood Team Fortress Classic Diving suit Brewery Volleyball Mach kernel Apple II family Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Equine conformation Krag-J__rgensen Tire Eddie Guerrero Geography of Africa My Little Pony Animal Crossing Rapid transit Phonograph Sony Wind turbine Honda Prelude Internal ballistics Guilty Gear Knife DVD Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Professional wrestling holds Photography The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Oasis (band) Racquetball Entropy Forty-seven Ronin Parachute World War Three (Doctor Who) Homer Simpson Stairway Basement Battlebots Compact disc Marilyn Monroe Amstrad CPC Toronto Streetcar System Phonograph cylinder Unreal Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Roger Federer Thief (computer game) Submarine Christmas tree Lionel Corporation Acorn Archimedes Miyamoto Musashi The Clash
