how do you find a job in marketing not personal selling i'm a marketing student and i want to go into my field but there is a lot of prymid companies claiming to be marketing firms you are smart to recognize that it took me years to get our career placement center to post jobs for our students that would not be pyramid schemes right now i'm a marketing professor who works closely with our students on placement with a lot of success here are a couple of suggestions if you haven't yet graduated there are a couple of things you can should do one is to do at least one and possibly more internships many entry level jobs these days require from one to three years of related work experience and the only way to get this is through internships another possibility would be informational interviews if your school's career center will work with you on this they can set up an appointment for you with an alumnus working in the field you ask them a lot of questions about what what they do without expectation of anyone hiring you but you gain information which will help you on the job market and also make it clearer to you what you want to do the last question can be can you recommend someone else in the field that i should talk to i know of someone who did this and people were so impressed with her interest that she ended up getting job offers in a really bad job market now as you get ready to graduate or if you have graduated since you are not interested in personal selling the types of jobs you might want to look at would be those called marketing coordinator marketing assistant and marketing analyst marketing assistant is a little confusing because while some of these jobs have you do actual marketing some are actually secretarial jobs for the marketing department so you need to read the job ad carefully to make sure it is what you want some marketing coordinator and marketing analyst jobs are entry level while others can require as much as ten or more years of experience so again you need to read further but it is a good starting place if you are interested in advertising appropriate directions for a marketing student would be assistant account manager or assistant traffic manager pr firms also hire marketing students fairly regularly so where to look do check your college's career center they do this for a living and should have some possibilities for you also ask your professors if they have any connections sometimes alumni will contact us wanting to hire a new graduate network as much as you can join clubs and go to events recommended by your professors if you can possibly afford it also while some people will tell you that only personal contacts matter a lot of my students have gotten jobs through job ads since i don't know where you are located i can't tell you which sources are good in your area but i go through every couple of days and pull job and internship listings from sites like monstertrak com entertainmentcareers net showbizjobs com teamworkonline com indeed com careerbuilder com hotjobs com monster com along with the search engine on my linkedin network i've been finding tons of jobs in really good companies in this area lately i'm not sure what it would be like in other parts of the country make sure your resume is in good shape and know how to put together a meaningful cover letter so that you are ready and make sure you have your resume readily available in case an opportunity arises good luck Plame affair Professor Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Corporate governance Karl Rove Intern Software engineering Education in Germany Management Paralegal Web traffic Management information system Theory of conduct Killian documents Microeconomics Lawyer Walt Disney World College Program Internet fraud Wal-Mart Academia Social network Scientology beliefs and practices Annuity Kasparov versus The World Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Search engine optimization Outsourcing Social rule Unemployment Avenue Q Jeff Gannon Spyware Password Michael D.
