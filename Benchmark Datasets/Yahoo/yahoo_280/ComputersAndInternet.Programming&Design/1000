oracle server odbc connect question i'm not a db expert but need to connect to an oracle xe server currently running on the same machine later it will need to connect to a remote machine note i have to break up some of these strings here so they'll display properly in yahoo answers in sql developer the connection name is abc but i think that's just specific to sqldeveloper the sid is xe the user is abc and the connection details string that gets me in is abc localhost xe i also get at it from the tomcat side with a string like this jdbc oracle thin localhost xe how do i get this into a odbc format for opening i've tried things like odbc dsn xe hst localhost prt database xe uid abc pwd abc and variations with sdsn and whatever but nothing seems to work oh and this will be running out of vb so it uses the dao opendatabase call thanks in advance thanks for the first post but let me clarify i'm actually developing this on the same machine that has the db i will have to make it run on another machine later but for now i'm just trying to connect to my own machine thought the 'localhost' would be a clue so this machine runs oracle and runs tomcat and the app running under tomcat talks to oracle just fine i didn't configure it though as i said i'm not a db expert but it currently connects to the oracle db i now need to deploy a standalone app to modify some content pulled from the db so it needs to talk to the oracle server running locally i gave the server connection details that are usually used above i don't see immediately why new drivers have to be installed when this machine already talks to the oracle server running on port hope this helps on second edit you're saying sql developer and jdbc are configured but odbc is not if so please edit your answer and let me know that could be the case now i understand thank you very much william when the hours are up you will get best answer i didn't realize i had to set up a separate odbc configuration to make this work windows xp offter odbc drivers for oracle in data sources under administrative tools in the control panel go there and make sure they are installed the configure for the oracle database schema you are trying to connect to PHP MySQL Database SQL Database management system SQL injection Tcl PL/SQL MUMPS Relational model MDAC Microsoft Jet Database Engine WebObjects HTML element Cross site scripting Visual Basic C plus plus Uniform Resource Locator ALGOL 68 Federal Standard 1037C Cascading Style Sheets Java Database Connectivity Files-11 Compiler optimization SAS System Stopping e-mail abuse Simple Mail Transfer Protocol JavaScript Geographic information system Internet forum Software testing Slashdot subculture Object-SQL mapping The Internet Movie Database C programming language Relational algebra Blue screen of death Ruby on Rails Common Lisp Gmail Digest access authentication Buffer overflow Oracle database Join (SQL) Logo programming language Control flow Open Database Connectivity Unicode BASIC programming language GameFAQs Hash table Internet Group Management Protocol Artificial neural network On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Windows Vista Internet troll Computer virus E-mail spam Python programming language Normal distribution Bloom filter Enigma machine Whois Expert system Hello world program Brainfuck Web design Atari 8-bit family C Sharp Database normalization PostScript Pointer Rootkit Domain Name System Associative array Objective-C Embedded system Search engine optimization Scheme programming language Perl 6 C syntax PostgreSQL Spam (electronic) Anonymity Emacs Information Technology Infrastructure Library ZX Spectrum Google Talk Independent Media Center TikiWiki
