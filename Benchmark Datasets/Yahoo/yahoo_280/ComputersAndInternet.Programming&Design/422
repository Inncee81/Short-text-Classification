ms access question i am currently doing a project where i created a microsoft access form database to collect data for stormwater data i e manholes catch basins culverts pipes ditches etc however i have numerous inputs that do not need to show the whole time for example if you pick that the shape of a culvert is a circle you will be prompted for the diameter of the pipe so on and so forth it has been years since i have used ms access and need to be refreshed on how to program for access any sites of programming codes would be greatly appreciated as well as any expressions you have for the described statement above as i cannot seem to get it to work the way i want it to i can only get it to work if all of the inputs show at all times thank you in advance and i hope you can give me some great input it sounds like you want to create a custom form and then put the options you want behind them as unbound options this makes it easier and then once you have the options you want you can save the data to the tables what this does is allows you to customize your form to pull the data you want and then save it as you see fit a good place to learn stuff is just by going to microsoft's website and they have how to's on there site some are good and some not so good but if you search you can find some basic info anything beyond that you would have to take someone's example and then mold it to your needs JavaScript Hello world program Datatype Objective Modula-2 Python programming language Pointer Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Application Suite String (computer science) C programming language Copy protection Internet Explorer PHP PaX Perl Forth programming language Extreme Programming Morse Code Document Object Model Quicksort DOM Events Library (computer science) Buffer overflow Object lifetime Windows 2000 Exponentiation by squaring Compiler optimization Lisp programming language Greasemonkey Federal Standard 1037C Static single assignment form Dynamic programming MD5 C Sharp ALGOL 68 Edgard Var__se Immutable object Associative array Bol__var's War Control character Comparison of web browsers User agent One-time pad Digital rights management Backup Compiler C syntax Computer Prototype-based programming Euphoria programming language Halting problem Software testing E programming language Unicode 400 (number) Architecture of Windows 2000 MDAC Appeal Redundant array of independent disks Copyleft Estimation theory Cross site scripting Bash Password cracking Callback (computer science) Dynamic HTML Mutation Web crawler JSON Pretty Good Privacy Kernel (computer science) REXX Macromedia Flash Newline Garbage collection (computer science) NX bit Timeline of computing 1990-forward JScript .NET Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Value at risk Polymerase chain reaction DirectShow Self programming language X86 assembly language Comparison of generics to templates Air traffic control Halo 2 Copyright law of the United Kingdom XML Brainfuck Revision control Objective-C Cryptography Plan 9 (operating system) Mach kernel Short message service REBOL Ethernet
