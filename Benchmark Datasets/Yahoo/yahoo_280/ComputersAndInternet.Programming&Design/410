permutations combinations of list i need to write a permutation algorithm in abap language for a given set of letters i need to determine the unique permutations as follows example set includes a b c d unique permutaions include a b c d ab ac ad bc bd cd abc acd bcd abcd note ab ba thanks for the answer mcfate i'm not familiar w java so it s somewhat difficult to follow your example can you explain how the solution would look if the results were in ascending order don't have abap handy but here it is in java it's a trivial program and should be easy to translate as long as you can do x x and bitwise and or a test of the nth bit in an integer y n public class myclass public static void main string args string c abcd int numchars c length int permutations numchars chars for each permutation for int i i permutations i print it out from the binary number for int j j numchars j int jthbit j boolean jthbitisset i jthbit if jthbitisset system out print c charat j system out println output a b ab c ac bc abc d ad bd abd cd acd bcd abcd how it works there are n combinations of each character from the original string being either present or not present in any solution so one can represent each solution as a different binary number with one digit corresponding to each character of the original string i use the loop iterator i to count up to n all binary numbers that can be represented in a number of digits equal to the number of characters in the original string each value of i represents one member of the permutations set the interior loop j is used to print each character corresponding to a bit in i to print out the permutation that corresponds to the binary number in i Wiki DAEMON Tools Scalable Vector Graphics Uniform Resource Locator OpenBSD Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Firefox BitTorrent Domain Name System Warez ITunes Linux GIMP Python programming language Apache HTTP Server Mozilla Application Suite Website Secure Shell Internet Relay Chat Wireless Application Protocol Geographic information system Wikipedia SUSE Linux Free software C plus plus Spyware Digital art Daemon (computer software) Network Time Protocol Microsoft .NET Free audio software VBulletin Knoppix KDE Mac OS X v10.4 Demoscene Collaborative software Linspire Java programming language GNOME OpenOffice.org Apache Software Foundation Proxy server HTTP cookie HTML Unix Bulletin board system Screenshot MIRC Gnutella Linux distribution Ada programming language Tcl MSN Messenger PlayStation 3 Debian Berkeley Software Distribution Session Initiation Protocol HyperCard GNU/Linux naming controversy Configuration management Eclipse (computing) Macromedia Flash Mandriva Linux Sega Dreamcast Web server Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing LiveCD Commodore 64 Lotus Notes Portable Document Format Operating system Whois MP3 Game programming Adobe Photoshop REALbasic ISBN MySQL TikiWiki Mac OS X Wikisource Rootkit VMware Xbox 360 MediaWiki Gmail Open Directory Project Telnet Digital audio workstation International Organization for Standardization GIF Theora ASCII art ROM image Console emulator Open access PHP Windows API
