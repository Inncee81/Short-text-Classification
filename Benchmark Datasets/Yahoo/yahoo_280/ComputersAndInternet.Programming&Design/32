java dateformat getdateinstance does not handle eras bc ad if you use the localized formats created by dateformat getdateinstance they display bc dates as positive years without the bc ie indistinguishable from ad dates manually creating a simpledateformat for each locale and for each style just to add the era designator seems less than ideal does anyone have any suggestions or can anyone suggest sites where this problem has been discussed whether bc or bce or translated to something else per the locale should be handled by the localizing code the 'standard' localized formats supplied by dateformat getdateinstance apparently does not handle these without intervention for every possible combination of locale and style yielding bc dates displayed as if they were ad dates looks like no one was actually reading what you wrote they answer before they have read the whole question and so there answers are pointless sorry i don't know either Unix time Unicode OpenDocument Windows 2000 Embedded system C programming language Objective-C Computer numbering formats Floppy disk Java programming language Lisp programming language Laserdisc Gregorian calendar Gmail XML Whose Line Is It Anyway?
