simple c source file and function problem i'm trying to create a simple program that prints the word hello to the console however i want the program to use two different functions the first being the main and the second being a void function that prints the word to the console when i try to compile it tells me there is an error at second h on the line that tries to print to the console the line with cout i was wondering what i did wrong here is the code from main cpp include cstdlib include iostream include second h using namespace std void sayhello int main int argc char argv sayhello system pause return exit success the code from second h include cstdlib include iostream void sayhello cout hello endl thanks i'm using the latest version of bloodshed dev c i only get this problem when i try to print to the console through a function on a source file other than main cpp the first line is a typo in the program i ran it is include not just include just a guess try moving the using namespace std before the include second h which as someone else has pointed out shouldn't include the sayhello function definition just its declaration i'm thinking your compiler requires the namespace be already pulled in for cout which as your code is currently configured it isn't when sayhello is compiled good luck by the way any compiler that just says there's an error on line such and such without giving any details should be evicted from your machine Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Diacritic Apple II family Keyboard layout Buffer overflow Amiga Computer keyboard Esperanto orthography IBM PC compatible NeXT Mac OS X Windows 3.x QWERTY PostScript GNOME X Window System Lisp programming language MS-DOS APL programming language RISC Computer Emacs IBM PC keyboard Forth programming language Linux kernel Device driver Atari 8-bit family Plan 9 (operating system) Opera (web browser) Operating system Control Panel (Windows) Password Computer-aided design Logo programming language Polish language OS/2 Mouse (computing) Trusted computing History of Microsoft Windows Arabic alphabet Windows API Assembly language Modifier key Burroughs B5000 Platform (computing) Atari ST Virtual memory Amstrad CPC NEXTSTEP History of computing hardware (1960s-present) System/34 Computer terminal History of the graphical user interface Unicode History of operating systems Cross-platform Windows Presentation Foundation Quotation mark Stardock Windows 95 Windows XP Computer multitasking Web design MIPS architecture Delphi programming language Virtual machine Control-Alt-Delete INMOS Transputer Apostrophe (mark) Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Java programming language System 7 (Macintosh) Library (computer science) Commodore 128 AmigaOS Chinese input methods for computers AS/400 BIOS Wintel Assembler System/36 Portable Document Format Windows Server 2003 Control key PowerPC Computing minimalism Game controller IBM PC KIM-1 International Computers Ltd VME Thread (computer science) Pinyin WordPerfect Blue screen of death
