how do you make your own file extension i need to now how to make my own file type and my own extension to create a application that can read it to do something programmable file extensions hold no power over what is actually held in the file if you take an exe file and change it's name to txt you still can't read it if you change it back to exe it still runs as long as you didn't change it while it was a txt file extensions don't dictate what's in the file they just offer an easy way to have an idea what kind of information that data holds i've created my own extensions plenty of times if you're wanting to make some sort of document or data file where you double click the output file the file with your own extension and it opens in your reader application then that will take a bit more then just naming the file whatever you want you can associate an extension to a program manually right clicking the file and following a few steps programmatically which you'll have to look up it's different for every language or on installation depends on what you use to build the installation i know i didn't help much but that's because of the lack of specifics what i am telling you is that it's possible email me with specifics and i can probably help you out more Web design Cascading Style Sheets Opera (web browser) Internet Explorer Ajax (programming) JavaScript Cross site scripting PHP HTML GameFAQs Mozilla Application Suite Mozilla Firefox Web browser XML World Wide Web ASP.NET HTML editor MDAC International Phonetic Alphabet Web page Wget Perl JavaServer Pages Macromedia Flash Microsoft Web application Search engine optimization Atari 8-bit family Forth programming language TikiWiki Internet Explorer for Mac Files-11 Dynamic HTML Windows Vista AmigaOS Virtual memory System/34 Hello world program NTFS Windows 2000 Gecko (layout engine) HyperText Transfer Protocol Obfuscated code Linux SHA hash functions Associative array ALGOL 68 Apple Macintosh Uniform Resource Locator Microsoft Jet Database Engine EIA-708 PostScript Lotus Notes PNG HyperCard System/36 Self programming language MSN Messenger Btrieve HTTP cookie Web crawler Library (computer science) Python programming language X86 TeX Windows API Screenshot Konfabulator Java programming language Extreme Programming Windows Presentation Foundation Comment XMLHTTP Fortran Tcl Windows XP Blue screen of death Wiki Apple II family X86 assembly language Domain Name System Geodesy Warez Bracket Aspect-oriented programming ICab Unicode Netscape Communications Corporation User agent Piccolo Junior Saga Minesweeper (computer game) Apollo Guidance Computer Beatmania IIDX MySQL Stairway Brainfuck Gmail
