transparency my friends and i started to play an online game where you have the ability to design your own heads and bodies using them online anyways i just got corel paint shop pro photo xi so i'm very new with the program and can figure out how to set the area around my image to be transparent i thought i had figured it out one time but i just ended up making the whole layer a background and the image during game play was invisible can anyone help one color and only one color can be read as transparent by the computer so keep that in mind when designing your graphic in other words use a background color that doesn't appear in your image bright pink or something very different then when you are done creating your image reduce the number of colors down to image decrease color depth colors then using the eye dropper tool right click over the color you want to be transparent so it's selected as the background color next go to image palette set palette transparency and select the middle radio button that reads set the transparency value to the current background color check your work by going to palette view palette transparency this way you can clean up any little spots that may have been missed save as a gif and you're done good luck joyce http www designbyjoyce com Xanga Microsoft FrontPage Wiki Object-oriented programming Macromedia Flash JavaServer Pages HTML HTML element Blog C plus plus Zope JADE programming language Web page OpenOffice.org PHP OpenDocument Hello world program ColdFusion Internet Explorer Unicode XSL Transformations WebObjects Cascading Style Sheets Macromedia Dreamweaver Mental illness Character encodings in HTML C Sharp JPEG Game Maker Linked list Navajo language HTML editor Logo programming language Comparison of generics to templates C programming language Dynamic HTML Emacs Skies of Arcadia Unicode and HTML Web traffic Web template Mozilla Application Suite Syntax highlighting Project Gutenberg XHTML TikiWiki Ebook Tab TeX HTML scripting Polymorphism (computer science) Quotation mark Blue screen of death Use case ASP.NET Web colors Plain Old Documentation Web design Diary Digest access authentication SharpDevelop Generic programming Objective-C Ajax (programming) Serendipity (weblog software) Polymerase chain reaction Telomerase Numeric character reference UTF-8 Cohen v.
