how do i compile a program in java in a terminal linux i am working on a university machine through ssh i know they have a java compiler installed what is the the equilvance in java to g foo cpp o foo thanks also how would i compile a multi file program how would i create object files what are the basic arguments the compiler takes thanks compilation is done with the java compiler javac to compile a single file javac foo java this will create foo class and maybe additional class files if you use some advanced java features specifically inner classes java class files are more or less the equivalent of object files though they're java bytecode rather than the machine's native code to compile multiple files just list them on the command line as well javac foo java bar java or javac java there's no true java equivalent to o foo as java doesn't make executable programs from the os point of view you can package your classes up into an application archive that the java virtual machine will execute though once you have all your class files created you package them in a jar java archive with the jar command which takes the same arguments more or less as the unix tar command jar cvf myapp jar class note that the class package naming and directory structure must match if you place your classes in the package foo bar you'll want to create the jar so that it archives a directory foo which contains a directory bar which contains your classes if you need to see the common command line options for the java compiler see the documentation for the appropriate version execute java version to see which it is then go to java sun com or execute javac help for a brief overview Java programming language Perl Lisp programming language Microsoft .NET Common Lisp Python programming language Library (computer science) Java platform Java virtual machine Smalltalk Comparison of generics to templates C plus plus AmigaOS Compiler Scheme programming language Macromedia Flash Objective-C Sun Microsystems Name mangling Forth programming language Linux Categorical list of programming languages Xcode AS/400 Ocaml Debian Tcl Emacs PHP OpenOffice.org Datatype JavaServer Pages Virtual machine GNOME Make Cross-platform C programming language HTML element Byte-code Polymorphism (computer science) Aspect-oriented programming Reflection (computer science) PaX Visual Basic MUMPS Spring operating system Objective Modula-2 Programming language Dylan programming language Variable NTFS Class (computer science) Bash Enterprise JavaBeans DIGITAL Command Language Plan 9 (operating system) File system XML Lotus Notes Common Unix Printing System Computer virus ZIP (file format) Namespace (computer science) OpenGL Associative array CPAN MVS Object-oriented programming C syntax JavaScript Windows XP JADE programming language Packages in Java Master Control Program Apache Ant Oracle database Thread (computer science) OpenStep Scripting language Compiler optimization Object lifetime Internet Relay Chat Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Obfuscated code C Sharp Hello world program Indent style ALGOL 68 Perl 6 Mozilla Firefox RPM Package Manager Exception handling Tar (file format)
