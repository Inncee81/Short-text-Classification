object decl in java why do v decl an object in java as class name obj new class name unlike class name obj in c it's sort of an artifact of java hiding pointers and doing memory management for you in c you can write class name obj or class name pobj new class name in a method as a temporary variable the first one declares a temporary variable that's an instance of the class temp variables are stored on the stack so the instance of the class itself is on the stack the other one declares a temp variable that is a pointer to an allocated instance from the heap in the latter case the only thing on the stack is the pointer to the object in the former case the instance is thrown away when the method returns because the method's temporary stack space is given up in the latter case the pointer is given up but the instance it points to must be explicitly deleted by the coder java on the other hand deals with all non primitive types by reference but hides the pointers a declaration of a temporary variable class name foo effectively creates a pointer on the stack but leaves it pointing at nothing there's not a separate syntax for declaring a pointer because pointers are hidden from the coder if java were to create an instance automatically for this syntax it would lead to a lot of waste since one doesn't always want to create the instance locally the c syntax for object instantiation on the heap new class name is pretty much identical to java's in java all objects are on the heap and are cleaned up by the java vm's garbage collection transparently to the coder when they are no longer referenced so the coder does not need to make the distinction between temporary and permanent objects this makes java easier to code in and less prone to issues like memory leaks and entirely free of segmentation faults and the like but there is a cost for letting the system do memory management for you so java is much less efficient when executing JavaScript HTML element Cascading Style Sheets HTML HTML editor Macromedia Flash Ajax (programming) Opera (web browser) Mozilla Application Suite Cross site scripting Mozilla Firefox Dynamic HTML XML Hello world program Comparison of layout engines (HTML) Web page Wiki Unicode Visual Basic ActionScript Object-oriented programming XForms Categorical list of programming languages XSL Transformations Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse DOM Events JADE programming language Diablo II: Lord of Destruction World Wide Web OpenGL Michael Morrison Windows XP Web application HTML scripting Windows 2000 Konfabulator Markup language Ebook Oscilloscope Comparison of web browsers HTTP cookie Scripting language Lotus Notes PHP Internet Explorer DVD TikiWiki International Phonetic Alphabet Client-side scripting XMLHTTP Calculator Portable Document Format Document Type Definition Document Object Model Cocoa (API) Website Inkscape CSS Virginia MDAC Unicode and HTML Regular expression XUL Gecko (layout engine) Common Unix Printing System Application programming interface Java programming language Associative array Linked list Typeface Ruby on Rails Filename extension Windows Presentation Foundation Emacs Browser wars Forth programming language Web colors Rich Internet Application Link spam AmigaOS Mac OS X v10.4 Scalable Vector Graphics Screenshot 2D computer graphics OpenDocument Comment GIMP HyperTalk XHTML Eclipse (computing) Server-side scripting ASCII art VME
