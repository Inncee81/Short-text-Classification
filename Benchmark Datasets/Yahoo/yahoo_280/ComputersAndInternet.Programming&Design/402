how the hell do i work windows movie maker i want t be able to download episodes off of websites and use them on movie maker but for some reason they have zipped in and i don't know what that means then when i save it it always says that i can't use it because of the format but i don't know what other things i can use tell me how to get the episodes on to movie maker without it telling me to have it in another format also what the hell does ' zipped' mean help zipped means the file has been placed into an archive which compresses the code so it is smaller and easier to transport across networks the extension you are referencing is zip or rar most likely windows xp has a native function which allows you to unzip the zip archive by simply double clicking on the zipped file it should open up a wizard on your desktop that will walk you through the process of unzipping the file if your version of windows doesn't have an unzip utility there are dozens of them out there freeware and shareware just search the web for file unzip software or unzip freeware pkunzip pkzip and winrar are three programs that i find to be useful and simple to use NX bit Free Pascal Cygwin CPU design PaX X86 AMD64 C programming language Mac OS X Allegro library X86 assembly language OpenStep 64-bit Google CPU cache Symmetric multiprocessing Microprocessor NVIDIA Intel iAPX 432 Pentium 4 Mac OS 9 Mac OS X v10.4 Windows Vista Apple Intel transition Floating point Search engine IA-64 DOS extender Malloc Google Desktop Sequent Computer Systems Intel i960 Mozilla Firefox IBM PC compatible Intel i860 Linux kernel Motorola 68000 Pentium D Windows NT Buffer overflow Memory-mapped I/O IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward RISC Ethernet Socket 939 MS-DOS DVD History of Microsoft Windows Berkeley Software Distribution OpenBSD Novell NetWare Word (computer science) Windows 2000 Central processing unit OpenDocument DragonFly BSD Rambus Cisco PIX Cache Character encoding L4 microkernel family Multics Googlewhack Plan 9 (operating system) DESQview Graphical Environment Manager 68k Radiation hardening PL/I Hyper-threading OS/2 MUMPS Tarantella, Inc.
