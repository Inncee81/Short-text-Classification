java jdk versions my application must be compatible but we want to move forward onto one interface in particular resultset changed quite a bit between the versions we have a class that implements resultset the interface now has quite a few new methods to implement however if we implement these methods it is no longer compatible because some of the new methods signatures refer to classes that are new to i would love some suggestions on how to keep my application compatible with but still able to move forward and also compatible with just implement to the spec for resultset and the other interfaces in java sql and compile your driver implementation using then bundle the compiled class files into a jar as long as you don't try to recompile the driver code you should still be able build applications to run under just use the compiled class files binaries in your jar file i e add the jar to your classpath as long as your application doesn't try to call the new methods everything should be fine be sure to document the level version of your implementation Search engine Web design Website Web crawler The Internet Movie Database World Wide Web Microsoft Deep web Internet Explorer Uniform Resource Locator Domain Name System Gnutella Amazon.com PHP Internet Adult Film Database Search engine optimization Scholarship Bioinformatics MDAC Video game developer MIT Media Lab Legal research Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Application Suite Cross site scripting Sequence alignment Ajax (programming) Database management system TikiWiki BitTorrent Spamdexing Astrophysics Data System Computer science Molecular dynamics Algorithm Google search Web application Opera (web browser) HyperCard Computer virus GNU General Public License Btrieve Library (computer science) Enterprise content management Open access Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Web traffic Java programming language Internet Speculative Fiction Database Software testing Social network Hash table The Mole Microsoft Access Online marketing Extrasolar planet File system Object-oriented programming IBM Perl Web page Plagiarism Game development Computer and video games Software patent debate Mac OS X Programming tool Web hosting Genetic algorithm Whois Book Kazaa E-mail spam Yahoo!
