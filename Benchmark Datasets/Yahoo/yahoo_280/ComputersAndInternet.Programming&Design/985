i would like to know with what computer language yahoo pages have been developed in fact i want to know what is the most professional computer language for developing big sites like yahoo or google actually as far as i believe microsoft technologies cannot cater for big sites due to low security and lower scalability in comparison with unix linux technologies i think asp would not be a suitable choice for implementing big sites moreover regarding php this language is not good for multi tier programming almost business and view layers are in the same files therefore the last option i know is jsp can someone please shed a light on jsp and let me know how good is it in multi tier programming if you know of better non microsoft technologies for this purpose please feel free to leave a comment here php and asp are the two major professional languages for developing websites which one you pick depends on a number of factors but the most important factor is to use the one the programming team is most comfortable with if you are wanting to know which one to learn php is based on c and perl so if you're familiar with c or perl and are comfortable with them php will seem very natural also if you prefer working on unix or linux systems then you will feel right at home with php on an apache web server however if you like object oriented programming better java vb net c then you may prefer asp net more asp net uses the net languages vb c jscript so if you already know one of those languages and are comfortable there asp may be more natural to you the major drawback of asp is that it costs money php is open source but if you have windows xp professional or the business version of vista you can at least learn it without paying for anything else jsp is also an alternative if you really like java Mozilla Firefox Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie Website Mozilla Application Suite Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Domain Name System Web browser Spyware Internet Explorer User agent Macromedia Flash Web page HyperText Transfer Protocol Wiki Comparison of web browsers Search engine optimization World Wide Web International Phonetic Alphabet Phishing Cascading Style Sheets PHP Google Browser wars Mouse (computing) Mozilla Thunderbird Web traffic The Book of Mozilla Windows XP Portable Document Format USB flash drive Netscape HyperCard Wget Greasemonkey Web design Google search Search engine Safari (web browser) Unicode and HTML Denial-of-service attack Web crawler Spread Firefox Morse Code Netscape Browser Thumbnail gallery post Gopher protocol Konqueror Apache HTTP Server Web application Google bomb Scalable Vector Graphics SAML Slashdot trolling phenomena Computer Digital rights management Pretty Good Privacy Kazaa Avant Browser Pop-up ad Internet censorship in mainland China History of the Internet XMLHTTP Photography NPAPI Internationalized domain name Internet Explorer for Mac Social bookmarking Netscape Navigator Hyperlink Copy protection ReactOS Aggregator GameFAQs OmniWeb XForms CPAN Electronic commerce Google Desktop A9.com BitTorrent Internet Relay Chat XML Whois Click fraud Favicon Internet Typosquatting Web banner Ebook Mosaic (web browser) Legal research Spamdexing Internet Explorer shell Common Unix Printing System
