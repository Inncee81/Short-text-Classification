is their a way to limit kill upload speed to certain peers when using utorrent i've looked through all of the tabs and right clicked on the peers ip address but it says nothing about killing the upload to that certain peer i'm talking about the peers that don't upload anything and just download from others i believe the term for this is a leecher anyway is there a way when using utorrent to kill the upload to these certain peers i hate to be a leecher myself so i don't want to turn my upload completely off but i hate to upload to leechers i haven't been able to find a way to kill the upload to only one peer from the list here is a picture of an example http i photobucket com albums m ferrari torrent jpg and notice ip addresses and others that i am uploading to and they aren't uploading to me in exchange these are small upload sizes kb s kb s but sometimes they will get to kb s anyway is their a way to kill these uploads with utorrent and if not with a diff bt client thanks for the help matt ok your missing how it works first off you will download a piece from a user you will upload a piece wich you already have to another user so your all switching between each other of pieces that you currently have downloaded just because they are downloading from you doesn't mean they are leeching from you you all are in a pool passing the ball around if you look they have uploaded parts maybe not to you because maybe you already have the pieces they have look to the far right t what they have uploaded just because i am downloading from you doesn't mean you download from me exspecially if you have all the pieces i have and don't need The Kids Are Alright Last Night a DJ Saved My Life (2001 song) OK Computer Spiderbait Jo Dee Messina Music video ITunes Bob Dylan The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) IPod Smooth Criminal Gary Glitter It's Alright (I See Rainbows) Moonwalker Macromedia Flash Floppy disk Yoko Ono Janet Jackson That '70s Show Something for Kate A Hard Day's Night (song) Chicago (band) BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Jesus of Suburbia My Generation Electric Six The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Rio (album) Rhythm Nation 1814 Sweetbox Overclocking The Who discography Cray-1 Powderfinger Push It (Garbage's song) Live At Leeds Mandy Moore Iron Maiden Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Living End WCBS-FM Reed (music) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Bringing It All Back Home Traditional animation Action Replay Cheap Trick Website The Offspring Journey (band) Pete Townshend Tru Calling Forth programming language I Don't Wanna Cry Donkey Kong Nas (rapper) The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall Computer virus Amy Grant Yellow Submarine (film) Virtual band Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) International League Stevie Wonder A Clockwork Orange (film) TM Network Live 8 concert, London The Star-Spangled Banner Rhapsody (online music service) Fiona Apple Black Sabbath Half-Life Loudon Wainwright III Portmanteau Rufus Wainwright Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Sigur R__s Steve Earle The Isley Brothers DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution University of Tennessee Streaming media Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Motion City Soundtrack Cache Louis Armstrong Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Super Mario Bros. 3 Jars of Clay Covenant (band) William Howard Taft Before the Flood American Country Countdown Alien vs. Predator (film) Krag-J__rgensen Freaks and Geeks Washington Capitals Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme) MP3 Rock Around the Clock
