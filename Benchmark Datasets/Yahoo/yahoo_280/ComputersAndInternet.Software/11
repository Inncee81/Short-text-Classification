can i transfer my user account i just recently bought an hp laptop for school and need to transfer my programs such as itunes adobe photoshop ect and other files to my new computer the computer that already has my files on it is a dell and not very old its a family computer and each person has a separate user account on the computer the dell has windows xp and the hp has windows vista home premium is there a way to transfer the entire user account i also heard that you can connect the two via the lan cable and run a transfer wizard would i be able to transfer my programs and files this way any help would be great i dont think you can transfer programs i believe you would need a setup file that you could transfer onto your other computer which you would then use to install yes you can buy a crossover cable to transfer your files to your other computer a crossover cable should cost about at radio shack it should come with a cable and software so you can transfer your files you can also transfer your files via a flash drive pen drive jump drive which may not be the best if you have a lot of file that may take up a lot of room or a larger external hard drive which normally can hold a lot of data you could also use an ipod or an mp player just rememebr the more it can hold the less unpluging and repluging in you have to do you can also upload your files online if you find a good site and download them onto your other computer watch your bandwidth amount usage if you do this i dont think you can copy an account or programs but you can certainly copy files and setup files IPod Windows XP ITunes USB flash drive Digital audio player Xbox Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Linux Macromedia Flash Computer virus BitTorrent Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Digital rights management MP3 Windows 2000 ITunes Music Store Microsoft Office Hard disk Warez Podcasting Apple II family Online music store File system File sharing Modem Computer Computer and video games Apple Computer Cable television MSN Messenger Universal Serial Bus Internet Skype Portable Document Format Laptop Web hosting Musical Instrument Digital Interface PNG GIF Redundant array of independent disks Uploading and downloading Peer-to-peer File Transfer Protocol Bulletin board system IBM PC compatible Copy protection Creative Zen System/36 Btrieve Personal computer NTFS Adobe Photoshop IPod photo Vorbis Windows Server 2003 TRS-80 Macintosh Finder History of Microsoft Windows Walkman Windows registry Digital photography Common Unix Printing System IPod shuffle Computer forensics Password Streaming media America Online Stardock E-mail Backup Kazaa Virtual Network Computing Object Desktop Spyware EMule Game programmer FireWire Ethernet DVD PlayStation Portable Copyright infringement of software MAME Cheating in Counter-Strike Creative Nomad Disk cloning Mouse (computing) NeXT FairPlay Virtual memory
