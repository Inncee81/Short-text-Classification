excel formulas okay here's the situation i have a spreadsheet that i am creating and i've hit a wall it has basically four pages the first three are 'year one' 'year two' 'year three' the last is 'totals' what the user is doing is selecting courses for weblearning that they've completed on the first three pages the user has a cell a with a drop down box referencing all of their class choices the user can then go back the next time they complete a webcourse and in cell a add the next one they've completed and so on how do i get the classes to show up on the totals page once they've been selected what i need is the 'total' page to show a list of all courses chosen over all three years maybe not the most elegant but i think the easiest way to do this assuming there is a maximum number of courses in a year say is to bring in all of the cells that may have course selections and then filter out the blanks bring over all the course selections if 'year one' a 'year one' a if 'year one' a 'year one' a etc if 'year one' a 'year one' a if 'year two' a 'year two' a if 'year two' a 'year two' a etc if 'year two' a 'year two' a if 'year three' a 'year three' a if 'year three' a 'year three' a etc if 'year three' a 'year three' a in the same way you can also bring over any other course information course type hours etc from the other columns hide the blank ones put a filter on that column data filter autofilter select nonblanks i hope this helps good luck PlayStation 2 Windows XP DVD Xbox Modchip USB flash drive PlayStation Portable Atari 8-bit family Sega Dreamcast Commodore 64 Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Xbox 360 Nintendo GameCube Nintendo 64 Sound Blaster IPod Floppy disk Knoppix Timeline of computing 1990-forward Warez GNU General Public License Atari ST Regional lockout Nintendo Revolution Apple Computer DVD-RAM PlayStation 3 Computer software Copy protection TiVo Sega Saturn ZX Spectrum Craps ITunes Digital rights management A600 Computer and video games Linux Nero Digital IMac Library (computer science) Microeconomics Microsoft Office MMORPG Digital video recorder AmigaOS DR-DOS Screenshot PC Engine Digital photography Sharp Zaurus CPU design NeXT First-sale doctrine Apple II family Amstrad CPC Camcorder ATI Technologies Sega 32X Embedded system Hydrogen economy Laserdisc MP3 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mac mini Price discrimination Sony Comparison of media players Virtual memory Machinima Mutual fund System/36 Windows Vista Video game publisher High-definition television Data General Wintel SAM Coup__ CD-ROM CD recorder Booting Mozilla Firefox Sega Blu-ray Disc Compact disc Macintosh Plus Console wars DVD player Microsoft History of operating systems Commodore REU Disk image Nintendo Entertainment System Hash table Microprogram DualDisc Karaoke Apple IIGS
