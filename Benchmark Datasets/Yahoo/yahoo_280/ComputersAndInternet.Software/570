how do i use my full connection speed when downloading from bitcomet or utorrent i ran a speed test online and it says that my download at a speed of kb s and upload at a rate of kb s but when downloading from bitcomet all i get is about kb s the same with utorrent i've tried everything from raising my tcp ip limit to raising the my maximum download and upload rate can someone tell me what i could do with these settings because i really don't know o you can pretty much throw those tests out the window for torrents torrent speeds depend on a lot of things you have to make sure the port is open and forwarding the port will make it go faster if there aren't a lot of seeders it will go slower CPU cache Disk image PNG Register file IPod Register renaming ISO image CPU design International Organization for Standardization C programming language File system Windows 2000 Windows XP Digital photography Files-11 Product Lifecycle Management MP3 Master Control Program Plan 9 (operating system) Unicode Domain Name System ISO/IEC 8859 Virtual memory Central processing unit Mach kernel Trusted computing Newline DVD Floppy disk MUMPS Redundant array of independent disks NTFS Linux Backup RISC Apple II family S__CAM XML BASIC programming language Spring operating system Book of Revelation Portable Document Format Serialization OpenDocument Markup language Printed circuit board Cue sheet Paper Digital circuit Computer Translation memory Library (computer science) ISO/IEC 2022 Computer forensics H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ITunes Screenshot Logo programming language Mac OS X v10.4 PHP Revision control File Allocation Table Advanced Audio Coding Ice cream The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Java programming language Year 2000 problem File format Jon Lech Johansen Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mouse (computing) Cache Modchip Base Station Subsystem ISO 8601 Warez XForms Photographic film AppleScript Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act WordStar Audio data compression Computer virus Self-replication E-mail Prefix code Gramophone record Microprogram ISO 9660 RFID Pipeline (Unix) Thread (computer science) JPEG 2000 Server Whitney Houston Sed String (computer science) Forth programming language ASCII
