help using rambooster v my friend recommended me with this program and i find it sort of hard to use even though the interface is so simple i want to know what is a good value to set the target level of free ram on top im using a dell with of ram thanks theoretically this program is completely unnecessary memory leak happens when a program stores something in ram doesn't use what it stored and doesn't free up the space either memory leaks typically only occur while the program is running when you close the program the operating system windows automatically claims back all of the ram that was used by that closed program a purported feature of ram booster if that were not the case that windows wasn't taking care of memory leaks you would have to reboot windows every time you opened more than applications because ram would be claimed by programs and windows wouldn't reclaim the ram when programs exited some ram boosters use virtual memory i e using part of the hard disk as ram but again windows takes care of virtual memory as long as you have plenty of hard drive space you can run a program that will completely max out your physical ram and windows will take care of optimizing virtual memory usage Microsoft Excel Windows 2000 Lotus 1-2-3 Medical prescription Quattro Pro OpenDocument 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Lotus Improv Quicksort NTSC 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Standard deviation On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Garbage collection (computer science) Fast Fourier transform G__del's incompleteness theorem Prime number Volleyball PHP House of Leaves Subroutine Redundant array of independent disks Starfleet ranks and insignia Formula One XML Crossword Apollo Guidance Computer Billboard Hot 100 Geographic information system JavaScript Bowl Championship Series Ozone depletion Turing machine IP (complexity) Debugging United States House of Representatives John Lott Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Musical Instrument Digital Interface MDAC Artificial neural network Royal Assent Oscilloscope Batting average Extreme Programming Halting problem Biblical inerrancy Computer numbering formats Test plan Have I Got News For You Flat file database Collision detection Baseball Guitar C programming language Mach kernel Pointer Macintosh Finder Fernando Alonso Second language acquisition 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Quantification Rugby union positions Ozone hole Molecular evolution 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Plame affair Wheel of Fortune Ontological argument Gross domestic product Michael Schumacher Control character Heinkel He 100 Indianapolis 500 Crystal Palace F.C.
