what program will streamline the process of scanning several pages into a single file and is preferably free i run windows xp and use microsoft office vista before the upgrade to office vista ms's document imager would allow me to scan files into one tif document now with the upgrade none of my ms programs will let me scan directly into a document not even into an outlook email they've caused me to have to open up a photo imaging program to scan with and it's added a good extra minutes to tasks at least it feels that way is there an open source program that can help me does open office allow scanning directly into one of their documents and any ideas as to why ms got rid of this functionality to its office programs to make you buy another program or to appease some drm idiocy any advice will be well appreciated from this frustrated office worker that's great to hear about open office and yes the image would be inserted at the cursor as for the ms document scanner it used to allow you to put the scanned documents in any order you wished although it saved it as a huge tif file i always produced a smaller pdf file using the open source pdf creator just go to the print menu in any program and produce the pdf great freebie for any pc i'll leave this question up for awhile to see if there's any more answers thanks all i'm not sure if i'm on the right track it would be very difficult to scan several pages into a single document because the document would need to know how to place them if you had such a program in the past i'm actually surprised i don't use open office but it's on my computer a quick check revealed that in the insert menu there is provision to scan pictures directly into the page you just set up your twain device scanner then scan the pic once the first picture is inserted and that would be at the cursor position i guess you can then scan the second third etc this is the best you're going to get open office can also convert your file to a pdf for emailing you must be very careful about using tiff's they are huge files by any standard photos will be up to ten times larger than a jpg maybe more i've got some tutorials on my site that may be of some help one is sending attachments by email the other is cropping photos to save space my next tutorial due in a few days is making photos smaller kb for emails and web pages i'd love to have you as a visitor because the tutorials are really worth their weight in gold all the programs i use are free and i tell you where to get them and how to install them it's just a temporary site at present but there's plenty of stuff there despite it being only a couple of weeks old http www yacht valhalla com answers hope to see you there my email address is at the bottom of every page and you're welcome to contact me Modem BitTorrent Sound card Windows 2000 MDAC DeviantART Mozilla Firefox Copyleft Dave Matthews Band Open access Mac OS X MySQL Bluetooth Steam (content delivery) Weezer Digital audio player Radeon Wine (software) Copyright Online music store Windows XP Human resources IPod Opera (web browser) Sound Blaster Railway signal Evanescence Creative Zen Trillian (instant messenger) EMule SAT Blue screen of death Creation (theology) Swing (genre) SmartRider A Course In Miracles Video game music Odyssey of the Mind Wikipedia The Star Wars Holiday Special C programming language Ada programming language Prostate cancer Creativity Jeremiah Duggan Film Perl Halo 2 Overhead lines Object Desktop Computer virus SoundStorm Debugging Windows Update Almost complex manifold Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Archimedes Metcard Bradley Nowell Driver's license Anthroposophy Something Awful Forums Asset Microsoft .NET Adobe Acrobat PHP Creation science Sample chess game Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold History of Microsoft Windows 64-bit Internet Explorer Entrepreneurship Outsourcing 2005 United States Grand Prix Creative Nomad Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dream Theater Jewish Task Force Attack of the Show!
