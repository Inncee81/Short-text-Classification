spreadsheet question i am making a spreadsheet through microsoft works and have about columns and rows but when i print only the st print and show in print preview what do i do to print everything i tried to highlight it all and print selection but that did not work now it is printing the first rows on page and the rest on page it is small enough to be one one page you need to set the paper to print landscape rather than portrait there might also be an option to minimize the page to print all the columns onto a single page in excel this is possible i am not sure in works but it might be if that doesn't work you might want to consider looking at getting the open office suite since it's open source software you can download this for free that should certainly enable you to work just like you would in excel good luck Windows XP Copy protection Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows Macromedia Flash Microsoft Spyware History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Apple Macintosh IPod AmigaOS Trusted computing Microsoft Office Floppy disk Atari 8-bit family OpenDocument ZX Spectrum Perl Object Desktop Mozilla Firefox Palm OS Windows 3.x Computer virus Expert system Booting Mach kernel WordPerfect Macintosh Finder Common Unix Printing System Windows Server 2003 History of the graphical user interface Blue screen of death IBM PC compatible OpenOffice.org Pretty Good Privacy Gmail DVD Amstrad CPC Digital rights management System 7 (Macintosh) Mozilla Application Suite Fritz-chip CPU cache Xerox Star Commodore 128 Virtual memory MDAC Redundant array of independent disks ALGOL 68 Software testing Jumpstart 3rd Grade Computer Knoppix Portable Document Format NX bit Unicode Copyright infringement of software CPU design PDP-11 MediaMax CD-3 Comparison of web browsers Acorn Electron ITunes Wine (software) DragonFly BSD Kazaa OpenGL Master Control Program Software cracking Password USB flash drive CP/M PlayStation 2 Morse Code Apple Open Collaboration Environment Debugging Google Desktop Spy Hunter X Window System MP3 Computer software Pirate decryption Btrieve Anti-virus software Modem WordStar Internet Explorer Hard disk Ebook
