damn small linux my old computer is running xp but barely has enough ram to run xp so i'm thinking about installing damn small linux on it i'm wondering how great of an os is damn small linux and can it run all the same applications as other linux operating systems such as wine damn small linux is okay for basic tasks like surfing the internet typing documents or playing simple games it comes with firefox but a much older version if i recall i don't believe i can check that it comes with wine or even has it available as a download through mydsl you could download the source code and possibly compile it yourself but if you are not comfortable with the command line then this might not be a good idea damn small linux was designed for really old computers even to run on a if your computer is higher than mb of ram then using damn small linux might be overkill you may be interested in puppylinux http www puppylinux com it has far more recent versions of popular programs it uses seamonkey instead of firefox but there is little difference between them i do not think puppy comes with wine but i'm almost sure that someone has developed a pup package for it puppylinux requires mb of ram it is a little awkward to install to a hard drive so you will have to look up the instructions and follow them very carefully Windows Server 2003 Windows XP Computer virus Windows 2000 Virtual memory Puppy Linux Windows NT Dynamic random access memory Dodge Charger Pocket PC Windows 95 IBM PC compatible X Window System Acorn Electron IPAQ Windows 1.0 Microsoft Windows Windows 98 History of Microsoft Windows Random access memory Linux DOS Pentium 4 Server Apple II family Personal computer Windows 3.x Emacs Ramesses II Transmission Control Protocol Text editor System 7 (Macintosh) Embedded system Windows Mobile Sequent Computer Systems Jet engine AmigaOS Windows Vista Cygwin International Phonetic Alphabet NeXT Tintin and Alph-Art MOS Technology 6502 Skype Mac OS X Timeline of computing 1990-forward 64-bit Page table Automobile RISC Emulator Windows Me Terminate and Stay Resident Sinclair ZX81 Sega Saturn Windows XP Professional x64 Edition MP3 WordPerfect OS/2 Dell Axim Commodore 64 CPU design Visual Basic .NET Windows XP Media Center Edition Redundant array of independent disks Windows CE SETI@home Windows 2.0 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Minimo X86 WordStar Windows Installer Wintel New Morning A600 PaX Upper Memory Area DVD-RAM Adobe Acrobat IBM PC St. Louis Rams Xbox Apple Macintosh CPU cache Computer software Microsoft Office System 6 Library (computer science) The Sims 2 2004 World Series RAM disk Kernel (computer science) Spring operating system Taikyoku shogi Xbox 360 RAM Racing Color Graphics Adapter Device driver
