how do you make sure you have deleted everything when you install downloaded programs i have a screensaver from the internet and when i did a system recovery it stopped working so i tried to reinstall and it wont let me so i tried uninstalling it and its not in my add program list i did a search for all it and found them what i want to know is it okay to delete them all so i can reinstall fresh first set a restore point name it something like screensaver problem so that you'll know what caused you to have to go through the following steps and that if all goes well you won't need to use that particular one again after you've manually found and deleted all files associated with that program look in my computer disk c programs then use the same route to get to the windows folder in there do the same while there go into the system folder in the system folder you must be very careful of what you delete because you could cause a crash by deleting the wrong thing but go in there and see if you find any files that go only to that program and delete them then use a registry cleaner to find the rest of the files to get rid of i use tweaknow regcleaner it's easy to use but does a good job get it here if you need it http www tweaknow com regcleaner html a follow up with ccleaner will finish the job if you need this get it here http www ccleaner com after you have your computer cleaned up including updating and running your av and other anti malware progs defrag then scandisk and then set a restore point again name it for what you've done like screen saver fixed computer clean this way you'll know that you can use this point in the future i hope this helps good luck Windows XP Anti-virus software Computer virus Rootkit Kazaa Internet security Internet Explorer Microsoft Windows Computer security Trojan horse (computing) AOL Instant Messenger Stopping e-mail abuse Adware Mydoom Microsoft AntiSpyware Spybot - Search & Destroy Uninstaller Skype Windows registry LimeWire Dialer Peer-to-peer Domain Name System Instant messaging NX bit MSN OS/2 Spam (electronic) Windows 2000 Opera (web browser) Host file Windows Me Proxy server Computer surveillance Blue screen of death Filename extension Gmail E-mail spam MDAC Pop-up ad Microsoft Trusted computing Norton AntiVirus Windows Installer Linux Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows New.net Windows Server 2003 Software bug Common criticisms of Microsoft Steam (content delivery) Zone Labs Component Object Model Extreme Programming Software cracking ITunes File sharing Yahoo!
