get some memory hi im not the best person on pc s and i need a little help a lot of my memory has been taken up on my pc can anyone tell me how i can get some of my memory back maybe by deleteing some stuff what uses most memory and is there anything i can do or get to help with this problem not sure what i can delete or not ie is it music and stuff like that or is it just software or both or something else any help please thank you do you mean memory or hard disk space the easiest way to differentiate is to think of the hard drive as the filing cabinet everything stays in there even when the computer is switched off memory is the stuff your computer uses when it's switch on and needs to access things quickly a bit like the stuff you keep on your desk while your working on particular projects memory clears when the pc is switched off like you clear your desk at the end of your working day if it's hard disk space then yeah deleting temporary internet files etc will free some space also uninstalling programs you no longer need using control panel add remove programs will also free up some more if you mean memory then you need to look at how many things are running on your computer at any one time i'm guilty of running lots at once eg word excel explorer firefox azureus and a few other programs every open program uses a bit or a lot or ram memory closing some of these programs will free up more ram or desk space and help your computer run a bit smoother if that doesn't do enough you may need to get a techie friend to come round and look at what is loading when the computer starts up i find the offer of beer cake or even lunch is enough to tempt most techies if your computer has mb of ram or less it may be worth upgrading a little too http www crucial com have a program that can determine what ram you need you'll need to grab that techie friend to install it or you could try going to your local pc superstore who'll do the lot although it'll cost you more than a cake Macintosh Finder Windows 2000 Windows registry Blue screen of death Windows 3.x File system Windows XP ITunes Control Panel (Windows) Mouse (computing) System 6 Object Desktop File Allocation Table Mac OS X MegaMan Battle Network System 7 (Macintosh) Booting Spyware COMMAND.COM Windows Explorer Btrieve Emacs MegaMan Battle Network (video game) NTFS junction point Gmail Hello world program MegaMan Battle Network 3 Windows Me History of the graphical user interface Microsoft Windows Library (computer science) NTFS Konqueror MSN Messenger IPod Cmd.exe Windows Vista Trojan horse (computing) Mozilla Firefox Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME AmigaOS Macromedia Flash Apple typography Mac OS history Common Unix Printing System Taskbar Klondike (solitaire) Start Menu MegaMan Battle Network 2 Host file Stardock Windows Server 2003 Computer virus Google Desktop Path (computing) Windows 1.0 Linux LiveCD Card game Commodore 64 Directory ILife SpamAssassin MDAC PHP Knoppix Filename extension Xbox 360 SQL Virtual memory Partition (computing) Computer and video games Windows API AOL Instant Messenger Xerox Star Job Control Language Data General Nova Pretty Good Privacy Embedded system Dialer Screensaver .NET assemblies Dance Dance Revolution Game controller The Sims 2 Mahjong solitaire Control-Alt-Delete OpenOffice.org Python programming language Universal Serial Bus Spirit rover NX bit B-47 Stratojet MegaMan Battle Network 5 Dynamic-Link Library Apple PlainTalk Windows Mobile Pipeline (Unix) Anti-virus software Uninstaller
