ie freezes when link is clicked i'm trying to revive an old pc and have updated the ram etc everything works fine but in ie i can't change pages it just freezes when i click a link i get the same thing pasting the link into the address bar i remember seeing this problem once a long time ago in a pc that someone had installed a skin in ie when the skin was removed it deleted whatever exe file handles link changes i'm wondering if i have a missing or corrupted copy of that file the reason i think it might be the same problem is i uninstalled the netzero program using add remove programs the other time i just reinstalled ie and that fixed it i'm hoping to avoid that this time i know there is a command you can run to extract one file from the install disk if you know the name of the file any thoughts the os is xp home edition i'm not sure but try firefox and see if it does the same thing Game controller Mouse (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis MAME Arcade cabinet IBM PC keyboard Computer keyboard Windows 2000 Commodore C64 Games System Screenshot Konami Code Microsoft Windows Object Desktop Tab Opera (web browser) Unicode Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Pump It Up AmigaOS Dance Dance Revolution Stardock Emacs Windows XP Golden Age of Arcade Games WordPerfect Visual Basic Nintendo Entertainment System Palm OS X Window System Xbox 360 DrumMania Slot machine Keyboard layout Xbox Atari 2600 Computer and video games Mame ROM image Modifier key Atari 8-bit family Beatmania IIDX Computer terminal Music video game Commodore 128 Diacritic Keyboard technology Zilog Z80 Windows API MSN Messenger Blue screen of death Control character Sega Dreamcast Namco Museum Macromedia Flash Joystick TRS-80 Common User Access Konqueror System 6 Switch Sinclair ZX81 Apple II family Accordion Expos__ (Mac OS X) Berzerk Option key Nintendo Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Legend of Zelda series songs Version C64 Direct-to-TV Midway Arcade Treasures 2 IBM PC compatible Spy Hunter R-Type Extended ASCII Tab (GUI) MapleStory DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Baseball Stars Virtual memory Gradius Microsoft Vim (text editor) Elevator FIFA Series Mozilla Application Suite Synthesizer Google Talk Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Shareware Bally Astrocade Emulator Atari ST Jumpstart 3rd Grade Goffredo Mameli PlayStation Portable Xlib Musical Instrument Digital Interface
