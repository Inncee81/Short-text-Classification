how to make transparent image color using photoshop i have made a rectangular shape i want to fill the color with blue how do i make the color so that it becomes transparent the reason is because i want to use the object as a highlighted menu in mobile phones i want to use it in theme studio so that when it highlights a menu the background can still be seen but not clear its kind of like misty can someone help i'm using photoshop cs hi there are a few important pieces of information missing from your question such as which version of photoshop you are using and what file format you want i'll provide two ways of doing this hopefully one will suit your purpose method create a new rgb image go to your layers lists and double click on the default background layer and click ok this will turn it into a regular layer choose select all from the menu and press delete the layer should now be a checkerboard pattern indicating that it's entirely transparent draw something on the layer then go back to the layer panel and lower the opacity save this as either a png or bmp and test method create a normal rgb image paint your image and select it go to the channels tab and click on the save selection as channel button at the bottom this will convert your selection to a black and white alpha channel with the name alpha select the alpha channel and then select adjust brightness contrast from the menu play with the settings so that the alpha channel is black and grey instead of black and white the intensity represents transparency try saving this out again as both png and bmp when saving bmps make sure you check the bit option so that alpha information is included older versions of photoshop don't support bit bmps good luck File system Macintosh Finder File Allocation Table PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 Disk image Universal Media Disc Mod (computer gaming) Partition (computing) Windows XP System 7 (Macintosh) Apple typography NTFS Object Desktop Mac OS X AmigaOS International Organization for Standardization Linux Launchd Windows Explorer Mouse (computing) Computer Embedded system Windows Vista System/36 Stardock Icon (computing) Acorn Electron Mac OS X v10.4 Regional lockout LiveCD Windows registry OS/2 Directory File format IPod Common Unix Printing System Read-only memory History of the graphical user interface Enterprise content management Macromedia Flash Gmail Quotation mark System 6 Debugging DVD ITunes Uploading and downloading Unicode Getting Things Done Plan 9 (operating system) Nintendo GameCube Berkeley Software Distribution Copy protection PNG Xerox Star Portable Document Format Advanced Audio Coding ISO image Redundant array of independent disks Lotus Notes C plus plus Software testing GBA Movie Player QuickTime ZIP (file format) Hello world program C programming language Modchip MSX Commodore 64 BIOS Digital Equipment Corporation USB flash drive OpenBSD Screenshot PlayStation 3 Master Control Program XML Virtual memory Apple Macintosh Product Lifecycle Management Konqueror MS-DOS Klik Double Dare Digital photography Geographic information system MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Computer hardware Musical Instrument Digital Interface Palm OS Computer forensics BASIC programming language Cyberspace Patch (computing) Spatial file manager .NET assemblies Easter egg (virtual) Mach kernel
