why should i bother cleaning my room go ahead call me an immature teen but i never quite understood the obsession as long as nasty stuff like dirty clothes and food dishes are where they belong i honestly don't really see the point in cleaning i don't invite people over anyway and i think clean ends up looking creepy and fake i don't wear shoes inside the house anyway and my floor isn't completely covered with stuff anyways so it can be swept and mopped when needed otherwise i just don't understand why i have the rest of my life to be a miserable adult with a to why can't i kick back and sit in my room as is it's not like it smells plus with everything out i actually find things faster since i don't have to remember what drawer it is stuck in which is really inconvenient since i have an unusually bad memory i don't see any reasoning that goes beyond i say so i'll wash the dishes and feed the pets and all that jazz but i don't think my room really needs it it's not like roaches abound well technically my dad is the one who bought the house and he doesn't really care as long he is doesn't have to come in in return i refrain from commenting on those huge ass dust bunnies on the desk in his room also i don't understand the clean room responsible connection i'm actually not that bad i keep my locker pretty organized at school i am in charge of holding on to my records so i have my files organized but i don't feel much compelled to clean my room except to shut my mum up i probably just jinxed it but the roaches party in my mom's meticulously cleaned living room and kitchen more than anywhere else i've only ever seen roaches in my closet where my stuff is supposed to be plus the stuff that's laying around is what i use the most so it gets shifted every so often instead of just settling there forever also about people taking my stuff that's why i don't like having people over in the first place but if it's that important i will notice i also love how i should clean because men like women who keep there place clean erm so i basically should change my behaviour toward my room for the sake of potential guys sorry i'm not quite in the boy or girl crazy teen stereotype yes i know that work makes you do things you don't want but at least there's a paycheck with my room the mess is back there in a few days since i actually live inside of there after all and that clutter is just a result of me actually being alive in there no my part of florida just sucks palmetto bugs anyone making the bugs unavoidable and like i said they're in the kitchen and such and beyond my control unless i suddenly get the the money to call professionals for my parents so i do have baits and spray and my room has stayed as safe as i can get it and keep in mind i am a teen that lives with my parents i have to clean eventually ever so often and i'm fairly certain that i would notice a million carcasses littered in my shoes and stuff ah but lennie while i could understand the dust and germs especially since it's so humid here the idea isn't to put it off but rather to keep sweaty things and stuff that can rot away and then it doesn't really matter where my stuff lands since i'll likely be using it again fairly soon also i do not believe that it is a reflection of myself i mean a room there are much better reflections such as my taste in clothing choice in friends or even how hard i work in school even if i despise it it's just a room a place to lay my head and store my stuff until i get up and go back out into the world how can it reflect me when i didn't even choose the year old furniture then again it's the perfect definition of a teen scattered thoughts over the base palette that your parents gave you ehem overall i still would like to know why the state of my room would even matter to others in this case my mother i don't even share a room james i find that very offensive seemingly you have gathered from the fact that i am questioning why i should clean my room that i am a lazy slut who will sleep around and have five kids for your information i do work hard i am in the top two of my class and i have no problem putting effort into the things that i need to do however i have yet to see my life go up in flames because i didn't hang my jacket up or stick my favorite flip flops back in the closet i see no reason why my room would reflect on me holding down a job whatever happened to things like education experience or how hard i'll work to keep that job i was unaware that a job interview included a home inspection stop being a jerk and assuming that i have to fit some twisted stereotype of yours because i don't want to clean my room everyday it's the things that you can't see that should be worrying you bacteria and fungus can cause all manner of diseases and air borne illnesses like meningitis and worst case scenario could also result in death this is serious stuff you should dvr how clean is your house on bbc america and sit and watch an episode or two it might shock you into cleaning up especially if you're eating in your bedroom Social rule Beavis and Butt-head Kodocha Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
