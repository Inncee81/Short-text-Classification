do air purifiers really work i want to buy one and hear some responses any bad brands my air purifier isn't going to arrive until monday but i've read enough user opinions that i believe they do work and work well two of the very important things to consider are the size of the unit and the cost of the replacement filters you obviously want the larger units that can move all the air in the room and filter it multiple times within one hour some of the filters are incredibly expensive so before you buy any model check with the manufacture web sites and do cost comparisons they should have at least two filters in them charcoal and hepa filters Air purifier Digital photography Hard disk Neopets Floppy disk Incandescent light bulb Censorware Water purification Air ioniser Gross domestic product Mutual fund E-mail spam Vacuum cleaner Stereoscopy Synthesizer Photography Stopping e-mail abuse NTFS CPU cache Cleanroom Water supply Mac OS X Loudspeaker Laserdisc Nintendo 64 F-16 Fighting Falcon System/36 PNG Liquid crystal display Ford Motor Company Inertial guidance system Virtual memory Python programming language Gmail Sport utility vehicle Spam (electronic) System/34 PlayStation 3 Carburetor Cascading Style Sheets E85 Leica Mach kernel Audiophile Hash table XML Computer Blog Air filter Cross site scripting Low-pass filter Bicycle lighting Fossil fuel power plant Database High-definition television Mozilla Thunderbird B3ta Extreme Programming Windows 2000 Web crawler Commodore 64 Analog-to-digital converter Steam (content delivery) Dry cleaning LiveJournal Airsoft Dairy Windows XP Comparison of web browsers Biodiesel Paracetamol RISC Mattress Motor oil IBM PC compatible S__CAM F/A-22 Raptor Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Binoculars View camera Modem Atari 8-bit family Air traffic control Intellivision RFID Syphon Filter Scale model Dialysis SCO-Linux controversies Denial-of-service attack Teletext Wayne Corporation MS-09 Dom Mozilla Application Suite Firewall (networking) Charcoal Diesel engine Thread (computer science) Redundant array of independent disks
