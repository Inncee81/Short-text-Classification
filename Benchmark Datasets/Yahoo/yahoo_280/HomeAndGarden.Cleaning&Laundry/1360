how can i get a henna stain out of my pastel green leather sofa please help i sat on our sofa and the tatoo was resting on it i got up and realised it had left a print i've tried all i can think of and all its done is make it worse i used nail polish remover and it took the top layer of the leather off so anyone else who has a similar problem do not use this otherwise you will ruin your sofa too please feel free to help x as you have already used a solvent and it has removed the finish on the leather you will need to contact a leather technician who will now be able to recolour over the damageand refinish for you if the nail varnish remover has not removed the dye then it has to be recoloured it is not a good idea to try everything without taking expert advice as sometimes the products you use can contain silicones which may make refinishing impossible new finish will not adhere to silicones a word of caution to all those who post on here with all these household products to try they do not work and in many cases as this one have made matters much worse the usual process for removing dye transfer is to use maxi cleaner specifically designed for the job and if this does not work to call a technician the use of a good leather protector one that works many don't will help inhibit this type of thinh happening again as it will be easier to clean off Upholstery Dry cleaning Chair Casting Leather Paint Tattoo Mattress Knife Technicolor Printed circuit board Solar cell Dye Hair coloring Violin Manicure Tire Nine Inch Nails Compact disc Vacuum cleaner Nuclear weapon design Strap-on dildo Soldering Turquoise Aluminium Diamond Contact lens Dairy IBM PC compatible Semiconductor device Staining (biology) Chromium Pottery Photolithography Ocean's Twelve Woodworking Hydrogen peroxide Volleyball Floppy disk Peanut View camera Drill bit Requirements analysis Menstrual cup Windows XP Heraldry Haloalkane Mach kernel Bong Professional wrestling match types Textile manufacturing terminology Justification (theology) Diode Shoe polish Theory of conduct Drawing Jack Thompson Plastic Cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chromatography Cross-country skiing Sanitary towel Enzyme Tariff Gramophone record Inflation Sulfuric acid Computer virus Digital rights management Coffee Social rule Nail (anatomy) Cricket ball Varnish Iron Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Snooker Undergarment Milton H.
