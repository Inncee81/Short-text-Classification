why does my room stink i just cleaned my fucking room with the rug doctor alright now after i fucking smells like ass like someone or a rhino shited in my room why the fuck does it smell like that and what the fuck can i do to get rid of that reeking smell sorry for the bad language but it just fucking makes me mad and frustrates me entirely when you use a rug cleaner a lot of water gets into the rug and if it has a foam underlay to pad it there will be a lot of moisture trapped it will take a long time to evaporate but you can help matters if you air the room as much as possible with fans and open windows don't put any furniture on the rug for days because all this moisture has to evaporate or you will have mildew and mold in the rug from the bacteria that will be growing in it try a few drops of nilodor in a cup set it inside the room also febreze is helpful and has a nice scent you have to be patient till things get back to normal if worse comes to worst you may have to repeat the cleaning process and this time suck all the water out of the rug i hope you don't have to lift the rug and remove the underpad hang in there a lot of us know exactly what you're going through it will get better sooner or later Upholstery The Shining (film) Vacuum cleaner Bong Andrew Dice Clay Sulfur Casting Social rule Shit Menstrual cycle Jackass: The Movie Air conditioning Sugar beet Water Fecal incontinence The Young Ones (TV series) Brewery The Marshall Mathers LP Shaggy dog story Midnight Run Rain Fire fighting Thermal power station Dry cleaning Punk ideology Paragliding Vacuum Cheese Cannabis cultivation Plastic Conker's Bad Fur Day Ron and Fez Halitosis Textile manufacturing Dairy Otitis externa Milton H.
