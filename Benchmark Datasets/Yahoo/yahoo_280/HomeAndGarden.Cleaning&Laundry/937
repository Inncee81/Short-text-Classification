smelly photos any way to remove odor from them hey all does anyone have any good tips for removing odors from pictures we had a fire in january and i suppose we're lucky to have been able to recover most of them they're in boxes in the basement however they stink something awful it's hard to even open up the box i'd hate to just throw them out and i was thinking about sticking an air freshener or something inside i don't want to risk further damaging the photos with spray any suggestions thanks you could stick a large bowl of charcoal in with them charcoal will absorb the smells and kill the bacteria and as long as they are in a bowl they won't hurt the pictures after about days change out the bowl if they still smell cause the charcoal can only absorb so much you could also use a large bowl of salt or baking soda but they won't absorb as much at a time as the charcoal Bong Sulfur Skunk Carbon dioxide Toilet humour Cannabis cultivation Acetic acid Foot odor Stink bomb Water purification Phoebe Buffay's songs Fume hood Fire fighting Iron Steel Diseases of the honeybee Flatulence Michael Moore Vermicompost Tofu Kurt Cobain Happy Tree Friends Pottery The Adventures of Pete & Pete Ammonia Toothpaste Shoe Poker jargon Odor Menstrual cup Professional wrestling match types Homer Simpson Deodorant Hydrochloric acid Ice cream Paracetamol Olfaction Tobacco V.F.D.
