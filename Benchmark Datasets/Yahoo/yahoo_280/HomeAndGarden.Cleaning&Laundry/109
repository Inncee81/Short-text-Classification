will washing a cat's food dish in the dishwasher spread germs to the other dishes in the dishwasher my roommate won't allow me to wash the cat's dishes in the dishwasher because she thinks the cat's germs could get spread to our dishes and then to us i argued that the hot water combined with soap should kill germs on plastic and ceramic dishes although maybe not on kitchen sponges no the water in a dishwasher gets hot enough to sterilize the contents not to mention the detergent that cleans the dishes do not wash the cat's dishes by hand as that will spread germs from the sponge to any other dish it is washed with now if you want to throw the sponge away after it is used on the cat's stuff which gets kinda expensive that will keep the germs from spreading Dishwashing Dishwasher Agar plate Car washing techniques Detergent Soap Hamster Textile manufacturing Kitchen Soap bubble Menstrual cup Sponge Hand washing Washing machine Cookware and bakeware Japanese tea ceremony Procter & Gamble Hard water Cuisine of the Philippines Morphology (linguistics) Cruising (maritime) Dry cleaning Disinfection Japanese cuisine Foodborne illness Bread Guns, Germs, and Steel Fuzzy logic Chinese cuisine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tattoo Breakfast Plastic Sewage treatment Tofu Laundry detergent French fries Laundry Cantonese cuisine Pizza Hell's Kitchen (television) Sauerkraut Care Bears Kosher foods Iron Chef Cleanliness Cuisine of Thailand Domestic water system Jewish cuisine Bong Central heating Dollar store Glycerin Korean cuisine Animal Customs and etiquette of Japan Sterilization (microbiology) Egg (food) Sterling silver Swedish Chef Garfield Swimming pool Teapot Menstrual cycle Milk Stir frying Weebl and Bob Ice cream Asepsis Minestrone Lutefisk Birth control Ramen Feet washing SpongeBob SquarePants Cha chaan teng Ovarian cancer Urticaria Rice Hydrotherapy Chopsticks Oregano Brillo Pad Pepper spray Sento Wound Sulfuric acid Potato Ripped Pants Solar power Roman eating and drinking Slow cooker Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cajun cuisine Nuclear fallout Collodion process Cat Cuisine of Laos
