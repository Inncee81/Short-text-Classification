how can i wash my mattress my dog pissed and crapped on it i can't get the stains out nor the smell i don't wanna flip it or throw it away go to the store and go into the bedding isle and purchase a waterproof mattress pad depending on the size of your bed it could range in price from but cheaper than a new mattress then check the cleaning isle and get some resolve spray foam cleaner you spray it on the mattress let it dry and vacuum it up you may need to do this several times depending on the mess at hand if the mattress is wet blot out as much of the mess as possible with a light towel and maybe something heavy blot as much as possible if you can leave a fan on and the windows open to dry the mess i would also sprinkle the mattress with baking soda and let it sit during the day while you are away it too will deodorize vacuum and that should take care of the smell once again you may have to repeat process if the smell still won't come out you can get a vinyl cover that zips all the way around the mattress sealing it completely then cover with mattress pad good luck Mattress Upholstery Plastic Bedbug Japanese toilet Dairy Social rule Menstrual cup Thermal power station Western blot Futon Dry cleaning Coir Bed (furniture) Manicure Cannabis cultivation Towel Paint Skunk Vacuum mattress Sento Bong Vinegar Coffee Brewery Waterbed Vacuum Vacuum cleaner Smells Like Teen Spirit Instant coffee Irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Strap-on dildo Diaper Kirby Corporation Bacon Cookware and bakeware Toilet humour Bread Sauna Gramophone record Illegal drug trade Phoebe Buffay's songs Fume hood Happy Tree Friends Shit Solar power Diseases of the honeybee Japanese tea ceremony Laundry Carburetor Sanitary towel Home repair Genericized trademark Washing machine True Crime: Streets of LA Transformer Wound Fan (implement) Carnivorous plant Drag racing Car washing techniques Xanadu House Sugar beet Fecal incontinence Champagne (beverage) Soldering Cat Autonomous building Glass Hemp American Psycho Cleanliness Craps Binoculars Personal flotation device Soap Sugarcane Textile manufacturing Toilet paper Fire fighting HIV test Halitosis Geodesic dome Fire extinguisher Diving suit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Trademark Mouse (computing) House dust mite Breastfeeding Filling station Pillow Bulk vending Urinary incontinence Brush Electrostatic precipitator
