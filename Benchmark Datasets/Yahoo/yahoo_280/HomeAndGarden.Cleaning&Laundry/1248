why do my towels never smell clean they seem to always have that musty wet smell to them i wash them every couple days with soap and liquid fabric softner but they never really seem to smell clean they are hung to dry after every use and not piled on the floor wet so i don't get why they'd smell bad mold can grow on your towels very fast even if you hang them to dry right away if the area is humid they will stay damp just long enough for the mold to infest the best way to kill the mold is to bleach the towels if they are colored you can still use bleach but make sure it is highly diluted fill the machine add in cup of bleach then add the towels by making sure the bleach is evenly dispersed in the water you'll avoid those yellowish white bleach spots they may fade slightly but it's worth it to kill the mold even if the mold is dead the smell might remain if so add a cup of baking soda the next time you wash them they'll freshen right up Menstrual cup Casting Upholstery Dishwashing Textile manufacturing Laundry detergent Washing machine Sauna Diaper Paper Hydrogen peroxide Vinegar Common cold Dry cleaning Japanese toilet Tea Water purification Hand washing Wok Halitosis Sento Menstrual cycle Towel Paper towel Hyperthermia Manicure Skunk Plaster Chocolate Dishwasher Cheese Sugar Glass Laundry Sand casting Bong Soap Car washing techniques Detergent Cannabis cultivation Linen Ammonia Sodium hypochlorite Compost Flour Hamster Organic peroxide Plastic Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Sulfuric acid Cocoa Fire fighting Mattress Sushi Disinfection Tofu Wheat Polyurethane Tattoo Concrete Sugarcane Dairy Sodium hydroxide Ultramarine Sodium percarbonate Gilding Houseplant Hemp Gypsy moth Diseases of the honeybee Bromine Polyethylene terephthalate Hebburn Bread Fire extinguisher Typewriter Spotted Skunk Fecal incontinence Carbon fiber Comfrey Thermal power station Polar Bear Procter & Gamble Weaving Diving suit Champagne (beverage) Brewery Water Bacon Vanilla Urinal Vermicompost Egg (food) Seismic retrofit Cruising (maritime) Glycerin
