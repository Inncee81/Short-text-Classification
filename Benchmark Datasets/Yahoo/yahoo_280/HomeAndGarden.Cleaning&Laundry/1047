gritty bathtub stains my bathtub has recently started getting a gritty buildup mostly on the bottom of the tub but a little on the sides as well it just looks like regular staining but when i try to scrub it it feels hard and does not rub off easily at all even with mr clean magic eraser that works on virtually everything anybody know what this is and what works to get rid of it btw this is an old porcelain type tub not one of the new plastic ones careful that you don't ruin the finish on your tub if you scrub with anything that takes the finish off you will always have a tub that holds the dirt and is very difficult to clean try clr it should remove any kind of dirt or calcium lime and rust build up if that doesn't work you will need to resort to more serious measures use ajax or comet powder and a kitchen scrub pad wet the tub first apply the powder to the scrub pad then scrub the tub in small areas at a time get into the tub sit on the edge and you will have less muscle strain good luck remember we're all in this together except for the people who don't have a tub Upholstery Mattress Casting Dishwasher Drill bit Sento Customs and etiquette of Japan Urinary incontinence Laundry Knife Wok Strap-on dildo Cast iron Sterilization (microbiology) Fecal incontinence Swimming pool Bong Top-bar hive Soldering Dishwashing Snowboarding Internal ballistics Motor oil Laundry detergent Violin Shampoo Illegal drug trade Japanese tea ceremony Woodworking Hard water Piccolo Junior Saga Plastic Chair Fire extinguisher Glass Paint Lionel Corporation Dialysis Cookware and bakeware Equine conformation Bathing M16 (rifle) Social rule Manicure Handloading Time Out of Mind Scrubber Bicycle Dry cleaning Menstrual cup Siegfried Line Sauna Hot tub The Inside Coriolis effect Phosphoric acid Brush Diseases of the honeybee Flue gas desulfurization Jackass: The Movie Dairy Plaster Termina Lawn mower Tofu Gilding Mouse (computing) Japanese toilet Water purification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cubic zirconia Glossary of climbing terms Car washing techniques Brewery Toilet Diving Drawing Vitreous enamel The Legend of Zelda series enemies Kitchen Rifle Surveillance TLC Ren and Stimpy Mortar (masonry) Sodium hypochlorite Theory of conduct Computer virus Tattoo Thermal power station Residual-current device 2000 Australian Grand Prix Explosive material Skiing Electrical wiring Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vacuum cleaner
