is it okay to use bleach to clean my bathroom floor i am a guy with a male roommate hence we don't clean much i want to really clean the bathroom well today so i want to know if it is okay for the floor if i use diluted bleach to clean it the floor is a grout and tile floor so i would think it would be okay but i just wondered if anyone had advice otherwise alternative ideas would be nice but i want to be thorough and be able to clean any mold or other things that may be on the floor thanks thanks to everyone who provided answers also there is no need to tell me not to mix ammonia and bleach i am a chemist well bleach would take care of the mold make sure you dilute it and use hot water also make sure you have ventilation in the area if you are cleaning on your hands and knees you can try sprinkling baking soda on the floor and wiping with a sponge and hot water if these are sealed tiles you can also put baking soda and a little bit of vinegar in your drains and let set overnight to make them smell better Bread Menstrual cup Dishwashing Vinegar Brewery Sodium hypochlorite Toilet humour Hydrogen peroxide Jewish cuisine Disinfection Avenue Q Plastic Water purification Ammonia Domestic water system Bong Tile Toilet paper Acetic acid Sento Bathroom Sodium hydroxide Organic peroxide Sulfuric acid Pet skunk Dymaxion house Mathematician Diseases of the honeybee Kitchen Textile manufacturing Fire fighting Toilet HVAC Casting Hamster Japanese toilet Marine aquarium Japanese tea ceremony Tattoo Urine Basement Sauna World War Three (Doctor Who) Wood pulp Ozone Flour Brush Seismic retrofit Pancake Toffee Carbon dioxide Urinal Japanese cuisine Plumbing fixture Hydrochloric acid Baptism Sodium carbonate Nirvana (band) Wok Ice cream Sushi Tea The Boondock Saints Water Fossil fuel power plant The Lovely Bones Gilding Social rule I Am the Walrus Tessellation 613 mitzvot Leblanc process Tofu Glass Titanium The Pet Sounds Sessions Paper Cuisine of Denmark Vacuum cleaner Rock (music) Plaster Menstrual cycle Scuba set Hot sauce Fecal incontinence God and gender Baking powder Hebburn Dialysis Idli Jackass: The Movie Dishwasher Car washing techniques Little Britain Cookware and bakeware Haloalkane Otitis externa Roman eating and drinking Rebreather Bleach
