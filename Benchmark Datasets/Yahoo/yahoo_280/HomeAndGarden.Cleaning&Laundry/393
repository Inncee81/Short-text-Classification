white plastic appliances yellow with age i have some white plastic appliances like toasters kettles and microwaves that have yellowed with age though they work perfectly well does anyone know a way of getting them white again i have tried many cleaning materials including bleach to no avail the yellowing seems to be within the plastic and not surface staining this is to do with the plastic slowly degrading due to uv attack from the sunlight if you can find some weay of reversing it you would make a fortune but it's jsut part of the nature of the polymers tht make up the plastic best advice is to move them out of sunlight and turn them around you should find the other sied has not yellowed as much more modern and expensive plastics have uv stabilisers in them to avoid this happening in the first place but there is no way to reverse it Bong Light-emitting diode Solar cell Melanin Water purification Billiards Kitchen Corrosion Motor oil Solar power Welding Romanian leu Brush Polyethylene terephthalate Fiberglass Hamster Upholstery Sewage treatment Transistor Diamond simulant Brewery Ammonia Timpani Sunglasses Drill bit Washing machine Seismic retrofit Hydrogen peroxide Menstrual cup Solar power satellite Glass Diamond enhancement Paint Organic peroxide Ice core E-waste Primer (paint) Wassily Kandinsky Polystyrene Traffic light Graphite-reinforced plastic Piet Mondrian Photographic developer Dishwasher Photographic film Major appliance Sulfur Glacier Beretta 92F/FS Bulk vending Ceramics Bleach Sun Radio controlled car Cookware and bakeware Ammolite Cloud Space manufacturing Screw Bagel Peroxide Vulcanization GLOCK DNA Mattress Lane Domestic AC power plugs and sockets International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea Pottery Nylon Explosive material Diamond Plasticizer Slide rule Fatigue (material) Titanium Deforestation Reinforced concrete Biodegradation Ultraviolet Bedbug Strap-on dildo Flour Unusual types of gramophone record Table saw Domestic water system Turquoise Cathode ray tube Building material Mulch Microwave Laser printer Dishwashing Diamond color Stereoscopy Polyvinyl chloride Car handling Irrigation
