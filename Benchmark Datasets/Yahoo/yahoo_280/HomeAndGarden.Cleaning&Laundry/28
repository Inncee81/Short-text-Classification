how do i prevent bleeding on new clothes i plan to wash all of my different colored shirts together eventually i have done this for years and never had a problem but i am going off to college soon and want to be able to wash everything together right away without worrying about bleeding one of my new shirts is red by the way what should i do to prevent bleeding i don't have many of the same color so i can't wash each color individually i was thinking about washing the new shirts in the sink first individually i heard of a trick about using vinegar salt or something to set the color but if i put one shirt in each sink how much vinegar and salt should i use how long should i let the shirt soak should i use cold or hot water do i need to put detergent in if so how much how many times should i do this before i can be confident that the color wont run is there anything else i can do instead thanks a bunch i will choose best answer you can set the dye simply by adding a cup of vinegar or salt to the rinse water the first time you launder them by soaking them you will cause the dyes to bleed out thus diluting their color i also usually use a shout color catcher in the washer to catch any dye bleeding out while it is washing so fill the washer with cold water add your detergent and the color catcher then add the vinegar to the rinse dispenser and add the clothing if you use salt you have to stop the machine after it has washed and filled with the rinse water put the machine on the shortest wash cycle for the fiber content of the garments you have in the load i usually throw vinegar in the rinse water with dark colored clothing every other time i launder them to keep my dark colors from fading it also acts as a fabric softener and the smell dissapates in the dryer Vinegar Upholstery Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Dry cleaning Washing machine Menstrual cup Laundry detergent Tofu Soap Detergent Clothing Laundry Sento Tattoo Haggis Dishwashing Leather Cruising (maritime) Starch Car washing techniques Staining (biology) Sulfuric acid Tag Sushi Hard water Jute Textile manufacturing terminology Electrophysiology Undergarment Tallit Edible salt Coffee Tanning Acetic acid Sodium hypochlorite Wok Mattress Manicure Yarrow Technicolor Cochineal Diaper Gram staining Bleeding Salt Plumbing fixture Smelt Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sewage treatment Denim Rebreather Carburetor Shaving Phosphorus Ammonia Water Psoriasis CPU cache Cheese Sulfur Food preservation Ironing Soy milk Cuisine of the Philippines Soap bubble Alum Plastic Rice Kilt Water (molecule) Peanut Indigo dye Kimono Sodium chloride E-6 process Jewish cuisine Sodium hydroxide Gilding Weaving Academic dress Wound Shaggy dog story Otitis externa Chowder Menstrual cycle Fencing 2005 World Series Japanese tea ceremony Bong Beachwear Piccolo Junior Saga Characters of Naruto
