which product have you noticed works on pet smells best i have a very expensive turkish rug that has a smell even after a professional cleaning from a past roommate's cat or dog that i used to live with i have heard of enzyme based cleaners that are supposed to be very effective at neutralizing all odor i looked and there are many brands out there which is best we are the proud or is it crazy owners of dogs a cat rabbits and hens all but the hens are indoor pets lol we have a large basement where the rabbits live most of the time due to weather our cat had bladder issues after being fixed and was peeing on our couch about once a week the odor was heavy as it was the last of the marking hormones then the dog decided he needed to cover that by marking arrrgh thank god that's over but in the meantime we were left with lots of smells and clean up i tried everything under the sun some cheap and some very pricey i found natures miracle to be a joke it was expensive and worked at first but the odor crept back over time and didn't keep the cat from going there again the best product by far came from wegman's our local grocery store it's called fresh 'n clean and is made by arm hammer this stuff is amazing it removes odors and stains it says it removes pet and odor and stains forever and a year later i have to agree i buy the spray bottle that says oxy strength with deodorizers and always keep a bottle on hand it has a great clean smell which i didn't find with nature's miracle or other products i recommended it to my neighbor who runs a cat rescue and usually has from cats at a time imagine her house on hot summer days we could smell the litterboxes she now swears by it too and we smell nothing you can go to www lambertkay com or call to see where it is available near you good luck Cat Hamster Domestic rabbit Flatulence Guinea pig Fancy rat Upholstery Phoebe Buffay's songs Garfield Plastic Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Sin City Perfume Bong Menstrual cup Heinkel He 112 Skunk Trademark Gaia Online Odor Tofu Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ferret Brewery Laundry detergent Tobacco smoking Care Bears Russian joke Poker jargon Dry cleaning Neighbours Red Dwarf characters Cannabis cultivation Energy development W.I.T.C.H.
