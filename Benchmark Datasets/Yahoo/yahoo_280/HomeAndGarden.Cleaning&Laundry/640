how to i get my white bikini w dark blue embroidered white again i was at the beach and i guess fr the grungy lake it has a grey tinge and the ass looks like a crapped myself im soaking in oxiclean but the label says cold water soak and oxiclean works awesome with hot and i dont need the blue to run its brand new and i cant put in hot water don't use hot water at all it will run i would try using nappy soaker in cold water you can dissolve in hot and let it cool and stay with the bikini to see if it runs before you just leave it to soak if you can't get it clean that way try making a paste of nappy soaker and apply that to the white bits that are the dirtiest and rinse in cold water after letting it sit for mins Tofu Sento Water Coffee Swimming pool Tea Sheryl Crow Bathing Jennifer Lopez Dishwashing Soldering Dishwasher Shit Wassily Kandinsky Bread Menstrual cup Onsen Manicure Car washing techniques Opportunity rover Dry cleaning Brewery Eric Cartman Frog Bong Textile manufacturing White phosphorus incendiary Jazz Billboard Hot 100 Jackass: The Movie Powerbomb Tattoo Cloud Leonard Cohen Hyperthermia Haggis Motor oil Hot tub Japanese tea ceremony Color theory Beer Water (molecule) Agar plate Leather Rum Cruising (maritime) Swimming Craps Gilding Sauna Professional wrestling throws Jennings Randolph Lake Sewer Composting toilet Year of the Spider Agarose gel electrophoresis ECW One Night Stand Stirling engine Toilet humour Mouth ulcer Wok Idli Ja Rule Contact lens Hippeastrum Common bean AFI 100 Years series Wallpaper Tap (valve) Don Rickles Sprouting Decaffeination Hot chocolate Laundry detergent Hersheypark Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Adhesive Comanche Sake Hot spring Vinegar Sulfur 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Lake Urinal Lighting Beaches of Hong Kong Dialysis CPU cache Swingout The Neptunes Coldplay Bikini Welding Hot sauce Temperature Mercury Atlas 6 Hollaback Girl Super Mario Sunshine Fossil fuel power plant
