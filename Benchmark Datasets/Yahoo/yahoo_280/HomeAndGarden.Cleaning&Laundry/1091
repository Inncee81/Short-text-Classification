how do i clean a raw silk lamp shade i have a lovely large eames lamp and the shade is beige raw silk but is is generally dirty i dont want to wash it as it may get water marks or shrink or something what to do it is a vintage lamp and i think the person who owned it before me was a smoker as i think it has nicotine all over it i have several silk lampshades and here is how i clean them first use the brush attachment to vacuum off any dirt dust and hair that has collected on the shade you cannot use any product that is liquid based or you will get water marks if the shade is small enough you can place it in a bag filled with salt and use it to scrub the shade to generally clean it and leave it in the bag for a couple of days to absorb odors and dust if it is very large you can use dry carpet cleaning granules like those made by resolve capture tech or chem dry carefully agitate the dry cleaning granules on the shade being careful not to snag the natural texture of the silk use a very large box to capture the excess granules or do double duty like i do and do it over carpet or upholstery that also needs cleaning if you do the latter agitate then let it dry on the carpet or upholstery and vacuum it up Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Carpet Mattress Bong Opportunity rover Jute Hydroponics Car washing techniques Plastic Tofu Coffee Soap Casting Tobacco Textile manufacturing Nuclear fallout Lighting Solar power Skin Car wash Pottery Sugar beet Textile manufacturing terminology Dairy Roomba Leather Soldering Instant coffee Polyurethane Silk Wool Top-bar hive Kerosene lamp Hamster Tea Drawing Japanese tea ceremony Hand washing Spider Fishing Laundry Dialysis Thermal power station Vacuum Japanese toilet Menstrual cup Hat Dust Brush Tanning Dishwashing Brewery Angling Ice core Wound Manicure First aid Textile Movie projector Ammonia Sugarcane Autonomous building Illegal drug trade Cigarette Food preservation Shampoo Cigar Gilding Cleanliness Yerba mate Radio controlled car Cheese Fan (implement) Glossary of wildland fire terms Kirby Corporation Honey Collecting fossils Clothing Tattoo Leaf Laundry detergent Soy protein Genericized trademark Lionel Corporation Gelatin Haloalkane Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carnivorous plant Rebreather Psoriasis Incandescent light bulb Siphon Photoelectric effect Ozone Wound healing phases Glaze Microfiber
