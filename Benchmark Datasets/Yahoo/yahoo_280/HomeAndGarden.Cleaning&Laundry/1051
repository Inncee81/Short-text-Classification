what's your favorite technique in cleaning up a messy room i procrastinate too much and in the meantime the entropic state of my room increases until it's too damn overwhelming p sometimes i play a game called 's first i set a timer for minutes then i grab a laundry basket and a trash bag i turn the timer on and go around the room picking up things that need to be put away if they can be put away in that room they're put away if not they go into the basket at items i race around the house putting up those items then i grab the garbage bag and find things that need to be in the trash and stuff them in then i go back to things put away the things thrown away i see how many loops of twenty i can make before the timer goes off if i run out of things to throw away or put away i go to another room after my first minutes i take a break and do something else for minutes after sets of minutes i break for minutes another thing i do is to break the cleaning down into little bitty bits like i'll clean the kitchen table and this bit of counter tonight it really does help to have music or something semi interesting on the tv to distract you just not anything that's so interesting that you stop cleaning lol also once i've decided to clean i don't allow myself to make things any dirtier that means everything must be picked up as i go no exceptions i used to be really really messy but got better now my house will be clean once every two weeks no matter what it gets messy but then i clean it up nicely so it's never really horrible Textile manufacturing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Star Wars Holiday Special Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Jackass: The Movie CPU cache Swingout Dustbin Sampling (music) Procrastination Aerial (dance move) Hell's Kitchen (television) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Piccolo Junior Saga BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban StarCraft: Uprising Social rule Damn Yankees Yao Ming Drill bit RISC The Inside Craps Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Dialysis World War Three (Doctor Who) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gaia Online Saw II Professional wrestling match types Page replacement algorithms Cleveland Browns Oplan Bojinka Little Britain Roxette 1957 World Series Blood (computer game) Getting Things Done Kender Burroughs B5000 Virtual memory Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Apollo Guidance Computer Table tennis Dog training Skateboarding trick Big Brother (USA TV series) Spidey Super Stories Glossary of American football Dry cleaning Ocean's Twelve Milton H.
