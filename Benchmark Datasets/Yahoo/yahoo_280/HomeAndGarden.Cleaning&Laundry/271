how to make a basement apt look more nice no matter how much i clean it it looks like a mess when i got divorced i had to move back to my parents house with my mo old the only available space for me was the basement i was determined to make what was just an unfinished area look like home i actually had no walls save for the outside walls and bought the large tan bamboo roll down blinds the sell at home depot to make them they come in a cheaper plastic version which is what i used tan and come as long as or foot so i hung them next to one another from the ceiling beams to form walls i even hung pictures from wire attached to the ceiling beams right in front of the blinds it gave the illusion of pictures on the walls since i am assuming you already have walls here are some other tricks windows are a big part of making the basement look like a basement here's a deception hang a curtain rod just at the bottom of the window and put a pair of cafe curtains on it now hang a matching pair of swag style curtains with tie backs on the rod above the window making sure they are long enough to come down over the cafe curtains you now have the illusion of a regular window this does volumes for making it look less like a basement in a living room area you can use long drapes over miniblinds and do the same thing just let the blinds go down to where a regular window would end and then use regular length drapes my walls were cinderblock but i painted them i bought gallons of floor paint made for garage basemnet floors in a pretty sand color and painted away it looked great i also got a berber carpet remnant at home depot and put that down finally you can hang pictures you do need a cordless drill and a masonry bit but it is possible for lighter stuff i actually utilized holes that were in the cinderblocks to keep it organized i agree with everyone above you have to realize that in a small space you need less stuff being that i had a baby i had alot of stuff i had to keep i invested in tan plastic tubs so they would blend in with the walls i picked one corner and stacked them high side by side then i got a pretty fabric shower curtain in a neutral beige bought a cheap shower curtain rod and hung this in front of the tubs from hooks in the ceiling beams instant closet another shower curtain rod hung behind the curtain provided somewhere to hang coats dresses etc i had wicker baskets with my son's toys that sat on the tubs and another that held my bed linens i shopped at dollar stores thrift shops and big lots and did all of this for very little be creative and good luck Textile manufacturing Seismic retrofit Basement Drill bit Chair Chatsworth House Carpet Passenger car Volleyball Plastic Hamster Mattress Jackass: The Movie Wilton House Casting Upholstery Solar cell Wood carving Skateboarding trick Irish Houses of Parliament Textile manufacturing terminology Bungalow McMansion The Brady Bunch Aerial (dance move) Bus models used in New York City Transit Christmas tree Bong Combine (Half-Life 2) Glossary of climbing terms Masonry Antenna (radio) Solar power StarCraft: Uprising Straw-bale construction Stairway The Time Machine Animal Crossing Bristol Grammar School Cruising (maritime) Sundial Characters in the Smurfs Apt Pupil Professional wrestling throws Customs and etiquette of Japan Door Great Teacher Onizuka Top-bar hive Professional wrestling holds Xanadu House Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Magic (illusion) Professional wrestling slang The Inside Printed circuit board Lighting Glossary of nautical terms Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shoe Dial M for Murder Glossary of firefighting equipment Paintball 2000 Australian Grand Prix Gay bathhouse Unreal Doom engine Comanche Surveillance Shaggy dog story Anchor Holkham Hall Disneyland Brewery Floppy disk John Cage Undergarment Knife Bathroom Wheel of Fortune Cannabis cultivation Pittsburgh Steelers Die (manufacturing) EastEnders Suplex Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Puppet Columbine High School massacre Avenue Q Ron and Fez Microeconomics Francis Bacon (painter) Piccolo Junior Saga
