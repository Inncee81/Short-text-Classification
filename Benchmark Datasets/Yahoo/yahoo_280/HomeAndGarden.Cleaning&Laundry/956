my house stinks man its not like its dirty and messy its just like any other house but for some reason it smells like year old cheese and the bathrooms man they smell like perfume mixed in with crap what can i do to make smell better especialy the bathrooms mold has heart attack first off a good cleaning with bleach to kill any germs or bacteria also kills mold as that sounds like it could be it the smell i mean next if you have a basement and attic make sure they are both well ventilated you need to air out the whole house so open every window and vent you have also check for water damage in the basement if there is water coming in the dampness will cause mold and the smell will knock your socks off lol but its also very dangerous for your health so do please check all this out once you have done all that cleaned vented etc go over all furniture with something like fabreez and get some good fragranced plug ins or scented oils etc to place around the home also if you have central air or heating its a good thing to check the ducts and make sure they are cleaned also as this can be your source of smell also you can place some fragranced sheets over the vents of these also another good idea is to lightly spray all light bulbs with your favorite scent so every time you open a light the room will smell really nice one more thing if your house is older check under the sinks in the kitchen and bathroom and make sure that you have the s type i think its called for water drainage if you don't then you are getting methane gas into the home which is bad for your health and causes a horrible smell my old house had straight drainage smell was horrible changed them and smell was gone as the water inside the s keeps out the gas and sewer smells and don't forget to clean out those pipes too with baking soda and vinegar that is about all i can think of good luck to ya and btw if it is mold have it cleaned out by a professional just in case because it is dangerous to your health cannot stress that enough Air pollution HVAC Kitchen Fire fighting Basement Perfume Japanese toilet Hydrogen sulfide Bong Menstrual cup Natural gas Houseplant Sulfur The Shining (film) Hamster Autonomous building Sewage treatment Bread Upholstery Cheese Geodesic dome Strap-on dildo Solar power Radon Air conditioning Plastic Flatulence Tofu Fume hood Diseases of the honeybee Odor Domestic water system Home repair Rebreather Furnace Swimming pool Social rule Foodborne illness Ozone Two-stroke cycle Skunk Dymaxion house The Young Ones (TV series) Soap Renewable energy The Brady Bunch Alkane Glossary of firefighting terms Spotted Skunk Oxyacetylene Dishwasher M16 (rifle) Blood Simple Lighting Acetic acid World War Three (Doctor Who) Olfaction Asbestos Gas metal arc welding Methane Airbag Gasoline Halitosis Fire extinguisher Ammonia Multiple chemical sensitivity Brewery Dormitory Tobacco Volcano Futurama (TV series - season 2) Jewish cuisine Motor oil Dairy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ventilation Lake Thermal depolymerization Hydrogen peroxide Chatsworth House Tank Abiogenic petroleum origin Fluorescent lamp
