how do i wash this hat last christmas i bought my fiance this white icp hat and he wore it every single day well it went missing and i found it today when going through some boxes we had moved and lets put it this way if you hadnt seen it when we first got it you wouldnt believe it was a white hat i want to wash it so he can wear it again but how do you wash it so that it will be white or as close to it as possible i would use bleach on it but im afraid that the bleach might yellow it around the bill of the hat any suggestions i would use oxy clean it works really well and doesn't discolor things as much soak it overnight with warm water then see how things look if that doesn't work you could try taking it to the dry cleaners and see what they can do with it Textile manufacturing Dry cleaning Menstrual cup Washing machine Sodium hypochlorite Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tattoo Dishwashing Laundry detergent Jackass: The Movie Teletubbies Japanese toilet Leather Calvin and Hobbes Characters in the Smurfs Wood pulp The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Customs and etiquette of Japan The Star Wars Holiday Special Avenue Q Salad Fingers Hat Recurring South Park characters Baldrick The Cat in the Hat Mattress Upholstery Friends Feet washing Bidet Coir Dishwasher Polar Bear Sugarcane Campfire Tooth enamel Baptism Wassily Kandinsky Toilet Social rule Hummingbird Japanese tea ceremony Blonde on Blonde Only Fools and Horses Characters in Bleach series I Dream of Jeannie Vacuum cleaner Jute RuneScape economy Diving The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Lutefisk Menstrual cycle American Psycho Sauna Futurama (TV series - season 2) Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Animal Crossing Contact lens Sugar Comanche Sin City Detergent Diving suit Laundry Brush Top-bar hive Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Bon Jovi Clothing Weebl and Bob Physiological plant disorders Psoriasis Hebburn The Warriors Hydrogen peroxide Usopp Futurama (TV series - season 5) Car washing techniques Caving Kitchen Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Tlingit Manicure Ozone Bleach Skinhead Idli Dairy Embalming The Beatles discography Lord Chancellor Surveillance Tour de France Rice Gaia Online Hatful of Hollow
