how much should i charge for washing windows i am trying to start my own housecleaning service i have a few clients already i charge a set price for vaccuming dusting mopping etc but i feel that things like window washing cleaning out the fridge cleaning the oven and laundry ironing should be charged extra the problem is i don't know how much extra what do you think is fair cleaning windows is a pain and once you set a price the homeowner becomes a pain in the butt you need to realize that window cleaning or washing means both sides what if the house is two storied now you need a ladder if you are writing up a proposal or just a pricing guide i would state that you only do windows on the bottom floor at a rate of a window that's a side no second floor outside windows will be done only the insides at a window as far as cleaning out the refrigerator goes that should be about because you have to remove the entire contents and clean all the shelving don't forget that includes the outside and the top i would also state that all cleaning supplies should be supplied by the home owner cleaning the oven what a pain i would say for those white stove tops that have burnt on crap on them that oven cleaner works really well and will not remove the paint laundry and ironing yuk i don't mind laundry to much but ironing is a pain i would recommend that they drop their ironing off at a professionals because people are really picky about this subject and if you mess up one article of clothing it could cost you several months salary i would like to make a suggestion one of the new waves of the future is designer closets i am going to include several web sites for ideas you can help during the building process of a home or remodel a older home it really is pretty basic and pays well also organizing garages shelve installation the rule of thumb here is materials times three for your labor cost what you do is figure out what all the materials cost everything from screws to shelving to hangers then multiply that number times three to get your labor cost http www californiaclosets com http www closetandstorageconcepts com http www easyclosets com http www closetmaid com
