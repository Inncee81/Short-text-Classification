do you make your bed every morning my husband has to make the bed every morning he tries to get me to help but i refuse i think that it is pointless and a waste of time we have two girls that we have to get ready in the morning so making the bed is the last thing i am worried about he says that it makes him feel better so i tell him that he can make it if it makes him feel better but i will not help i just don't see the point if there is not going to be anyone at the house all day then by the time we get home we are pretty much right back in it now i can understand if we were having or had company this morning he told me that he thinks i am the only women in the world that doesn't want the bed made is that true no making your bed is a waste of time every morning especially if you have kids and already have a long enough routine in the morning your husband has to be kidding is he a neat freak or something i assume the house will sit empty for the entire day why stop at the bed why not go ahead and vacuum dust and clean the ceiling fans every morning just in case for everyone saying an unmade bed feels dirty i hate to tell you the sheets are just as clean as if the bed were made i can only assume the people that replied yes either don't have kids or don't have jobs to go to and for the guy that compared it to brushing your teeth and dirty underwear are you kidding me unless you wash your bedding everyday there is no comparison please refer to the above paragraph the sheets are just as dirty in an unmade bed as they are in a made bed Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie EastEnders Milton H.
