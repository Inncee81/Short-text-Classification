has anyone used a maid service my mother wants to give me a gift card for a maid service i am pregnant and shouldn't be lifting more than or bending a lot but i looked at them and i just don't think that they are going to do anything i can't do with a little help from hubby and older child and i found a lot of very negative reports about them online anyway so does any one have personal experience with any of the big maid services when living in maryland i used the cleaning authority and they were great i had them in every two weeks on a specified day with their own alarm code to enter their first two visits were more expensive but the following visits were reasonable and they did a fabulous job using two or three housecleaners each time each visit they had an area they detailed more than the others so everything got extra attention regularly in between i only had to dust or clean up a bathroom depending on use you have to interview several to find out what their services include and then decide on how often you want them that determines the price i am planning on using them again in our new home in our new state people in my old neighborhood who used independents had many problems as have friends who used independents as well i never had a problem they were on time and professional and i never worried about anything being stolen or broken nor did i worry about my two maine coon cats escaping interview and decide who will live up to your expectations Social rule Friends The Apprentice 2 Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Theory of conduct 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Baseball Ty Cobb 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adult attention-deficit disorder Surveillance The Fairly OddParents Avenue Q Knots Landing Kodocha 1957 World Series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Pregnancy Extreme Programming Pok__mon Chronicles Jam (TV series) Plame affair Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ethics Education in the People's Republic of China Pitaten Charmed Infantilism Jennifer Lopez MapleStory Emergency preparedness Oasis (band) Professional wrestling slang The Emancipation of Mimi Aerial (dance move) Little Britain Cindy Sheehan The Family from One End Street John Wesley The Sims 2 Our Gang Sin City Columbine High School massacre Hermione Granger Minor league baseball Tesco Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Rosa Parks Richard Chase Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Lazarus Long The Inside ITunes Music Store Big Brother UK series 6 Meat Loaf Phoebe Halliwell Babe Ruth Elvis Presley Microeconomics Kyoto Protocol Occupation of Iraq timeline Freeters Breastfeeding W.I.T.C.H.
