problem with dial up interference we recenctly hooked up a xp home edition desktop upstairs with a wireless linksys adapter i for one like to play games on the computer but i have connection problems due to the fact that even though we are on dsl now it still believes we use dial up and asks to hook it up to the internet causing the wireless to have limited or no connectivity this is very annoying because i lose connection with my games does anyone have any advice on how to make it so it will work right p s the wireless is through the xp configuration in case that does anything if you go into control panel networks you can run the new connection wizard and set it up for a wireless network with direct access to the internet it is best to do a manual install and don't bother with a disk creation as the last step one other thing is change your router channel to to cut down on interference be sure to set up some type of security and change the default password Wi-Fi Windows XP Digital Subscriber Line Wireless LAN Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus Modem IEEE 802.11 Cisco Systems Router Windows Server 2003 Internet Telephone Federal Standard 1037C Linux Telephone exchange Computer surveillance Malware Telegraphy Ethernet Hard disk USB flash drive Broadband Internet access Windows 2000 Control Panel (Windows) Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Wireless access point Computer virus Mouse (computing) Integrated Services Digital Network MDAC Computer security Virtual Network Computing PlayStation Portable Pretty Good Privacy Multiplayer IBM PC compatible GSM services Visual Basic Floppy disk FreeBSD Denial-of-service attack Nintendo Entertainment System Dialer Television Object Desktop Apple Computer Redundant array of independent disks Xbox 360 Internet Relay Chat Vertical service code Computer hardware Wireless Application Protocol Novell NetWare PlayStation 2 AirPort MAC address Laptop Telephone numbering plan Mandriva Linux AmigaOS WiMAX Blue screen of death Knoppix Prodigy (ISP) Opera (web browser) Apple Open Collaboration Environment Windows Vista Netfilter/iptables Rootkit HomePNA Private branch exchange Wireless mesh network Nintendo DS Voice over IP Files-11 Secure Shell File system General Packet Radio Service System/36 File Transfer Protocol Burglar alarm Internet protocol suite System/34 Differentiated services Skype Power line communication Java programming language
