what is voip and how is it used as said its voice over internet protocol it is basically a voice n w which is packet switched usually u knw the normal pots r circuit switched but while u want to implement provide land base ph cervice or voice service over data network ethernet dsl ip core etc then u need to make packets which will be routed and then terminated at designated point need to remember things the delay should be fixed amongst packet delivery the delay should be minimum voip is when we r using ipcore backbone to implement this packetized voice service it can be implemented as vodsl voice over dsl etc let us come to the topic again if we implement the voip then the cost will be reduced at large amount as existing data backbone will provide the larger and cheaper bandwidth the use of voip is ip telephony let me knw if u wanna knw anythin more whatever in details Voice over IP Asynchronous Transfer Mode IP Multimedia Subsystem Digital Subscriber Line Telephone Internet Ethernet Quality of service GSM services Frame relay Integrated Services Digital Network Broadband Internet access Skype Session Initiation Protocol Private branch exchange Routing Bluetooth Cable modem Packet switching Multiprotocol Label Switching Modem Internet protocol suite WiMAX General Packet Radio Service Computer History of the Internet Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Cisco Systems Internet Group Management Protocol Cable television AppleTalk IPv4 Differentiated services Packet H.323 Wi-Fi Communications protocol Enhanced 911 Power line communication Router 9-1-1 X.25 Telephone exchange Transport layer Network Switching Subsystem CPU design Serial communications Public Switched Telephone Network EIA-708 Triple play (telecommunications) Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ITU-T Computer network Mobile phone Network address translation Xerox Network Services Internet service provider OSI model PCI Express Amateur radio Federal Standard 1037C Denial-of-service attack Internet Protocol PowerPC Netfilter/iptables Telephone numbering plan USB flash drive Telegraphy IEEE 802.11 IPTV Internode CPU cache PARC Universal Packet Windows XP Wireless mesh network Peering Internet Relay Chat Central processing unit Protocol stack Telkom IAX ALOHAnet GPRS Core Network TCP Offload Engine Call centre Error correction and detection RISC Intelligent network
