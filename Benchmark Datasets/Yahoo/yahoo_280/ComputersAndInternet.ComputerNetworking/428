after you delete your history can it be retrieved from another computer in your network i was told today that our boss went into one of the computers that was part of our network and was able to retrieve the deleted history from all the computers is this possible you can restore deleted files you can format a hard drive and still get all the data back put them through a shredder program and they can never be recovered i don't think your boss would be good enough to restore deleted files but i supose that depends on where you work Backup File system Disk formatting Computer science NTFS Disk cloning Computer security Computer virus ITunes File Allocation Table Btrieve Shred Computer Plaintext Windows 2000 Macintosh Finder Virtual memory Data remanence Java programming language C programming language MDAC Common Unix Printing System Enterprise content management Linux Trusted computing Hard disk TiVo Malware Master Control Program Windows XP Filename extension Apple II family Library (computer science) Domain Name System Commodore DOS Computer forensics Computer storage MP3 Xerox Star Linked list ALGOL 68 Password Redundant array of independent disks Database File sharing WordStar Identity theft Bluetooth Internet Message Access Protocol Distributed file system Computer insecurity System/36 SQL Gmail Files-11 Inode Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Pretty Good Privacy Spyware Sed Freenet Computer file AmigaOS Megabyte Password cracking Flat file database Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Surveillance PNG Mouse (computing) Cache Digital photography History of the Internet Computer chess Final Fantasy (video game) Microsoft Jet Database Engine Embedded system ISO image Trojan horse (computing) Translation memory ZX Spectrum Hash table CPU cache Netfilter/iptables E-mail History of Microsoft Windows Web crawler JavaScript Windows Me Hacker Microsoft Windows System/34 Kazaa Bioinformatics HyperText Transfer Protocol Floppy disk Flash memory Metadata Digital audio player Expert system
