voip and qos i have comcast internet service using a motorola modem sb which connects to a linksys wrt g wireless g router i have voip service using a linksys spa r connected to port on the linksys router the router has qos settings that can be changed for better distribution of packets i have the voip device's mac address set to have highest priority and upstream bandwidth is set to auto however i still seem to get low qos when i run voip tests and i get choppy audio at times too can anyone help me with this ongoing saga any help is much appreciated you sound like you know what you are doing so i am going to assume that your wrt g is setup correctly to give top priority to your voip device i bet i have used almost the exact same equipment as you i would work the problem like this make sure you have the bandwidth to do voip go find a speed test and follow their instrutions and look at the numbers take the spa r out of the picture you may want to run it at different times during the day to see if something is happening out there and your bandwidth isn't what you think it is if you are not getting the speeds your cable company advertises then you could take this issue up to them make sure nothing else is using your bandwidth this could be computers tivo etc hogging your bandwidth the wrt g is wireless so make nobody else is on your network using your bandwidth yes i know you turned on packet prioritizing but these devices cost and the routers companies purchase cost many thousands of dollars i'm sure there are some differences take everything off your network including turning wireless off except the three devices up there and make a few phone calls to see if it improves try to packet prioritize on the port and not the mac plug the spa r into the fast port if you have the bandwidth and you still have problems then i have these suggestions work this through you voip provider chance of success probably very low you could switch to comcast voip they have a cable modem that includes the voip and an hour lithium battery for phone service when the power goes out i garuntee that packet prioritizing is much better when done here with this device you might can upgrade your speed cable and twisted pair a k a phone company offer different levels of high speed access you might need to upgrade from fast access to super fast access i'm sure prices will vary any of the above testing might give you a clue to replace a component above i would suspect the wrt g or the spa r before the cable modem IEEE 802.11 Skype IP Multimedia Subsystem Quality of service General Packet Radio Service Telephone Digital Subscriber Line Cisco Systems Asynchronous Transfer Mode GSM services Satellite internet Cable modem Private branch exchange Amateur radio Denial-of-service attack Nintendo DS Laptop Session Initiation Protocol Integrated Services Digital Network Power line communication Differentiated services USB flash drive Enhanced 911 Linux Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Internet Federal Standard 1037C Windows XP Transmission Control Protocol AppleTalk Internet service provider 9-1-1 Embedded system Television IPod Musical Instrument Digital Interface WiMAX Mobile phone Wireless LAN IPv6 PowerPC Apple Macintosh Serial communications Xbox 360 TiVo PlayStation 3 Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DOCSIS Game Boy Advance IMac Xbox Mac OS X Internet protocol suite Wireless access point RS-232 ITU-T Telkom Computer bus Telephone numbering plan Mach kernel Nintendo GameCube Atari ST X.25 Web crawler ZX Spectrum Lag Phreaking Hard disk ALOHAnet PlayStation 2 Frame relay Commodore 64 Supercomputer Routing Windows 2000 AT&T Computer Communications protocol HyperTransport CPU design CompuServe Nintendo Entertainment System Audiophile Call centre Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
