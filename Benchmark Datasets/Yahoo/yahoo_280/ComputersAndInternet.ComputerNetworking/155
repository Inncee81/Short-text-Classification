ics internet connection sharing host looses connectivity after using ics for a while the host computer looses connectivity the only solution to this so far is to disable and then enable the internet while keep the network between two computers alive any ideas i initially used ics then i realized it wasn't a good idea for several reasons my machine had to be up for my wife's machine to work i couldn't let it go into standby mode if my machine died i couldn't use hers to get help off the web like from yahoo answers the transfer rate to her machine was slo o o ow i eventually bit the bullet and bought a router for about the same as the second wireless adapter cost on my machine it's more headaches security wise but it's worth it so my answer to your question is to ditch ics and install a router wireless probably but not necessarily at least the second computer won't be at the mercy of the first's health and who knows it might fix the problem too Windows XP Wireless LAN USB flash drive Ethernet Serial communications PowerPC Voice over IP Universal Serial Bus Windows Server 2003 Router Internet protocol suite Internet Modem AppleTalk Transmission Control Protocol Telegraphy Bluetooth Atari 8-bit family Password E-mail WiMAX Apollo Guidance Computer Web crawler Broadband Internet access PlayStation Portable Floppy disk Digital Subscriber Line PlayStation 3 Central processing unit Computer virus Cisco Systems Asynchronous Transfer Mode Linux Secure Digital card MDAC Outsourcing Streaming media History of the Internet Wireless Application Protocol Mach kernel Incident Command System ARPANET Routing Domain Name System IEEE 802.11 Pretty Good Privacy Fax Embedded system File Transfer Protocol CPU design Windows 2000 Internet Group Management Protocol General Packet Radio Service Copy protection Novell NetWare Wireless access point Super Nintendo Entertainment System Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Xbox Spyware Java programming language Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol FireWire PHP Atari ST Seymour Cray Wardenclyffe Tower Internet Relay Chat Peer-to-peer ITU-T Distributed computing Internet Explorer AirPort Microeconomics Local area network $ale of the Century Border Gateway Protocol Algorithm Microsoft Windows PLATO MP3 Natural Selection (computer game) Acorn Computers Nintendo Laptop Mobile ad-hoc network Telephone Space Shuttle program Communications protocol
