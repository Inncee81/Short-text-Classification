need help with a wireless network question i hope there is a simple answer to my question i have a wireless router set up in my house connected to my main pc the wireless is used for my wife's work laptop which has a wireless card that is enabled i have a work laptop where the internal wireless card is disabled for security reasons in order to connect to my network at work i connect an ethernet cable to the back of the wireless router and directly to my work laptop this means i always have to be in my home office when using my work laptop is there a way for me to use my work laptop somewhere else in my house without being directly connected to the main wireless router is there a hub of some sort that will accept the wireless signal and allow me to connect my ethernet cable to the hub any help with this is greatly appreciated btw enabling the wireless card is not an option thanks you have a few options though some may not be recommended or may be locked down by your employer what you've described a wired device that picks up your wireless router's signal and allows you to connect to it using your ethernet connection is called a wireless ethernet bridge unfortunately most of them are just as expensive as a router but they will accomplish exactly what you want without requiring you to change anything on your laptop you will need to set the bridge up to work with your router though you can then bring the bridge around with you and plug it in wherever you want to work i got one from newegg for a voip phone i wanted to use in a room without an ethernet jack it gets the job done a more affordable option for you might be to buy an additional wireless adapter either usb or a pcmcia card for your laptop unfortunately you may need local administrative rights on your laptop in order to install the new hardware if you're not a local admin your best option is the wireless bridge it's also the least likely to be against company policy keep in mind it may be against your work's policy to ever allow your laptop on wireless networks secure or insecure please check the company rule books and always make sure you use wireless encryption especially when transferring confidential information cheers gl Universal Serial Bus Wireless LAN Windows XP Computer bus Cisco Systems Secure Digital card GSM services WiMAX Password MAC address Wireless access point USB flash drive PlayStation 3 PCI Express Cable television Laptop AirPort IBook IEEE 802.11 Xbox Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Xbox 360 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Router Verizon Wireless IPod PowerPC Nintendo Revolution FireWire HomePNA IMac Telephone Television Surveillance PlayStation 2 TIA-568A/B Embedded system Internet Apple Macintosh Skype NSA encryption systems 9-1-1 Local area network Nintendo DS Telegraphy Closed-circuit television Internet fraud IP Multimedia Subsystem Global System for Mobile Communications Federal Standard 1037C Mouse (computing) Transmission Control Protocol Desktop computer Mobile phone Internet Group Management Protocol PlayStation Portable Telephone tapping Copy protection Wardriving Wireless Computer networking device Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus IEEE 802.11i BlackBerry Enhanced 911 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Session Initiation Protocol OSI model SCSI CompactFlash Amateur radio Wireless mesh network Telephone exchange Asynchronous Transfer Mode One-time pad Virtual private network Category 5 cable Wi-Fi Protected Access Private branch exchange Power line communication ALOHAnet Computer network Wireless Application Protocol Computer surveillance Peripheral Component Interconnect
