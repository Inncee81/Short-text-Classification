hockey tryouts im really nervous about these tryouts any advice for a goalie to impress the coaches during tryouts so your going to be nervous like anyone if a few goals get passed you just think about stopping the next puck not the one that let in also if anyone cheers or thinks their goal was the best you know in your head you'll stop them next time don't let anybody get under your skin or try to mess you up show confidence and calmness in the net a calm goalie is miikka kiprusoft look at him hes so calm and forgets about the past try to do what he does but obviously not in the nhl also make sure you are not scared of the puck a scared goalie will never get what they'd like if your scared it means you don't want to stop the puck you want to see if fly pas you and thats a goal stay calm and cool don't be scared of players or the puck and try your best remember your angles to the player and make sure you know in the back of your head where the net is and always stay square to the shooter remember your challenges and how far you are out on the crease the right distance from the net depends on the shot as you'd probably know and if you have the right distance chances are the puck is going to hit you not the back of the net good luck in your tryouts d Goaltender Goal (ice hockey) Hockey rink Centre (ice hockey) Miracle on Ice Roller hockey Hockey puck Gerry Cheevers New York Rangers 2005-06 NHL season Los Angeles Kings Detroit Red Wings 1992-93 NHL season Jacques Plante Floorball New York Americans Ice Hockey (video game) Official (ice hockey) Goalkeeper Montreal Canadiens Lacrosse Doug Harvey Billy Smith San Jose Sharks Wayne Gretzky Pittsburgh Steelers Boston Bruins Winger (ice hockey) National Hockey League Peter Bondra Social rule Toronto Maple Leafs Water polo Qu__bec Nordiques Hartford Whalers Grant Fuhr National Hockey League All-Star Game Blitzball Overtime (ice hockey) Volleyball Glossary of American football Instant replay Rob Ramage Hockey stick Florida Panthers The Mighty Ducks (movies) Fast bowling Mark Messier Philadelphia Flyers Edmonton Oilers Field hockey Georges Vezina Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Roger Neilson Pavel Datsyuk Jokerit New York Knicks Miikka Kiprusoff The Contender (television series) The Mighty Ducks (animated series) Mario Lemieux Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup Satchel Paige St. Louis Blues (hockey) Press Your Luck Cleveland Browns Indoor soccer Ottawa Senators Baseball Peter Shilton Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) Dany Heatley Snooker Craps Doug Gilmour Bobby Hull Batting (cricket) Martin Gelinas Ken Daneyko Reservoir Dogs Rink hockey Phoenix Coyotes 1985-86 NHL season Michael Larson Columbus Blue Jackets Don Cherry (hockey) Sandy Koufax Colorado Avalanche Phil Esposito Art__rs Irbe Jeopardy!
