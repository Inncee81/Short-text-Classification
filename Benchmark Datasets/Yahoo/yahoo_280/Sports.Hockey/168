what should it take for me to become a nhl fan again ok i want people to understand where i'm coming from here up until the ' lockout i loved the nhl i still watch hockey at the junior a and high school level here and it's an awesome sport after the lockout i was pissed off as regardless of right or wrong they had two years to figure out how to split money between the owners and players without having to destroy an entire season to do it when jeremy roenick made the comment that all americans should kiss his ass regarding blame that moment turned me off right there since that day i have not watched the nhl on television or in person where i live we have an ahl franchise and i refuse to go to those games i love hockey don't get me wrong but when we've seen labor issues in the other three major sports i'm just fed up i want to be an nhl fan again but i'm still furious what should it take for me to become a fan again one thing for sure another lockout can't happen the best way is to ease yourself into going back to the games go to the game with an open mind as though you are discovering hockey for the first time a perfect example would be my feelings after the last baseball strike in i was upset that the clowns who run baseball cancelled the world series a contest the montreal expos would have won in seven games over the cleveland indians i was even angrier that it was all about money i was at the time and swore up and down that i would never go to another baseball game then one afternoon in my mom had the day off from work i was having a bad day myself so to cheer me up she picked me up from school and drove me to tiger stadium which is a hour away from my home with her help she was able to get me watching baseball again initially i didn't want to even walk in the ballpark but after picking up a few baseball items and realizing that this was one of the coolest things my mom ever did for me i was okay over time i would go to more games then i was fully following baseball again trust me when i say this you will enjoy the nhl again there is so much you're missing out on just ease into being a nhl fan again you will not regret it Major League Baseball National Hockey League Montreal Canadiens World Series Playoff Stanley Cup International League Chicago Blackhawks Wayne Gretzky Ty Cobb Sports timeline Boston Bruins Toronto Maple Leafs Babe Ruth 1994 baseball strike National Hockey League All-Star Game Ice hockey Salary cap Los Angeles Kings Reggie Jackson Detroit Tigers Detroit Red Wings National Football League Edmonton Oilers New York Islanders Ottawa Senators Pittsburgh Pirates New York Americans Pittsburgh Penguins Washington Nationals Seattle Mariners Tampa Bay Lightning Vancouver Canucks Major professional sports league Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Toronto Blue Jays St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers Satchel Paige Calgary Flames Tris Speaker New York Mets Washington Capitals Shaggy dog story Hamilton Tigers Montr__al Expos Western Canada Hockey League NHL series Japanese baseball MLB on NBC Springfield Indians Negro league baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game 1992-93 NHL season Baltimore Orioles Texas Rangers (baseball) San Diego Padres 2003-04 NHL season Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL) Dallas Stars Playoff format Florida Marlins Philadelphia Phillies Carolina Hurricanes National Hockey League rivalries September 2004 in sports Cincinnati Reds Los Angeles Clippers San Jose Sharks 1919 World Series American Football League Hank Aaron New York Rangers MLB on FOX Troy Glaus November 2004 in sports 1981 baseball strike Qu__bec Nordiques Maurice Richard August 2005 in sports Mighty Ducks of Anaheim
