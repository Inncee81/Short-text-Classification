norton anti virus morning so i finally broke down and bought this since my son is always on the computer and we seem to be very slow lately dang runescape anyways i installed it the other day and it seems fine it will pop up that certain things need my attention so when i click on these things they have a low risk now my question is there are options of what i should do ignore fix exclude what do i do what do each of these commands do if i click on them i just feel like its not really doing anything maybe it is but i've never had this or any antivirus protector before so i am at a loss please help thanks keep in mind i am pretty illiterate when it comes to computers i'd first follow the software's recommendation and always make it 'fix' things even if they have low risk given the choice you should always err on the side of caution and remove or fix the problem i say this because this type of software is not foolproof and it may incorrectly categorize something as low risk when it's really not Anti-virus software Computer virus Computer security Prostate cancer Windows XP Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape RuneScape cheats Spyware Stopping e-mail abuse Internet security Extreme Programming Software testing Weight training Pneumonia Folic acid Floppy disk Mouse (computing) USB flash drive RuneScape Random Events Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RuneScape weapons Theory of conduct Poker jargon Filename extension IPod MMORPG Cytomegalovirus Opera (web browser) Virtual memory Debugging RuneScape skills Rootkit Software bug Malware Mozilla Firefox Blue screen of death NX bit Autism Microeconomics Year 2000 problem Betting (poker) Pretty Good Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Anorexia nervosa Macromedia Flash Mutual fund Trojan horse (computing) Apostrophe (mark) Hard disk Norton AntiVirus Knoppix Computer surveillance Sexual orientation Digital photography Laptop Lung cancer Internet fraud Dieting Computer and video game genres Unicode VHF omnidirectional range Patch (computing) Surveillance Password Cascading Style Sheets Symantec Software engineering Gmail Microsoft Windows Copy protection RuneScape economy Atkins Nutritional Approach Windows Vista RuneScape quests Computer role-playing game Prank flash AmigaOS LiveJournal Drawing StarCraft Secret Missions Dialer Common Unix Printing System Anti-aircraft warfare Undergrads Haloalkane Conscience Risk management Cancer Debt Food and Drug Administration Antiretroviral drug Expert system Atari 8-bit family Linux Intellectual property Hypoglycemia Trusted computing Nuclear power
