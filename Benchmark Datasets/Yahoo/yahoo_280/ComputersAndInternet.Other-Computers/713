computer problems i have a computer that has been giving me some problems i think i might have a virus but i don't know my computer keeps telling me that there is no room even though i have the bare minimum on the hd i don't have any games i've removed all the neccesary programs through the control panel i did have an anti virus program but it was giving us errors and i did what the tech support said which was to unistall and reinstall however when i went to reinstall the software the computer told me i didn't have enough room there is something going on with our computer the percentage of space keeps decreasing over time even though nothing has been added does anyone have any advice to help this could be a number of things i don't know how experienced you are so i'll keep this basic and stick to only a few troubleshooting items before getting intro troubleshooting make sure your anti virus program is installing into the correct hard drive usually c if so go on first verify your free space open up my computer and look under hard disk drives look at the total space and free space for all the drives the c drive most likely the main one so that's the important one if it shows only a couple of gb or even worst any amount in mb in free space then you're out of space try cleaning up your hard drive by running disk cleanup start programs accessories system tools disk cleanup alternatively download ccleaner which cleans up more files see sources check your free space again if that doesn't help try looking around your hard drive to see what's taking up so much space windirstat is a utility that can help you figure that out see sources mp s and movies are the most common files if that doesn't help download and install avg a free yet good program see sources or go to the symantec website and run a free virus scan see sources if no viruses are found and you still have problems short of a long list of troubleshooting steps you may need to format your hard drive and reinstall if your hard drive though shows a lot of gb in free space try downloading or copying over a huge file or several files that you know are safe alternatively try installing another program that you need such as ms office if that doesn't work either your hard drive may be corrupted whereby it shows free space but it is unusable you may need to format your hard drive and reinstall everything if copying files or installing other programs works then the problem may be the anti virus program you're trying to install once you figure it out you'll want to make sure you have an anti virus program such as avg and a firewall either the one in windows xp or download the free version of zonealarm running at all times you'll also want to set your recycle been space and system restore space closer to gb or less finally set your ie cache space to about mb Jet engine Axial compressor Two-stroke cycle Gas compressor Vacuum cleaner Turbocharger Four-stroke cycle Pneumatics Ramjet SR-71 Blackbird Supercharger Vacuum Trumpet Air conditioning Pratt & Whitney J58 Fan (implement) Pulse jet engine Liquid air cycle engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Blow molding Insulation Wind Nuclear explosion Compressibility Blown flap Turbofan Dymaxion house Fireworks Turbojet Model aircraft Haloalkane Water organ Movie projector Santa Ana wind John Bull (locomotive) Stirling engine Jackhammer Propeller Concrete Miller cycle Energy development Laundry Dodge Neon Professional wrestling slang Convection Aerodynamics Torpedo Mattress Aircraft Humidifier Ice core Air brake (rail) Diesel engine Carl von Linde Lift (force) Internal combustion engine Sound Rifle Threshing machine Fume hood Data compression Keg Sex toy Combine harvester Air gun Solar power Carburetor Bong Gunpowder Plot Ground effect The Wack Pack Air purifier Hadley cell Gas turbine CPU cooling Bypass ratio Grateful Dead Silage Adiabatic process Compression ratio Motorcycle SpongeBob SquarePants Buoyancy Baby bottle Rolls-Royce Trent Type 93 torpedo Circuit breaker Engine knocking Black tea Sonic boom Natural gas Diesel cycle OLN Explosively pumped flux compression generator Oxyacetylene Lossy data compression Scuba diving Airbrush Brayton cycle Diving air compressor
