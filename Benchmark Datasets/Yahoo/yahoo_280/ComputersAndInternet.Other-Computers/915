dv file won't play correctly on pc i have about a mb dv movie that was created on a mac and plays perfectly on a mac however it will not play properly on my pc in quicktime about seconds will play until the video stops but even those seconds are very very poor quality i tried it in vlc and the quality is fine there but the video stops after about seconds and i cannot fast forward or anything either is my pc just a piece of junk and cannot handle the file size or format or is there something i am doing incorrectly would converting the file to another format if so are there any free programs any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thanks there is a misunderstanding by many users that think video is video when in fact there are upwards of formats that a video can be produced with now comes the good part most mac's come with the ability to make copys of dvd's that unfortunatly are many times mac specific the reason is the software that is used roxio's toast gives different settings that will allow the user to choose how it is burnt and will give the options for pc only for mac only for pc or mac so as you can see there are several things that can affect your ability to play anything that might have been burned on either pc or mac http www videohelp com dvd above is a link that is a little long but goes indepth as to the differences in the formats available and the confusion that can also accompany burning dvd's my suggestion is to purchase a good software that will enable you to read the options available to burn so that it can be read by pc or mac next another problem could be the media you have this project or movie on dvd media s very greatly in quality and format as well herein lies another issue many users presume that they can just go out and purchase any of the cheapest dvd because it is on sale it may be the media that it was burned on dvd r media is the most widely used and recognized media used as well dvd r media can be played on just about any player or computer whereas if one of the other formats may not be able to play on anything you have especially if r or dl media was used always use the highest quality media and software to be able to read it and write it on anything you might own don Windows XP Spyware Firewall (networking) Malware HTTP cookie Mouse (computing) Uniform Resource Locator Mozilla Firefox Stopping e-mail abuse File Transfer Protocol Proxy server Internet Explorer Pop-up ad Web browser AOL Instant Messenger Comparison of web browsers Cascading Style Sheets Voice over IP Domain Name System Internet security Google Desktop Netscape Communications Corporation Phishing America Online Opera (web browser) Web design Internet fraud Internet Mozilla Application Suite Java programming language Knoppix RuneScape cheats E-mail spam Screenshot Computer security Common Unix Printing System Trusted computing Visual Basic International Phonetic Alphabet Linux Universal Plug and Play Mac OS X Unicode and HTML BitTorrent Skype Internet forum Netfilter/iptables Mandriva Linux MSN Messenger XML Password Cross site scripting OpenBSD Rootkit Trojan horse (computing) Gmail Windows Server 2003 Embedded system Common criticisms of Microsoft Control Panel (Windows) Server Hyperlink World Wide Web Wiki Web application Buffer overflow Web page Tabbed document interface PNG Danger Hiptop Web crawler Network address translation Instant messaging HyperCard Web service User agent Linux distribution CPU cache Ajax (programming) Google Windows 2000 Peer-to-peer Spam (electronic) Netscape Hotmail HTML element PlayStation Portable AmigaOS
