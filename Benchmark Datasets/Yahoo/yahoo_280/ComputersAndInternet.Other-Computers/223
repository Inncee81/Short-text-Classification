how does an ip address travel from one place to another i had tracked an ip address from a threatening email that i had recieved to a cox communications host that was in san mateo ca at one point and than an hour later it was showing it in eureka ca which as some know are not close cities now my only confusion is that cox does not provide any wireless services that i know of i have figured out that this place might be a business and most businesses run off of servers that should not travel via satellite why would a business server hit one satellite and than another so far away in such little time please help as i am very confused and would like to rest easy thanks an ip address is assigned to an organization for their use generally they are quite static when used by high speed connections but they can be dynamic when used by dialup in general without the assistance of the party who is responsible for teh ip address cox in your case you cannot pinpoint with any accuracy the location of the current user IP address Internet service provider Global Positioning System Transmission Control Protocol Broadband Internet access Internet protocol suite Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Domain Name System E-mail Voice over IP Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Proxy server Web crawler Server Whois Federal Standard 1037C National Weather Service IP Multimedia Subsystem Windows 2000 Blog X Window System Dial-up access Telephone numbering plan Denial-of-service attack Satellite internet Enterprise content management Stopping e-mail abuse America Online Wi-Fi Web hosting Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Information Technology Infrastructure Library Data retention Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Windows Server 2003 Bay Area Rapid Transit Mouse (computing) Password Web analytics BitTorrent Cable television Fast bowling Geographic information system AppleTalk JavaServer Pages 9-1-1 Internet Group Management Protocol Web server Secure Shell Network address translation Internet privacy Novell NetWare Usenet Universal Plug and Play Mach kernel Bluetooth CPU cache Internet Telegraphy Prodigy (ISP) Website CPU design World Wide Web Mac OS X Redundant array of independent disks Communications satellite Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line E-mail spam Trademark CompuServe Domain name Caltrain Radio USB flash drive Distributed computing Internet Relay Chat Architecture of Windows 2000 Pretty Good Privacy Direct Client-to-Client MAC address Unified Modeling Language Windows XP VMware Modem Jabber Speech recognition Musical Instrument Digital Interface MySQL Peer-to-peer Quake Sinclair ZX81 Kernel (computer science) Pok__mon Abilities Hotmail WebObjects Hard disk BlackBerry GunZ The Duel
