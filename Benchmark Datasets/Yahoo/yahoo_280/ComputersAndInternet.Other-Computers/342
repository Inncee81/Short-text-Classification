my computer is giving me and error message stating windows system error there is an ip address conflict with another system on the network what does that mean is someone on my wireless network if so how do i boot them off yes i would say so a clumsy one too here are the steps to take from a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable only log into your router's admin pages from your browser find the page that controls wireless access to the admin pages and deactivate it make it so someone has to be sitting next to the router with a computer and an ethernet cable connecting them to control it find the page in the router's admin pages that defines the ssid essentially the network name turn off ssid broadcasting so the router doesn't announce it to the world you're not running a hotspot and all your machines should know the ssid change it you'll have to change it in all your machines also so it's not using the default for your router find out how to install a network wep or wpa key not a login password for your router do so and set it up there and on all your machines i suggest copying and pasting it there may be four into a notepad or wordpad document so you can accurately copy and paste it to your machines that should throw the interlopers off and keep them from coming back good luck Microsoft PowerPoint Microsoft Office Macromedia Flash MSN Messenger Slideshow Windows Mobile Computer and video games Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible OpenOffice.org HyperCard ILife Microsoft Google Desktop Presentation program Xerox Star Machinima CP/M Linux Windows XP ZX Spectrum Mac OS X IPod Apple Macintosh Computer virus Icon (computing) Personal computer Blue screen of death Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Buffer overflow Palm OS History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer MP3 PlayStation Portable Peer-to-peer Mach kernel Film Emacs Computer AmigaOS Commodore 128 PC Engine Perl Library (computer science) TRS-80 64-bit ASCII art ITunes Microsoft Excel Game programming MSX Debugging QuickTime Booting Lotus 1-2-3 Screenshot Editor Synthesizer Commodore 64 Function key Virtual memory Operating system AOL Instant Messenger Ada programming language Skype Common Unix Printing System Game programmer BASIC programming language Spyware Amstrad CPC Need for Speed NX bit Windows registry Domain Name System TeX Patch (computing) RISC Windows Server 2003 Stardock Amiga X Window System Programming language OpenBSD Forth programming language Visual Basic X86 MDAC Text editor OS/2 Pocket PC Windows 3.x Wine (software) SAS System Fritz-chip
