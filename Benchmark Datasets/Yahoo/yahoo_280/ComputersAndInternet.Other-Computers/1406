yahoo and myspace question plz help no i had tht too peoples i had an email about a year ago i have a new one now but i always wondered what happened to it i could log on to it or my email and i didnt have an alternet email but is there any way to log on to my email and old myspace cuz id really like too see how people have talked to me thx if you have all the correct account info you might be able to contact yahoo by fax or phone and have your email password reset but good luck with that sites with free services seem to provide little to no customer service other than that if you don't have your myspace password or the password to the email account associated with it and there was no alternative email associated with the email account then you're pretty much out of luck if its been months since your last login your yahoo account has already been deactivated and will eventually be terminated i'm not sure what myspaces policy is on inactive accounts but i'm almost positive theres no way to get a password without access to the associated email account DVD Television SCART Laptop Xbox S-Video Amstrad CPC IPod Computer and video games Personal computer Nintendo GameCube ATI Technologies Desktop computer IBM PC compatible Atari ST PC Engine Wheel of Fortune RCA connector Secure Digital card IBM PC Atari 8-bit family Headphones Computer hardware PlayStation 2 Xbox 360 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Laserdisc Composite video Modem Copy protection CompactFlash Game Boy Amiga Hard disk Nintendo Entertainment System Radeon Home cinema Sega Dreamcast Computer Jack plug Component video High-definition television S__CAM Regional lockout Sega Saturn SAM Coup__ Commodore International Karaoke Game Boy Advance SP Slot machine Cyrix Pornography IBook Family Guy Video CD Windows Vista CD-ROM PlayStation 3 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital rights management MPEG-2 Sega CD Apple Macintosh Bluetooth Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple Computer Mac OS X $ale of the Century Compact disc Movie projector Commodore 64 Emacs DualDisc Lighting Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Game Boy Advance Apple IIGS TRS-80 VAIO Widescreen Floppy disk Our Gang Apple II family Anamorphic widescreen Pok__mon (anime) Power Macintosh G3 CD recorder Sega Spider-Man (games) VHS RISC MP3 Yu-Gi-Oh!
