what exactly is the processor speed can someone explain to me what it does im thinking of buying a very cheap second hand laptop with only mhz speed ill really only use it for word processing and maybe some net searching what do you think it will be very slow basically the speed means how many operations a cpu can perform in a second eg mhz means it would process million cycles per second try and find a laptop at least more than ghz even this is slow by todays standards hth Pentium 4 PowerPC Pentium M Laptop Apple Macintosh Athlon Central processing unit RISC Pentium III Supercomputer CDC 6600 Clock rate Celeron Pentium PowerPC G4 Oscilloscope PowerBook AMD PlayStation 3 Athlon 64 Overclocking IBM PC compatible Computer Itanium 2 Hard disk Xeon Xbox 360 CPU design IBM PC Timeline of computing 1990-forward ZigBee VIA C3 Pentium D VIA Technologies ATI Technologies FLOPS Atari ST Opteron Wi-Fi Pentium II Front side bus IEEE 802.11 IBook Amateur radio Cray-1 Vector processor Bluetooth Computer architecture Cyrix IMac Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Color Computer ZX Spectrum MIM-23 Hawk Microprocessor Microprogram Thread (computer science) Stream processing CPU electrical consumption Software-defined radio PowerBook G4 Duron Radeon PC motherboard Atari 2600 Cell (microprocessor) NVIDIA PlayStation 2 ILLIAC IV Personal computer EMac MOS Technology 6502 INMOS Transputer PR rating History of computing hardware (1960s-present) MIPS architecture Power Macintosh G3 Data General Nova Emulator Coprocessor Mach kernel Apple Intel transition TI-83 series MSX Superscalar MOS Technology Commodore International Mac OS X USB flash drive Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Linked list Motorola 68000 SIMD Acorn Electron BBC Micro ARM architecture Sound Blaster
