i have the free limewire site but have been told that bittorrent i better i dont know how to get the bit torrent site does anyone know is it free and can i download music and movies this is the guide to begin with i think bittorrent is better by far and it certainly is free you can also download practically anything be it movies music games or software e t c the advantage of using torrent for example to download music is that you dont waste time finding single songs you simply get the whole album to use the torrent system you firstly need to install a client on your computer a free piece of software that you use to download your stuff here are a few popular clients bitorrent bitlord bitcomet and utorrent bittorrent is the official one but i found that it didnt achieve as faster speeds as i could get utorrent is a small client but that never worked for me either the pick of the bunch is really bitlord or bitcomet personally i favour bitcomet now as the former gave up catastrophically the other day now you need some websites to get torrents good ones include demonoid com torrentspy com the piratebay or isohunt e t c you search for what you want on one of those and it will give you the option to download it as a small torrent file do this and save it on your computer then simply open your client and then open that file with your client the torrent should begin downloading hope that works good luck Spyware Malware Windows XP Kazaa Computer virus Windows 2000 Anti-virus software Stopping e-mail abuse Phishing HyperText Transfer Protocol Denial-of-service attack Rootkit Adware Common Unix Printing System Windows registry Btrieve Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Hello world program Spam (electronic) AOL Instant Messenger Microsoft Windows Filename extension MegaMan Battle Network Internet security COM file NPAPI AmigaOS Grokster Spybot - Search & Destroy Web server Internet fraud Windows API Proxy server Files-11 Trusted computing Windows 3.x Warez System 7 (Macintosh) Apple Macintosh MediaMax CD-3 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Atari 8-bit family Mydoom Password Pop-up ad Comparison of web browsers Typosquatting World Wide Web Microsoft AntiSpyware MSN Messenger Ebook National Oceanographic Data Center HTML element Host file Dialer Apple IIGS Cross site scripting Cascading Style Sheets Computer insecurity Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Computer file HTTP cookie Domain Name System Peer-to-peer Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Laptop Component Object Model Surveillance Internet privacy Virtual hosting Network address translation Microsoft .NET Portable Document Format Macromedia Flash Copy protection Screenshot CoolWebSearch Computer surveillance Windows Vista Digital audio broadcasting History of the Internet Bash Linspire Slash (punctuation) Opera (web browser) Web crawler Ajax (programming) Fritz-chip Yahoo!
