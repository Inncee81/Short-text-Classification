how does light beems transfer data an electrical signal activates a light emitting diode led the light signal is transmitted along a fiber optic cable which works on the theory of total internal reflection light that is transmitted is picked up at a light absorbing diode which generates an electrical signal when it is subjected to certain frequencies of light the new electric signal does what all electrical signals do best it is interpreted from the light transmission much like a morse code but as s and s currently only fiber optic cables use light to transmit process data in the future it may become the case that computers come with fiber optical processing very science fictional at the moment however laser communication is also possible but not widely used as it works very much on the same principles of microwaves both light and micro waves and even radio waves they are all transverse wave types and hence it was just a matter of time before we developed the idea for visible light we use microwaves and radiowaves instead because their higher frequency band while being invisible to human optics can transmit a signal much further without breakup so besides fiber optics you can also send a light based transmission wirelessly via laser the military developed laser comms as a means of keeping communication established even when the enemy had jammed conventional radio and microwave transmissions Monopoly (game) Live 8 World Wide Web Computer virus CPU cache Daylight saving time Gmail Domain Name System Poker jargon Internet fraud Ron Weasley Theory of conduct Ra (board game) Auction Charmed Legal research Advance fee fraud FoxTrot RuneScape cheats Collision detection United States Postal Service Atomic Kitten Neopets RuneScape economy Columbine High School massacre Outsourcing Computer security The Sims 2 Surveillance Microsoft The Hobbit Phoebe Halliwell Flintheart Glomgold The Amazing Race Oh My Goddess!
