about my broadband ive done a test and my download speed is kbps and upload is kbps what is this in english terms and is it good or bad good or bad is relative to several things what your service provider indicates your maximum download speed is and the same for upload if you don't know that just contact them and they will be happy to give you that information if the actual speed you are getting is significantly less than the maximum your provider gives for your subscription it generally is the quality of your connection i e in house phone line wiring coax or whatever it is that connects you to and through your service provider the distance you are from their substation and or how busy that dsl or cable line is with other essentially simultaneous uses it also could be a setup problem with your computer if that's the case and you're not comfortable with making os adjustments get a program like optimize from pcpitstop input what your service provider gives you as the maximum download speed the type of broadband connection you have and let 'er rip you'll be optimized very quickly and correctly btw this program is specifically for optimizing internet connection speed and it's inexpensive it not only gives you your actual download speed everytime it's run but also optimizes os registry settings and cleans out cached information you no longer need from the speeds you mention it appears you are on cable broadband but there are some dsl services operating close to that speed too it appears to me at first glance that you have a very fast connection my dsl here in arkansas runs at kbps download and that's darn quick for out in the country hope that helps chuck p s upload speed is always significantly less than download so concentrate on optimizing download speed upload will follow suit Warez Web crawler Spyware ITunes Internet service provider Broadband Internet access Base pair Kazaa File sharing Commodore 64 General relativity BitTorrent Kepler's laws of planetary motion Dot-com Read-only memory Oscilloscope Computer IEEE 802.11 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Computer virus Voice over IP PowerPC Information Age Dial-up access Faster-than-light Computer network General Packet Radio Service Internet Visual Basic Cyberspace Peer-to-peer Modem Skype Special relativity SubSpace (computer game) Power line communication Comparison of latency and throughput Cache Cheating in Counter-Strike MAME Web accelerator Dot matrix printer Radeon Cable television Uploading and downloading Internet Message Access Protocol Redundant array of independent disks Apple Macintosh Gnutella Volleyball Satellite internet Mac OS X SETI Warp drive Ethernet Energy Firewall (networking) Windows XP Morse Code Distributed computing MOS Technology 6502 Particle accelerator Quake III Arena Bulletin board system Computer and video games ZX Spectrum Central processing unit Inmarsat Planetary orbit Abandonware EMule Nintendo Revolution Supercomputer Japanese copyright law Internet protocol suite Logo programming language Now Broadband TV Dialer Mach kernel Coriolis effect Synchrotron radiation Digital photography Microsoft .NET Drifting (motorsport) PlayStation 3 IP Multimedia Subsystem Linux TCP Offload Engine Chess Jet engine Mario Kart 64 PlayStation Portable Difference between sub-orbital and orbital spaceflights Overclocking Internet Explorer First-sale doctrine Violin Field-programmable gate array
