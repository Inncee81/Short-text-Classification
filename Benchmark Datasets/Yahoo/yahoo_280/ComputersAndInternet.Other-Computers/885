when you use a proxy site to register to a site can the site still get your ip address because i used a proxy site to do the registration on the main site but i had to go into my emails to send a reply which i couldn't use the proxy site there so once i send the reply does it get my real ip address or what or does it still hide my real address because i think once you reply with your normal ip address they get your real ip address not the one supplied by a proxy server my hubby says no Kazaa Mozilla Application Suite Macromedia Flash Computer virus Rootkit Domain Name System Opera (web browser) User agent Windows 2000 World Wide Web HTTP cookie Web browser Comparison of web browsers Blue screen of death AOL Instant Messenger Microsoft Windows NPAPI Stopping e-mail abuse Spybot - Search & Destroy Netscape Communications Corporation Ajax (programming) Internationalized domain name Linux Mac OS X Spam (electronic) Java programming language Adware Phishing RuneScape cheats X Window System NX bit Netscape Navigator USB flash drive PHP Trojan horse (computing) HyperCard Pop-up ad CPU cache Mozilla Thunderbird Netscape Browser Forth programming language Cascading Style Sheets Internet security BitTorrent Windows registry MDAC MSN Messenger Timeline of computing 1990-forward Windows Installer Cross site scripting Computer security Internet Typosquatting Kernel (computer science) Open Directory Project Konqueror OS/2 Mandriva Linux Operating system Wget Mouse (computing) New.net Hello world program Common criticisms of Microsoft Netscape Screenshot Python programming language Windows 3.x Greasemonkey Web page Perl Microsoft Office E-mail spam Library (computer science) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Uniform Resource Locator Unix IBM PC compatible OpenBSD Proxy server International Phonetic Alphabet CPAN Unicode and HTML
