leopard os x is the leopard os x system worth getting as soon as it comes out i know when every new windows os comes out a lot of people wait because there are normally a lot of problems to fix as a general rule is this the same case for new mac os's should i get tiger for now and later upgrade to leopard the main reason i want leopard is for time machine and boot camp is automatically bundled with it from what i've read leopard seems to be more like update rather than a new os altogether would this be why people are saying the transition will be easier i'm looking to get this thing before september that would mean for me to get the tiger os if i did this rather than waitied what would the approximate cost be for upgrading to leopard when it comes out even the mac os's require patches from time to time i'll admit that when apple went from panther to tiger it wasn't a big pain at all but realize that these new os's to to etc aren't true revampings of the os windows to xp or xp to vista were huge reconstructions of the os and thus had many problems in the interum if you remember when apple went from os to os x there were big big problems with the os that took over a year to iron out so this upgrade to leopard won't have that many problems but you'll still get an os update every couple months although time machine is a neat concept there are programs out there that already do that for you though i haven't had the chance to test out time machine also boot camp is available free on apple's website the only reason i see to get leopard now is that you don't have to buy os's Macromedia Flash Multimedia Streaming media QuickTime H.264/MPEG-4 AVC PlayStation Portable Data compression DVD ITU-T Enterprise content management Windows 3.x Disk magazine Ogg Vorbis Multimedia literacy HyperCard Multimedia Messaging System Mac OS X Windows Vista Authorware XML File format IBM PC compatible OS/2 Mass media Peer-to-peer RSS (file format) Portable Document Format Musical Instrument Digital Interface Iriver MIME Theora Podcasting Flash memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Microsoft Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG-4 Internet phenomenon Comparison of web browsers Internet pornography Web browser MP3 Synchronization Deep web Digital photography Graphics DivX Mac OS X v10.4 Screenshot Marching band Thomson SA Archos Computer Webcomic Semantic Web Web design Text editor Digital audio player Vlog Steganography Wikimedia Commons Morse Code Secure Digital card Interchange File Format Matroska MSN Messenger Sega Dreamcast MPlayer Digital television AMD Computer and video games History of Microsoft Windows PNG Blog AVI Markup language Cascading Style Sheets JavaScript Prank flash Computer-assisted language learning Xbox Media Center Scalable Vector Graphics Universal Serial Bus Macromedia Shockwave Spider-Man (games) Disc jockey Lossy data compression Vector graphics Greek language Hyperlink XMMS Multimedia Card Trusted computing Microsoft PowerPoint Television Mouse (computing) Macromedia
