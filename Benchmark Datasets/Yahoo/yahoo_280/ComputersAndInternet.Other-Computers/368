new laptop windows vista who's changing my files i have a a folder called 'recently changed' and it lists loads of files that have recently been changed most of them are photos that i have edited but some are music files type windows media player i have not used windows media player i do not listen to music on my computer and i do not recognise any of the songs so my question is this is someone else getting into my computer and tampering with things or is it something simple and less sinister that i haven't thought of thanks in advance windows vista is gd and sometimes can change the formats slightly when it upgraded daily so some of the song formats might change even though u haven't touched them and when this happens it will be listed in the recently changed file however this does not always happen Computer Computer chess Artificial intelligence Chess Turing machine ELO rating system Fischer Random Chess Artificial consciousness Digital circuit Expert system CPU design Computer Go Turing test Central processing unit Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Mathematics Data mining Game theory History of computing hardware Fermi paradox Intelligence (trait) W.
