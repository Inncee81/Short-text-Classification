which is better memory sticks or cds i want to make copies of my excel spreadsheet files and my word files firstly to free up space on my hard drive secondly so that i will have a backup if my computer crashes and thirdly so that i will be able to access the files from both my office laptop and my office desktop are there any relative advantages disadvantages of memory sticks and cds i hope this is not a stupid question but i have never used either honestly the best thing to do is this first off email yourself the file usually they aernt that big and if you are with yahoo you have unlimited space best to save second sticks are good but can be lost and if they short out or become damaged they are useless cd's are great for storage but if you are going to update alot then it's a pain as it's more for a final project they can be scratched but usually people put them in a case and are done with it and thirdly to answer your thirdly part if you do email them to yourself and have internet access you are set i do that to my files and then file them in my yahoo i save them on my computer stick aswell if i want to transfer them to a computer that doesnt have the internet like work computer etc NTLDR Preboot Execution Environment Booting AmigaOS GRand Unified Bootloader Windows 2000 LiveCD Mac OS X v10.4 IPod SYSLINUX Menu (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Classic (Mac OS X) Windows XP MS-DOS BIOS Partition (computing) Dual boot Boot image PlayStation Portable Desktop computer Mac OS history Macintosh Finder Context menu Knoppix Stardock Microsoft Windows Windows 95 Atari 8-bit family Computer virus History of the graphical user interface Modchip Boot image control File system Linux Pie menu RISC OS Boot Thin client Nintendo DS GNOME FreeDOS Bootstrapping Xerox Alto Windows registry MacWrite Anachronox WIMP (computing) Computer program Game Boy Player Power-On Self Test Malware Colossal Cave Adventure Widget (computing) Common User Access Puppy Linux File Allocation Table Boots Group Screenshot Launchd Personal computer Lotus 1-2-3 BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Upper Memory Area IA-64 HFS Plus C64 Direct-to-TV Disk cloning USB flash drive X86 DOS Comparison Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Windows Server 2003 University of Utah Hard disk Graphical user interface MIPS architecture SAM Coup__ Wellington boot Extensible Firmware Interface Filename extension Forth programming language FVWM RAM disk Mac OS 9 Nonvolatile BIOS memory Hercules emulator Sampler (musical instrument) Hierarchical File System Mouse (computing) Footwear Net Yaroze OpenVMS Disk image Apple Computer (c)Brain Snowboard Computer keyboard GURPS IA-32
