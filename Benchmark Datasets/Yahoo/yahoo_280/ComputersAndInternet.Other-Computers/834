yeah im having real trouble trying to get videos on to my pc from my jvc hard disk camcorder how do i do it also ive done it once and got the files on my pc but i cant put them on youtube in says theres no film there help plz what model if it is hd you may be having difficulty because of the format of the files a program like nero will allow you to play and convert various file formats like avchd typical to a hd camcorder if you don't own nero here is the procedure in a nutshell for coping files from an camcorder connect the camera to the computer using the usb cable provided by the manufacturer select the option in the menu on the camera to connect to the computer this may be called copy files or one of many different things depending on your model use windows explorer if on a pc and look for a new device it will look just like an external hard drive or thumb drive copy the files using windows explorer what you can do once you copy those files will be limited to the software you have on your computer if you plan to upload files to youtube you'll need a tool to convert to one of these formats wmv avi mov or mpg if your camera doesn't store them in those formats already also some cameras allow you to copy files to an sd card usually the camera will convert to mpg or mpeg automatically when copying to the sd memory you can then put the sd card on your pc if you have a sd reader and access it using windows explorer if you are just learning you'll benefit from a program like nero as it will make things much easier for you Computer virus Anti-virus software Malware Spyware Windows XP HyperText Transfer Protocol Filename extension Trojan horse (computing) E-mail spam Windows Me Stopping e-mail abuse Ajax (programming) Virus Bluetooth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mozilla Firefox Computer insecurity World Wide Web Mydoom The Matrix Online Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Windows Cross site scripting Blue screen of death Trusted computing Resident Evil Outbreak Spam (electronic) Kazaa Gmail Website Web crawler Computer security Wiki Representational State Transfer Ada programming language Antibody Linked list Peer-to-peer Web server AIDS Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 John Sheppard (Stargate) Windows 2000 Morpheus (The Matrix) Wget Antiviral drug Cytomegalovirus ReBoot Internet security Enterprise content management Resident Evil (film) HTTP cookie Foodborne illness Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms Intrusion-detection system Mozilla Application Suite Thin client SQL Files-11 C plus plus JavaScript Epstein-Barr virus Expert system Copyleft Rabies Everything2 Hacker (computer security) Pneumonia PaX P53 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Software bug Cascading Style Sheets ILOVEYOU Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Proxy server Global Positioning System Denial-of-service attack Anti-aircraft warfare Unicode and HTML Diseases of the honeybee Steam (content delivery) Computer surveillance Titration Deus ex machina Mutation Medicine Gene therapy Forth programming language HyperCard H5N1 Computer worm James D.
