cant log into computer profile i have windows xp and when i went to log into my account profile it said it cant log in due to corrupt or missing files and logged me into a temp account instead is there any way i can fix this i dont want to lose everything on my account although even more important i dont want to lose my entire laptop help please i know i should back things up i just suck at actually remembering too would doing a restore date maybe a week ago or more possibly work or should i even try it i am trying what was already suggested to me though maybe because it redirected me here from the admin account it will let me at the very least create another one to work from forgive me if i get things wrong and seem dense i know just enough about 'fixing' computers to really screw things up p well there is no quick and easy way to do this first you'll have to login and create a new profile then copy all of your data from the old profile to the new one the temp account may not have high enough user rights if this is the case you can usually log in using administrator as the id and leave password blank after that s done read the following from microsoft and it should guide you along the way http support microsoft com kb i don't normally offer extended help to random people but since this has the potential to be a pain in the rear for you feel free to drop me an e mail if you can't get it working charlotteguy yahoo com if you do get it back up and running smoothly you should make it a habbit to backup everything incrementally good luck rick in response to your additional comments you can try to run the restore very easy to do but chances are that this will not fix the issue and may actually cause more damage but it's totaly up to you Virtual memory Windows 2000 CPU cache Windows XP Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks AmigaOS Mouse (computing) Windows 3.x File Allocation Table Computer virus Linux 64-bit USB flash drive Mac OS X Page table Mach kernel Windows Server 2003 C programming language Btrieve Emacs History of Microsoft Windows Partition (computing) Apple Macintosh DOS System/36 PaX NX bit Hello world program Kernel (computer science) Blue screen of death Knoppix Embedded system System/34 Page replacement algorithms FreeDOS Screenshot RISC Spring operating system Memory (computers) CPU design System 6 System 7 (Macintosh) Forth programming language Windows Vista Macromedia Flash Novell NetWare File system IA-32 Sorting algorithm Atari 8-bit family Computer IPod Architecture of Windows 2000 Central processing unit Booting Universal Serial Bus Kazaa Emulator MDAC Unicode MS-DOS PlayStation 2 Macintosh Finder MIPS architecture Digital photography Object Desktop Compiler optimization Computer multitasking Minesweeper (computer game) Anti-virus software X86 Paging INMOS Transputer NeXT Gmail Digital Equipment Corporation Amstrad CPC Pixel The Sims 2: University Perl HTTP cookie Spyware History of the graphical user interface Cache Disk cloning Hard disk Computer storage Quicksort National Weather Service Thread (computer science) DragonFly BSD IMac Laptop Xbox 360 World of Warcraft Digital circuit
