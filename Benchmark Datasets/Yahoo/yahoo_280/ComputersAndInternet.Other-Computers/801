where is lightscribe i have a lightscribe disk drive and dvds but the problem is i cant find my lightscribe media i know i have it but it only shows up after i finish burning a disk in itunes where is it i figured out that sonic burns it i thought the name of the software was lightscribe thanks anon i am guessing you have an hp computer compaq lightscribe is a drive that allows you on certain lightscribe only disks to burn a label on the disk face so you burn your information on the bottom and have a snazzy image on the top you should have sonic software on the computer sonic allows you to burn the images please note though that it takes sometimes a half hour to make a custom label good luck Linux Google search Operating system SUSE Linux Web design Search engine optimization Mandriva Linux Opera (web browser) User agent Microsoft Windows Linux distribution Doom 3 Radeon LiveCD MontaVista Session Initiation Protocol Sun Microsystems Delphi programming language Social bookmarking Google bomb Linspire Digital audio workstation X Window System Personal digital assistant Ubuntu Linux Netscape Communications Corporation Apple Macintosh Gentoo Linux Common Unix Printing System Debian 64-bit Security-Enhanced Linux GNU Privacy Guard Embedded Linux Kernel (computer science) Unreal Tournament 2004 Online music store MSN Messenger Linux Standard Base Uplink (computer game) SCO Group Suwon Samsung Bluewings Sinclair QL Real-time operating system Silicon Graphics Arch Linux Novell NetWare OpenOffice.org Mono development platform Timeline of computing 1990-forward GNU/Linux naming controversy NVIDIA Slashdot Package management system Slackware Mydoom Damn Small Linux ISCSI FVWM MSX GIMP IPAQ OS/2 Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Novell, Inc.
