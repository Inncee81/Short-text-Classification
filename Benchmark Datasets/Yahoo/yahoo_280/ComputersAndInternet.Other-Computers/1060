which unix platform is best and used most sun solaris hp ux linux lindows i have been a tech tl for unix system admins of a large organization as my previous profile and we supported different versions of os aix x hp ux i sun solaris and linux redhat el i have also been an sys admin for novell netware freebsd sco and various versions of windows starting from win x to win have worked on a few others but those os never made it big so which is the best os it depends upon what you need to run do with it an os takes the role of an operator what we had with early mainframe systems and if your task is to just work on word and excel documents windows xp may be good enough for you and if you are doing simple data entry or have a pos in a third world country you may actually be using software made for dos all command line text gui however come to big organizations that have lots of data and processes even business that utilize that data they need powerful systems and high end applications where unix and it's clones come into the picture stable robust with some of the best performance if your work is involved with cheaper hardware non proprietary etc i would say go ahead with linux or solaris if supported on the other hand if you have the hardware to go with it hp ux or aix may be the ones to consider we have run very large oracle databases have designed systems with tbs of storage written network backup apps dr software etc and with the right hardware os combination all the top versions of unix linux perform quite alike the differ only in the cost and quality of support so if you go ahead with a free version of linux you may have a to performance lower compared to aix though a lot of your effort would need to go in to keep it tuned and running well likewise if you go for hp ux and have a support package most of your headache will be limited to the cost of hardware software and upgrades so the key is in finding the combination platform which is right for you and meets your budge requirements hope this has helped andrew Control key Emacs Modifier key Control-Alt-Delete Vim (text editor) Computer keyboard Unicode Ctrl Alt Del (webcomic) Internet Relay Chat Blue screen of death COMMAND.COM IBM PC keyboard Dayfree Press Diacritic Wil Wheaton Control character QBasic Common User Access Keyboard layout ASCII Mouse (computing) Amiga Immanuel Kant Webcomic Windows 2000 WordPerfect AltGr key Internet troll City of Heroes Carl and the Passions - "So Tough" Make money fast Jack Thompson Reservoir Dogs Editor war Norton Commander Friedrich Nietzsche Tea GNU Screen Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys The Contender (television series) Made in U.S.A.
