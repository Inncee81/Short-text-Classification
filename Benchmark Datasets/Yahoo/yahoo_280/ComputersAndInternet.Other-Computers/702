burning files hi i was wondering if anybody coud help lately ive been downloading torrent film files ive been burning them to dvd r and dvd rw useing nero now the quality is brilliant my problem is i watch the film on my dvd player everything is ok till about mis to the end of the film then it starts to pause sound starts to cut out and the picture skips now i dont think its the dvd player because it plays other stuff my gut feeling is theres to much info for the dvd to hold ie the file is to big for the disc but it dont say this on nero any help please because im baffled thank you i have played it on pc its fine put it in a new dvd player it still skips and the soud is on and off still helppppppp first of all rule out that it's your computer or the downloads by playing the downloaded files and watching the part where the dvds skip on it use nero showtime or windvd etc if the dvds are fine then make sure you burn them to a dvd r dvd rws fade too quickly then try playing the dvds themselves in your computer if they work fine great if they don't then try reburning the dvd but on x speed or even x speed the slower the more chance of the disc retaining the data well it just depends on how much free time you have to sit around and wait then check again if they work still using the computer then play them fully in your dvd player if they work fine great if they don't get a dvd cleaning disc which'll hopefully help things by getting rid of all that pesky dust inside your machine on a side note downloading torrented movies is illegal but we all do it anyway Windows XP Blue screen of death MDAC Btrieve Windows Server 2003 Library (computer science) Spyware OpenBSD DragonFly BSD Web browser Gmail Computer virus Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Microsoft Jet Database Engine Windows API Cocoa (API) Component Object Model Perl Unicode Common criticisms of Microsoft Mozilla Application Suite Internet Explorer Pretty Good Privacy History of Microsoft Windows HyperText Transfer Protocol Name mangling HTTP cookie SCO-Linux controversies Steam (content delivery) DLL hell Software cracking Mouse (computing) Emacs Mac OS X C plus plus Apache HTTP Server AmigaOS Wine (software) C programming language Microsoft Uniform Resource Locator Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Copy protection Phishing Mach kernel Game programming Copyright infringement of software Error correction and detection Common Unix Printing System Windows Installer Dynamic-Link Library BASIC programming language World Wide Web Java programming language Opera (web browser) Cryptography Unicode and HTML XML Federal Standard 1037C Emulator Stopping e-mail abuse Video game crash of 1983 0 (number) Windows 2000 Microsoft .NET Patch (computing) Quotation mark ALGOL 68 Linux .NET assemblies MSN Messenger Forth programming language ICalendar Virtual memory Cheating in Counter-Strike WordPerfect Mydoom Master Control Program AppleScript Plame affair Digital rights management Comparison of web browsers E-mail Code (cryptography) Transport Layer Security Thread (computer science) GSM services Windows Vista Real-time operating system COBOL OpenOffice.org Objective Modula-2 File Allocation Table Ajax (programming) Advertising Extended ASCII Internet Group Management Protocol X86
