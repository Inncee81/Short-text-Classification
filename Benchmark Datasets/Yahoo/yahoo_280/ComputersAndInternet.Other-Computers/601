downloading movies error loading codec no pic just wierd scribbles sometimes when i download videos off file sharing i click play and windows media player pops up and it says error downloading codec there are just wierd scribbles on the screen it also does it on realplayer what causes this and how can i make them play thanks for the answers this is because the file is in a format that windows media player can't play currently so it plays scribbles because it knows that something should be playing what the codec is is a way for wmp to decode the format the movie is in and play it normally but unfortunately a lot of the files you download off of filesharing applications need a codec that you might not know specifically which one to download one way to fix this is download the divx codec or simply just download divx player this will play almost any file type i've encountered from file sharing apps google divx player it's free Teen Girl Squad Network effect What's Happening!!
