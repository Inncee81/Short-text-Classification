can i use two email programms for same address i like windows mail for my email and outlook express too i aso like the calender better for that is there a way i can set them up so they will both receive emails the short answer is yes you can however it does require a proper setup which will depend on the type of mail account you're using there are two standard types of e mail accounts you may be working with pop imap if you're using a work or college e mail account it may be imap in which case all you have to do is set up both windows mail and outlook express with your e mail account information and you should be set just try to avoid running both programs at the same time to avoid conflicts if you're using a web mail provider like google or hotmail chances are it's a pop account which is a little more tricky to set up with a pop account all of your mail is stored on a server that your mail provider owns client programs like outlook express and windows mail then download copies of the mail from the server the problem is that by default once the mail has been downloaded the client will send a message to your pop account telling it to delete the original source from the server so if you downloaded all of your mail with windows mail it would show up but then if you tried to open outlook express it would tell you there were no messages to download to prevent this you need to configure both microsoft mail and outlook express to leave the messages on your provider's server the steps are similar for both microsoft mail and outlook express so once you've entered your e mail account information just do this on both clients go to tools accounts highlight your mail account by clicking it click the properties button select the advanced tab under the delivery section check leave a copy of messages on server click ok now you should be able to switch back and forth between windows mail and outlook express without having one steal all of your mail unfortunately the two clients don't communicate so even after you read messages with windows mail outlook express will think they're new messages until you open them with outlook express if that doesn't bother you then you should be all set i hope that helps gl Windows XP Windows 2000 Windows Vista Password Partition (computing) NTFS History of Microsoft Windows Hard disk Apple Macintosh File system Windows registry Redundant array of independent disks Computer virus USB flash drive Oracle database Linux IBM PC compatible DOS Booting AmigaOS Disk cloning Novell NetWare Backup Windows Server 2003 Computer forensics Forth programming language Microsoft Windows MS-DOS Knoppix Domain Name System System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Virtual memory BIOS Atari 8-bit family System/36 Control-Alt-Delete Computer security MDAC Blue screen of death Information Technology Infrastructure Library Personal computer System/34 Rootkit Cache Embedded system Copy protection Steam (content delivery) Phishing Common Unix Printing System Passphrase IPod Wget Kernel (computer science) Microsoft Office Wi-Fi Mac OS X v10.4 Windows API Windows 3.x Btrieve Secure Shell FreeDOS HyperCard Digital rights management Apple II family Malware Mac OS X CPU design File Transfer Protocol Windows Me Architecture of Windows 2000 BASIC programming language Patch (computing) Stopping e-mail abuse OpenOffice.org Enterprise content management Thread (computer science) DR-DOS Files-11 Boot image Federal Standard 1037C OpenGL Disk formatting Computer storage Two-factor authentication TRS-80 Apple Computer Computer SAS System
