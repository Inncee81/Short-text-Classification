opening folders to full screen size when i open my desktop shortcuts for internet sites the window opens to a small size and then i have to maximize it to be at full screen size how can i set them to open at full screen size without maximizing them open your window as normal and then drag it so that the top left hand corner of the window is aligned to the top left hand corner of your display then grab the bottom right hand corner of the window and drag it out to the bottom right hand corner of the display finally close the window by clicking on the x in the caption bar or selecting exit from the menu making certain that the window is not maximized when you close it from this point on the window will open at this size windows applications typically save their state in the registry when they close so the trick is to close them at least once in a non maximized state at the size you want them to always open at Mouse (computing) Screenshot Macintosh Finder Taskbar History of the graphical user interface Windows XP EIA-708 X Window System Windows Vista AmigaOS Windows 2000 IPod Microsoft Windows Opera (web browser) Start Menu Konqueror System 6 Danger Hiptop History of Microsoft Windows Unicode Windows Explorer Drill bit Macromedia Flash Window Maker HTML element Blue screen of death ITunes Pop-up ad Minesweeper (computer game) AppleScript Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Konfabulator Windows registry Google Desktop Multiple document interface Mac OS X v10.4 Teletext Menu (computing) Dance Dance Revolution Apple typography Gmail Cascading Style Sheets Inkscape Laptop System 7 (Macintosh) Library (computer science) Windows 1.0 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Hello world program GunBound Twm Newline Self programming language OpenGL Xlib Mac OS X Professional wrestling holds Cmd.exe File Allocation Table Visual Basic Computer virus Poker jargon QuickDraw PostScript Virtual desktop DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX GNU Screen Loudspeaker IBM PC compatible Stardock Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass Windows Server 2003 Tab (GUI) Tabbed document interface Mac OS history Prank flash NTFS junction point Screensaver Palm OS Lotus Notes DesktopX Internet Relay Chat Stereoscopy Common User Access Apple Computer Kayak Option key Cut and paste Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Mozilla Firefox Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Icon (computing) IBM PC keyboard Halo: Combat Evolved
