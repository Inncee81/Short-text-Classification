what kind of things should i look for in a laptop i dont know much about them what is better mac or pc whats the diffence between ddr memory and hardrive whats a super multi dvdrw with lightscribe whats the diffrence between a regular one and a duel layer one whats a card reader iis it better then a whats a b g wifi what graphics would be the best the bigger numbers the better right what is a media adapter thank you well if you ask me a pc is way better than a mac due to it's price compatibility and flexability i don't think that a mac can run the linux operating system but a pc is very flexable in that area pc's are easier to troubleshoot when there is a problem i had to support mac's in the past and researching what a sad mac code is back then was not easy as far as memory gigabyte should be more than sufficiant my laptop is running with gigabytes only because i run a full version of sql server database for testing my code memory is only for temporary storage whereas your hard drive is much more permanent storage i would get a drive at least gb or larger my laptop has of which i only use gb due to the sql mentioned earlier i wold get a dual layer dvd read write drive the lightscribe drive just allows you to burn an image on the other side for a label and is very pricey most laptops do not have card readers so if you get one get an external one that plugs into the usb port or pcmcia port most laptops now come with g wireless faster transfer rate than b which is just an older technology wireless but your laptop can do both g and b if it comes with wireless as far as graphics most laptops are not known for having great graphics cards but yes the more memory the card has is sometimes better but unless you are a serious gamer or d designer don't waste your money brands toshiba is the original designer of laptop computers and is in my opinon still the best gateway and dell run a close second but hp compaq acer are the bottom of my shopping list as the quality is just not there and neither is the technical support don't spend over a unless you just have to have bleeding edge graphics speed etc i have never payed more than for any computer or laptop in my life but my company that i work for did on my last laptop sigh oh well good luck ASCII art Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Ajax (programming) Website Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web ASCII Dash Character encodings in HTML MIME Apostrophe (mark) Web server Common Unix Printing System Wget Internet Web browser Gmail HTML Domain Name System HTML element Punycode Base64 XHTML Phishing File Transfer Protocol Quotation mark Apache HTTP Server AmigaOS File format Mac OS 8 Uniform Resource Identifier Unicode and HTML Newline Web application MSN Messenger Slash (punctuation) Domain name Slashdot trolling phenomena AOL Instant Messenger Extended ASCII TOC protocol Hello world program 2channel MPlayer Esperanto orthography Lotus Notes Ebook JavaServer Pages Unicode LOL (Internet slang) HTTP cookie The Cure Windows XP User agent Pipeline (Unix) XML Mac OS X Server Transport Layer Security Unix Microsoft UTF-8 SAML GameFAQs message boards String (computer science) Mozilla Application Suite Cascading Style Sheets BinHex Internet phenomenon WebDAV Streaming media Favicon 10cc Tab Macintosh Finder Web crawler Netscape Navigator MD5 Common Lisp Virtual hosting Digest access authentication Collation Ignatz Awards Stardock Full stop PHP Icon (computing) Konqueror Copy protection Rod Stewart Goatse.cx Jabber U.S. presidential election, 2008 __Okina Slashdot subculture Mac OS X Ultima Online ISO/IEC 8859-1 Google search
