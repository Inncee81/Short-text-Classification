sound card won't work i reinstalled windows xp on my computer didn't change any hardware the computer does not recognize any sound card which was working fine before i reinstalled windows and doesn't have any volume controls except for the microphone chances are you probably had windows preinstalled for you when you bought it if it's a brand name go to their website hp com dell com etc and look for the drivers windows installation disc doesn't have all of the drivers for every component so it is usually packaged with the computer it might be included with your computer's reinstallation disc so i suggest you look there first if it's not a brand name you'll have to find out what brand of motherboard it is you can do that by either opening up the case to see if the brand and model numbers are on it or you can try looking at system information by clicking on start then program files then accessories then system tools then system information on the main page under bios version it may contain info about your board to go find the drivers Windows 2000 Defragmentation File system Data recovery Windows XP Blue screen of death NTFS Fsck Embedded system HyperText Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Defrag Windows Vista System/36 File Allocation Table Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks Web crawler AmigaOS FreeDOS Apple II family Booting Btrieve World Wide Web Exception handling Master Control Program Windows registry File format Debugging Mach kernel System/34 Computer security Domain Name System Linux Gmail Disk image Macintosh Finder Mozilla Firefox Early IBM disk storage Wget Hard disk PC-DOS Backup Web server GameFAQs Partition (computing) MiniDisc Windows 95 XHTML Spyware Opera (web browser) Floppy disk Malware ReiserFS Representational State Transfer Steam (content delivery) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Fragmentation Filename extension Library (computer science) HTML Architecture of Windows 2000 AOL Instant Messenger Rootkit C programming language Page table Objective-C XML Linux kernel Computer CPU design Unicode and HTML Freenet Unix Disk cloning Microsoft Windows PHP DR-DOS Disk formatting CPU cache Melissa worm Error correction and detection Apple Computer MDAC Streaming media Commodore 64 DOS OpenBSD Pretty Good Privacy DragonFly BSD System 7 (Macintosh) Enterprise content management OpenVMS Novell NetWare Transmission Control Protocol Website Forth programming language
