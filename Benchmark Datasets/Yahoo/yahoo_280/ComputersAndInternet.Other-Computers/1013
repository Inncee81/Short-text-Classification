why do the people who run isohunt have attitude and why are only to of all their torrent scrapes complete i have used the site and joined the forum only to be banned for double posting and pointing out that most of the content they offer is not complete is riddled with trojans or spyware and thats just the movies yes viruses now can exist in video audio files i know some have views on peer to peer but until you try it you will never understand the reason for it in simplest of terms you have to very often pay allot of money to use a program that very likely does not do or perform the task you require despite many programs claiming to do as much but dont so you the consumer pay pay and pay again until you get the program you want so try before you buy is imho best policy trial programs are often limited never perform or are riddled with spyware so back to isohunt what is wrong with them anyone directly involved with the site here or isohunt a front or sister site to another torrent peer to peer forum it is in my experience that most torrents even the iso releases are not complete or no seeds i have complained about the scrape system proposed a simple effective way of dealing with fakes and all i got was banned imho theyre like the joke tampax walking down the street mini maxi and super which one says hello none as they all stuck up unts cheek of it all you said it my friend they are there to make money one way or other they know you are sucker they know how to make you pay for it it is not hard to implant virus into audio or video all virus can be transmitted through any media it depend on individual programmer i can create one and send it to anyone but what will that prove it will only prove i am no better then them virus programmer are nothing more then morons and thief Digital video recorder Universal Serial Bus World Wide Web USB flash drive Laptop Computer bus TiVo Secure Digital card Ethernet Wi-Fi Computer hardware IPod Dongle Internet IBM PC compatible Musical Instrument Digital Interface Bluetooth FireWire Atari ST Uniform Resource Locator High-definition television Floppy disk Television RS-232 Hard disk SCART Common Unix Printing System Serial ATA HyperText Transfer Protocol Archos PowerPC Sound card Commodore 64 Desktop computer Phishing Personal computer Apple Macintosh Apple Desktop Bus Plug-and-play AlphaSmart S-Video Linux kernel Disc jockey ACCESS.bus Extension Cord PlayStation 3 Jack plug Hotspot (wifi) Flash memory Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Web server Personal area network Router PCI Express CD recorder CompactFlash D-subminiature Microsoft Closed-circuit television Digital Visual Interface Commodore International Power strip Mouse (computing) Timeline of computing 1990-forward History of Microsoft Windows Memory card ABS-CBN Coaxial cable Digital audio player Parallel port Port (computing) Mobile computing Windows XP ReactOS IPod shuffle Domain Name System N-Gage Device driver SCSI Computer forensics PlayStation 2 IMac IBook Sound recording One-time pad Advanced Technology Attachment Internet privacy USB mass storage device class Computer network High fidelity Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Surveillance Universal Plug and Play Gender PowerBook Adapter TIA-568A/B System/36 NetNavi
