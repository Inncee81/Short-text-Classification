is there a way to 'lock' my computer while watching movies just wondering if theres anyway i can lock my computer or disable the keys and the mouse when watching films with my younger cousins they always mess around with the computer pressing buttons and playing with the mouse im on a laptop so i cant unplug the keyboard and mouse do u mean while watching them on your laptop if so there is a lock on windows media player while playing your movie change to full screen mode either by right clicking on the video and clicking full screen or by clicking alt enter on your keyboard now there should be two little buttons in the bottom right hand corner one exits the full screen and the one below it locks the full screen padlock icon click on the padlock icon and then enter a four digit code you can use a different code everytime you do this also it only accepts numbers once four numbers have been typed in a little tick will appear click on it now the media player will be locked in full screen mode to unlock just click on the padlock again and type the same code in you used to lock it then click the tick again also there is usually a keyboard shortcut to disable your mouse or touch pad on your laptop usually there will be an icon on one of the keys like on mine its f but they tend to vary on different laptops just look for something that would resemble the touch pad i e a hand or finger on a square youd should also have a button saying fn hold down the fn button while clicking on the other button i just mentioned on mine i hold down fn while pressing f mine is an acer laptop use the same keyboard shortcut to enable it again hope this helps Wget BitTorrent HTTP cookie Apache HTTP Server Uniform Resource Locator Website CPAN Spyware 400 (number) Mozilla Firefox HyperText Transfer Protocol Representational State Transfer MIRC Uploading and downloading SAML Goa trance music Download.com Fedora Core Google Web Accelerator World Wide Web Mozilla Application Suite Jabber Deep linking JSON Music of Pakistan PHP-Nuke 200 (number) 300 (number) Common Unix Printing System Dave Matthews Band 500 (number) Digital art Wireless Application Protocol Internet censorship in mainland China Internet Suprnova.org Spread Firefox Video game music Session Initiation Protocol Download manager REBOL Web server Bbc.co.uk OpenOffice.org Evanescence Gnutella User agent I-mode Multimedia Messaging System VBulletin Network Time Protocol MP3.com VeriSign Online music store Macromedia Flash Cross site scripting Differentiated services MD5 Web crawler Ajax (programming) File Transfer Protocol REALbasic Intranet Slapt-get Web browser Tom Johnson (composer) Domain Name System Mozilla Thunderbird Streaming media Vorbis MSN Messenger DeviantART Thumbnail gallery post File sharing Halo: Combat Evolved CalDAV Microsoft Office Samples of music from the United States Lotus Notes FastTrack RealNetworks Windows XP Church of Scientology Netscape Navigator TikiWiki ITunes Music Store Warez File-sharing program Pixies Etisalat Soul music Typosquatting Cross-platform Anime music video Domain name Internet art KDE Damn Small Linux Wynton Marsalis StarOffice
