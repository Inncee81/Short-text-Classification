how can i raise the volume of my mp files i have an mp player and all my music is in mp format or most of it rather the songs i burnt from cd's to my computer are significantly quieter than the songs i downloaded off of the internet when i put these songs together the normal ones and quiet ones on my mp player you can just assume the frustration of dealing with some songs being too loud because you can't hear the quieter ones well and vive versa so my question is is there anyway to raise or lower the volume of my mp files permanently through the computer to where my songs are all at the same or a similar volume you can use sound editing software such as goldwave to adjust the volume MP3 ITunes Music Store Musical Instrument Digital Interface Karaoke DVD Commodore 64 Vorbis Macromedia Flash IPod Disc jockey Digital audio player Video game music Apple Computer Dance Dance Revolution Big band Prank flash Windows XP Online music store Marching band Floppy disk PlayStation Portable Multitrack recording Digital rights management Buddy Guy Filename extension MAME Piano Computer virus Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Vista Warez Podcasting Gramophone record Windows 2000 ZX Spectrum E-mail QuickTime Copy protection GIF John Cage ELO rating system Stardock Module file File sharing Peer-to-peer Amstrad CPC Mod (computer gaming) Computer science MiniDisc Psychoacoustics AmigaOS Mixtape Computer History of Microsoft Windows Digital photography Java programming language OpenDocument Oxford English Dictionary Object Desktop Chess Cheating in Counter-Strike GNU General Public License Mute (music) Loudness Synthesizer Dynamics (music) The Waterboys Grateful Dead PlayStation 3 Doom 3 Electric guitar Trusted computing Windows registry Nintendo GameCube Microeconomics Machinima Timpani Super Nintendo Entertainment System TeX Ebook Dave Matthews Band Ray Charles Portable Document Format Rhythm and blues Apple II family World Wide Web Sony Doom Kraftwerk SonicStage Doom WAD Apple typography File Transfer Protocol Sound recording Streaming media Dither
