when you use a proxy site to register to a site can the site still get your ip address because i used a proxy site to do the registration on the main site but i had to go into my emails to send a reply which i couldn't use the proxy site there so once i send the reply does it get my real ip address or what or does it still hide my real address because i think once you reply with your normal ip address they get your real ip address not the one supplied by a proxy server they dont get your real ip the website thinks the proxy is the actual client you and then the proxy just forwards that information onto you Uploading and downloading BitTorrent Internet pornography Internet Gmail Vlog Google Video Web hosting CPAN Spam (electronic) Debian General Packet Radio Service Topsite File Transfer Protocol Wikimedia Commons E-mail Stopping e-mail abuse America Online World Wide Web Debian Free Software Guidelines Web page Yahoo!
