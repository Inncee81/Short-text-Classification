how do i remove a icon program from my system tray taskbar next to the clock there is a program running next to the clock in my system tray i want to remove it it opens to a web page for a product that i don't want normally you can right click on the icon and the menu will give you a close option more than likely if the program is in you system tray it is set to auto start every time you reboot your pc if this is the case you can go to your start menu then run and then put in msconfig without the quotes and hit enter this will bring up a system configuration box which has a tab labeled start up go to that tab and locate the program from your system tray and un check the box and hit apply when you hit ok it will probably prompt you to restart your pc after rebooting the program should no longer be in your system tray if it is you might have some thing attached in your system registry and you should take it in to a professional BitTorrent ITunes Macromedia Flash Comparison of media players Mac OS X RealPlayer IPod Windows Vista System 7 (Macintosh) Windows XP Peer-to-peer Screenshot Mac OS X v10.4 AOL Instant Messenger Azureus Virtual memory Windows registry Macintosh Finder Object Desktop Windows Media Player Kazaa Filename extension Streaming media Vorbis Winamp MP3 Computer virus MDAC PlayStation Portable EMule ZIP (file format) Windows 2000 Trillian (instant messenger) Windows Media Audio Theora Online music store Digital rights management Windows Mobile Musical Instrument Digital Interface Stardock Podcasting HyperCard Windows Me Internet Explorer Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Knoppix H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DVD DirectShow Uploading and downloading Windows Explorer ILife File format Warez Computer and video games Jon Lech Johansen Library (computer science) TiVo Video game music Bluetooth File system Suprnova.org Enterprise content management Microsoft Office Web page Konqueror Opera (web browser) OpenOffice.org Common Unix Printing System Google Desktop ITunes Music Store MIRC Linux Skype Cue sheet NTFS Windows Media Video Ebook Lotus Notes Spyware America Online DeltaAnime SonicStage PHP WordStar Commodore 64 Media Player Classic NPAPI Home directory System/36 Web crawler ROM image Linux distribution Gmail Ogg
