why does my cpu run so high when i use the internet especially on yahoo q a it fluctuates from to on average it stays at its getting annoy how i can i get ride of this i've scanned my computer several times it says nothing is on it the most likely cause for this is if your computer is infected with spyware spyware typically does things like watch all of your keystrokes and send them to someone's server or it might replace ads on web pages with ones for their own products unlike viruses spyware often slips through virus checkers companies that make spyware eventually get their servers shut down or blocked and when this happens the badly written spyware applications spend heaps of cpu time constantly trying to phone home applications like spyware blaster and spyware blocker prevent spyware from being installed on your machine but once you've got one they can be difficult to get rid of a good test is to run the freeware program hijackthis hijackthis will scan your internet explorer registry settings and show everything that is currently installed most of what you see should look familiar i e internet messenger adobe plugins google taskbar etc but if you see unidentifiable ip addresses i e number sequences that look like then that's often a good indication of an infection if you're feeling very adventurous you can use hijackthis to remove these things but i wouldn't recommend doing so without the help of someone who knows a bit more about it you can break explorer altogether if you're not careful best advice is to take the machine to a local computer store for servicing good luck Witchcraft Troll Magic (paranormal) Elf Norse mythology The Hobbit Races in the Warcraft universe Satan Discworld gods Aleister Crowley Internet troll Neopaganism RuneScape quests Wicca Demon Devil Celtic polytheism Orc Alaga__sia Christian views on witchcraft Dark elf Supernatural Incarnations of Immortality Witch-hunt Tamriel Viking Satanism Druid Locations in the Warcraft Universe Narnia Angel Henry VIII of England Middle-earth RuneScape locations Shannara creatures The 10th Kingdom Final Fantasy IV Hogwarts Slashdot trolling phenomena The Death Gate Cycle Illuga saga Gr____arf__stra European witchcraft The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Minor Discworld concepts Fiend (Dungeons & Dragons) Witch trial Unicorn Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Goddess Malleus Maleficarum Exorcism Satanic ritual abuse Origin belief Greyhawk Vampire Vow Wizard Hell The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Beowulf Bigfoot Necromancy Mary, the mother of Jesus Warhammer Fantasy Battle Harry Potter Fire Emblem Ayya Vaikundar Picts Curse Amulet Characters of The Sandman Goatse.cx Norse dwarves Isis John the Baptist Odin Hecate Conan the Destroyer Anglo-Saxon literature Book of Esther Elric of Melnibon__ RuneScape gods Elizabeth I of England Pentagram Deity Pok__mon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Merit Minor Discworld characters Salem witch trials
