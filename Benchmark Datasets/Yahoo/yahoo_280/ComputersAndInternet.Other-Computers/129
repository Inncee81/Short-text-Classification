annoying scroll bar i want to play a game in a website and i have to use the arrow keys to play but whenever i press up the scroll bar goes up which is really annyoing and i can't move up until the whole page is at the top but then i couldn't see the game screen and this goes for all the rest of the games is there some way to delete the scroll bar at least make it stop this usually happens when you are not clicked onto the game and the browser thinks that you are trying to scroll up and down a screen try clicking on the game screen twice and then using the arrow keys then if that doesn't work try leaving your mouse pointer within the game screen sometimes this will work good luck hth Mouse (computing) IBM PC keyboard Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Screenshot Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Scrolling Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Dance Dance Revolution Option key Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Beatmania IIDX Prank flash Computer and video game genres Opera (web browser) Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Cursor (computers) Blue screen of death Pump It Up Bubble Bobble Minesweeper (computer game) Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Danger Hiptop Scrollbar Diablo II Combo box Web page DrumMania International Phonetic Alphabet Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara WordStar Fighting game AmigaOS MapleStory Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Dance Dance Revolution Solo Violin Winning Streak Gmail Diablo II: Lord of Destruction WASD Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX Amstrad CPC Windows XP Uniform Resource Locator Mouse gesture Parodius Fitts' law Spy Hunter Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Go (board game) BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban In The Groove (game) Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMIX The Elder Scrolls Dance Dance Revolution 5thMIX BlackBerry Castle of the Winds Resident Evil 4 GuitarFreaks Hyperlink Shoot 'em up Super Mario Bros. 3 C64 Direct-to-TV Flash Flash Revolution Mozilla Application Suite Cyberspace Keyboard layout Baseball Stars Dance Dance Revolution (Game Boy versions) Gradius Anime Blood (computer game) Windows 2000 Finale notation program Expos__ (Mac OS X) Teen Girl Squad Mega Man (NES) IPod Page widening Greatest (Duran Duran) History of the graphical user interface Scrolling shooter Computer role-playing game Mozilla Firefox Cello Original Amiga chipset Touchpad The Fool's Errand All your base are belong to us Warcraft II Daigasso!
