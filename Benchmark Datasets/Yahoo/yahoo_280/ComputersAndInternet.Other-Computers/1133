how can i back up my zipped music onto dvd the already compressed file is on 'my documents' when i click the icon and try to send to the 'e' drive i keep on getting the message windows has encountered a problem i hit retry but that doesn't help either it's only gb onto a gb dvd and help please in plain english uh am i missing something here are you simply trying to copy a file to a dvd disk with drag and drop is your dvd burner your e drive in my experience there are some dvd burners which can use rewritable media which act like a very slow hard disk which will allow drag and drop but the disk has to be formatted and such just like a hard disk the dvd just becomes another drive but with removable media the error you are getting could be the media is not formatted i do not recognize the error i use a program called incd which comes from nero and came with my dvd burner sometimes it fails to load the drive when i insert a disk and it takes an eject open my computer right click on dvd drive then select eject instead of using the eject button on the drive if i use the drive button it fails to load the next disk and reinsert for incd to recognize the disk and load it so it is ready to use newer versions of windoze may have this ability built in either you are using packet software like i do with incd or you are using a burning program to create a dvd data disk either way it appears the dvd drive is not recognizing the media is loaded and ready Ethernet Modem Digital Subscriber Line Computer bus Universal Serial Bus Wi-Fi Xbox Router AppleTalk Enigma machine Local area network TIA-568A/B PlayStation 2 Laptop Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Power line communication FireWire Jack plug Bluetooth Commodore 64 Password Null modem Computer network Desktop computer Federal Standard 1037C Digital Equipment Corporation Personal computer Category 5 cable RS-232 MAC address Cisco Systems Communications protocol Atari 8-bit family Cable television Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IPod DOCSIS Residual-current device BS 1363 Internet Group Management Protocol Telephone exchange Computer surveillance IMac Coaxial cable Wireless LAN Voice over IP Wireless access point Private branch exchange Integrated Services Digital Network USB flash drive AirPort Denial-of-service attack Broadband Internet access Musical Instrument Digital Interface Network switch Dial-up access Serial port Netfilter/iptables GSM services SCADA Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Telegraphy X.25 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis STS-61 3Com Corporation HyperTransport Advanced Technology Attachment Universal Plug and Play Computer networking device Secure Digital card Computer PowerPC MIPS architecture SCART Electricity meter Spark plug RJ-45 Cable modem IEEE 802.11 10-gigabit Ethernet HomePNA Computer hardware OSI model NSA encryption systems Network address translation Dongle ARPANET Xbox 360 IBook ALOHAnet Nintendo GameCube LocalTalk Mouse (computing) Packet radio Electrical wiring Internet service provider
