can you get in trouble with internet pornography on computer i have a foster child and recently noticed that on my computer he has been visiting gay porn sites i'm so frustrated with him right now i wanted to take my computer to ggek squad to add a gaming card to it and some memory but i'm afraid that they will see those sickening images and videos and i will get in trouble for his wrong doings even if you could tell me how to get rid of them that would be great also thx plz help me the presence of pornographic content generally isn't illegal unless the content is of minors if they review the content and the age of the subjects is in question you could potentially run into problems too clearing out the browser history and deleting temporary files will remove the easy way of finding information on your computer but it doesn't completely remove it you would need to use an application that is specifically designed to overwrite the files at the disk level so that file recovery programs are unable to recover the data too i would recommend moving the computer into a common location like the living room so that you can observe the content visited if you don't think that will work look for net nanny applications that will block access to certain content you'll also want to ensure that each user in the house has their own login so you can identify each users behavior and set access controls COMMAND.COM Tcl File system Unix Uniform Resource Locator AmigaOS Commodore DOS Path (computing) Python programming language Cp (Unix) Active Directory DIGITAL Command Language NTFS junction point Chmod Symbolic link Bash Programming language News server TeX BASIC programming language XPath Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Common Lisp Perl PHP Tar (file format) Smalltalk Master Control Program Configuration file Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Apache Ant File system permissions D programming language Job Control Language NTFS File Allocation Table Apple II family Scheme programming language Enterprise JavaBeans Macromedia Flash LiteStep SQL Launchd Drive letter assignment Data General Nova Secure copy Ontology (computer science) Grep English as an additional language Filename Maze Hardware description language Self programming language Eclipse (computing) Orthodox file manager Regular expression Test Drive (video game) Windows registry French Directory Uniform Resource Identifier Rail trail CPAN HTML element Home directory ColdFusion Expert system Java programming language Visual FoxPro Pretty Good Privacy Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Metadata PILOT Forth programming language PONG Partition (computing) Make Hierarchical File System Library (computer science) Second Life XRI MATLAB Podcasting Project management Spanish language Backslash Multics DOS Plus Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Class (computer science) Windows 2000 Comparison of file systems Electronics Open-source software Chroot Space shuttle main engine Spirit rover timeline for 2004 April Samba software Directory RPL programming language
