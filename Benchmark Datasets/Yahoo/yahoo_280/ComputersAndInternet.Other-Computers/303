at what age should a kid get his own computer i had my first computer at yo i think this next generation needs computer skills at an early age although i'm not sure at what age a kid can be trusted to take care of equipment i bought mine with my own money back when you hooked it up to a tv so it was only remember the atari xl and vic now computers are more expensive i really feel like getting started early helped me with my career today i don't think my nephew is allowed to spend enough time at the computer so i think he needs his own at what age can a kid take care of a computer i think it depends on how mature the child is and not how old they are i received an old computer when i was nine and i took wonderful care of it but my six year old cousin has trashed his more importantly what will he be using the computer for is he responsible enough to know not to access any inappropriate websites once more that depends on the maturity of the individual if you don't know how mature your nephew is i suggest taking a look at his other toys and possessions see if he takes good care of his other expensive items and make your decision based on that Life insurance Motion picture rating system MAME Health insurance Generation Y Publicly funded medicine Social rule Mutual fund Care Bears Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Code: Lyoko Video game controversy Ethical consumerism Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Atari 8-bit family Atari MMORPG Floppy disk Intellivision Surveillance Bond Stars!
