ok so im starting college next month and i wanna i wanna buy a laptop but i dont know what kind to get which brand is better and doesnt mess up easily is there a specific kind that you use for college i was thinking about buying me an apple laptop please help thanx first ask yourself these questions am i really going to use this laptop in class do i really need this to study in the library common room etc will i really carry this thing with me into every class i have if you answered no for any of them i would recommend just getting a desktop what's the point of bringing a laptop to lecture when you're just going to im your friends and not bother taking notes or even pay attention to your professor the less distractions the better but if you really want a laptop then i would recommend one that is portable and lightweight if you are thinking about buying a mac i would highly recommend a macbook because they are light and their battery life isn't too bad if you decide not to multi task too much while the macbook pros are sleeker and have more processing power i don't think normal college students would need it besides it's a big wider and more cumbersome to carry around in my opinion anyways if you buy a mac now you can get a rebate for back so you can treat yourself to a new ipod for pcs there are the panasonic toughbooks they have slimmer versions and they're made to sustain some damage like dropping it on the floor the dell inspiron is affordable but the xps m looks way better but i don't recommend dell because their customer service is horrible and a few of my friends' dell laptops have stopped working by their junior years there is also the tablet laptops which are quite handy if you need them depends on your major it helped when i took organic chemistry but it would also be helpful if you're an art major or if you like to write your notes rather than type them for tablets i would recommend an ibm lenovo thinkpad x series tablet they're sturdy and reliable overall whichever laptop you choose remember to splurge on an extended warranty trust me you'll need it Hard disk Uninterruptible power supply Computer forensics ITunes Music Store Team Fortress Classic 2003 North America blackout Copyleft Universal Serial Bus Floppy disk Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Computer insecurity Computer virus Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Personal computer Laptop Unicode Atari 8-bit family Windows XP Space disaster Carburetor Vacuum tube SL-1 Combine (Half-Life 2) D-subminiature MAME Cheating in Counter-Strike CPU cooling Shadow the Hedgehog Turbocharger File Allocation Table Federal Standard 1037C Data recovery Embedded system Shutdown Nuclear reactor Steam (content delivery) File system G-Man (Half-Life) Protoss Year 2000 problem Frame rate Malware Counter-Strike Crash (computing) Trusted computing Bird migration C programming language File Transfer Protocol Hybrid vehicle Public domain Sub-Zero One-time pad Blue screen of death CANDU reactor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Password cracking Computer Power outage Windows 2000 Starsiege: Tribes Virtual memory File sharing PaX PlayStation Portable Computer security Bene Gesserit Digital photography Surveillance Napster Apple Computer Pump It Up Gmail IBM Computer storage Nuclear power CPU cache Fecal incontinence Arguments for and against drug prohibition System/34 Prostate cancer Classified information Microsoft Windows Space Shuttle program Peer-to-peer SCO-Linux controversies Gradius Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Hybrid Synergy Drive Game programmer Southeastern Anatolia Project Laserdisc Seismic retrofit Cryptography Macintosh Finder Sierra Entertainment Manual transmission Mac OS X
