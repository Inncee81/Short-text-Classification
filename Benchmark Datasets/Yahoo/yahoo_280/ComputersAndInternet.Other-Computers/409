cable vs dsl a friend of mine keeps insisting he gets mb sec with qwest dsl service here in phoenix at a month i have cox cable modem service and the maximum that is available is supposed to be mb sec at a month i asked cox and they tell me that mb sec speed isn't even possible currently but my neighbor shows me this report on his pc that shows mb in one second and he says downloads are really really fast i'm not an expert on this nor a total novice so does anybody know the real stats the mb speed is probably his pc speed to his router from the modem to the isp is probably closer to kb ask them to visit http performance toast net and let you know what the results are most routers offer mb for wired connections and mb for wireless depending on which wireless protocol but g is typical just because the router offers that speed it doesn't mean that they have that speed all the way to the internet the mb speed would only be noticeable for pc to pc transfers when both are plugged directly into their router going to the isps line behind the modem dsl cable or fios is going to be slower than your network on your router Internet fraud Lens (optics) Single-lens reflex camera The Star Wars Holiday Special Contact lens Escape from New York Richard Nixon Apollo 8 Short selling Binoculars Anamorphic widescreen Digital photography Craps Canon EF lens mount Advance fee fraud Intraocular lens Neopets Canon FD Digital camera Bulk vending Plame affair PayPal Futurama (TV series - season 5) Digital camera back Canon T90 Rangefinder camera Ocean's Twelve Contact (film) Attack of the Show!
