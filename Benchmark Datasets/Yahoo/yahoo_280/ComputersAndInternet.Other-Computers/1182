can someone check my ip adress from an email i send from yahoo or gmail like an expert hacker or a computer geek i am going to write stuff against military regime to a website anything you send to anyone from anywhere is tracable most of the time an expert hacker isn't even necessary to do so for example anytime you connect to at least a high speed internet provider your computer's ip is recorded as well as the amount of packets sent and received i do not know what country you live in but if it's the us i would advise going to an attorney for help in writing such information because there have been reports of a teenage girl on myspace who wrote against the bush admin and was questioned and i bet you probably do not want a visit from homeland security or the cia or the fbi or whatever Typewriter QWERTY Computer keyboard Dvorak Simplified Keyboard Killian documents Keyboard layout Teleprinter Computer printer Apostrophe (mark) Enigma machine Writing PDP-1 Control character Quotation mark IBM Selectric typewriter Keyboard technology Diacritic Arabic alphabet Infinite monkey theorem Word processing Paper size Desk Game controller Typeface Emphasis (typography) Dash Colossus computer Stenotype Hebern rotor machine Synthesizer IBM 1620 Optical character recognition Computer PostScript Braille Atari 8-bit family Devan__gar__ Monotype Corporation String instrument ASCII art Dot matrix printer Esperanto orthography Postage stamp Oxford English Dictionary Poker jargon Mail Laptop Jumpstart 3rd Grade Coleco Adam ISO/IEC 8859 Cursive English words with uncommon properties Xerox Unicode Mimeograph machine IBM Ruby programming language Cangjie method C programming language Linotype machine Fairlight CMI System/36 Modifier key The Allman Brothers Band X Window System Piano Texas Instruments TI-99/4A AlphaSmart Prolog Typesetting German alphabet Word processor Photocopying Brainfuck Computer and video game genres History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Medical prescription Screenplay Punch card Musical Instrument Digital Interface IBM PC keyboard Commodore International One-time pad Blood on the Tracks AltGr key Keyboard instrument Mouse (computing) Acorn Computers Downing Street memo Musical notation Roswell UFO incident Bringing It All Back Home British Locomotive and Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification The Shining (film) Manuscript Apple Macintosh TRS-80 Letter Atari ST
