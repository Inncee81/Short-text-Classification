what is all neded to watch tv on a desktop i live in a apt that in order to get tv you have to get cable i refuse to pay to watch dumbass reality shows i have watched maybe hrs of tv in the past year literly anyway there are a few shows i would like to watch i was wondering whats the best way to be able to watch tv on a pc and if anyone does watch tv can you please let me know if you like it or not i hate the fact on yahoo answers you cant reply to peoples answers tv cards for pcs are very easy to install and relatively inexpensive however the issue you are still going to have is the reception you will still need the equivalant of a roof antenna or cable it is similar to saying i want to watch tv off of my vcr except there is no source to grab the signal once you have it though it is great it is like having your own digital video recorder good luck Uniform Resource Locator Bracket Slash (punctuation) Domain Name System ASCII art Wikipedia Quotation mark GNU LilyPond Prefix code Wiki Comma category Punctuation Computer art scene Apostrophe (mark) Base64 String (computer science) Uniform Resource Identifier Newline Character encodings in HTML Comma (punctuation) ISO/IEC 8859 ANSI art On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences International Phonetic Alphabet Hyphen RSA Jabber HTTP cookie Mona (ASCII art) Content Extended ASCII Dash Slashdot trolling phenomena Domain name S Scalable Vector Graphics MIME Wget HTML element MIRC ASCII Esperanto orthography Internet Relay Chat Digital art Decimal separator Braille Network Time Protocol GNU/Linux naming controversy Wikisource E-mail 2channel Internet encyclopedia project Devan__gar__ Vertical bar ISO/IEC 2022 WikiWikiWeb Full stop ACiD Productions Lojban UTF-8 Colon (punctuation) Interval (music) Usenet Remorse ASCII Debian File Transfer Protocol Punycode EBCDIC Grave accent __Okina Website Goatse.cx System/36 Ampersand Teleprinter Semicolon World Wide Web Control character Gettysburg Address R800 Internet troll R__maji Comma-separated values Question mark Rabin-Karp string search algorithm Code E-text Visual Basic Tab Ligature (typography) Exclamation mark HyperText Transfer Protocol Mozilla Firefox HTML JavaServer Pages CamelCase UTF-7 Unix Comixpedia
