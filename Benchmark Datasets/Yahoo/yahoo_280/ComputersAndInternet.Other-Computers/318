please help it's urgent my comp lately just sometimes automatically tried to reboot itself by doing that cd booting does not exist or whatever when i didn't even try to boot it but i always went to set up and disable the first booting device and then it worked after a while it did it again and i would disable the first booting device it didn't work so i disabled both first second and third and then it worked and now today it did it again i disabled all but it still wouldn't work i tried to disable all that says boot it didn't work i tried to put the windows xp cd just to continue with the booting it didn't work it kept saying about problem and stuff like that so i don't know why this is happening it happens randomly and now it wouldn't even fix what should i do if your computer is not booting up at all it may be a problem with the bios if you are not the only one using it someone may have accidentally played around with it another issue is that a cable is not connected all the way anyways to get into the bios you usually press del right away some computers may be different it will bring up a screen and depending what bios you have the choices will be different navigate through the menus and find the boot up sequence make sure that the hard drive is selected as the first boot up now if you want to reinstall then you would want to change that but for now make sure that it is at the boot up choice and you will not see the cd booting does not exist Mac OS X Apple Computer Amazon.com Apple II family Mozilla Firefox BASIC programming language Microsoft Apple Macintosh HyperText Transfer Protocol Google Word processor Metadata Spyware Pointer Amiga C programming language Ajax (programming) Home computer Unicode Slashdot trolling phenomena Forth programming language IMac Commodore 64 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Meta tag MOS Technology 6502 Apple Newton ZX Spectrum Spamdexing Electronic commerce Google search BitTorrent Internet Computer On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Personal computer Search engine Windows Vista Visual Basic Federal Standard 1037C Web server Unix ITunes Music Store Mac OS X v10.4 CPU cache Embedded system Digital audio player IPod ITunes Website Floppy disk Uniform Resource Locator Web traffic Supercomputer Steve Wozniak Sun Microsystems Modem Cache Domain Name System IBM Computer workstation Trademark Interpreter (computing) Computer virus Apple Lisa Computer hardware Gmail Hash table Kademlia Perl Flickr Mac OS X v10.2 Computing Web crawler Atari 8-bit family NeXT Hacker Apple I Java programming language Computer-supported collaboration Book Hard disk Mac OS 9 Open source culture 64-bit MP3 IBM PC compatible Copyleft Python programming language Xerox Star Software patent debate Digital audio workstation Search engine optimization Fairlight CMI Software agent History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Disk magazine Wintel
