when you asking a question on yahoo do some people just give an answer that sucks like if you ask a question about selfishness then someone gives an answer that sounds pretty selfish in its self almost like they missed the point the question you asked their answer is kinda the reason why your asking the question kind of thing i get a lot good answers then some others are just really a waste of time you have that happen to you yes and it really sucks because i'm looking for real answers for my questions otherwise i wouldn't have asked them and what really makes me mad is when people don't pick a best answer i mean i spent a few minutes seriously thinking about the question and coming up with a good answer for it the least they could do is pick an answer i really hate it though when people just answer to make fun of the question or say something really irrelevant i usually just suck it up and hope that i got a decent answer out of it but yeah it definetly gets on my nerves Hiberno-English Social rule The nature of God in Western theology The Ashlee Simpson Show Have I Got News For You Time Out of Mind Little Britain The Young Ones (TV series) She Loves You New York Knicks Altruism Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Apprentice 2 Radio Yerevan Jon Secada Shaggy dog story U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Whose Line Is It Anyway?
