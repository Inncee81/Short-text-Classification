why are the homeless homeless besides not having a home or job i went up to a homeless guy once and asked him why he is homeless he just stated that he lost his job wife and kids home and now he is homeless i have lost those same things to and still here what is the real reason i also offered to help him the only thing i asked was for him to meat me at a certain place and time he never showed up i think you are a genius why because you have just asked a great question the real reason is just not that simple i think its mostly personal unless of course the person got kicked out of his house because everyone in the house were determined to kick him out of the house we can often be misled to thinking that most of the social problems are just as simple as they appear to be but really they are not keep questioning don't stop yahoo Homelessness Knots Landing Aerial (dance move) The Apprentice 2 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Moe Szyslak Sexual orientation Avenue Q What would Jesus do?
