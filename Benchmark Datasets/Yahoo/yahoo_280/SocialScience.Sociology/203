is there less war now than in the past in other words as time goes on does the incidence of war lessen there has never been a time in history as peaceful as now most likely hard to say since large chunks of human history was before recorded history the reduction in the amount of war has little to do with time a little to do with a tired populace mostly it has to do with the increased consequences of war because of technology there are cycles of war the most recent brought about gentleman's war in europe the preceeding years had so badly ravaged europe that the entire continent was not only on the verge but at times thrown into utter chaos cities were sacked killing all or nearly all who dwelled within entire populations decimated by the starvation brought on by war after a point the populations of europe became war weary just as ww ii and ww i has left european nations terrified of another war the level of destruction and the loss of a large chunk of a whole generation has left them exhausted as a people so for a time these peoples become peace loving nations having had their fill of war for a time eventually the past is forgotten and the cycle cranks up again technology has interupted this cycle the costs of war are too high for any nation now if nukes or biological weapons are used the us and ussr if not for nukes would have had a shooting war that lasted maybe a decade instead it lasted for decades with both nations fighting by proxy using third world nations as the battleground the primary reason was a shooting war would lead to the use of nukes and that would end the world for all today nukes are proliferating and the more countries that have them the more likely war will result unlike the us ussr cold war there are nations today seeking nukes that believe they can use them up until recently technology conventional and nuclear has served as a deterrent to war wars have happened in the third world not in developed nations the costs would be too high for developed nations to go to war even if no wmds were used conventional war with modern weapons means huge casualty counts tactics have not kept up with advancements in technology nor has defensive weapons so both civillian and military dead would be massive think about it if we were to go to war the factories would be rather close to where you live oil pipe lines technology centers research centers military bases important highways waterways bridges how many of us don't leave near one weapons don't always fall where they are supposed to a near miss could be your neighborhood or the nieghborhood of friends and relatives when conventional weapons can easily take out a square block and vaporize it think about millions of block busters hitting the nation during the course of the war ground troops with the armor support air support and so on this happening in both nations it makes a pretty good deterrent against going to war that is what war between developed nations will be like that is why there hasn't been one since ww ii technology has come a long way since then and ww ii was such a bloody war that it's scared two generations out of war so far Nuclear weapon Cold War Nuclear warfare Terran (StarCraft) World War II Economy of Africa Nuclear power Total war Nuclear weapons and the United States Mutual assured destruction Military history of the Soviet Union Kosovo War Gulf War Rise of Nations Peace movement Superpower Operation Barbarossa Iran-Iraq War Iran and weapons of mass destruction Soviet Union Vietnam War Famine 2003 Invasion of Iraq Weapon History of nuclear weapons Bloody Valentine War Polish September Campaign Military history Combine (Half-Life 2) Ozone depletion Second Bloody Valentine War Marshall Plan Iraq disarmament crisis British Army Winter War RAF Bomber Command War Franco-Prussian War Battle of the Bulge Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Blood (computer game) Ozone hole Royal Air Force Iraq Survey Group Armoured warfare John Titor Infantry Battle of Stalingrad Nuclear proliferation Future energy development Military history of Japan Zerg Terminal ballistics Early modern warfare United States Army Eastern Front (World War II) Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Yom Kippur War Asymmetric warfare Criticisms of the War on Terrorism Military history of the United States World War I Tank classification Counter-Strike Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Bombing of Dresden in World War II Red Army Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Napoleonic Wars Second Sino-Japanese War Energy development Battle of Kursk Siege Donald Rumsfeld Global warming Military history of the Roman Empire Protoss Anti-ballistic missile Guilty Gear William Perry War of the Pacific Modern warfare Solar cell Burma Campaign T-72 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Ground Control II: Operation Exodus
