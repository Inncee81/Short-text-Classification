why can't some people distinguish fiction from reality let's take the tv show friends for example when gunther told rachel that ross cheated on her some fangirl in real life bumped into the actor who plays gunther and just gave him a death stare and chewed him out for telling rachel about ross or fans would run into one of the writers and ask if ross and rachel are going to get together as if they're real people or if an actor plays a retarded character in a tv movie the actor gets treated like a retard or stupid when he's really not why do people do this don't they know that acting is just acting that those characters aren't real it's just a show and entertainment this has been studied i heard apparently people who watch a tv show regularly come to regard the regular characters as friends otherwise there might be schizophrenia involved scary Friends Gunther (Friends character) Actor Neighbours Red Dwarf Rachel Green Law & Order War of the Worlds (2005 film) Little Britain MTV Joey Tribbiani Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling slang Phoebe Buffay Family Matters (TV series) Mental illness Case Closed Television program Extras (sitcom) Hogan's Heroes Days of our Lives The One With the Blackout About a Boy A Beautiful Mind Highlander (film) The West Wing (television) Mental retardation Theory of conduct Another World (TV series) Blue Heelers Psychosis Garfield Ross Geller Intelligence quotient Social rule Tolkien fandom Tony Hancock Saturday Night Live Andy Kaufman Alias (TV series) Prank flash The Price Is Right Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Lisa Simpson The Inside Soap opera The Mary Tyler Moore Show Janice (Friends character) Chuck Cunningham syndrome The Truman Show Phoebe Buffay's songs Slash fiction Bullitt Chandler Bing Jeopardy! in culture Butters Stotch Paul Is Dead Peter Griffin Teen Girl Squad Something Awful Seinfeld Midnight Run Care Bears Superman III Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Motion picture rating system The Ashlee Simpson Show Big Brother (USA TV series) Controversies in autism Batman The Supremes Minor characters in Seinfeld Scary Go Round Channel 4 Nutrition The Godfather Narrator EastEnders Eric Cartman Guy Chambers Rachelle Waterman War of the Worlds (television) Savage Dawn The O.C.
