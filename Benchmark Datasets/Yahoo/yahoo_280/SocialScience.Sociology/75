who's more old fashioned in terms of social mores america or england just wondering what people think wow see i've never been to england but do have relatives from there and they are so different they're absolutely lovely people so different from us americans i'd love to move i feel like there has got to be a better place to live than here where almost everyone is spiteful defensive and generally beaten down i've lived in ca co ct ri ma and it's all the same maybe i'll visit them and move haha oh let's not forget the spoiled american brats please i think your question assumes that there is one culture in both the us and uk this is not the case the culture in small town texas is very different than in boston just the same the culture in a village in the midlands is nothing like birmingham you can find a place in both countries that match your preferences you just have to decide what is important to you and go looking that said and this is just an overall view in which you can find millions of examples to dispute this in my opinion the us is more old fashioned in sexual morality and the uk is more old fashioned in other types Sexual orientation Ethics Lawrence v.
