can someone help with a suggestion on a cross culture relationship my wife is chinese and she came to our western country in we have a boy aged yrs i am european however i have a big problem i cant seem to solve my wife insists she wants to teach him chinese and so she talks to him all the time in this language the issue is i dont mind her teaching him chinese but when our boy is doing something wrong or needs urgent attention she yells at him in chinese yet my wife knows english very well she keeps on speaking in chinese even though i try and teach him english so he can go to school and speak our native language without having to be confused i dont speak chinese but when i am speaking english she will insistantly keeps on in chinese to him even though his small knowledge of english is better than chinese i have spoken to her about my concerns but she refuses to listen i am very frustrated as i think that if she is in my country then she should speak our english is there any suggestions to solve this to add more pain to my situation over the last year she has slept with our boy and neglected our relationship she refuses to sleep with me and makes excuses for why she wont come to bed with me ie i dont shower i dont brush my teeth which i do of course and i get negativity from her instead of encouragement she isnt physical and emotionally attached with me and sits away from me and wont even look at me its a frightening scenario and this certainly wasnt what it was like when we first went out it's great to be bilingual we are bringing our daughter up to be kind of a necessity because daddy is deaf a bilingual child will have a smaller vocab in each language than a monolingual child but will have an overall greater vocab since they have two languages that your wife speaks chinese to your boy is no problem that she interrupts you speaking to your son is a problem you have every right to converse with your boy if you are speaking to him in english and he is out and about in the world he will learn english if there is any danger to his learning either language properly it is his chinese as he will hear less of it because it is the minority language by the time he gets to school age he should be a functional bilingual actually by his current age he should have a pretty clear idea on which language to use to which person i think you should encourage his chinese but stop your wife interrupting you i've known hearing kids with deaf parents who only signed to them they pick up english everywhere else in their life and are perfectly bilingual long before they get to school don't worry about it mother son relationships are very strong in chinese culture if i were you i'd do a bit of research about that norms in childraising vary a lot from family to family let alone between cultures what she's doing might be perfectly normal for chinese people even though it isn't for you i don't know i'm just suggesting a different avenue for you to consider once you've sussed out that you'll both have to come to a compromise Multilingual Second language acquisition Autism Infantilism Hearing impairment Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Singlish Philosophy of language Simplified Chinese character Franz Boas Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Deaf culture Chinese language Languages in the United States Korean language Shaggy dog story Ludwig Wittgenstein Domestic violence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Narcissism Family name Culture of Lithuania Education in the People's Republic of China Grief Friends Theodicy Theory of conduct About a Boy Hypnosis Autism rights movement Avenue Q Non-native pronunciations of English Esperanto as an international language American and British English differences Education in the United States Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Humphrey Bogart Love Welsh language Sociolinguistics Abortion debate African American Vernacular English Signing Exact English The Fairly OddParents The Shining (film) Alcoholics Anonymous W.I.T.C.H.
