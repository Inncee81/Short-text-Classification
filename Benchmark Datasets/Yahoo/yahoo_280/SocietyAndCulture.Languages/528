why is standard english referred to as correct or proper english standard english is only correct or proper according to standard english and those who prefer it why are so many people willing to accept new word formation as long as the new words are considered to be a part of standard english while criticizing sub languages dialects of english you're confusing standard with correct this is what i don't understand why is standard referred to as correct what does gangsta have to do with anything urban vernacular english is only one dialect what about canadian english is that incorrect okay standard english like most standards are only dialects the only issue is that they are considered the upper class or scholarly dialects for example british rp recieved pronounciation was right out of oxford college standard american has two forms it has the form which was from children growing up in different parts of the country and thusly not developing one true regional dialect but a more general one it also has the form which came from the upper class and was dictated by universities and such from the major cities the problem is standard doesn't like to be challenged or changed in fact they don't even think of themselves as a dialect though they are that's why they made it to be considered the only correct way to say it luckily no one large gives in to it and keeps regional dialects remember that dialects like languages have their own set of rules which they have to obey otherwise communication is lost and the whole point of language is communication german is like this as well the standard is called hochdeutsch high german and it's primarily in the south but plattdeutsch low german is heard in the north and sometimes one needs to know both remember those that speak the standard have the power so they will belittle the lesser dialects but linguists like myself know better and we promote dialects as long as communication is still there if it's not then we have another language almost hope that helps you can contact me if you want more on it German language Dialect English language Non-native pronunciations of English Dutch language Standard Mandarin American and British English differences American English Chinese language Newfoundland English Standard Cantonese Serbo-Croatian language Taiwanese (linguistics) English plural High Germanic languages International English Greek language Cantonese (linguistics) Inuktitut Regional accents of English speakers African American Vernacular English Tone (linguistics) Indian English Multilingual Mandarin (linguistics) South Slavic languages Slovak language Spanish language Germanic languages Hebrew language Vowel Standard language Hindustani language Russian language Danish language Gender-neutral language Swedish language Croatian language Philosophy of language Arabic language Swiss German Yiddish language Romanian language Mispronunciation Afrikaans Sanskrit Norwegian language Bulgarian language Korean language Southern American English Old English language Slavic languages Aramaic language Shtokavian dialect Quebec French Languages in the United States Finnish language New York-New Jersey English Austrian German Thai language High German consonant shift Italian language Differences in official languages in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia Jamaican English Spanish dialects and varieties Grammar Portuguese Creole Low German languages Webster's Dictionary Names given to the Spanish language Languages in the United Kingdom Manually Coded English Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diglossia Alemannic German Spanish pronouns Urdu Hangul Written Cantonese Linguistics English English History of the English Bible Athabaskan languages Political correctness British English Hindi Ukrainian language Tamil language
