i'm learning english can someone help me i'm not sure of what the difference is between sentences like the following ones i can't wait for the weekend to begin i can't wait that the weekend begins or i want you to bring me there i want that you bring me there are all correct or not if yes do they mean exactly the same or do you use them in different cases for example to emphasize some aspects of the request the above answers are correct but they haven't told you why which makes it hard for you to construct other sentences with a similar structure i can tell you that the structure i want that you bring me is not grammatically incorrect but that it is not colloquial in other words this is not the way native english speakers talk it just doesn't sound right we use such structures as these all the time i believe that i think that i wish that i hope that i demand that i insist that although just to confuse you we often leave out that i wish he would go away i hope you believe me but i want i love i hate and i like are followed by either a noun such as peace a pronoun such as you or a noun phrase such as you to take me there examples i want you to tell me the truth the dog likes me to play with him the baby loves me to tickle her tummy my boss hates me to be late for work my mother wants us to come over for dinner your girlfriend hates you to laugh at her hair they may also be followed by the infinitive of a verb i hate to lie i want to dance i can't wait i long i yearn are phrases that are followed by for plus a noun pronoun or noun phrase or just the infinitive of a verb such as i long to know i can't wait to see examples i long for an end to the war she yearns for love he can't wait for the end of the movie contrast i want an end to the war she wants love really the only way for you to become confident about choosing which structure to use is to listen all the time to native speakers talking on the bus on the radio in movies everywhere gradually you will become familiar with the commonly used phrases and colloquialisms and then you must use them yourself in real conversations good luck and i hope you enjoy learning english Bulgarian language Gender-neutral language German grammar English grammar Singlish Slovak language Finnish language Spanish verbs Swedish language Shit Non-native pronunciations of English Spanish language Japanese grammar Pronoun Gerund Czech language Japanese language Dutch language Hiberno-English Esperanto grammar Finnish grammar American and British English differences Grammatical aspect Greek language Korean language Grammatical gender Welsh language Grammatical mood Portuguese language French grammar English verbs Kapampangan language Tamil language Preposition Quebec French Hypercorrection Navajo language Philosophy of language Georgian language Japanese honorifics Subjunctive mood Sesotho language Proto-Indo-European language Sanskrit Second language acquisition Pleonasm Morphology (linguistics) Disputed English grammar Polish language English plural Vietnamese language English language Grammar Esperanto as an international language German language Ido Grammatical number Japanese particles God and gender Chinese grammar Infinitive Written Cantonese Spanish pronouns French language Italian grammar Chinglish Brazilian Portuguese Esperanto vocabulary Dutch grammar Indian English Article (grammar) Meaning Literary language Hong Kong English Adjective Dative case Relative clause Expletive Arabic grammar Umlaut Figure of speech Ubykh language Spoken Finnish E-Prime Burmese language Inflection Shibboleth Hindi Vulgar Latin African American Vernacular English Dual (grammatical number) Kanji Latin grammar Serbo-Croatian language Varieties of Arabic
