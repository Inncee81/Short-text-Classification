i'm sorry what did you say i can't hear you i'm afraid i'm beginning to lose my hearing i am very frightened by the thought of such an outcome i found out when i was talking to one of my friends and someone else was talking to me but i had my back to them and i didn't hear them at all they were standing right behind me also my fianc needed help unloading the car and called for my help and i didn't hear it she was screaming ironically i've already learned bsl because i was interested in the deaf community but now that i'm becoming deaf i just feel disabled in some way do you know any way to become adjusted to something like this should i embrace it or should i try to ignore it sorry if this isn't making any sense but i'm quite scared confused and a bit annoyed that this is happening to me all help would be appreciated p s i don't think that people who are death have a disease or anything it's just different when you've been able to hear your whole life and now it's suddenly going away my advice is to go to the doctor it may not be anything perminant of course it's frightening it's nothing to be ashamed of and it doesn't mean you have anything against the deaf community your doctor will tell you what's going on and how to proceed from here i hope everything works out Hearing impairment Milton H.
