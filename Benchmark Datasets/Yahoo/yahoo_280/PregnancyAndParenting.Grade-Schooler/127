my year old daughter has become very clingy to me i have asked her if she is being bullied at school brownies etc and also if anyone has upset her within her close friends and family and all the answers are the same which is no i ask her why she wants to be with me all the time and her reply is that she loves me she has also said that she doesn't want to go back to her out of school activities which she has always been happy to go to we had two close family friends pass away last year and it is the only thing that i can think of that is worrying her i am looking for any advice sensible only please to help her overcome this little phase that she seems to be going through i am worried that she is missing out on her childhood by clinging to my apron strings i am a protective mum but looking for a happy medium i think there could be several possibilities for your daughter's behavior the death of anyone that a child knows is traumatic death is final and most kids and adults have trouble coping depending on your religion your daughter may be unsure about what happens after someone dies i think that talking to her to explain your views or having your pastor set things straight might ease her mind adults underestimate kids' need to know and sometimes take the position that the less information the better which is not true in my experience i will discuss it for a long or often and as frank as they want i try not to sugar coat the info it only leads to confusion also were the deaths by accident long illness sudden illness discuss the cause with your daughter to try to ease her fears mary went to the doctor and the doctor said that her heart was not working right and it quit working like it should and she died your daughter may be worried about losing you to a sudden illness or accident if the other occurred were unexpected at your daughter realizes that she is suppose to be growing up and she's scared to grow up because once she's grown up she's not suppose to be a momma's girl anymore at she figures she can get by with being clingly because she's but she realizes that this won't go on forever or she'll be uncool be patient be loving be supportive don't push her to grow up maybe start treating her like she's somewhat grown up but not totally sit and read with her tuck her in a night she may be being bullied but is afraid to admit it ask the brownie leader or teacher to pay attention without being obvious and then check back my guess is that she's just scared of growing up and who could blame her good luck Pitaten Shaggy dog story Milton H.
