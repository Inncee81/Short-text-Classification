school lunche ideas my daughter started school last year and ate the school lunch i noticed that she gained quite a bit of weight over the school year and wasn't thinking about the lunch she is a very active child dance gymnastics karate on her own accord so it wasn't lack of activity since she started summer camp i have been making her lunches altough not the healthiest i believe better after reading all of the articles i think it was the lunch often times she didn't like the food so would have a bologna sandwich before then she had never had bologna i don't like it so had no idea about the fat and calories now she loves bologna i need ideas for lunches that are better for her she only eats roast beef or bologna sandwiches she doesn't eat carrots any ideas of how to keep dip cool for celery sticks any help will do i am not a parent stuck of having a thin kid healthy will do for me nothing with mayo she hates mayo i'm going to assume your daughter is or i would skip the sandwiches altogether unless you're giving her whole wheat and her school allows you to send peanut butter some don't so make sure first try sending some healthy home made soups in a thermos fresh fruits grapes berries pack well and are easy to eat and whole grain pretzels why limit her to just celery try bell pepper rings cucumber slices cherry tomatoes broccoli cauliflower etc my kids believe that triscuit thins and a wedge of light laughing cow cheese in their lunch is a very special treat other options include graham crackers sugar free jello cups fat free pudding cups apple sauce cups light yogurt etc allow her to choose items for her very own trail mix my kids love teddy grahams raisins and other dried fruit nuts again check with your daughter's school cheerios or whatever cereal we happen to have on hand throw in a few mini marshmallows chocolate chips or m m's as a special treat but don't go overboard on them try whole grain bagels with low fat cream cheese or peanut butter another treat that my kids look forward to is a slice of leftover pizza the first time i snuck that into my son's lunch he came home and said that wasn't lunch that was thanksgiving the above idea of freezing the juice box is a good one but make sure it's juice and contains no high fructose corn syrup another idea is to freeze grapes whatever you do offer her a variety it's easy to get stuck in a rut and soon she'll get sick of eating even her favorite foods Food Cuisine of the Philippines Vegetarian cuisine Tofu Milk McDonald's Barbecue Ice cream French cuisine Cuisine of Africa Food preservation Salad Cuisine of the Southern United States Russian cuisine Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Vegetarianism MRE Veganism Fruit Ramen Cold Stone Creamery Yoghurt Porridge Camp Lazlo Cha chaan teng Kit Kat Peanut butter Peruvian cuisine Chocolate Dairy Korean cuisine Tea Cantonese cuisine Hamster D__ner kebab Soup Street food Cuisine of Singapore Snack food Dim sum Rice pudding French fries Chili con carne Pancake Fast-food restaurant Soul food In-N-Out Burger Tomato Roman eating and drinking Coffee Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Brazil Peanut Potato Butter Happy Meal Oreo Cheerios Bengali cuisine Garfield Comanche Fish and chips Serbian cuisine Ketchup Kebab Bacon Kraft Foods Cake Kosher foods Mnemonic Apple Cuisine of Vietnam Omega-3 fatty acid Cookie Kellogg Company Fanta Domesticated turkey Girl Scout cookies Cuisine of Canada
