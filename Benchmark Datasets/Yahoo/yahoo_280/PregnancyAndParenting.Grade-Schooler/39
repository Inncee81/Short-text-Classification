school im worried how manny kids get dropped of a block away from their home in middle school and is it dangerous to be dropped off that far away and i have been to public school my whole life and this year its public school im scared that the kids wont like me biggest mistake most new kids make acting shy the kids can think you are stuck up i know it doesn't make sense but try acting as outgoing as you ever felt don't worry your ears won't fall off if they don't fall in love with you on day one you probably need time to get to know them to are you in danger when you are dropped off were you in private school first your question says public both times i really think you can't worry over stuff out of your controll if you see a problem speak up to someone like your parents or teachers but otherwise coming from someone who went from private to public school it's gonna seem scary loosen up because they for some reason do not seem to know it is scary for you they seem to want to know everything about you with no reservations you are more than capable of doing this just focus on being as outgoing as you have ever been not fake mind you just your most bubbly self i hope that helps The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule The Fairly OddParents Time Out of Mind Hey Arnold!
