is to young to let my daughter shave she is constanly asking me to let her shave her legs part of me wants to let her because her legs are quite hairy and the hair is pretty dark but on the other hand i think is a little to young what to you guys think everyone develops differently if your daughter's legs are hairy with dark hair and she is self concious because its noticeable let her shave show her what she needs to do and help her as much as you can age is just a number when it comes to the development of a young girl's body also at that age she may be taking gym in school and having to change in front of other girls and the ridule she can receive because of not being allowed to shave is so much worse than we really want to admit its hard wanting to let your baby girl grow up but truth is it happens just sooner for some than others Kodocha Hair Tarantula Pubic hair Beard Social role of hair Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Leg shaving Shaving Skinhead Haircut Tenchi Muyo!
