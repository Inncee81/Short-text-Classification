i'm a sigle dad looking for a book about sex ed for my year old daughter i've been told it's not too early to teach her i either need a book i can read or one we can read together to help explain what she needs to know at this age there is a great book called ''flight of the stork'' that covers the subject of sex talk from birth to age might be worth it for you to look into it my mom had this rule where if we asked about something she would answer i don't think it is ever to early but it depends on how graphic you get so at this age keep it pretty basic and if she has questions be as honest as you can without getting to detailed i applaud you for taking this time to find out rather than avoiding the question great job additional info i see a lot of people telling you to wait until she is or tell you that you must be joking and you should have her stick to barbies and girlie stuff my mother is a social worker who works with teen parents her youngest teen parent was years old the girl became sexually active when she was ten years old is too late to first start talking about the birds and the bees also when other people say that books shouldn't teach kids about sex that is incorrect books offer a good introduction to your talk if you feel like you do not know what to say a book is a good way to start the discussion you structure it just like a lesson begin with an introduction answer her questions during the reading and explain the story after the reading Joke Social rule Theory of conduct Kodocha Sex education Human sexual behavior Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain About a Boy Survivor (novel) Child sexuality Calvin and Hobbes Kurt Cobain Avenue Q Shaggy dog story The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Married... with Children Plame affair Discordianism Transactional analysis Age of consent English grammar Sexual orientation Laura Schlessinger Titans (comics) Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Garfield Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adolescence $ale of the Century The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Futurama (TV series - season 5) Teenage pregnancy U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Infantilism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Graduate school Prostate cancer Great Teacher Onizuka Milton H.
