your kid needs something instead of taking them to the store they insist they are old enough to make a responsible purchase reluctantly you give them the money what did they need and what did they buy this can be hypothetical or a true story i once had a stepson that needed baseball shoes and an athletic cup for little lge he insisted he could make a responsible purchase he comes back home an hr later and he bought his shoes a size larger which was perfect because we hoped he would be able to wear them again next season he's yrs old but he bought a large athletic cup we said shawnee why'd you buy the large size he said that's ok i'll grow into it true story linda nowhere was i endorsing this the above incident was the only time this took place for me but i'm also saying hypothetically which opens the door for a creative humorous false answer as these things go that is a responsible decision for an year old sounds like a smart kid to me Nike, Inc.
