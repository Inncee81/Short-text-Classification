teacher seeking parent's opinions i work in a great school where the majority of the kids come from low socioeconomic families and the parents do not have a higher education beyond high school most of the teachers i know complain about it i don't i love talking to parents and working with them to show them how to help their child i would like some feedback from parents of elementary school kids or just parents regarding the importance of the teacher's role in parental involvement in other words can you give me some friendly suggestions on what you would like to see a teacher doing for your child or for you to help your child succeed thank you while i have had some college education i still have a difficult time understanding some of the things the teachers try to tell me regarding my sons' homework not because i'm stupid but because it's been a long time since i was in school and had to worry about it and things have gotten a bit more difficult since then what i would like for my sons' teachers to know is that while i am not stupid and can help my sons' with their homework i am also a working mother and up until recently a single working mother who tends to spend more time at work than she does at home with her awake children so it really helps me out a lot when the teacher allows time in class to get actual homework assignments done instead of going over the basics then assigning homework to take home i can also say that while i can help my kids with their homework there are times where even i don't understand the questions if i send them back to school with their homework incomplete it means that i helped them with as much as i could figure out and i need your help for them to finish it because i can't explain it to them well enough because even i don't understand it Homework Education in the People's Republic of China Education Theory of conduct Saved by the Bell Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Extreme Programming Kodocha GED Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Calvin and Hobbes Recurring South Park characters Laura Schlessinger No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania Education in Taiwan Shaggy dog story Androgen insensitivity syndrome Gifted Ludwig Wittgenstein Education in India Teach the Controversy Education in the United States Education in Japan Intelligence quotient African American Vernacular English Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Primary education Education in Germany Kender About a Boy Social rule Generation Y Charter school Intelligent design movement Philosophy of language The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Asperger syndrome Homeschooling Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education in South Korea Brown v.
