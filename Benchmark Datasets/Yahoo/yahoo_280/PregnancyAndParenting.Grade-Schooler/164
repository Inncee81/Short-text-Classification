after school chores for an year old girl year old boy i'm looking to get a list together for my kids of afterschool chores do you have some good ideas and ways to reinforce it they will be with an afterschool babysitter this is during the time before i get back from work and i'm not looking for them to clean my house lol i just think they should have one or two responsibilites that they should make sure are done during the week maybe times a week where they'll get a signficant allowance that they already get for just making their bed whew it's not child slavery it's called teaching responsibility my son has responsibilities vs chores he is responsible for feeding the dog taking him out doing the recycle picking up after himself and juts recently dishes he is also he then gains rewards for being responsible such as computer or playstation time monetary gain or just a plain old hug and thank you i like this approach better because it teaches him what being a member of a family is and also shows him that if he does what is expected then good things will come his way sometimes i find him going out of his way to help just so he can earn extra computer time he will ask is there anything i can help with today that's when i know i am being an effective parent mentor and father Dog training The Fairly OddParents Gender role Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Sumo About a Boy Justification (theology) Melanie Wilkes Dogville Spice Girls Infantilism Roots: The Saga of an American Family Calvin and Hobbes Second language acquisition Day care RISC B3ta Garfield Cowboy Bristol Grammar School Judaism Milton H.
