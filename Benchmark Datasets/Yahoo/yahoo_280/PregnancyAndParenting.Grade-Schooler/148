help my and half year old keeps being mean to other children prof 's and parents that went through it i have a and a half year old daughter and this has been the fourth time in her life that she displayed being mean to other children the first time was when she was about and i walked in on her yelling at her cousin that is a year younger than her and i told her about it and made her appologize and she stood in the corner the second time was about weeks ago when we went away on vacation and she clawed her other cousin on his arms and legs for no reason she was punished for that also but when asked why she did it she said no reason the rd time was about days later and she shoved him to the floor when asked why she said she didnt know why by this time i was fully fed up and since i'm months pregnant her father made it to her before i did which was a good thing for her cause he sent her to the corner after yelling at her then today i went to pick up a friend of mines and her yr old and she bit the little girl finger while in the car again for no reason please help i agree with the other poster that these are seperate incidents and more than likely related to the new baby on the way however just sticking her in the corner probably isn't enough of a punsihment for her to think about her actions before she does it again all standing in a corner does to a kid really is well take a few minutes out fo their day all goes back to normal in to minutes it's time for the punsihment to fit the crime she needs to have something taken away from her something she covets either a special show on tv or a favorite toy and not just for an hour this item needs to be taken from her for several days and when she asks about it she can be reminded by you exactly why she can't have it when she does get it back it is yet another time to remind her why she is getting it bac and what will happen if she hurts someone again if she hurts someone again while the item is taken away then she loses two things etc but hopefully that won't happen on the other side of the coin though make sure you praise her for her good efforts and even moreso after the baby is born make sure you put away special time for just her where baby won't get in the way of it About a Boy EastEnders The Inside Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Father's Day (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Shaggy dog story The Amazing Race Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Columbine High School massacre One Tree Hill (TV series) Sharon Tate Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Teen Girl Squad Alois Hitler 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Professional wrestling holds Time Out of Mind The Adventures of Pete & Pete Escape from New York Breastfeeding Knots Landing The Shining (film) Neighbours Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wheel of Fortune Xiaolin Showdown Shawn Michaels Pitaten Baby Blues Phoebe Halliwell The Price Is Right Aerial (dance move) The Family from One End Street The Catcher in the Rye Jam (TV series) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Charmed Blonde on Blonde Ron Weasley RuneScape quests Sydney Riot of 1879 Kender Silent Night, Deadly Night Days of our Lives Blood on the Tracks Fancy Crane The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Apprentice 2 Sin City Babe Ruth's Called Shot Hansel und Gretel Colony in Space Good Times Romulus and Remus Boston Public Friends Vegeta Characters of Lost Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Luke and Laura Spencer Incarnations of Immortality George Costanza Russian joke The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Professional wrestling attacks History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Hollywood Squares True Crime: Streets of LA Ben Johnson (athlete) One Life to Live Inspector Gadget Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban My Family (television) Jean Grey Mojave people Ocean's Twelve Ron and Fez Garfield She Loves You Salad Fingers Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism
