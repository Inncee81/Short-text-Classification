my sons friends are'nt being looked after properly my son is and plays with particular friends they come from different families but neither of them have any parents at home who cook a meal for them or provide drinks or lunch during the day one child has no mum and his dad is out most of the time and relies on his year old sister to cook i am feeding these kids good home cooked food for dinner most night as they seem to exist on rubbish at home i dont mind doing it sometimes but its becoming a habit and getting rather expensive i cant approach the parents as one dad is an alchoholic and a bully and the other just isnt there i am more concerned with the children not getting a good meal than the money aspect but it cant go on forever i feel responsible although i know i shouldnt any ideas please well done to you and i am sure these boys think highly of you for the care you give them i would also be concerned with the 'love' aspect too all kids need a hug and if these parents are so distant not to be able to provide the basic food and water then they are highly unlikely to show them a great deal of care or love it may be worth mentioning to social services if you feel unable to approach the parents directly also give the boys a hug i am sure they both need one still i take my hat off to you you're obviously a brilliant mum with attention to detail you children are going to grow into well adjusted adults because of the care and time you put into them About a Boy Food Hikikomori Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Care Bears Fecal incontinence Meal Motivation Pitaten EastEnders Laura Schlessinger Parenting The Adventures of Pete & Pete Comanche Social rule The Brady Bunch Hypoglycemia Only Fools and Horses Little Britain Second language acquisition Breastfeeding Child sexuality Recurring South Park characters Friends W.I.T.C.H.
