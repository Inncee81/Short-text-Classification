i have a year old who still wears nighttime underwear how can i stop him from peeing in the bed good question but the problem is some kids don't stop until they get way older our daughter would pee in the bed until a little older than your son and if she gets scared of anything she will still do it to this day no matter what we do and she is now you have to try teaching them to go to the bathroom even in the middle of the night but some kids just don't grow out of it for many years good luck to you and i hope he does grow out of it soon just work with him and be patient Kimberly-Clark Corporation The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Avenue Q El Chavo del Ocho Ron and Fez Milton H.
