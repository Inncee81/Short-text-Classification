can't get my kid to wear her patch my daughter has a sever eye problem she is nearly blind in her right eye i have been taking her to specialist and we are putting contacts and glasses and patching the good eye the doctor wants the patching to be done for at least hours day i am lucky if i can get min out of her after to min she starts crying i ignore the crying and tell her she has to wear and then she just goes into her room and falls asleep and then when she gets up i put the patch back on and she does the same thing she cries more and then falls back asleep i tried to explain that to the doctor yesterday but he says that the patching needs to be done how is it being effect if all she is doing is crying and sleeping with the patch on fyi my daughter is years old maybe you can think of a good reward system i don't think this would be a time where that could be harmful as eye patch wearing is not considered a fashionable thing maybe think of something she really really likes and doesn't get very often and tell her you'll do that thing on saturday if she wears her patch hours a day until then and then keep it up for continuing weeks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Characters of The Sandman Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Electrophysiology Jam (TV series) Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) About a Boy Soap opera Sleep Characters in the Smurfs The Amber Spyglass Sin City The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters The Contender (television series) Conker's Bad Fur Day Boom Town (Doctor Who) STS-62 The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Amblyopia Diabetic retinopathy Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Narcolepsy Psoriasis Gia Carangi The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Doctor Dances One Piece minor characters Eyeglass prescription Sunglasses The Silence of the Lambs Hansel und Gretel Time Out of Mind The Catcher in the Rye The Caves of Androzani Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Ocean's Twelve Cenodoxus Star Wars: Galaxies One (Voyager episode) Paul Is Dead Futurama (TV series - season 5) Gemini 7 Kimi Finster Dialysis Frankie Laine 613 mitzvot Gemini 6A Kodocha The Care Bears (television series) Friends Conspiracy (TNG episode) Tire The Unquiet Dead Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Incarnations of Immortality Solar eclipse Oh My Goddess!
