yr old and a peroid i live in a brand new neighborhood and there are only about houses my yr old wanted someone to play with so we introduced ourselves to the neighbors the only other child in the neighborhood is an yr old she is a really sweet child and my daughter loves her to death the problem is that this girl started her peroid the other day and she told my daughter all about it its ok that she knows i would have told her about it anyway but i wish she hadnt how would you feel i didnt make a big deal out of it i just felt like she is a little too young to understand maybe she will forget it alot of people are saying the age gap is too big it might be if you were in a place where there were other options however as long as the year old is responsible things are probably fine it's not like she was teaching your daughter to do drugs having a period is not the same thing as having sex so how should the year old have known that it was inappropriate don't worry about it your daughter won't really care in a few days Marilyn Monroe Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Kodocha Social rule About a Boy Milton H.
