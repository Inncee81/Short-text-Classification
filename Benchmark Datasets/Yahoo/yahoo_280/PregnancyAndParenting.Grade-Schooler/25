question about my son and kindergarten here is the situation my son is going to be five on august my husband and i have decided not to send him to kindergarten until he is six my husband was a late summer baby as were two of my younger brothers and they all struggled in grade school i have enrolled him in pre k at our local school here which is the same schedule as half day kindergarten i do think that he needs something to do since he will be five now though my grandparents my friends a lot of people are telling me that i am making a huge mistake by not sending him to kinder this year so for parents who have been through this what do you think the reason my friends and family are objecting is because they say he is smart enough well he is he knows his abc's can count to etc the reason i really decided to hold him back was because i do have some reservations about him emotionally and socially he also has a hard time with small motor skills like writing his name he struggles really hard to just accomplish it he shows no interest in coloring would rather be playing trucks or throwing a ball i am told this is very common for boys our pre k program here is very academically based they will be learning math how to read ect it not just a pre school maybe that is what my family and friends don't understand the reason my friends and family are objecting is because they say he is smart enough well he is he knows his abc's can count to etc the reason i really decided to hold him back was because i do have some reservations about him emotionally and socially he also has a hard

school maybe that is what my family and friends don't understand i have no idea why the additonal details posted three times sorry guys computer is freaking out on me well my first reason for answering your question is because my birthday is also august next is because some of the issues you're describing sound like my daughter she was born in january so she was fine to start but it didn't go so well she has a lot of social problems some fine motor issues only with bilateral activities and severe sensory issues i think you are correct for not sending him you're the mother you take care of him every day these other people are a small part of his life and grandparents are the worst everything i do with my kids is wrong in the eyes of my parents on another note if he is struggling to write it may hurt and he may not have developed a decent grip yet he could also have low muscle tone or just weak hands in that position this first link is where i get most of my daughter's stuff on the left side there are links and you want to look at fine motor fun finger strengtheners and handwriting when he uses crayons make sure they're broken into smaller pieces which helps promote the proper grip with pencils also use smaller ones with a big fat grip on them our favorite being the jumbo pencil grip also instead of having him sit to color or write tape the paper to a wall or use an easel or chalk board because that position also encourages proper grip one really good activity is using theraputty expensive and you can make your own putty and hiding the little pieces from a lite bright and he has to use his fingers to find all the pieces and then re hide them does he write too hard if so he may need more 'input' to feel the pencil you could use a vibrating pen which is also really fun to use because is makes squiggles or weighted things on his pencil they also have raised line paper to help see and feel where the lines are or colored line paper you could do yourself for better visual clues does he write too light something weighted or a pressure sleeve helps and again the same activities as above for the colored line paper use college ruled paper and trace the first line blue middle line leave and don't dash and the bottom line is green to write right start at the sky and pull down to the ground http www therapyshoppe com index php i unoffically homeschool my kids and i use these sites a lot i found with my daughter she needs a few worksheets to do before she's really ready to write right sometimes she just needs to scribble to work out any cramps or antsy ness use this year to work with him on his handwriting not penmenship and lots of social stuff outside of te preschool http www dltk kids com http www coloringbookfun com http www tlsbooks com Drawing
