when should i tell my year old the truth about santa claus i thought about this subject often i ended up thinking it through and decided that when my kids ask me if there really is a santa claus i'm going to say yes because there is he may not be a little fat guy that comes down your chimney and leaves presents under the tree but he is definitely real he lives as the spirit of giving and every parent that creates a special christmas for their children or anyone else they love is inhabited by the spirit of santa claus therefore they are santa claus therefore he is real my daughter is but when she hears about santa being a fake here's my plan i'm going to show her the story of santa claus by finding books or information online and explain to her the spirit of santa claus i will tell her that somebody she loves and who loves her very much is being just like santa claus and making a special christmas and when she is old enough to ask about it she will also be old enough to be a santa claus so every christmas after she learns the truth she will get to do a project to create a special christmas for someone she loves so she can feel how wonderful it is to be santa claus Santa Claus Christmas Silent Night, Deadly Night The Nightmare Before Christmas Avenue Q Rent (musical) Saint Nicholas About a Boy A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas Christmas tradition Santa Claus: The Movie Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special) Rankin/Bass The McGuire Sisters Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban E.
