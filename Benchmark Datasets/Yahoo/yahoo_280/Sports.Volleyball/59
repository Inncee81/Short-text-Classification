jump serve troubles ok i have my normal serve down but im working on my jump and im getting frusterated i do the step wit hleft throw it up step with my right and then jump off my left but i cant get it over either it goes a weird direction or it hits the net what do you suggest and how do you do it hi try practicing a standing jump serve first that is toss and swing like a jump serve without actually running or jumping this way you will learn how to hit the ball with control and hard enough to get it in you need to toss the ball up high and swing through the ball like you are hitting a spike but you need to hit it upwards a little so it will go over the net once you get that down you can then progress to a quick jump and then a full run and jump good luck Volleyball Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fast bowling Swingout Professional wrestling attacks Baseball Softball Baseball Stars Table tennis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Serve (tennis) Badminton GunZ The Duel Glossary of American football Aerial (dance move) Parachuting Mario Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Pole vault Guilty Gear Four square Golf Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Coin flipping Ty Cobb Cricket The Legend of Zelda series enemies Piccolo Junior Saga DDT (professional wrestling) Craps Equine conformation Tag Figure skating Tennis 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup Billiards Rugby union positions Mills Mess Professional wrestling holds Batting (cricket) Laws of cricket Types of bowlers in cricket Dodgeball Indian Oil Cup 2005 1957 World Series Glossary of partner dance terms International League Lemmings 2: The Tribes Tenshinhan Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Circle (dance move) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Cheerleading Super Mario Kart Items in the Metroid series Bubble Bobble Side pass (dance move) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Beer Pong Swing bowling English cricket team Ravi Shastri Strike zone Seishun Academy Middle School Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sandy Koufax Pittsburgh Steelers Diving Gary Sheffield Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Charleston (dance move) Himura Kenshin Robot Master Lindy Hop Girls Aloud Glossary of climbing terms Team Fortress Classic Yorker Glossary of ballet terms Escape from New York Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Baseball statistics Fielding (cricket) First baseman Sonic Advance 3 Piledriver (professional wrestling) Stolen base No ball Knuckleball Shogi Olympic medalists in athletics (men) BZFlag Wrigley Field American football Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Unreal Pitcher Satchel Paige
