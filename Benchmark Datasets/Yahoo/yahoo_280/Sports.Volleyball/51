in volleyball what rules apply to the ball making contact with an oppenent through the net the question is whether the opponent commits a foul by making contact with the ball even though it is separated by the net from the opponent or whether the contact with the ball is ignored in such a situation say both opponents go up to play the ball but the ball goes into the net and makes contact with opponent on the other side of the net are there consequences or is it ignored hi there are no consequences if the ball goes into the net and the net ball hits the opponent on the other side you are not allowed to touch the net but there is an exception if the ball pushes the net into you it is ok also if the ball goes into the net and and hits you the other team can still play it off the net it doesn't count as a hit on your side so the other team doesn't get another attempts to get it over about years ago there was a trend to take advantage of this rule if you are blocking keep your hands up and near the net if the ball goes into the net if you are quick you can move your hand near it and make a fist when the ball hits the net and then your fist it will take a weird bounce and be harder for the other team to play it off the net all perfectly legal Volleyball Table tennis Water polo Snooker Eight ball Baseball Basketball Tennis Four square Softball Professional wrestling match types Badminton Cricket Australian rules football Field hockey Glossary of American football Rugby union Canadian football Ultimate (sport) Football (soccer) Beer Pong Ice hockey Baseball statistics Beach volleyball Dodgeball Laws of cricket Backgammon Batting (cricket) American football Team handball Billiards Racquetball Serve (tennis) Tenshinhan Interference (baseball) Leg before wicket Tag Fast bowling Comparison of Canadian and American football Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers American handball Tackle (football) Seishun Academy Middle School Professional wrestling aerial techniques Piccolo Junior Saga Blackjack Paintball Umpire (cricket) American football strategy Pinball GunBound Football Indoor football Lacrosse Professional wrestling holds Super Bowl XXVII Squash (sport) Floorball No ball Touch football (rugby league) Fielding (cricket) Down (football) Boxing Onside kick Out (baseball) Appeal play Rugby league Wing Chun Golf club (equipment) Betting (poker) First baseman Professional wrestling National Football League Snap (American football) Determinism 2005 World Series Punt (football) Martial art Stolen base Croquet Korfball 2005 NFL season Shogi Collision detection Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Poker jargon Volley Penalty (ice hockey) Pitcher Tennis shots Strike zone Laws of the Game 2004 World Series
