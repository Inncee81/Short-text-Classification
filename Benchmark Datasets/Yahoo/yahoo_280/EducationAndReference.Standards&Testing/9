what would be better for me see details the sat or act i am an incoming junior and highschool and it's time for me to decide if i want to take the sat the act or both i'm very strong in reading and writing english especially spelling and grammar etc i'm decent at science but i'm pretty bad at math the only math i'm good at is geometry and even then i'm not that good other than that i have a good knowledge of history and i can usually ace any history test without studying also any reccomendations for prep classes in the houston area first off if you are taking the sat i reasoning than history and science would not matter at all if you are taking the act then you will need science on top of english and math the reason why the act was establish was because the sat is a bit bias towards guys since guys normallly score better on math than girls on the act it is more comprehensive and more about what you have learned while the sat is an predictive test the act would probably be better for you since you are better at the english component the science component of the act has a very big reading comprehension component in terms of the english component i would have to say that the act is more focused on reading comprehension while the sat is more focused on the grammar part nevertheless i suggest you take both the act and the sat because people tend to score higher on one test than the other it never hurts to give yourself extra chances and if cost is a problem you can always apply for fee waviers good luck SAT Education in the United States Mathematics Education in Romania Graduate school Sex and intelligence GED Education in Taiwan Education in England Test (student assessment) American and British English differences Junior Certificate Intelligence quotient Homeschooling Independent school (UK) Tripartite System Theory of conduct Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China Industrial engineering Academia Graduate Record Examination Dyslexia Quizbowl Grade (education) Avenue Q Advanced Placement Program Noam Chomsky Physics Second language acquisition English grammar Secondary education Caulfield Grammar School Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Inflation Education in Australia College admissions Regents (Examinations) Philosophy of mathematics Psychology Poker jargon Cognitive bias Logic Charter school Standardized testing Science The Princeton Review Science fiction Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Lynbrook High School Appeal Extreme Programming No Child Left Behind Act Doomsday argument IBM PC compatible Education reform Productive and unproductive labour Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Aerial (dance move) Hunter College High School Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Numerology Grammar schools in the United Kingdom Grammar Scientific method Linguistics Education in Germany George Lakoff Model (economics) Product Lifecycle Management Central processing unit Causality Teen Girl Squad Martial art Stuyvesant High School Medicine Ra (board game) Esperanto as an international language Chinese character Randomness ELO rating system Education in Singapore University of Waterloo Dictionary Natural deduction String theory Race and intelligence Pittsburgh Steelers CPU cache Great Teacher Onizuka Troy High School Social rule North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Spanish language Hardware random number generator Sociology Where Mathematics Comes From Programme for International Student Assessment
