do colleges or univesity look at ur sat score from high school for sat expert only or college students what i dont really get is sometime when i check out colleges board com the website in it they had sat score for colleges that colleges its required does colleges look at ur sat score when u apply for it or does they look at ur all of ur high school grade or even both n what if it the end of juinor year n i took my sat exam n had bad scores on it can take it again is sat score important for colleges or the grade that all i had for now plzzz help me im jus really clueless it for my future okay colleges look at ure sat is u submit it to them and they want it for their application process some colleges could care less tho they prob want an act or they are international schools for the most part schools need ure sat 's and 's so whatever data they have at the time that u apply is all the data that they want to look at so u apply in november december and thats all the look at the first or marking periods of senior year back untill th grade if you take it at the end of ure junior year and u are dissatisfied with ure grade u can study up in the summer and take it again in october this should be the last one that u can take while still being on track for ure application deadlines schools do not look kindly upon u missing ure application date but if u call then when u apply and tell them that u are taking ure sat a little later than they deadline im talking a matter or a week or some schools are lenient and will let u submit it to them anyway most schools when deciding upon who is accepted rejected have a point system depending on what they are looking for this year sat grade class rank extra curriculars recommendations essay awards just for example sat and grade will always be the defining points of any school for information on what the student body looks like and therefore what it looks like to be a student in their next upcoming class i would go to the schools individual website and look for a student profile or something to that effect good luck College admissions Education in the United States Grade (education) GED Advanced Placement Program Graduate school High school A-level Education in Germany Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology National Certificate of Educational Achievement IB Diploma Programme UCAS Juris Doctor Law school Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Junior Certificate Trinity College, Dublin College Lynbrook High School Education in Japan Barrister Education in Taiwan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Physician Education in Portugal Numerus clausus Secondary education in France Law School Admissions Test Appeal Prostate cancer International Mathematical Olympiad Affirmative action Education in Singapore Education in Sweden Education in Hong Kong Football (soccer) Education Secondary education in the United States Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Canada Baccalaur__at Chiropractic British honours system Lawyer College and university rankings Brown University Peer review American and British English differences Act of Parliament Patent application Independent school (UK) CPU cache Victorian Certificate of Education Doomsday argument Scholarship Economics Bush v.
