cna certification skills exam please help okay so i have to take the skills part of the cna state exam and i was just wondering from all of you people out there who have taken it what kind of skills did they ask you to perform i figure if i get some examples of what they might ask i would be less stressed out right now thanks i also had to transfer a resident this one was a stroke victim with left side weakness from bed to wheelchair i made sure to wash my hands when i came into the room and talk the resident through everything i was doing we did not have a sink to wash hands in but i made the motions and said i'm washing my hands they must have been tired of hearing that because they just rolled their eyes and said ok continue i kind of thought that i had failed because of their attitude but i passed be sure to use gate belts etc when doing the test would not hurt to wear one to the test some people had to do occupied bed changes sheets and some had to assist with ambulation i doubt you'll be tested on changing attends unless it was a dummy not my brother and actual mannequin in the bed just be sure to talk to your resident and explain everything and don't forget hand washing you should be fine Certified Nursing Assistant Milton H.
