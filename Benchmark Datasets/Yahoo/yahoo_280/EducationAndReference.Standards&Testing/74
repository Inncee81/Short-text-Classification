do the proctors check your calculator before the sat i took the sat times and the act times i think there were maybe of those times total that the proctor actually looked up after reading the calculator instructions and peered around to see if we had appropriate calculators there was only one time that i remember them actually going around and looking at everyone's calculators and even then it was little more than a cursory glance then again they might be likely to take note if you were using a calculator you weren't supposed to have the ones with say printing capacities are noticeable as are the ones with qwerty keyboards other than that any calculator unlike the ones most everyone else had would stand out and really it's best to not risk it and just use an acceptable one and i'm sure there are testing sites where the check more closely that was just my experience it would also depend on the individual proctor different proctors approach the test and the instructions differently if that's what you meant by check there was one girl on here saying that they actually cleared the memory of her calculator before she took the test while i do think they're well within their rights to do that i'd never heard even the suggestion that they would before and the theory is that the questions ask for reasoning so even a better calculator or anything you have on it won't change your score too much if you have something on your calculator you don't want erased just in case you can archive it so that the standard ram cleared won't get rid of it SAT Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache TI-92 series Typewriter Inflation The nature of God in Western theology Atari 8-bit family GED Contract Scientific method Reliability engineering Supply and demand Transformation problem Sersi Apollo Guidance Computer Philosophical skepticism System/34 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Bayesian inference Second language acquisition Explosive material System/36 Education in the United States Theory of conduct Big Bang TI-89 series Intelligent design Normal distribution Extreme Programming Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Supreme Court of the United States Logo programming language Mutual fund Postmodernism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Appeal Compiler optimization ELO rating system Coercion Collision detection Race and intelligence Entropy Milton H.
