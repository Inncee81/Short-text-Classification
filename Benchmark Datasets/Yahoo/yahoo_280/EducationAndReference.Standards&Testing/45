is it going to be a problem that i haven't taken my sat yet i'm going to be a senior this fall and i still haven't taken the sat but i'm signed up to take it october most of the schools i'm applying to also require sat ii subject tests which i won't be able to take until november since i can't take them the same day as the sat reasoning i'm thinking of applying early to my top school which is yale but the deadline is november hopefully i should have my scores for the reasoning test by then i believe i can get them online about weeks after the testing date but i won't have even taken any of the subject tests and two are required for yale is this going to be a problem i know i can somehow send them my subject test scores as soon as i receive them but they won't have them with my application and i know that they decide pretty quickly on early action applicants by december i think it will be too late for you to send your sat ii scores to yale because you're applying for an early decision you'll be taking your sat ii tests in november which is when the application is due the scores come out around two and a half weeks to three weeks after you take the exam never ever rush your scores to a school because it's really a waste of money when you list the colleges that you want to send your scores to they get sent your scores electronically rushing only rushes the paper copy of your scores to the colleges they get the scores electronically and can access them through a secure database provided by college board or the maker of the act course i would recommend applying to the normal pool i believe it's by january i'm applying to yale too but i already have taken the sat i twice and have taken three sat iis i'm taking three more sat iis in october so i can send them to yale and whatnot by november i'm just going to pick my best three out of the six i would have taken by then good luck SAT GED Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Advanced Placement Program Education in Romania E-mail Test (student assessment) Law School Admissions Test Grade (education) Affirmative action Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus UK Singles Chart Juris Doctor Cleveland Browns American and British English differences Internet fraud National Certificate of Educational Achievement American football Numerus clausus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Lynbrook High School Computer virus Jeopardy!
