did not get the chance to take physics in highschool so i 'm probably going to be lost in college is there any sites or things you would recommend for help you will not necessarily be lost unless you are planning on majoring in science if that is the case you should take a community college physics class which is a heck of a lot easier that a year's class but in any college class they pretty much assume you know nothing so i wouldn't worry trust me there aren't any sites that will really help you physics was hard for almost everyone i've known in high school and i don't think most kids got much out of it if you are required to take science as electives by the way you can get away with intro classes my college said i needed one bio and one physics or chem Education in Romania Philosophical skepticism Education in the United States Secondary education in France Hard disk Floppy disk Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible U.S. Electoral College Extreme Programming Computer security GED Redundant array of independent disks Education in the People's Republic of China Intelligent design Graduate school Secondary education in the United States Columbia University Advanced Placement Program Francis Crick Secondary education Abortion University of Southern California Social rule Community college Grade (climbing) Government of France Franklin W.
