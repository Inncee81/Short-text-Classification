exam results stress help i'm really stressing over my exam results which arrive online tomorrow and through the post on tuesday does anyone have any ideas on how to get my mind off of it i'm really scared because i know i've not done too great and even though my parents keep saying they know i've done my best i'm just really scared when the time comes since you know your parents are proud of you knowing that you did your best why don't you relax with a good book or if you have too much energy to relax go for a long walk or walk run or grab a friend and play tennis or go for a swim or to the mall shopping the physical activity will help destress you and the conversation will distract you o if you are concerned because you don't feel you've done well enough if you find you didn't then sign up to retake them and do a little more brush up on the material remember one test does not define you as a person there are lots of things to stress over but this isn't one of them you did your best and you can feel good about that good luck Humphrey Bogart Aikido Singlish Social rule Procrastination EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Great Teacher Onizuka Shaggy dog story Ex-gay Infantilism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.
