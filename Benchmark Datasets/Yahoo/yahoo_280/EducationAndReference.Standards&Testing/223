rate my min essay in an act rubric please and tips to how to improve it prompt in your opinion should high schools ban students' commuting to reduce traffic and tardiness problems well i know that i got lots of work to do on this essay i wrote hr essay but not min one's so here are some of the issue im concerned taken a position long enough how to create step by step body paragraph in shorten way here's the essay in united states there are different regulations and laws depending on each state for instance in the state of california teenagers are allowed to drive once they are sixteen years old and have acquired driving education from the stand point i believe that every high school should allow student s to drive because of their intelligence to make the right decision i would further argue that driving education has kept high school students out of traffic problems first students have the right to drive once they have reached certain age usually traffic problems are caused by someone who is careless to know the rules and regulation about driving i believe students should first have the opportunity to drive to school instead of preventing students to drive in the first place we should ban the students after they have proven to cause traffic problems next we should note that someone who drives the car aberrantly doesn t denote the fact that they are less likely to cause accidents for example external disturbance can trigger problems to drivers some of the examples are cell phones eating and losing concentration because of their drowsiness thirdly each student must have driving education and pass certain test to acquire a permit in addition in the state of california provisional permit enables the students to be aware of traffic problems because if he or she happens to cause an accident their license will be taken away in fact i believe students have a better driving education than adults because after the age of eighteen he or should would not be required to take certain driving education that students take therefore students should have their privilege to drive to their high school in and out instead of not having an opportunity to drive in conclusion i think that appearance and age shouldn t be taken as the most important issue but their knowledge and maturity to drive a vehicle furthermore high school students are not far away to become an adult maybe this is a very basic essay first and most important you have no introduction or thesis statement your introductory paragraph sounds like it was a body paragraph cut and pasted first your three points are good and valid but try and use less boring transitions these are very bad transitions first next thirdly for example for the transition for example there is nothing wrong with it but you use it too much try different transitions such as furthermore becasue of this etc tie your conclusion back to your introduction and in your intro make sure to mention all three points of course this is the worst possible format for writing an essay but this is a test after all good luck ps if you had captured my attention and put in a thesis statement this would have been a solid
