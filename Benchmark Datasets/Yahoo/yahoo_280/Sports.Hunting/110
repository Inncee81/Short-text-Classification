i dare you to answer this gun question i have asked this question before but no one seems to know i have spent so much time looking for the answer online i am ashamed to post it online i am trying to find the trigger pull for a standered factory double action colt annaconda i would like to know what the weight of the trigger pull is in double action mode pulling the trigger to fire and what it is in single action mode pulling the trigger to fire with hammer already up i would like the answer in pounds i do not have a device to measure it and it has been driving me crazy also i have noticed in a few gun articles that writers will sometimes refer to a weapon's trigger pull as smooth what does that mean if two different weapons are the exact same weight size caliber action with the exact same trigger pull weight would the feel of pulling the trigger be different for one than the other if it is different is it better to be smooth or not what does a smooth trigger pull mean dj if you claim that you can find it out online why didn't you furnish an answer i will tell you why i have looked through several search engines for over and a half hours and i can't find it and you couldn't either dj thanks for the other info though it was fairly helpful i love a challenge but this one is made simple by my work i am a gunsmith and i am colt trained and certified as a colt factory armorer tech the factory specifications for the colt anaconda are factory set at lbs or for double action and lbs or for single action respectfully the plus or minus addition to the poundage allows for quality control variables that occur during production manufacture colt had seven independant quality control points during the manufacturing phase to insure these control statndards are the same start to finish these quality control accuracy production tests cannot be duplicated simply by purchasing a trigger weight gauge and doing it at home for yourself we are talking lab controlled conditions here not guess work i personally prefer smith wessons but i also own more than a few colt wheelguns as well as a few semi automatics anyone who implicates the colt is sub standard or a problem gun must also be clueless to the incredible heritage and quality of colt handguns the tradition and the history lives on we have a saying in gunsmithing that goes anyone who doesn't appreciate the quality of colt and smith wesson handguns needs to have the nut on the grip replaced lol the rest of your questions regarding trigger smoothness have already been addressed here hope this answers your question finally Revolver Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Firearm Cartridge (firearms) Shotgun M1911 Colt's Manufacturing Company Internal ballistics GLOCK Pistol Beretta 92F/FS Colt Single Action Army handgun M4 Carbine Machine gun Mouse (computing) Krag-J__rgensen Heckler & Koch USP M60 machine gun Concealed carry (USA) Browning Model 1919 machine gun Punisher Airsoft Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Heckler & Koch G3 Colt Python Carburetor Smith & Wesson XM8 rifle Ammunition Colt Commando Five-seveN .44 Magnum B-47 Stratojet Elevator Handloading Plame affair AK-47 Expert system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Heinkel He 112 Explosive material Personal weapon Mumia Abu-Jamal Carbine Syphon Filter Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Pound Poker jargon Kammerlader Quake III Arena Heinkel He 100 Enfield revolver John Browning Gravity Theory of conduct Gradius Submachine gun M240 Extreme Programming Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Game controller CPU cache Software testing Drill bit StarCraft: Uprising SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Professional wrestling throws Microeconomics Blackjack The Cure MS-06 Zaku II T-64 Mattress Perfect Dark Lee-Enfield Terminal ballistics Caliber Robert Adams of London Gun politics Natural Selection (computer game) Bass guitar Modem Stopping power M2 machine gun Nuclear weapon design Battlefield 2 New York Giants Computer virus Gunsmith Cats Cleveland Browns
