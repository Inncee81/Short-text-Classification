i need advice on a crazy dream and your feelings on soul mates i haven't sen my ex boyfriend in over years in that time i don't think i've ever really thought about him he was a verbally abusive jerk i'm now happily married my husband is great and i love him very much however the other night i had a dream that i was with my ex then all of a sudden the next day people we had in common just showed up at my work i have this knot in my stomach like as if it were just yesterday that we broke up i'm constantly nervous because i know that the last time i had this feeling and this type of dream i ended up running into him why do i even care were we soul mates or something as cheesy as it sounds i love my husband and i would never do anything to disrespect him i actually feel guilty for even having this dream in the first place i also feel guilty because i can't seem to get it out of my head help why is this happening to me all of a sudden any advice how is it that i know when i'm going to run into him before i actually do i have dreams like this all the time i try and figure out why and i've found that it's usually a song on the radio a smell even a comment someone made basically my subconscious stored it and my dream let me know about it it is weird and unnerving especially when you then see the person or people that were in your life during that time i find that those people are always around you just didn't notice them until your dream made you notice them if you run into your ex be calm say hello and then tell him you have to go even if you don't don't stress or feel bad about your dream our subconscious holds onto a lot of feelings thoughts memories worries that are released during dreams most importantly remember it was just a dream Unconscious mind Jon Secada Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Infantilism Social rule Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard Hey Jude Transactional analysis The Ashlee Simpson Show Haven (TNG episode) Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs Emotions (album) Out-of-body experience The Lovely Bones Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Anxiety Fruits Basket Waylon Jennings The Emancipation of Mimi (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Melanie Thornton Lucid dreaming Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) K' The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Carl Jung The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q AFI 100 Years series Honey and Clover The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie I Want to Hold Your Hand Journey (band) God Emperor of Dune Pitaten Alanis Morissette Edgar Cayce W.I.T.C.H.
