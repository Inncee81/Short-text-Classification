big brother live why do the producers cut out so much of the audio all the time i cant stand big brother live it seems you get about of the time where they are talking and where you hear background noise birds whistling plane flying overhead etc does anyone know why they cut out so much it cant just be swearing as they do this after watershed where swearing shouldnt matter they cant be talking so much about brand names and things too that i guess is another reason why big bro would choose to block the sound any ideas think you will find it has something to do with politics basically if they say anything which can be deemed as offensive to people no matter how trivial they are not allowed to air it if they were to say the sky is blue someone would complain and say its not thats how i see it anyway Super Mario Bros. 3 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hearing impairment Sampling (music) Mario Super Mario Bros.
