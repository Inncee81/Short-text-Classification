do you hold your partners hand in public also do you and your partner kiss in public my husband and i are both bisexual and we sometimes just stop wherever we are and kiss even in the middle of the grocery aisle he was in a gay relationship for years before he met me and he said that even when he was out with his ex they would kiss and cuddle in public and all their gay friends would give them odd looks as though they shouldn't be doing that in public i know that even some straight people have a problem with showing affection in public we were wondering if any of you kiss and hold hands in public i do sure sometimes i get crap for it but ive learned not to pay attention to it i love her and im not going to act like i dont just because it makes someone else uncomfortable im never going to see those people again so it doesn't bother me what they think people say that we shouldnt do it around children that if their parents want them to know about homosexual relationships that they will tell them on their own but thats not how it works this is reality there are gay people there are straight people their are bisexuals and asexuals there are different kinds of love but no matter what the gender is the feelings are all the same and thats what should be looked at not whether or not im kissing a guy or a girl but how i feel about that person i have no shame in who i am i know im gay and i would never want it any different Sexual orientation Bisexuality Human sexual behavior Gender role Asexuality Friends Homophobia Coming out Infantilism Physical intimacy Bi-curious Anal sex Homosexuality and Christianity Domestic violence Gay Pedophilia Gay slang Ex-gay Gay rights Lesbian Heterosexuality Same-sex marriage Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures LGBT Homosexuality Homosexuality and transgender History of sex Transsexuality Queer Child sexuality Transactional analysis Avenue Q Transgender Marriage Polyamory Friendship Kurt Cobain Marilyn Monroe Demographics of sexual orientation The Amber Spyglass Queer as Folk (U.S.) Strap-on dildo Will & Grace Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Group sex Milton H.
