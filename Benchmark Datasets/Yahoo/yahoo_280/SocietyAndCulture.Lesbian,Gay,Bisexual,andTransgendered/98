how do you feel about gay leaders in the boy scouts do you feel that the majority rules when it comes to this issue or do you feel that they gays should be allowed the right to be a leader even if it makes many parents uncomfortable also what reason would a gay man want for being a scout leader anyway knowing that he is making many parents uncomfortable i have no opinion really on this issue as i'm not faced with this dilemma tammy i think if my son was in the boy scouts i would not feel uncomfortable with a gay leader as long as he doesn't have some police record for you know what and especially if the person in question has a background in education or something similar then i'd understand his interest in the boy scouts i can honestly say i did cub scouts and worked my way up to boy scouts where i earned my eagle and silver palm i was an assistant scoutmaster a camp counselor i taught jltc probably times and went to all sorts of camps including philmont at the time i was lying to myself about my sexuality but when i came out and was still in boy scouts you know what changed absolutely nothing but i knew how much i was basically hated for realizing the truth about myself shortly after that i bailed from the program because if you are found out they red line you i think that's the term i was told my family was still really big into the program so that's why i bailed i didn't want to embarrass them in the bsa the funny thing after that was that i worked as an employee at their store selling uniforming i couldn't believe how many gay leaders men and women would come in and buy things how many gay parents would come in and buy things for their children how many gay guys would come in and buy their own uniforming and stuff there are so many gay people in scouting it's funny we are so hated by them but if they'd open their eyes the bsa would realize how gay their organization really is and that there are so many gay people in the program and as leaders honestly i would have no problem sending my child to scout camp with a straight or gay leader Boy Scouts of America Scouting Venturing (BSA) Order of the Arrow Philmont Scout Ranch Boy Scouts of America v.
