the presidential debate last night were glbt people satisfied with answers or disappointed we lost our power because of a big storm and i couldn't watch it what did i miss mike gravel does support same sex marriage and feels like the marriage issue is not even going to be an issue in yrs and understands there should be no ban on who marries who because marriage humans being in love and wanting to make a commitment says that the only way to stop the hatred and bigotry is for all gays to come out of the closet and assert their rights he thinks that the older americans are wrong to say flat out that homosexuality is wrong and that he tells them so the only real thing i disagreed with is that he wants to legalize all of the illegal drugs and makes it where doctors can prescribe them like medical marijuana but i don't think that will work very well with meth and some of the other stuff out there today and he didn't say one single thing about health care dennis kucinich also supports same sex marriage wants real equality believes that sexual orientation doesn't matter and will abolish the discrimination in the workplace wants a not for profit medicare system for long term health care and wants to take on the aids issue john edwards wants health care benefits for all low income and the lgbt community the only problem i saw was when he was astounded that in l a some lgbt teens had been kicked out of there homes and made homeless because their parents didn't agree with their sexual orientation supports trangender issues and wants to make it where there is no discrimination in the workplace wants to get rid of the don't ask don't tell but is against same sex marriages and wants to make sure that gay hate crimes are prosecuted bill richardson believes in domestic unions with marriage benefits but not marriage itself wants to abolish don't ask don't tell passed hate crimes act in new mexico for domestic partners the only major thing that he said that nobody will agree with in the lgbt community is that homosexuality is a choice he also believes that everybody should have equal rights hillary clinton wants to get rid of don't ask don't tell and said that the reason that she didn't try for it earlier is because she knew that it would not pass in the republican congress believes that sexual orientation doesn't matter in the service wouldn't put somebody that is anti gay in the jointy chiefs the only downers for her was that she still thinks that the states should have th final say on same sex marriage but she is against it and that she skimmed over the hate crime issue and the workplace discrimination issue Homophobia Homosexuality Human sexual behavior Hillary Rodham Clinton Federal Marriage Amendment Religion and sexual orientation Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Transsexuality Homosexuality and Judaism Gay rights timeline Lawrence v.
