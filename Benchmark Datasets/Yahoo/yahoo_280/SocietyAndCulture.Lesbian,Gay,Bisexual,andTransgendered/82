this question is directed especially for women but men welcome to participate i have noticed that their seems to be some controversy about how women and men adapt to the situaltion when retirement comes along and after so many years the two are together much more and some conflict can occur how have you found this to be in your marriage and is it a good or a negative thing to have so much shared time hmmm interesting question reminds me of the saying familiarity breeds contempt i think if people don't stay active after retirement then they could become bored and take that out on their partner plus the transition to retirement seems to be hard especially for professionals who had fulfilling challenging careers i think it depends on your personality too i can't imagine being completely retired i'd prefer to taper down my work to only working part time or doing a lot of volunteer work in my field of expertise overall i think it all depends on how you handle the transition to retirement i think it could be the best or worst thing for a marriage for someone who has used their job to escape from their marriage retirement will obviously be a nightmare Sexual orientation Ethics Strap-on dildo Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Human sexual behavior Extreme Programming Asperger syndrome Same-sex marriage EastEnders Genealogy Internet troll Age of consent Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Consensus decision-making Child sexuality Current teachings of Prem Rawat Divorce Tiger Woods Sociolinguistics Gospel of Mark Theory of conduct Ocean's Twelve Same-sex marriage in Canada Microeconomics Screenwriting Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Transsexuality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gender role Habitat for Humanity International K' Jennifer Lopez Altruism Entropy Conscription Biology and sexual orientation The Brothers Karamazov Hiberno-English Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Garth Brooks Judith Miller (journalist) Anarchism and society Economic inequality Freeters Socrates Mediation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Incarnations of Immortality Monogamy Archaeological field survey Infantilism Social psychology Nancy Witcher Astor Israeli Arab Make money fast Fight Club Karen Horney Supply and demand Paralegal Mathematics Polygamy The nature of God in Western theology Incest Republic (dialogue) Swinging Professor Retirement Transactional analysis Donald Rumsfeld Identity and change Polyamory Fathers' rights Traumatic incident reduction Leadership Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Minister of religion Ty Cobb Bulgarian language Interracial couple Anal sex Baseball Nicomachean Ethics Chuck Palahniuk Hacker Transgender God Emperor of Dune Ontological argument Marriage Gay Leviathan (book) Procrastination Feminist movement Norway national football team Pedophilia Single Transferable Vote Fantastic Four Sin City Same-sex marriage in the United States
