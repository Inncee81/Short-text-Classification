feels so good yet hurts so bad im afraid to let go even tho its already been done for me after a long yrs she broke up with me several days ago the arguing us seeing things so differently i thinks she's a little childish at times and we both agree that im too mature we dont argue all the time but when we do it gets bad but we have some of the best times togther the hard part is that we stay together and she wants us to just be friends this isnt the first or rd time shes done this its just that this time it feels as if she's foreal be her friend i cant i really want to be with her shes out right now with some old friends i txt her earlier and she didnt txt back i called her after that and asked her when she'd be back and she said in an hour itll be am been waiting on her for about hours just wondering what shes doing and wondering if she even still cares about me because she acts as if she doesnt i need serious emotional support and opinions on what i should do and pls i dont want move on well i can say this from experience and it is very true sometimes letting go is hard to do but it needs to be done everyone deserves to be respected regardless of what sexual orientation they are and its a shame you will spend so much time with this kind of drama if your mature enough than she is then you know you deserve better than that it feels good because you think this is your version of what love should be self sacrifice to show the one you love how much you love them it hurts because in your mind you know this is not love and as scary as it may be to start again you need to do it love is blind and right now your won't even listen to anyone who is not saying what you want to hear you want to hear she does love you you are unique your one in a million your the one and only maybe you'll hear it but what are words when actions speak louder than words if she is out there without you it means she wants a life of her own you are not on the same page you need to find someone who will be on your wavelenghth it took alot from me to let go of the one person who ment the world to me and like you it hurt so much yet felt soo good i didn't want to lose her but i needed to sometimes you need to be cruel to be kind to this day i miss her but i am with someone who loves me soo much more than i could of imagined and my past well drama is still in her life and i am counting my blessings that i am not part of that drama good luck and many blessings Theory of conduct Pitaten Social rule Time Out of Mind Drama Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Atomic Kitten Past teachings of Prem Rawat Poker jargon Evil The Amber Spyglass Sexual orientation Avenue Q Simone Weil A Course In Miracles Narcissism Sydney Riot of 1879 Abortion debate Socrates Summa Theologiae John Howard Yoder Merit Sin Fiddler on the Roof Hey Jude Emotions (album) Blood on the Tracks Cliff Richard Pok__mon Live!
