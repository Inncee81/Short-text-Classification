would a drawn picture of two clothed lesbians kissing be considered pornography if it was just a cute romantic type of picture would two girls kissing passionately be considered pornography my ex girlfriend broke up with me because i requested from her best friend a drawn picture of two girls kissing passionately don't get me wrong i'm totally over her because of how lame she acted but i'm just curious as to if it would actually be considered porn or not i've talked about it with my friends and family each person i've talked with it about says that it isn't porn but i would like to hear your personal thoughts thanks i guess it comes down to what is pornography i would say a book could be pornographic even if it is written words without pictures if the picture is arousing then it could be construed as pornography personally i wouldn't see it as pornography but other people especially people who grew up in a conservative culture might consider any kind of arousing depiction even if it is just two people passionately kissing as pornography i don't think you can really criticize somebody for where they draw the line however i would hope that once somebody has drawn a line that they would be consistent about it you can't decide that a drawing of people kissing is pornography but then that sexually charged tv advertising or passionate art works in a gallery isn't pornography if you want to be consistent Hentai Child pornography Friends Pornography in Japan Pornography Zoophilia Lesbian Pornographic movie Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Motion picture rating system Pornographic actor Internet pornography Child sexuality Bish__jo game Pedophilia Nudity Sexual revolution Love Traci Lords Sex-positive feminism Otaku Oral sex Little Britain Erotica Group sex Andrea Dworkin 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Milton H.
