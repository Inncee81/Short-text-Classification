what do i do i've been having physical relations with this girl i'm not gay for anyone else for a few years we're not exclusive it just kinda happened and never stopped but there's definitely feelings involved other than eachother we have never messed around with other females she has a boyfriend she says she's in love with anyway recently she's started sleeping with my brother it's driving me crazy but i don't know what to say to her she knows it bothers me but she claims it shouldn't as she's not my girlfriend i don't 'own' her so now she says when she hangs out with my brother i can't be there and vice versa my bro has no idea of the situation between her and i what can i say to make this all go away i would drop her she isn't respecting you and whatever you think you guys have and probably never will this doesn't sound like a healthy relationship in any way shape or form i don't suggest continuing any sort of relationship with her it sounds like it will only bring you pain tell your brother she sleeps around she must if you her boyfriend and your brother are all having relations with her and tell her to leave you alone don't kid yourself into thinking you can make this relationship better i really don't think you can p s stds can be spread by girl on girl sex i would suggest getting tested given her rate of activity if you absolutely cannot stop having sex with her at least use protection p p s nothing will make it all go away especially not something you say this is rarely an option whenever you wish it would all go away what you should probably shoot for is damage control Avenue Q Human sexual behavior Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Something Positive One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Dualism (philosophy of mind) Sex and the City Domestic violence About a Boy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pedophilia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Puberty Theodicy Gender role Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Polyamory Sin City Kyle Broflovski Badly Drawn Kitties The Shining (film) Child sexuality Sexual orientation Shaggy dog story Great Teacher Onizuka Will & Grace The Marshall Mathers LP 11:14 Transsexuality Epistemology Dawson's Creek Recurring South Park characters One Life to Live Anal sex Good Morning, Vietnam Condom Interpersonal relationship Sexual abstinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sid Vicious Abortion debate Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Trailer Park Boys True Crime: Streets of LA Sex education Safe sex The X-Files (season 1) Phoebe Halliwell Cosmic Era list of characters Little Britain Fictional crossover The Catcher in the Rye Ex-gay Homophobia Sexually-transmitted infection Dead Like Me Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) My Family (television) Liam Gallagher Wonder Woman (television series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Cardcaptor Sakura Infantilism Scooby-Doo Blankets (graphic novel) St. Elmo's Fire (film) Drawn Together Sexual intercourse Neighbours Jam (TV series) Kylie Minogue Friendship Singlish BDSM Sonic the Hedgehog Charmed Pitaten Hey Jude The Amber Spyglass Springfield Elementary School Smallville (Season 4) Cool (song) Ranma __ characters W.I.T.C.H.
