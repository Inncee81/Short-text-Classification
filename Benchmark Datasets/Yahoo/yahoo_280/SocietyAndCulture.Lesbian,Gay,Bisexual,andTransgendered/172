shirley fred phelps was watching one of the videos posted earlier in this section where fox news interviewed her about demonstrations at a funeral i noticed that throughout the interview some words and phrases were repeated over and over again a abomination b obey c word of god i wonder if the westboro baptist church uses these repetitively as a strategy to thwart any logic in the name of the religion it claims to follow or is it just a brand building exercise with market driven motives to gain popularity among the common man what are your thoughts well considering it was on fox news it had a heavy biblical slant and they probably tried to steer the interview that way those words are extremely strong words its not something like listen to the word of god they use words with weight to help brainwash their followers and their ilk i think that the wbc has been so brainwashed that they believe that they have religion and that they are following christianity btw i like your avatar i think its my favorite of the ones you've done Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Fred Phelps Religious conversion Religion Calvinism Anti-gay slogan Mind control Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptist Church of Christ, Scientist Mormonism and Christianity Fox News George Fox Opposition to cults and new religious movements Fundamentalism Christian right Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Ten Commandments Separation of church and state Sabbath Christian Identity Brainwashing Theology Divine grace Bible and reincarnation Church of Christ Religious Society of Friends A Course In Miracles Teach the Controversy Restorationism Messianic Judaism Baptism Jesus Alternative theories regarding Hurricane Katrina Curse and mark of Cain Prophet Christianity Bene Gesserit Homosexuality and Christianity Pledge of Allegiance Cult Devil Avatar Royal Assent Evil Gospel of Thomas Lutheranism Antichrist Authorship of the Pauline epistles Intelligent design movement Unification Church Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Separation of church and state in the United States Propaganda Idolatry Zoroastrianism Chick Publications Mission (Christian) Predestination Biblical canon Anglicanism Atheism Great Apostasy Advertising Popular music Matthew Shepard Christian denomination Christianity and anti-Semitism Charles Darwin's views on religion Holy Spirit Sola fide Christian anarchism Sikhism Falun Gong Opus Dei Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church Spiritism Sathya Sai Baba Prayer Existence of God Apostasy Iglesia ni Cristo Dyslexia Clergy Nontrinitarianism Jehovah's Witnesses New Age Roman Catholic Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Trinity Laws of Form Rastafari movement Historicity of Jesus Islam Rick Warren Blacks and Mormonism Paul Is Dead Meaning of life
