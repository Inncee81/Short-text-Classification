i can tell my gf is nerves about sex with me first im a girl bi and me and my gf haven't seen eachother in months so im planning to have that nite we are both virgins im mostly the guy in the reat so i guess i have to use the toys on her the most we have been together for years in sept so i know how she is she can be uncomfortable with things like that i want this to be special so can i have advice on makeing her feel good about this like are there certain tips i can have to make her ready i dont want to push her into doing it thou i'm picking her up at the airport and then we are going to dinner then to are house what do i do then should i watch a movie with her should we go st to bed and do it help me i need all the tips you have i would say watch tv or something to keep your mind somewhat distracted just start to makeout with her as you have in the past be honest with each other about what feels good and what doesn't forget the toys you don't need them when it gets to the point where you are petting down there you should be able to get naked with each other just do what feels good to each other and that you are both comfortable with you don't have to put something into your vaginas in order to give your virginity to each other in my opinion taking your clothes off and bringing each other to orgasm counts even if you end up having an orgasm playing with your own clit while she is kissing you and rubbing your breasts she is still actively and lovingly helping to bring you to orgasm in the heat of the moment it is about doing what feels good to each other it isn't about if we don't do this specific thing then we are still virgins relax and enjoy each other Strap-on dildo Friends Masturbation Orgasm Oral sex Anal sex Milton H.
