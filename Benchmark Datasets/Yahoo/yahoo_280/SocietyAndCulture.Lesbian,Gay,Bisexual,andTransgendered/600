how does less than equal equal full equality last night i heard several democrat frontrunners state they are for equality for all but do not support gay marriage how do they justify this simple math teaches that what is not fully equal is unequal yet many of these folks seem to really believe they support equality do you believe legalizing civil unions on a national scale but not gay marriages equates to equal rights i mean if they made civil unions on a federal level and let churches call them marriages if they so chose to then i would be fine with that that would mean that nonreligious straight people would get civil unions too that i support civil unions but not marriages is a bunch of crap and is separate but equal well actually just separate Same-sex marriage in Canada Same-sex marriage Civil union Same-sex marriage in the United States Democratic Party (United States) Federal Marriage Amendment Gay rights Defense of Marriage Act Civil unions in Vermont Separation of church and state Homosexuality and Christianity American Civil Liberties Union Civil unions in Ireland Civil unions in the United Kingdom Rick Santorum Same-sex marriage in Australia Constitution Same-sex marriage in Alberta Congress of the United States Divorce Equal Protection Clause Same-sex marriage in New York Civil Marriage Act Civil rights Liberal Democrats (UK) Centre Party (Germany) Sexual orientation NAACP Homosexuality and Judaism Gay rights timeline Same-sex marriage timeline Homophobia Homosexuality Fathers' rights Desegregation Libertarianism Same-sex marriage in Spain Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Libertarian Party (United States) Mary Robinson Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom United States Constitution Democracy United States Senate European Convention on Human Rights Religion and sexual orientation John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004 Government of India Common-law marriage American individualist anarchism Plessy v.
