is it disrespectful for straight people to tell gay people they have chosen to be gay i don't get that unless you are in that person's head and have experienced their life what gives them the right that is so incredibly arrogant and patronizing to the gay community i am quite perplexed i need answers mzbrown you are ghetto therefore dismissed yes very disrespectful thoughtless and ridiculous as well the reason they want to say this i think is because they don't want to allow that anyone can be gay from birth or for any other reason beyond his her control and thus have to admit that homosexuality is natural the religious right seems to push the argument that homosexuality is a choice to avoid god receiving credit or blame for homosexuality sorry but if god created the world and everything in it he did create homosexuals because he knew exactly everything that would ever exist in the world before he ever created it so he knew that there would be homosexuals and therefore he created homosexuals if i plant seeds and a plant grows then i'm responsible for creating that plant you can't say that god created everything and then say that he didn't create some things doesn't make any sense whatsoever the other side of the choice coin is that if homosexuality is a choice then homosexuality is the fault of the homosexual hence the person who says homosexuality is a choice has in his her mind absolved god of any responsibility absolved nature of any part and laid the blame entirely on the homosexual who in their opinion has made this decision because of their evil and depraved nature that's the whole thing in a nutshell blame the whole thing on the homosexual why they find that necessary is another question i suppose i agree with the people who comment that the proper response to this is so you're telling me that you have been attracted to members of your own sex because if you say you could never be attracted then how can it be a choice how can you tell me that i had this choice if you have never had to choose i firmly believe that about of homophobia has its roots in men wanting to shore up their own heterosexuality at the expense of homosexuals and what that means of course is that their own heterosexuality is open to question in their own minds if it didn't mean that they wouldn't have to go out and make such a big deal about how manly and virtuous they are that the arguments and statements they make are illogical and contradictory highlights that it's their fear that's motivating them Sexual orientation Homophobia Homosexuality and Christianity Theodicy Theory of conduct Gay Ex-gay Heterosexuality Human sexual behavior Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and transgender Rick Santorum Bisexuality Same-sex marriage Transsexuality Marriage Religion and sexual orientation Reparative therapy Laura Schlessinger Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Federal Marriage Amendment Religion Biology and sexual orientation Phaedo Gay rights Epistemology Supernatural Homosexuality Evil Transgender Simone Weil Lawrence v.
