does this guy have a point so i saw this video on youtube and it made me think is it possible that just because you're a minority in this case gay that you aren't a jerk i'm not really trying to start crap but just wanting to see if anyone else see my point btw i'm a african american whose a bit of a libretarian i think that gays won't really be accepted until they can publically admit that their crap does indeed stink in other words i would like to see how many people think the nararrator in this case in a homophobe or if he has a point http www youtube com watch v mgd zozoyrk please watch the video and respond also no i don't hate gays pitbull fever catch it to zikiru despite what you said we actually agree also to elaborate popular culture has made gay guys the new cool thing every new sitcom has a gay character as does most literature with a modern day setting one of the reasons why gays are still on the outs is that almost always the gay characters are portrayed as being super nice guys they're never the jerk of the story and it they way pop culture embraces them i don't think gays will be fully accepted until they can accept themselves as real members of society and accept that some of them are jerks also to the guy that call me vice i hate dog fighting thank you for trying to judge me i hope you get the gout thanks vanilla sky you rock wow i first came on this and read all the posts and i was not going to watch the video but it sparked some curious george in me i watched it and i have never laughed so hard in my life i will be showing this to my girlfriend i may put this on myspace because i laughed that hard i am gay but i would never talk about that hit in public me and my girlfriend don't even hold hands in public because we have respect for people now keep in mind my girlfriend is obviously gay and even an old lady would have gaydar at that very moment but would never she be embarrassed by my girlfriends actions now i do know some jerks out there that are gay that's who they are now the only show that has a gay guy in it that is a complete is brian off of queer as folk but other than that i agree with you all of them are nice my shit stinks and so does my girlfriend we all can be pricks at one point of the day thanks for the good laugh have a good night Avenue Q Gay George Costanza Social rule Homophobia Family Guy Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Andrew Dice Clay The Ashlee Simpson Show Queer Megan Griffin Something Positive MTV The Contender (television series) Eric Cartman Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Gay rights AFI 100 Years series South Park Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Queer as Folk (U.S.) Queer as Folk (UK) Craps EastEnders Friends Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Human sexual behavior Outing Singapore gay equality movement Ren and Stimpy Shit Plame affair Shaggy dog story Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Sharon Tate Happy Days The Critic Diana Ross Squidward Tentacles Kylie Minogue Kitsch Recurring South Park characters Coming out Kyle Broflovski 2004 Democratic National Convention Lesbian The Young Ones (TV series) Have I Got News For You Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In Gay slang Jeopardy! in culture American Psycho Paul W.
