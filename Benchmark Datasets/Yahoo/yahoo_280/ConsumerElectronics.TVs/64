a few questions about hdtv's and their supported resoulutions lets say you have a lcd tv with a supported resolution of p when your watching tv does that tv show p on screen or does p only apply to when you hook it up to a dvd player or gaming system another question to help me further understand this is what does that number mean p also what is the difference between p and i which is better p only works with games and hd dvd players i is for transmitted tv signals p is progressive scan it scans line line line i is interlaced scan it scans line line line does the whole picture then scans line line line that's why there's an odd field and an even field scanned both fields create one frame progressive's frame rate is the same as the interlaced frame rate the reason to split it into odd even fields is to transmit the signal rather than plug it in like a game or dvd better transmission capability less bandwidth or throughput neither one is actually better enough to see the difference but interlaced gives you some jaggies on circular objects like tires and balls but it does give you better hi speed smoothness in interlaced that's because it's creating semi pictures to progressive's full pictures the brain fills in the missing lines but you'd never know it Interlace High-definition television Video Television NTSC ATSC Digital video Digital television Frame rate Video codec Telecine Broadcast television system Original Amiga chipset Federal Standard 1037C Ethernet Widescreen Digital Visual Interface 720p 1080i S__CAM DVD Deinterlacing Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Stereoscopy Compact disc Nintendo GameCube Radio Antenna (radio) Movie projector H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Anamorphic widescreen Modem Universal Serial Bus Nintendo 64 Xbox Xbox 360 Bluetooth Football (soccer) Warez Digital cinema IS-95 Power line communication Musical Instrument Digital Interface Game Boy Magnetic resonance imaging Konica Minolta SETI Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal display Video compression PlayStation Portable Electrophysiology Snooker Helical scan Fax Speed of light 1080p IEEE 802.11 Resident Evil 4 Windows Vista Telegraphy Refresh rate CPU cache VHS Items in the Metroid series John Logie Baird Bandwidth Phase-shift keying Oscilloscope Asynchronous Transfer Mode Microscopy Cable television Teletext Electric motor Gravity Newton's laws of motion Coriolis effect Faster-than-light Aspect ratio (image) Videotape Cathode ray tube Redundant array of independent disks Moir__ pattern Computed tomography Digital Luna 3 Surveyor 5
