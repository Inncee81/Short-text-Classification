can you change the dmd chip on a dlp screen from p to p i bought a p when the p's were way high in price and am wondering if i should have waited a few more months my question is if it is possible to change a samsung p to a p by replacing the dmd chip i was sitting around and thought this up but i havent been able to find anything to support my idea so if anybody is knowledgeable or knows whether or not its possible i would much appreciate it first off a dmd is nothing more than an array of tiny mirrors which are individually controlled to either reflect or not reflect light they are not measured by p or i or p or p they are measured the same way any digital display device is measured horizontal vs vertical pixels or in this case mirrors the video scaler is what you are talking about messing around with and it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever in any case the dmd chip is part of the dmd drive assembly which is matched to that specific chip there's a lot more than just the dmd chip in that assembly if you have a product capable of displaying p you are going to be just fine for quite a while there are no sources of video which require a higher resolution than that so to answer your question no it isn't possible to change out a dmd chip DLP Digital Micromirror Device Digital photography Liquid crystal display Amstrad CPC Atari 8-bit family Light-emitting diode Sinclair ZX81 PlayStation 3 Radeon High-definition television Oscilloscope Atari ST Transistor Television Pixel Video Graphics Array Apple IIGS Xbox 360 Display resolution Nintendo 64 Laptop Radar Commodore 64 Plasma display IMac PC Engine Dynamic random access memory Hubble Space Telescope ATI Technologies TurboGrafx 16 Traffic light Xbox NTSC Nintendo Entertainment System IBM PC compatible Embedded system MSX CPU design Computer display Microeconomics Laserdisc Redundant array of independent disks Dots per inch Timeline of computing 1990-forward H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Digital cinematography ZX Spectrum Flash memory Digital camera Telescope MEMS Computer display standard Digital Visual Interface Stereoscopy PlayStation 2 Sega Saturn Mechanical television Computer ZigBee Overclocking Nintendo Revolution MOS Technology VIC-II Antenna (radio) Machine vision Charge-coupled device Digital Supply and demand NVIDIA Color Vacuum tube Commodore International CPU cache IPod Apple Computer Creative Zen Seismometer Teletext Bluetooth 2D computer graphics Intellivision Holography Graphics processing unit Integrated circuit Nintendo GameCube DVD Modchip Cathode ray tube System/34 MPEG-2 Slot machine
