' sylvania super screen tv color problems hi i have a sylvania big super screen tv ' i pulled the back off and i see that the red and the blue guns are on but not the middle green gun i am only getting a very high red with some blue in picture looks like a devil screen do you think that the middle gun is shot or can it be checked first also is this too expensive to replace any help would be appreciated thankyou adrienne sorry to say this but i think it may be time to buy a new tv i seriously doubt that sylvania is still selling parts for this tv and if they do they would probably be pretty expensive and as far as checking it maybe try setting your tv to full green and none of the other colors to see if it still works use a multimeter to check if there is a current running through the wires going to and from the gun other than that call around local tv repair shops Oscilloscope Light gun Television Game Boy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Super Mario Bros.
