i used two splitters to split my internet to two tvs and one computer but now i have serious problems first i split the internet with a bi splitter one leads to one tv and the other cable leads to another bi splitter thing one leads to the computer and the second one leads to another tv the problem is that when i turn on the second tv i used to feel a wave come out from my computer monitor and i literally mean a wave like a electronic wave or something over time the wave has gotten weaker to where i cant feel it anymore the wave only comes out during the turning on of the second tv and doesnt continues while the tv is on im just wondering if the wave is dangerous to my health or not i only have analog cable am i splitting my cable incorrectly thanks for your time the wave is an electrostatic field created by the high voltage charging up the picture tubes it won't hurt you and it's really not important that you feel the wave most likely there is a resistance building up over time to soften the effects of the wave it doesn't hurt the units it's just good old aging occurring cable connections do not have any effect on the wave so don't worry about your hook ups Diode Loudspeaker Cathode ray tube Circuit design Capacitor Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Action potential Transformer Television Digital Subscriber Line Welding Radio Volt Synthesizer Plasma display Tesla coil Transistor Impedance matching Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Hall effect Lightning Quantum mechanics Submarine communications cable Radiation hardening Electronics Speed of light Atomic Kitten Electrophysiology Liquid crystal display Universal Serial Bus Computer Electrical generator Battery (electricity) Transmission line Uninterruptible power supply High-voltage direct current Operational amplifier CMOS Fusor Carbon nanotube Ethernet Klystron tube SCART Modem Michelson-Morley experiment Electrostatics Electric motor Digital photography Photoelectric effect Light-emitting diode Particle accelerator Plasma (physics) Van de Graaff generator Microphone Antenna (radio) Floppy disk Spacecraft propulsion Piezoelectricity Electromagnetic radiation Cosmic Era technology S-Video Information Age Digital Visual Interface MOSFET Electric power transmission Electrostatic discharge Internet Nuclear fusion Electronic amplifier Voltmeter Determinism General relativity Seismometer Nickel-cadmium battery Corona discharge PlayStation Portable Items in the Metroid series Dimmer Debugging Computer and video games Windows XP Computer hardware Surveillance Digital television Aerial (dance move) Wind turbine Federal Standard 1037C Single-phase electric power Low-pass filter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wardenclyffe Tower RGB color model X-ray Prostate cancer Explosive material Special relativity
