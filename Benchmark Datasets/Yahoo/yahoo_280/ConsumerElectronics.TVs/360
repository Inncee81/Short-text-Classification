i have a inch rca tv it gives a sound but no clear picture it has lines that runs thru it what can i do if it is an analog tv not digital or hdtv then you need a better antenna better antenna connection or better cable connection or you need to be more specific about what lines you are referring to going thru the picture have a friend who knows something about tvs look at it or seek help from a service professional too many people use the push on cable wires that come with vcrs and those cause picture problems especially on tv cable due to the lack of a good connection and poor shielding always use ohm f connector cables that screw on finger tight Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Laserdisc Digital television Xbox DVD Coaxial cable S-Video RCA connector S__CAM Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Impedance Decibel Digital Visual Interface S-VHS Advanced Technology Attachment Ethernet IPod Ribbon cable Federal Communications Commission Satellite television Atari 8-bit family Digital cable Universal Serial Bus D-subminiature Xbox 360 DMX (lighting) Nintendo Entertainment System XLR connector Bluetooth Gramophone record Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Set-top box Antenna (radio) Digital video recorder S/PDIF Musical Instrument Digital Interface TiVo Communications satellite Telegraphy Jack plug Videotape Serial ATA Synthesizer Transformer Balanced audio Impedance matching PAL Overhead powerline SCSI Composite video NTSC Apollo Command/Service Module Federal Standard 1037C Digital photography TIA-568A/B ATSC Electrical wiring FireWire Integrated Services Digital Network Modem Category 5 cable Audiophile Digital Subscriber Line Loudspeaker Nintendo GameCube Drill bit Camcorder Phantom power Commodore 64 DIN connector Videocassette recorder BS 1363 Ohm's law VHS Home cinema RS-232 Telephone Telephone tapping Electrophysiology Wi-Fi Nominal impedance 8 mm video format Atari ST Teletext Internet Sound card Betacam ITU-T ITV Hearing aid 10BASE5 Copy protection Broadband Internet access Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Power line communication Glossary of climbing terms
