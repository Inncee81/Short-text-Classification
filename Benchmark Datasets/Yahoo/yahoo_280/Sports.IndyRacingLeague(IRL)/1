what would a change from sunday to monday do to the indy i think it would be nothing but a positive other than tuesday being the day to make up for a rain delay i think it would be a good move you would get the nascar doubles like tony stewert and robby gordon back and who knows maybe even drivers like jeff gordon and ryan newman all indiana natives what do you think let nascar move back to saturday night then they do that whole thing at charlotte wrong anyway the all star race should be about wednesday night rather than the weekend before then run on into the other racing the best part of that weekend other than the is watching the outlaws on the dirt track leave me monday for getting home from either one i've been to each indy used to draw whatever day of the week it was held Indianapolis 500 Tony Stewart May 2005 in sports Hendrick Motorsports Bristol Motor Speedway Lowe's Motor Speedway Monday Night Football September 2005 in sports NEXTEL Cup NASCAR Rookie of the Year Monday NASCAR Realignment The Double Penske Racing Jeff Gordon NASCAR Watkins Glen International Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Chip Ganassi Racing Indianapolis Motor Speedway October 2005 in sports NASCAR Thunder 2004 June 2004 in sports Robby Gordon Ernie Irvan 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Roush Racing Carnival Dale Earnhardt Auto racing Jimmie Johnson Operation Market Garden Saturday Craftsman Truck Series Saturday Night Live Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
