ps vs pc polycount ok i'm confused and i hope you won't consider this a stupid question and actually shed some light on the subject i read that onimusha warlords's character are built from polygons the game was realeased for ps in and for pc in on the other hand there's doom which had bigger sys reqs but still the characters were made from polygons plus pcs are supposed to be faster than consoles yet lair's character are built from polygons this statements put together make no sence at all am i missing something or are some of the numbers incorrect thank you the number of polygons does not determine what the over all product will look like the major factore is the shading that is done with those polygons example lets say you have a character from doom that is polygons and it used complex shading giving the final look something thats not all blocky then take a character from some random game and give it polygons with not as complex of shading they will look about the same due the the major diffrence of polygons but the one with more polygons will actually require less system resources as the shading is not as complex and less strenuouse in the end shading is going the be more of a key factor on system resources then polygon counts i really hope that helps and you can understand it as i am tired while doing this i would also like to thank you for a really good question nice question in general and nicely asked with detail on what you wanted to know Geographic information system Normal mapping Expert system Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible PlayStation 2 First-person shooter System Shock 2 Nintendo Revolution English grammar Super Nintendo Entertainment System Final Fantasy $ale of the Century Large numbers Atari 8-bit family Game programming Clipping (computer graphics) Polygon Nintendo GameCube Password On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Descent (computer game) Shader Binary space partitioning Theory of conduct Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Xbox 360 Xbox Ruler-and-compass construction Computer CPU cache Rendering (computer graphics) System/36 Sega Saturn Doom engine Wheel of Fortune Akuma (Street Fighter) Randomness Quantum computer Windows 2000 Galactic Civilizations Internal ballistics Blue screen of death RISC Free will Complexity classes P and NP Wallpaper group Winning Streak Computer animation GunBound Computer and video game genres Machinima Doom 3 3dfx FIFA Series Probability Traditional animation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Computational complexity theory Quicksort Euler characteristic Debugging Little Britain Grand Theft Auto III Ghost Mortal Kombat System/34 Regular polytope Gouraud shading Interactive proof system Computer graphics Vector graphics NVIDIA Halting problem Chinese character Poker jargon Doom 3 engine Causality Copy protection Python programming language Singlish History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Ashton-Tate Microeconomics Avenue Q Timeline of computing 1990-forward Dominoes ELO rating system You Don't Know Jack New York Giants MAME Sega Dreamcast Typeface Milton H.
