what would you do if a neighbor dog ran over to you and scratch you and the dog owner did not apologize to you and next day you find your scratches infected it so happen to me yesterday but i wasn't afraid of the dog because i am a dog owner and i do understand that dogs do play roughly but what i don't understand is why the owner is so irresponsible of letting the dog run out of the house without looking to make sure all the gate are close and afterward the owner think it alright for their dog to scratch other people without saying sorry or anything at all what is my next step if i find myself with a infection from the scratch i don't want to bring it to court or something it just that i feel the dog owner is a very irresponsible person i do not want this to happen to other people especially elderly or children i am very disappoint of some of the answer i'm receiving from you guys why do some people think i am crazy or need to grow up my concern is not for myself but for others people which i stated earlier if you think i'm crazy or just making small things into big deal than i don't think you guys have any concern for others safety did i say i was going to sue anybody or ask for any medical bills to be pay no i didn't i just want to know if i should confront them and tell them to not let their dog run out of the house with out supervision what if the dog get hit by a car or if the dog attack a elderly from what i know of their are many elderly people living in my block and having difficulty walking i don't want them to get hurt one last comment for the people who thinks i need to grow up or get over it you guy should be the one that need to think before you talk i'm more concern for others and not just thinking of for myself you have to decide whether you want to make an issue of the incident or not should you decide to make an issue of this i would do something that would require action on the owner's part yesterday your dog scratched me and it got infected i need to know how you want to resolve this oh by the way just to be on the safe side i'm assuming that you've decided to control your dog so no one else like a little kid would get hurt we certainly wouldn't want animal control to get involved would we Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Satchel Paige Grandview, U.S.A.
