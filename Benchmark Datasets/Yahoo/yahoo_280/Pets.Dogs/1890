are chow chow's good for me i'm planning to get a dog and i dont know if chow chow's good for me they say it's an agressive and high maintenance dog is that really true are chow chow's good i hope to find information about chow chow dogs thanks please do some research about the breed before getting a chow they are somewhat unusual dogs and not for everybody i currently own a chow mix dog age and my sister owned a pure bred chow for many years both of those dogs were are very protective my chow bites any stranger who steps foot into my yard i am a pretty good dog trainer but i doubt i will ever be able to stop him from his agressive biting of strangers as that is normal for the breed chows have long fur that looks soooo cute it also requires daily brushing he leaves clumps of it everywhere it comes off on my pants every day etc my chow is very high strung he worries about any little noise in the middle of the night and wants to go outside to check it out he is terrified of thunderstorms etc all those traits seem to be characteristic of the breed i got my chow mix from a dog rescue group after i had him a week i called with the intention of telling them i'd like to return him the lady i talked to informed me that he had been returned by previous families who had adopted him i couldn't bear to have him go thru that again so i kept him but obviously chows aren't for everybody is a chow right for you only you can make that determination Dog Keeshond Obedience training Schutzhund Cat RuneScape quests American Eskimo Dog Fancy rat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Equine conformation USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Spitz Havanese Hamster Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Mahjong Poodle Piccolo Junior Saga Tasmanian Devil Kodocha Species Milton H.
