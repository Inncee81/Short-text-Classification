has anyone bought a spoodle from valley view dog breeders in mirboo victoria are they good breeders they charge much more than other breeders so i was wondering if anyone has actually dealt with them before are they reputable breeders and are their dogs really that good a reputable breeder doesn't mix breeds on purpose and give the dogs cute designer names though not all mutt breeders are bad its you who needs to do the research and you started by asking here that's good now you need to get their vet number call and be sure they are seen regularly and there breeding stock is given oks for breeding call area shelters and law enforcement find out if they were ever complained about or there dogs wound up in shelters for behavioral issues see if they will give you references to current owners for testimonials on there dogs see if they let you visit and tour the entire premises so they are not hiding anything then lastly check out how many dogs they have there should be one person per to dogs be sure they have adequate staffing if they have large amounts of dogs this is crucial for proper socialization if they dont comply on any of those points above i would proceed cautiously i would never pay those kind of prices for mix breeds like spoodles contrary too what someone said about them being a puppy mill thats not always true of mixed breed breeders you just have to do lots of digging i havent heard of anything with these guys but if they are a large kennel facility then the are more of a processing plant for dogs and are in it for profit rather than breeding good dogs Mixed-breed dog Dog Docking Labrador Retriever Breed registry Dog breed American Kennel Club Puppy mill Dog show Dog breeding Havanese Pet skunk Contract Hamster Nuclear power Economics Microeconomics Intellectual property Border Collie Nuclear reactor Tax Fox hunting Guinea pig Pet store Fast breeder Gray Wolf Housebreaking German Shepherd Dog Theory of conduct Microchip implant (animal) Internet fraud Appeal Border Terrier Golden Retriever Fancy rat American Eskimo Dog Rottweiler Domestic goat Anarchism and capitalism Breed standard Capitalism Surveillance Dog training Socialization Rescue group Alaskan husky Surplus value Manx (cat) English Springer Spaniel Supply and demand Goodness and value theory Keeshond Plant breeding Illegal drug trade Public domain Obedience training Working dog Selective breeding Mutual fund Basset Hound Dobermann Monster Rancher monsters Scientology beliefs and practices Australian Shepherd Best of Breed Discus (fish) Equine conformation Insurance Canary Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Bond Dog agility Alternative fuel Anarcho-capitalism Software patent debate Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Poker jargon German Shorthaired Pointer Komondor People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals United Kingdom corporation tax Capital accumulation Pekingese Animal shelter Nuclear proliferation
