can you teach your mo old pup not to growl he doesn't growl much but i hate it when he does so i say no growling growling is just one way your puppy is using to express himself whether this is problematic or not depends a lot on when and why he's growling if he does it when you're playing together or pulling on a toy it's not such a big deal try not to get into a tug of war game and if you do and he starts growling just take the toy away and stop the game he'll soon learn that growling spoils the fun if he growls at you when he doesn't want to do something you've asked him to or growling is part of a food or toy guarding behavior it needs to be dealt with now same goes for growling that is directed at strangers etc some breeds tend to be more growly and vocal than others but if your pup is trying to dominate with his growling you need to reshape the behavior it's important that your puppy doesn't find that growling gets the results he wants for example if you want your dog to get off the sofa and he growls at you don't shrug your shoulders and say oh okay and leave him there instead tell him no growl very firmly not shouting though as a raised voice or an aggressive stance from you will only reinforce his behavior then take hold of his collar and firmly remove him from the sofa if he's growling when you go near his food bowl you need to nip it in the bud start off by hand feeding him his meals instead of using a bowl he'll learn that his food is literally in your hands then after a few days use his food bowl again but reach down slowly while he's eating and drop a tasty treat near the bowl do this a couple of times each meal time until he realizes that having you near his bowl is a good thing then progress to putting the treats in the bowl once you've overcome the food guarding still continue with the treats in the bowl intermittently so that he doesn't go back to his old ways if he's growling at strangers etc you need to get him enrolled in a good puppy obedience class for socialization purposes and get a professional to help you show him that this behavior isn't acceptable hope this helps some good luck Dog Cat Gray Wolf Kodocha Fast bowling Guinea pig Housebreaking Hamster Shaggy dog story Obedience training Customs and etiquette of Japan Tenshinhan The Star Wars Holiday Special Social rule Pet skunk Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Poker jargon Garfield Survivor (novel) Ranma __ characters Milton H.
