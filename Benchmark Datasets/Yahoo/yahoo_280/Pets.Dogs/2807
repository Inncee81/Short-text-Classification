are there any laws in california about driving with a dog in the passenger side of a car i like driving around town with my bulldog puppy with him in the front passenger seat of my car but since he is getting so big now he likes to sit in the back seat and stick his head out the window i haven't bought a harness for him in the car yet although i'm planning to but he doesn't disturb me while i'm driving but i was wondering if there are any laws that prohibit dogs from riding in the passenger side of a car or without any restraints or any doggy in the car laws any good websites to see this information thanks for the help i let my dog do it but she is harnessed securely into the back seat and i just bought her a pair of those doggles doggie eye protection she's secure and her eyes are safe and it makes her so damn happy ps it took me a week to train her to wear the goggles and i take them off her whenever we stop the car i don't want her to try to pull them off Car safety Airbag Dog School bus Snoop Dogg Seat belt Shaggy dog story Tag Automobile The Ashlee Simpson Show Professional wrestling throws Horse tack Strap-on dildo Reservoir Dogs Driver's license Ocean's Twelve Pioneer Zephyr Equine conformation Horse Crash test dummy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) BMW Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Rules of the road Auto Train (Amtrak) The Inside Manual transmission Car body style Taxicab Aerial (dance move) Crate training Montgomery Bus Boycott Grandview, U.S.A.
