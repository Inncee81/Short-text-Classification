why do breeders breed every other day for days from most of what i have read it seems like when people are breeding their dogs they want them bred every other day for days like the and th of a month why is this for the female to rest of is it for the males sperm to reproduce or something ahhh but dp then you would have to ask that people actually have some clue about what they are doing yes every other day means that the sperm should be at its highest viability assuming he's ejaculated sometime recently within a week or two before the st breeding i check for cornification what dp is referring to when i am breeding to an older dog or when i am traveling usually to the stud dog seems the best dog to breed to is rarely around the corner personally i like to pretty well let nature take its course i believe if a dog cannot be bred naturally she won't stand the dog is disinterested she doesn't get pregnant on repeated tries with a viable male then they shouldn't be bred i came to that opinion after talking with many breeders and noting the frequency of breeding issues amongst certain lines of course i also don't believe in breeding lines of dogs that habitually need surgical intervention to bear live pups either Hybrid Dog Havanese Gray Wolf Plant breeding Pregnancy Puberty Breed registry Dog breeding Dobermann Artificial insemination Dog breed Abortion debate Birth control German Shepherd Dog Selective breeding Kakapo Guinea pig Dog show Hip dysplasia American Pit Bull Terrier Pet skunk Orgasm Dachshund Sexual reproduction Hamster Infertility Surveillance Prostate cancer Scooby-Doo Liger American Kennel Club Miscarriage Rottweiler Iditarod Sterilization (surgical procedure) Kurt Cobain Pekingese Manx (cat) Social rule Intelligent design Androgen insensitivity syndrome English Springer Spaniel Domestication Golden Retriever Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Estrus cycle Cat Horse Parthenogenesis Labrador Retriever Fertility awareness Sea Otter Male reproductive system (human) Canary Mixed-breed dog Chinook (dog) Sexual selection Great Dane Dog training Intersexuality House Mouse American Cocker Spaniel Menstrual cycle Development of Darwin's theory Spanish verbs Ferret Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Jeopardy!
