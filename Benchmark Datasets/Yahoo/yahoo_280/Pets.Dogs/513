how can i get puppies to stop crying i have german shepard puppies females and i am havin such a prob wit them if i take them out of the crates they go to the bathroom everywhere and they will start wrestlein each other and hurtin each other playful bt they still whine and cry if i keep them in the cage they wrestle each other and whine and cry and if i have one in the crate and the other out they start crying bc the dogs can t be seperated they are best friends and do everythin together but if they are together they will wrestle bite scratch and just beat up each other i'm only and takin care of these dogs is a hassel they are pure bred german shepards the best there is but in the past days i have gotten a combination of hours of sleep sleepin only between and hour of sleep each night and i have to work out everyday for my training for hockey and i just need to solve this problem so all three of us can sleep in peace hah thanks yeahh i dont hit them i would never hit them at all my moms best friend purchased them shots and all i just got another crate so they each have there own but that goes back to the fact that tehy can't be seperated and they start crying for each other they are about weeks old and yes they are from the same litter get the puppies some stuffed animals and squeaky toys play with each one then leave some stuffed animals and toys not just one in the cage with them while you are away this way they can bite and wrestle and pull the toys not just each other like in a pickup game of hockey if it ain't broke and ain't bleedin' its not a foul they are just playing Housebreaking Dog Ferret Shawn Michaels Dog training Eddie Guerrero Crate training Guinea pig Hamster Nintendogs Ice hockey Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pok__mon Live!
