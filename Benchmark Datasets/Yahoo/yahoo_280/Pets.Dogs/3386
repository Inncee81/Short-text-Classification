my dog is terrified of thunder how do i end this fear this is so common i watched a show on this recently they suggested that you buy one of those cd's with sounds of thunder on it play it very softly your dog will become nervous reassure your dog with a quick pet but do not coddle them this only send them the message that they have reason to be fearful the next day turn the cd up slightly and continue on your same routine dogs often take cues from their owners so if you don't seem alarmed they will feel less alarmed every day you turn the cd up slightly continue this every day until the cd is loud keep doing your thing apparently by the time the cd is loud your dog is supposed to be used to it and not bothered good luck Dog training Garfield Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hearing impairment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Death Gate Cycle Housebreaking First Battle of the Atlantic Reservoir Dogs Urinary incontinence B3ta Scooby-Doo Jam (TV series) Dog Cheating in Counter-Strike Kim Possible Hiberno-English Colony in Space About a Boy Maison Ikkoku Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an German Shepherd Dog Care Bears Doomtown Dog agility Jennifer Lopez Social rule The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Traumatic incident reduction The Smoking Room Surveillance Delicate Sound of Thunder Animal Farm The Price Is Right 1957 World Series Keeshond Dead Like Me Obedience training Musical Instrument Digital Interface God Emperor of Dune Friends Saturday Night Live Rabies Game show Out of Gas Code: Lyoko Sin City English grammar Mickey Mouse Oh My Goddess!
