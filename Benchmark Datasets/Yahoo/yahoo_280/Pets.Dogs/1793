when training your puppy do you stick with one obedience goal at a time until he masters it or can you throw in two like you teach him how to sit and he sat without struggle a few times so you throw in the come command with the sit suggestions is limiting treats per day too much suggestions he's three months old how many days should you stay on one command do you teach him twice a day a session in the morning and affternoon or once i think that you are supposed to work on one command at a time and don't start on a new one until he really has it down that way he won't get confused when learning them as for the treats i don't know but seems like a lot i try not to give my dog more than per day depends on the size of your dog compared to the treat and how much exercise your dog gets Obedience training Housebreaking Milton H.
