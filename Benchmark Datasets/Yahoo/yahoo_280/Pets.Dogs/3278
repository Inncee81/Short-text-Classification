leash training i have a month old chihuahua puppy and he wears a collar but never has worn a leash i tried to put one on him because when i'm over at my parents house he can't potty outside like normal because they have a big dog that scares him and the only way i can take him outside is to go in the front yard but he needs a leash start training him by putting the leash on him at home and walking him around the house and continuously give praise then walk him outside of your house and give the same praises and eventually when you think he is ready take him to your parents and try it there just try not to get impatient because he will look at it as a negative thing Dog training Nintendogs Leash Dog collar Housebreaking Obedience training Professional wrestling match types Dog Crate training Dog agility Characters in the Smurfs Aerial (dance move) Collar (BDSM) New York Giants 1957 World Series Invader Zim USS Walke (DD-723) Falconry Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Rugrats Elimination communication Toilet humour Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fox hunting Kitesurfing Hazing Feral child Humphrey Bogart Ocean Beach, New York Beer Hall Putsch Tag Collar Coronation of the British monarch Sinfest Pittsburgh Steelers Spot the Dog Skinny Puppy Rammstein Parenting Petplay Basset Hound Richard Chase John the Baptist Eid ul-Fitr Mixed-breed dog New Morning Back to the Future timeline Urbana, Illinois Primus (band) RuneScape Passchendaele Eruv United States Marine Corps Lady and the Tramp Lucy Robinson Sandy Koufax USS Austin (LPD-4) Greyhound The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse The Fairly OddParents 101 Dalmatians: The Series Milton H.
