house training puppy impossible when they have free roam my puppy has had free roam since we got her days ago she's a little over months old i feel too bad to put her in a crate she does well at night mostly sleeping through the night on her bed i put wee wee pads in the places she's gone to the bathroom in the house and reward her with a treat when she does her business outside i can't seem to get her to get on a schedule though she just goes sometimes every hours in the house during the day do i really need to confine her can it be done without confinement is that all i've done wrong i need to get her trained soon thank you in advance thanks for all the answers so far i wanted to add i just wrote i need to do it soon because i go back to school in september i agree with the other comments crate training isn't mean or punishing to puppy once puppy knows the crate is its safe place it will become puppy's den it also aids in housetraining immensely the key to housetraining is consistency for you you have to be consistent getting puppy outside every single time the urge strikes if you fail it's your error not hers every time you fail you delay her learning process free roaming is ok but it makes your job of housetraining a lot harder i see it like trying to swim upriver against the current blindfolded at midnight trying to follow a fish not impossible but to me you're creating a situation with so many obstacles you have a hard time clearing one let alone all of them at the same time going every hours would be a dream one of my dogs had to go out every minutes i let him roam in whatever room i was in and that's all i moved him with me everywhere i went i had baby gates throughout the house every time he paused in play i'd scoop him up and take him outside to wee other prime time potty breaks immediately coming out of the crate immediately following a meal or play time as soon as he pottied he got lots of praise and we came back into the house this went on for several months gradually the time between his potty breaks extended and he started going to the door and looking at me his signal he needed a potty break that's why crate training is so helpful when you can't watch puppy the crate is puppy's crib housetraining isn't hard but it requires lots of patience constant watching and consistency good luck Housebreaking Crate training EastEnders RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story Fox hunting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Dog Toilet humour Big Brother (Australian TV series) Ron and Fez Extreme Programming Skinny Puppy Poker jargon Scientology beliefs and practices Sin City Pitaten Tag Norwegian Campaign Dog agility The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Characters in the Smurfs Snooker John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Apollo 8 God Emperor of Dune Socialization Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Michael Garibaldi Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dean Koontz Battle of the Bulge One Tree Hill (TV series) Triage USS Tunny (SS-282) Sharon Tate Jumpstart 3rd Grade Urinary incontinence Crash Bandicoot 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule The Amber Spyglass Sydney Riot of 1879 Bon Jovi Daylight saving time USS Trigger (SS-237) StarCraft Secret Missions The Ashlee Simpson Show The Contender (television series) Speed of light Korea Jindo Dog Firefighter Baseball The Catcher in the Rye Rule of St Benedict Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Roger John Brownlow Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes Beethoven (film) Link (Legend of Zelda) Avalanche Hebrew calendar Muslim ibn Aqeel Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Big Brother UK series 6 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Reinforcement Attack on Pearl Harbor The Price Is Right My Little Pony Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Elimination communication Columbine High School massacre Crime prevention through environmental design Japanese tea ceremony Humphrey Bogart Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Singlish The Star Wars Holiday Special Johnny 5 Drowning USS America (CV-66) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Debugging Equilibrium (2002 film) The Shining (film) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
