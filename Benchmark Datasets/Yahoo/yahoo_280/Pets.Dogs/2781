bringing home a rescued lab for a trial run we're looking to adopt a yr old female lab from a rescue we're going to bring her home tomorrow and let her stay with us for the weekend we really want her to find a forever home and hope it will be with us aside from the obvious aggression what types of things should i try and or look for during those few days i have a month old and yr old at home with me as well no other pets unless you count my husband just kidding i know that she has separation anxiety and loves to counter surf but those are the foster parent's only complaints having been in rescue for over yrs and fostering many i will help with some guidelines it is good she was in a foster home very important often we have little or no background info on a dog unless owner release many good wonderful dogs are abandoned and dumped for little or no real good reason i can not express how important it is not to overwhelm her for the first week or so at least don't try to settle her in too fast and expect too much right off do not let the kids hover too much either this is a new world for her that may be overwhelming enough for first few days do not try to be training her she needs time to settle in know always full food water bowls and the door she would go out to potty that's about it dogs will give us clues to past treatment and type home they were in if you observe and give her space the seperation anxiety is to be expected no telling what the girl has been through especially if had a real home and then dumped lost from it after yrs it happens a lot so she may be clingy normally to the female of the family let her explore house and yard she may be housetrained already let her make the moves and come to family members on her own if she likes kids she will show that fairly quick a weekend is not really a fair assessment time for any new pet they will either be rather shy fearful or full of it just because of the new situation that is why we allow a wk trial adoption with a full refund within that time it is no different than a human adjusting to a new house job school etc do not allow anyone near her food water she might be overprotective of that and not because of aggression as such a dog that went without for awhile may be a bit watchful of food until it feels safe any dog that has been out on its own for any length of time and gone hungry may act this way for a while need to know how long she was fostered did they have her long enough to see her real personality i do think a older lab is a good choice with small kids your children must be trained also thank you for considering adoption and good luck follow your gut instinct on this Dog training Dog The Fairly OddParents Code: Lyoko Social rule EastEnders Pet skunk Working dog Philip J.
