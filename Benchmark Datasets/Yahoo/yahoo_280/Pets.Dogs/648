is a raw meat diet good for small dogs or just for large i have a jack russell terier and you know how hyper they are after reading about the raw mear diet for large dogs i was wondering about for her i use purina puppy chow with the vegatables in it and she is doing great looks great the vet can find no fault it doesn't really depend on the size of the dog for a raw diet just that you may want to try it but it will be a change for the dog so they suggest you use digestive enzymes to help it digest the raw food for a short while until it gets used to it it has been said that a raw diet is more natural for a dog since they don't eat cooked meat in the wild but then again we are not in the wild are we lol if the vet says its okay to try it there are more nutrients and vitamins and minerals in raw meat since the cooking process in commercial foods kills most of the good stuff hope this helps Raw food diet Milk Vitamin C Food Egg (food) Nutrition Veganism Guinea pig Vegetarianism Hamster Healthy eating Fruitarianism Domestic rabbit Vitamin Rice Livestock Pasteurization Soybean Coprophagia Cat Sauerkraut Pet skunk Vegetarian nutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Dog food Cat food Folic acid Organic food Antioxidant Cyanocobalamin Domesticated turkey Fancy rat Fecal incontinence Dieting Cuisine of Denmark Tooth Carnivore Ferret Sewage treatment Genetically modified food Ralston Purina Company Peanut Acorn Honey Crohn's disease Gastrointestinal tract Korean cuisine Food preservation Stomach cancer Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Taboo food and drink Nutrient French fries Trichinosis Enzyme Cassava Dietary fiber Paleolithic diet Sausage Chocolate Binge eating disorder Hot dog Domestication Game (food) Cooking oil Agriculture Carnivorous plant Escherichia coli O157:H7 Meat Horse meat Golden rice Foodborne illness Pig Ramen Irish cuisine Protein Cuisine of the Southern United States Coronary heart disease Nestl__ Colorectal cancer Fugu Pork Adjustable gastric band Retinol Oyster Atkins Nutritional Approach Roman eating and drinking Gray Wolf In-N-Out Burger Soul food Banana Calorie restriction Vitamin D
