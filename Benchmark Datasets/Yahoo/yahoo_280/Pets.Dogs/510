i love dogs and want to start a dog park can anyone share ideas on how where this can be done we are thinking of moving about miles so we will be near an interstate because that will create alot more business than where we are currently living also if you have been to one the things you liked or did not like about it one that has water fountains is great provide poop baggies and trash cans to help encourage people to clean up after their dogs separate fence areas for big and little dogs the one i went to had a small fenced in area at the entrance you had to go thru gates to get into the fenced area that helps prevent escaping benches for the humans to sit is good trees you need rules too and a way to enforce them aggressive dogs should not be allowed dogs should be current on shots and also be licenced if a particular breed is illegal in your city natrally it shouldnt be allowed in the dog park as well Livestock Baseball Dog training Dog Working dog Garfield Yosemite National Park Fox hunting Cerritos, California Hubert H.
