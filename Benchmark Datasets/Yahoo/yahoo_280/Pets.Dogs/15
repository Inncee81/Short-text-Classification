why do people think rottweilers are bad dogs i believe its the owners fault if the dog is bad not the dog's fault i have a rottweiler german shepherd husky mix and she is the most sweetest dog i know she is protective of me but she don't bite she'll bark at you though if you touch me i also have a labweiler lab rottweiler he's is very friendly as well i didn't need to train them to be friendly they were already and i didn't teach them to be mean i think if all people gave more love and didn't train there rotties to be mean then rottweilers would get more respect and not a bad rap like they have im not saying all people but most people my rottie mix is my sweet baby girl i love her lots since she is part husky she likes to guard her toys and anything she can get her mouth on but if i give her something else she wants or tell her to leave it alone after she drops it she will they were made to be loving dogs and as a mttera fact they are the dog for thrapie and useing for nursing home dogs i use to have one and he was the bigest baby in the world i loved him to death Rottweiler Police dog Dog German Shepherd Dog Dobermann Road Rovers Dog training Pit bull Alaskan husky Obedience training The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Schutzhund Nintendogs Humphrey Bogart Doug Jennifer Lopez Belgian Shepherd Dog Billboard Hot 100 Kodocha Alaskan Malamute Fantasy (Mariah Carey song) Allied invasion of Sicily Ranma __ characters Mixed-breed dog Hip hop collaborations Keeshond Neighbours Theory of conduct Remix Working dog Street-Legal The Beatles discography Maison Ikkoku Characters in the Smurfs Ron and Fez Kim Possible Care Bears Freestyle music American Pit Bull Terrier It's Walky!
