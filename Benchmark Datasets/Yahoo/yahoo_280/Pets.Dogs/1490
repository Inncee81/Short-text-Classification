my puppy is playing with rocks and digging them up unfortunately my backyard is decorated with river rock all around the fence line i can't take them out because we don't own the house our month old puppy has taken to playing with them i'm scared she's going to eat one or break her teeth on them it's also a problem because she likes digging them up so we end up with little rock holes in the yard it's never in the same place twice so burying poop doesn't help she gets exercise and plenty of outdoor toys and we can't be outside with her all the time any ideas make a loud annoying noise or blow a wistle when she diggs if you do this every time she will associate the noise to the digginf and stop you can also ask the breeder a longtime volunteer or the pet behaviorist at a shelter or someone who works at a pet shop or a trainer for advice petco and petsmart almost always have trainers there during the afternoon so you can ask them also look it up on the internet ceaser milan is the guy that is always on oprah look up his website good luck Housebreaking Dog Domestic rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Cat Hamster FoxTrot Guinea pig Pet skunk Hedgehog The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Puppy mill Madonna (entertainer) Kim Possible Socialization Friends Toilet humour Fancy rat Pet store Characters in the Smurfs Internet phenomenon Oprah Winfrey The Fairly OddParents Pet Tag Treehouse of Horror VIII First Battle of the Atlantic People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Border Collie Brown Bear Skinny Puppy The Brady Bunch Budgerigar The Time Machine Buddy Guy EastEnders Surveillance Nine Inch Nails Rent (musical) Garfield PETCO Park Pitaten American Black Bear Kodocha Pok__mon Live!
