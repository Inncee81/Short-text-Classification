why does my dog poop inside my house and pee outside i have a lb female chihuahua puppy she's about years old but still has problems with potty training she pees outside on our front lawn but for some reason she still poops inside the house i've noticed that she likes to go in covered areas such as under the bed under the drawer i think it's just weird and no matter how long i wait outside for her to go she doesn't go until she gets inside the house it's like when she has to go she will go no matter what time it is or where it is it doesn't seem like she can hold it in does anyone have any ideas suggestions it is because she is fearful she is afraid that the boogiman predator can find her by her scent so she does it where it is best hidden you need to build her confidence take her for long walks around her neighborhood so she can see what makes noises and learns that there are no predators awaiting her teach her things that she can learn to do to make her more confident put a bag of garden sand down where you want her to go in a secluded place put a teeny smear of her poop there so she knows that its ok to go there when you walk her on a leash in your yard take her to that place after she has snooped around a few minutes and stand there being patient when she sniffs the spot praise her when she gets the idea praise her lightly don't make a big deal over it for a timid dog and let her off lead to play a bit before going back inside in the beginning take her out seven times per day this can be reduced when you learn when she needs to go feed her at regular times removing dish after she eats so she will get on a schedule dogs love a routine and they love knowing when they are to go outside same time every day Dog training Housebreaking The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Shaggy dog story Richard Chase Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toilet humour Pitaten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Time Out of Mind Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q The Inside Characters in the Smurfs Dog Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Plame affair The Fairly OddParents Professional wrestling match types Milton H.
