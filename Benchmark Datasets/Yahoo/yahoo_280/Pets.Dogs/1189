house training puppy i have a week old lab puppy who always poos outside and wees outside the majority of the time apart from the odd accident which is nearly always because he missed the newspaper or we didn't let him out in time he sleeps in his crate at night and i was told to put half blanket half paper on the crate floor so he could toilet in the night at what point should i take away the paper so that he learns to be dry at night and go when i get him out in the morning iv'e not had a puppy since i was little it's like training a toddler to use the toilet don't put paper in the crate it will encourage him to go in the crate that is the idea of crate training not to go where they live you yelled it yourself you aren't letting him out in time take him out more often and praise him when he goes Dog training Housebreaking Crate training Ron and Fez Toilet humour Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet paper Saturday Night Live RuneScape quests Dog Urinary incontinence Toilet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
