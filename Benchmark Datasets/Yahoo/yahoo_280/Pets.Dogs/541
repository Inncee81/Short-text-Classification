how do i teach my female dogs to stop killing and playing with chickens my dogs kill and then play with chickens and that makes me sick how to make them stop that those chickens are no ones but it is still sad and disgusting and yes they are well fed they just do it for fun do your dogs run loose or do the chickens come into your yard because if the chickens come into the yard where dogs who chase chickens are that's just stupid for the chickens also what kind of dogs do you have the motivation and hence the training might be slightly different depending on their heritage do you dogs really play with the chickens and accidentally kill them or is there not really any play involved just straight to the kill chicken chasing and killing is natural for dogs some don't do it but it's definitely in their instincts that's how their ancestors survived since your dogs have already chased and killed chickens it's likely that they had a great time doing it and it will be much harder to break if your dogs aren't restrained like in a yard i think that's the best option not only will it keep them safe from dognappers and road hazards it will also protect the chickens if your dogs and the chickens must roam in the same space i think that the chickens will eventually figure out that this area is unsafe of course you don't want dead chickens everywhere before this happens so i'd suggest that you create some sort of area where the chickens can go to be safe maybe some sort of elevated platform well that's the best i can give you with limited information about the dogs chickens and their living situations but i hope this helps Dog Cat Fox hunting Joke RuneScape quests Tag Taikyoku shogi Sin City Gray Wolf The Death Gate Cycle Glossary of American football Domestic rabbit Dog training Garfield Sub-Zero Locomotive Kodocha Crate training Artificial selection Aztec Avalanche Airport Chicken Tyrannosaurus rex Scooby-Doo Baldrick The X-Files (season 1) One Piece minor characters Domestication Cowboy 24 Hours of Le Mans Ren and Stimpy Darth Vader Shaggy dog story Redundant array of independent disks The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Brown Bear Parachute Floppy disk Tai shogi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dairy Bene Gesserit Vernon Schillinger Obedience training F-104 Starfighter Characters of Lost Chapterhouse Dune Contract Social rule The nature of God in Western theology Martial art Game of chicken Space elevator Livestock Dead Like Me Housebreaking Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Aerial (dance move) Firefighter Dean Koontz Volleyball Billboard (advertising) Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Anchor Kain (Legacy of Kain) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toronto Subway and RT Bob and George Cave diving USS Trigger (SS-237) Characters of Naruto The Price Is Right The chicken or the egg Road safety Sesshomaru Cincinnati Bengals Invader Zim Space Shuttle program USS Tunny (SS-282) Dai dai shogi Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Road traffic accident Hard to Be a God Spidey Super Stories Cockfight The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Diving Soul Penda of Mercia Russian space dogs AIM-120 AMRAAM Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
