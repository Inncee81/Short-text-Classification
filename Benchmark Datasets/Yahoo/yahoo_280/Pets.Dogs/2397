any one else own a basset hound are they escape artists or what i've had my bassett hound his name is flash for the past three years i love him so much but he's became a escape artist all of asudden he will find any way possible to get out of the yard or the house for example one day we left and he was in the house we get home and he's gone didnt' no how he got out at all we searched all over well we have a window air unit in our bedroom window and on each side is a plastic flap that stretches across he tore it out and squeezed his big body through this tiny space lol i couldn't help but laugh in the back yard he has like escape holes he dug we are always trying to block lol we walk him alot and love him and don't misteat him is it just in there blood to wander around or what anyone else had this promblem is it just the type of dog he is or what and he always comes back home after wandering the neighborhood for awhile we always go look for him for what's up with this unfortunately any scent hound will do this some are so bad they are slaves to their noses they smell something remotely interesting and they must go find it and most do become rather good escape artists if his sense of scent is really that great maybe you could look around to see if your city has a volunteer rescue dog group that might at least give him an outlet for his sniffing otherwise just keep a good eye on him it's in his blood as deep as it can go and no amount of training will ever cure him of it Scent hound Dog Basset Hound Obedience training Housebreaking The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Olfaction The Cure The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Billboard Hot 100 RuneScape quests Drill bit Slayers Tag Holes (book) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Fox hunting Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Futurama (TV series - season 5) American Black Bear Skinny Puppy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fancy rat The Amber Spyglass Search and rescue W.I.T.C.H.
