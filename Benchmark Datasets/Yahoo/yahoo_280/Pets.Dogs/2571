why does my basset hound like his crate better than his playpen my basset is years old now and he's had both his playpen and his crate for a little over a year he grew up in a smaller playpen and now i enlarged it since he grew more he has a pillow some of my sweaters lots of toys a sliding door to look out and his dog bowl and water dish when i put him back there before i leave for work he howls and cries and trembles when i put him in his crate he sits there quietly i don't like the idea that he's in his ' x ' x ' crate for hours while i'm at work how can i get him to feel safe in his playpen looks like he's telling you what he wants so don't feel bad about crating him dogs in the wild seek out covered areas for protection and security and many domestic dogs love their crates plus it keeps him safe from the elements and safe from getting into dangerous things like household poisons go ahead and let him stay where he feels safe and happy The Shining (film) Dog training Dog Crate training Gray Wolf The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Basset Hound Humphrey Bogart The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Care Bears Sea-Monkey EastEnders RuneScape quests Columbo Hamster Innocence: Ghost in the Shell The Death Gate Cycle Hunting Wolf's Rain Scent hound Fox hunting Japanese tea ceremony Billboard Hot 100 Oplan Bojinka The Ersatz Elevator The Star Wars Holiday Special Fugu Garfield Balto (film) The Unquiet Dead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 2) Ferret Rent (musical) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sento Toilet humour Ed, Edd n Eddy Pitaten Time Out of Mind Muslim ibn Aqeel Crash Team Racing Firefighter Tag Blonde on Blonde Poker jargon Avenue Q The Beatles discography Saki Minor characters in Bloom County Crash Bandicoot AFI 100 Years series Columbine High School massacre Ben Johnson (athlete) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Scooby-Doo Domestic rabbit Combine (Half-Life 2) Jonathan Archer Bike lane debate Foodborne illness Seismic retrofit Kodocha Hip hop collaborations Worms weapons and tools One Tree Hill (TV series) The Lovely Bones Fancy rat The Doctor Dances Paragliding Ron Weasley Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Equine conformation Johnny 5 Salad Fingers Cat Ocean's Twelve The Emancipation of Mimi First-person shooter The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) One (Voyager episode) Serenity (Firefly episode) The Beatles bootlegs Dolly Parton Simon Tam Elis Prefecture Highway 61 Revisited Morphology (linguistics) The Apprentice 2 Whitewater Dean Koontz Fire fighting Sydney Riot of 1879 Customs and etiquette of Japan
