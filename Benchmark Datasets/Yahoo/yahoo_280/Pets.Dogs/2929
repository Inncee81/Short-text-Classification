i cant make my dog behave any tips how i can make him behave well first of all you are not very descriptive on the issue you are having with your canine friend if i do not know what the problem is then i guess i will just have to give a few tips on some common issues with dogs one jumping up on people first thing is that you need to learn to ignore your dog when hey get out of hand when he jumps on you or begs you to play and you do not want to simply say no in a firm tone and turn your back towards him if he continues firmly tap him on the snout and yell out a startling sound to get his attention not too loud but just loud enough to give him a little shock then say no and turn your back to him two begging for food when a dog begs the best thing to do is simply ignore if he lingers around the table and whines make a loud firm yelp as with and startle him say no in a firm voice and demand go lay down if persistance stand before him and shuffle your feet and yell no go lay down three dragging you on the leash this one takes strength and patience as well as the other but strength depends on how big your dog is if it is a small dog then it will make is easier with big dogs prepare for more disipline when walking your dog and he starts to pull forward stop and pipe out a strange sound like a loud shriek of some sort and say bad in a firm tone and demand stay pull back on the leash and make him sit beside you continue this over and over until he gets the point that you are the leader not him four chewing things up this is probably one of the easiest things to stop there are a number of ways to prevent this one way to prevent this is that you can buy a no chew or no bite spray that tastes terrible to him in which they usually use for hot spots or excessive chewing of the limbs but it will work just as well on things that belong to you such as pillows in which he likes to chew simply spray the things he likes to chew the most and keep this up for a week or so until he finds the objects undesirable be sure the spray is safe for your dog you can find the spray at most pet stores another way is to simply smack him firmly on the nose retrieve the item and yell no bad and make a loud shriek of a sound these sounds are used to simply get their attention it is a technique used with most professional training fyi you may need to continue this for a little while but hopefully if you are doing it correctly he will get the point that chewing your stuff is not ok tips do not be rough with your dog and scream too loud at him just use a firm tone screaming at him doesn't help be sure to buy your dog plenty of toys and raw hides for him to chew on and play with when training him not to chew on your things introduce him to hides and toys in which he can chew without getting into trouble good luck Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Aerial (dance move) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog Garfield Invader Zim Dog agility Equine conformation Tag Reservoir Dogs Sin City Skateboarding trick The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Hamster Vegeta Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Inside Combine (Half-Life 2) Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests GunZ The Duel Timpani Volleyball The Dalek Invasion of Earth Piccolo Junior Saga Futurama (TV series - season 5) Full Metal Panic?
