my mo old german shepherd is not listening to me he barks and when we tell him no barking he keeps barking same with the biting we tell him no bite and he does it again at in the morning he barks non stop for an hour he's been like this for about a month he isnt very obdient what do i do dogs have a genetic pack mentality it's something that cannot be trained out worked around or ignored a dog has an inherent sense of pack order alpha dog is the leader of the pack and you obey alpha or there will be serious consequences in the wild alpha always eats first alpha is typically the only one who is allowed to reproduce alpha walks at the front of the pack alpha calls all the shots etc that's a biological part of a dog's brain end of story you and your dog comprise the pack if you won't step up an be alpha you dog happily will it sounds like he already has you need to break him of that i am not an advocate of animal abuse starving depriving of water beating unconscious but you need to be firm and assert your dominance otherwise you'll end up with a dog who runs your household why is it important that you do this now because the longer you dog thinks he's alpha the harder it will be to break him of that idea why is it important that your dog knows you're alpha and he's beta because otherwise he won't listen to you so if he sees an extremely exciting squirrel running across the road and is too distracted to see the truck rolling along he won't come when you call him and you'll end up with a dead dog or what if he tears up your furniture or bites someone perhaps a neighbor's kid who parents would sue you and have the dog put down point blank a dog sees the world through dog eyes and thinks with dog logic every dog knows their place in the pack if your dog thinks he's alpha you're in bad shape a dog who knows that he is beta and his owner is alpha is a dog who will love you look up to you and most importantly listen to you all the time a dog doesn't know when it counts when he needs to listen to you it's either a he does it of the time because you're in charge or b he does it when it pleases him because he's in charge i have two german shepherd puppies both months old and both are happy and healthy dogs who have the utmost respect for me and my commands we walk through town without leashes on and they stay right behind me no matter what squirrel runs by or what dog or person walks up i am alpha and disobeying me isn't an option they know that they are perfectly happy with that and so we have a healthy relationship and i know i can trust them to run around outside and not run away or run into the street i didn't use obedience school training classes personally i don't believe in that stuff in the wild no one teaches alpha dog how to be alpha he simply does it i teach my dogs from day that i'm in charge they don't eat unless i put food in their bowl put it on the floor and tell them it's meal time they don't chew on anything i don't give them they never walk in front of me or walk through a door before i do in the rare cases where i'm somewhere where they need to be on leash they never pull on the leash they're at my side not in front of me they go to the bathroom both pee pee and poo poo separately on command they sleep at the foot of my bed and only get up when i tell them they can and only get off when i tell them that too this is not brainwashing or abuse this is simply working with their genetic pack order mentality when it comes to dog training it is not a time to get political and whine and cry about how we need to let our dogs think for themselves and do what they want that's a human debate dogs don't use human logic they use dog logic which is rudimentary and based entirely on a chain of command pack order it's called dogma for a reason my dogs are friendly with strangers other dogs and guests they love me and i love them but it's a healthy relationship i can trust them and they will always do what i say without fail including coming when i call no matter what known as total recall i'm not trying to boast here i'm trying to paint a picture of a healthy relationship and show you what you can have if you're willing to step up and be dominant frankly you should have read up on this stuff dog training and specifically german shepherd training before you got a puppy in terms of turning this mess around and showing him that you're dominant here are some tips first have patience you need to do dominance exercises with your dog for an hour a day every day that's about all a puppy can handle second don't be a wimp enforce what you say don't teach your dog that you're a push over teach him that the only option is to listen to you the idea of doing something else simply shouldn't cross his mind i crate train my dogs and it works wonders yeah your puppy will whine and cry and scream for two hours too bad you're in charge your puppy will eventually settle down and sleep whatever you do do not ever let your puppy out of the crate while it is whining crying objecting you hold of the power and your dog holds dogs can't understand mutual decision making again that relies on human logic your dog uses dog logic i am not afraid to slap a puppy as in hard enough to knock him over on his side but not hard enough to break a bone or anything dogs don't use words to communicate things they use actions they can't speak and they can't follow a conversation use lots of praise when your dog does what you want repetition is key the worst punishment for a german shepherd is to be locked in his crate in the corner where he can see you and to have you ignore him minimum of minutes again never let him out unless he's silent if you give in to him he's alpha and you are following his wishes not the other way around i sincerely urge you to check out http www uwsp edu psych dog dog htm there are tons of great puppy training how to articles one of the most useful ones for me is training cold turkey minute down stay by j frasche' it's an excellent dominance exercise for german shepherds remember if you want a loyal loving happy healthy dog who listens to you no matter what and respects you as
