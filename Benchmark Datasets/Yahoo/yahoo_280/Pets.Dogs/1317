need to train my dog to not snap hen i give her her treat she sits when told lays when told usually but when she gets her treat for doing good she always jumps out of sitting or laying position to get it and ends up snapping at my finger anything i can do i've already tried not giving it to her until she calms down but that doesnt' work i had that problem with my one dog i like watching victoria from animal planet's its me or the dog show and her suggestions are great she also has books and a web site too in a couple of days i had zoe broken of this bad habit victoria suggests not to say no but making a grunt dismaying sound because dogs don't talk but give short grunts yips etc to communicate feelings to each other your dog won't be used to this and will stop its train of thought of the treat and hopefully bring its attention back to you i also completely encase the whole treat in my hand and state the word gentle along with moving slowly if zoe would move i would grunt at her and give her a look of i mean business patients is a must and being consistant is the most important part of training hope this helps Dog training Milton H.
