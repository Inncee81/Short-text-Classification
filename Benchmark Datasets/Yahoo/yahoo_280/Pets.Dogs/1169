how old can a female yorkie get pregnant i have a months female yorkie she is only lb oz now we want wait until she is older and bigger before spay her but i'd like to take her to my cusin's home she has male poodle i want to make sure she is safe to become pregnant i mean i don't want my yorkie to become pregnant i had a yorkie long time ago she become pregnant by accident she looked older and tired after the puppies born call your vet and ask if he doesn't have some sort of 'birth control' pill you could give your puppy while she is on the visit to your cousin's home only if she'll be staying at least 'overnight' most dogs don't go into their 'first heat' until they are seven months old but i had a dog of a larger breed that got pregnant when she was only five months old and your yorkie would be 'much healthier' if you could keep her from ever getting pregnant i assume that you didn't buy her to become a 'breeder' of more yorkies and because she's 'tiny' that is probably for the best otherwise you could get some 'heat panties' that she can wear when she is around the male dog they 'absorb' the blood dogs shed when in heat and better yet the prevent the male from being able to 'penetrate' to get the dog pregnant Dog Yorkshire Terrier Guinea pig Housebreaking Menstrual cycle Dog training Docking EastEnders Dobermann Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Humphrey Bogart Cat Dog show Mixed-breed dog Psoriasis Oral contraceptive Havanese Pet skunk Eddie Guerrero Horse Folic acid Basset Hound Neighbours Maltese (dog) Poodle Labrador Retriever Birth control Ferret Rottweiler Scooby-Doo American Kennel Club Manx (cat) Crate training Breed registry Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tocopherol Alois Hitler Abortion debate Nuclear power Socialization Fox hunting Dog breed Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Lion Pekingese Hyperthermia Ocean's Twelve Dog breeding Kakapo Great Dane Pregnancy Acne Hamster Nuclear reactor Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Kerry Blue Terrier Cytomegalovirus Cockapoo Animal testing Tire Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Border Terrier Charles Manson Sharon Tate Puppy mill Friends Keeshond Nintendogs Tigon Rosa Parks Vampire Shaggy dog story Kangaroo Dennis the Menace (UK) Baldness treatments Urinary incontinence The Inside Best of Breed Knots Landing Amy Dumas Firefighter Kodocha Marilyn Monroe Heartworm Hybrid Fancy rat Undergarment German Shepherd Dog Welsh Terrier Dairy Liger Smooth Collie Irish Wolfhound Guide dog Spacecraft propulsion Discus (fish) Pomeranian (dog) Alaskan husky Francis Bacon (painter)
