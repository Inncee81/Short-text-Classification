why buy when you can adopt why do people always insist on buying a pure bred dog from a breeder i mean mixed breeds are so much healthier and there are tons of dogs in pounds who need a home not to mention its so much cheaper to adopt a dog than to go out and buy a 'designer doggy' from a breeder i adopted my dog why don't other people do the same wow almost all of you act like a pure bred is a much healtier dog that is automatically smarter and more obidient the most violent foul mannered dogs i've met are pure breds mixed actually are healthier dogs heard that straight from the mouth of a vet there are rescues for purebred dogs why not go there if you want a purebred and at pounds you can hear from volunteers who work with the dogs as to whether or not the dog is foul mannered or untrainable and you can adopt puppies at pounds too why pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a dog when you can save the life of a dog in the pound many people think that buying a purebred will insure a healthier dog or a better behaved dog also its a status symbol some people really like how a dog looks and they want it but as long as people keep wanting these dogs people will keep breeding them i am surprised that there are so many people out there that really don't know how bad the overpopulation of animals is million are euthanized each year in shelters across the us because there are not enough homes for them i adopted my dog and cats as well i also foster homeless kittens when reputable breeders do all necessary checks to help insure a healthy dog that helps a purebred i've worked in the veterinary field for about years and in my experience and the veterinarians that work there's experience more purebreds come in with health issues associated with their breed than mixed breeds but also there are many people that buy purebreds from bad breeders that are not honest and don't do testing testing for genetic disorders in puppies is not always acurate and just because a parent is healthy doesn't mean that the puppies will be healthy people are going to buy or adopt whatever they want to and breeders are going to keep breeding just keep letting people know that there is an over population problem and that they should not be letting their pets run around and get knocked up and have litter after litter of puppies spaying and neutering is going to be the fix to pet over population there are so many low cost spay neuter places if you want to help with the pet over population problem please call your local humane society if you plan on breeding please be a good breeder and make sure you are adopting out healthy pets Domestic rabbit Pet skunk Mixed-breed dog Animal shelter Dog breed Dog breeding Docking Breed registry Golden Retriever Guinea pig Dobermann Animal euthanasia Manx (cat) Socialization Labrador Retriever Selective breeding Puppy mill Havanese Fancy rat Great Dane Greyhound Alaskan husky American Kennel Club Hamster Housebreaking Rescue group Border Terrier Pet store Veterinarian Rabbit German Shepherd Dog Whippet Border Collie English Springer Spaniel Health insurance Keeshond Yorkshire Terrier Show cat American Pit Bull Terrier Overpopulation Theory of conduct Beethoven (film) Garfield Siberian Husky Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rabies Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Dog training Dog agility Obedience training American Eskimo Dog Chihuahua (dog) Fox hunting Smooth Collie Pet Working dog Castration Nuclear power People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Dairy Sterilization (surgical procedure) Life insurance Alaskan Malamute Gray Wolf European Rabbit Iditarod Pound sterling Shaggy dog story Dog show Adoption Economy of the United States Pekingese Domestication Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hip dysplasia Terri Schiavo Hunting Belgian Shepherd Dog Annuity Brian Griffin Bulk vending Fast breeder Jack Russell Terrier Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Canary Poker jargon Pomeranian (dog) Rottweiler American Cocker Spaniel Discus (fish)
