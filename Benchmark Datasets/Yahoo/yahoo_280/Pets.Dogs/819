am i killing my dogs since the food recall i really dont like trusting food and i know they are supposed to pull them off the shelf they havent had all of them pulled my friend had a dog die from trying to buy safe dog food they thought they pulled them off teh shelves and besides i heard that its alot better for the dogs to have raw meat in there diet anyway she is also a wolf hybrid if that helps i also give my dogs vitamins everyday like i have chicken steak roast deer meat etc i dont feed them alot and they love the meat also is this healthy for my dogs it will not hurt them in fact because they are wolf hybrids it is probably better for them than most dog foods and they are not in the house lap dogs they are large dogs and need the proteins and minerals raw meat and bones give them you don't believe me you a try putting your hunting dogs on a diet of dog food dry canned chimerical hi dollar it doesn't make any difference then hunt them and see how much it hurts their stamina they'll be give out before the morning is half way over that stuff might be alright for poodles and other house and lap dogs but not for large dogs they need the raw meat dogs and wolves are carnivores they need meat you might also try mixing in some sardines a couple times a week for their coat and skin get the kind had has real sardines with real sardine oil not that soy oil junk if you can if it where you live also if you feed them chicken it is a good idea to get the bones out first unless you are feeding them whole chickens you don't there is a danger they will get a bone stuck in their throats and you will get your arm chewed up getting it out Dog Veganism Tlingit Gray Wolf Chicken Livestock RuneScape quests Fancy rat Hamburger Tofu Vegetarianism Ferret Egg (food) Jewish cuisine Cantonese cuisine Domestication Cuisine of Malaysia Raw food diet Guinea pig Milk Domesticated turkey Hunting Omega-3 fatty acid Food Domestic rabbit Hamster Breastfeeding Soybean Vitamin D Vitamin C Chili con carne Cat Lisa the Vegetarian Ramen Brown Bear Healthy eating Dog training Carnivore Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Organic food Theory of conduct Cuisine of Denmark Comanche Vermicompost Tyrannosaurus rex Hot dog Animal rights Aztec Dog food Peanut Factory farming Garfield Kangaroo Chocolate Barbecue Korean cuisine German cuisine Meat Loaf Dieting Inuit Cuisine of the Southern United States Rocko's Modern Life Sperm Whale Vitamin Sin City Peruvian cuisine Soy milk Whaling Pig Kosher foods Food preservation Tooth French cuisine Bengali cuisine Protein Cat food Anemia Fishing Foie gras Soy protein French fries Kebab RuneScape skills Genetically modified food Meat Snake Tiger Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Nutrition Gelatin Vegetarian nutrition Taiwanese cuisine Chicken soup Cheese Cuisine of Singapore Vitasoy
