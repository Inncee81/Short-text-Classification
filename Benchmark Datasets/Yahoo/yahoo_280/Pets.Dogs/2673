suggestions please for making my dogs run more interesting already have swinging tyre loads of toys i have two dogs one year old staffy dog and an month old staffy cross girl we have been told the younger dog barks when we leave her in her run she also chews her wooden kennel i realise leaving them is not ideal but i want to make the environment as interesting as possible to keep her occupied i am also toying with buying one of those anti bark devices which lets out sonic pulse everytime she barks to try and break the habit harmless just annoying to her is this a good idea i walk them both am and pm during the walks they run themselves ragged the anti bark device is not in the form of a collar it is made for attaching to a wall it emits a short burst of high frequency sound when it senses barking i like your attitude that you care about your dog's well being firstly about the anti bark devices they may stop a dog from barking but do they really solve the problem what i am saying is that they dont teach anything the dog doesnt get to learn not to bark except through force and can we really be sure that it is harmless in the long run given that dogs have such sensitive hearing apart from that your dogs sound somewhat bored chewed kennel and barking she has lots of toys then you can rotate them take some away for awhile and then when you bring them back out she can rediscover how much she used to love that toy s also dogs in their natural state spend their time hunting and forageing for a large period of their day hiding foods strategically is also a good idea and lots of excercise before you leave them with your attitude i think you will all do fine Dog training Carl Barks Garfield Dog agility Hamster Shaggy dog story Alaskan husky USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation RuneScape quests Naval mine Futurama (TV series - season 5) M16 (rifle) Electronic amplifier Iditarod Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sesshomaru Obedience training Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Labrador Retriever Golden Retriever Sick Puppy Chinchilla Loudspeaker Combine (Half-Life 2) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Johnny 5 Docking Good Vibrations The Shining (film) Traumatic incident reduction John Cage Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Milton H.
