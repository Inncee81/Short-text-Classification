so what's the story on cesar millan dog whisperer i heard he killed a dog and abuse dogs huh explain for me many of the methods cesar millan uses can actually kill a dog although i do not think cesar has actually killed a dog using them at least not yet the incident you are reffering to is probably the one reported by usa today back in may of where a tv producer dropped his dog off at cesar's training center and was called shortly thereafter with a report that his dog had been rushed to the vet his dog suffered from damage to his esophagus as well as severe bruising supposedly it was not cesar himself who was handling this dog but one of his employees regardless of who actually injured the dog they did it using techniques recommended by cesar millan unfortunately abusive is often in the eye of the beholder in this country i can guarantee if i went to my local dog park and whipped out half of the techniques cesar uses on his show that people would come up to me and tell me what a horrible person i am for abusing my dogs in the past it was not uncommon for a trainer to recommend that a dog owner handler hang the dog on their choke chain pulling up so that the dog's front feet could not touch the ground this is an undeniably abusive method of training and many of cesar's techniques aren't really much different when you look at them closely other people see nothing wrong with using physical force such as hitting and strangling a dog if it's done in the name of training that's not to say that all of his methods are abusive but many of them are by modern dog training standards i actually have to agree with him on some points for example i agree that most dogs that display problem behaviors do not get enough physical exercise and that many people coddle their dogs inappropriately therefore creating behavior problems and making them worse Dog training Dog agility Dog Domestic violence Stuttering Sin City Traumatic brain injury Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Boxing Scientology beliefs and practices Professional wrestling holds Housebreaking Traumatic incident reduction Ultimate (sport) Glossary of American football Swimming Professional wrestling throws Fox hunting USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Spanking 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Suffering (game) Schutzhund Cancer Capital punishment Fancy rat Gun safety Contract Infantilism Neuro-linguistic programming Trench warfare Autism Diving Contredanse Equine conformation Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Torture Shaggy dog story Gun dog Alcoholism Socialization Mumia Abu-Jamal Insulin Camp Delta Sniper Tenshinhan Violence in sports Gray Wolf Professional wrestling aerial techniques Dog show Pok__mon Abilities New York Giants Abortion Service dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Mixed martial arts Mixed-breed dog Tag Professional wrestling match types The Death Gate Cycle Domestic rabbit GunZ The Duel Drug abuse Australian Cattle Dog Battle of Calabria Rabies Controversies in autism Phimosis Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Milton H.
