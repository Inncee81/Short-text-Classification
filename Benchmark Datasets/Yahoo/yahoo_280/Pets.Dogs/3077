what should i do about my dog my dog is a purebred siberian husky i found him in the streets when he was and adopted him he has been a part of the family for three years he has pain in his back legs it's hard for him to lay down everyone sugests to put him down i don't want to i can't the most ppl to tell me to put him down than i will put him down if more ppl tell me not to than i won't i have given him lots of medication but most of it he wont take i just dont know what to do this is one of the hardest things about owning a pet you love them so hard and you want them to be with you forever but unfortunately they only have such a short lifespan compared to us humans you have given this dog a loving home and the experience of being owned by someone responsible for the last years at an age when most people wouldn't people don't like to invest their emotions and finances in senior dogs for just this reason it took a very big heart to do so and i'm very glad to hear that there are people like you still out there with that said if you've already taken your dog to the vet gotten a diagnosis and pet meds then you are now at the point where his quality of life is what should drive your decisions there are a variety of pain meds out there sounds like your husky has the hip problems that afflict most of the breed after a certain age some people use rimydahl and find that effective for pain management but even that fails to work after a certain point if your dog has more pain in his daily life than not you need to seriously consider your options if he's no longer able to comfortably eat drink and get around without being in constant pain then he's not having a quality of life you would want him to have if he's still having days without pain and getting around well then it may not be time yet but if he's in pain most of the time and letting you know then you may have to make that hardest of decisions because huskies are such stoic athletic dogs they often don't acknowledge or demonstrate their pain until its really bad if he's having pain getting up as well as laying down unable to climb stairs without hurting or able to enjoy a simple walk or unable to get up to relieve himself elsewhere then its time he's relying on you to keep him from suffering a pain he can't relieve himself of and its your responsibility as someone who loves him to make sure he doesn't suffer needlessly because you're too selfishly loving him to let him go yet i know this is hard i've been in your shoes where i've had to make a life ending decision to stop a dog from suffering i don't know whats harder making that decision with an senior dog who's now suffering from age related deterioration or with a puppy who's never had a chance to enjoy life and is slowly dying because its so sick from being in a shelter since it was born and contracting diseases it has no immune system to recover from i've done both and my only consolation to offer you is that you gave this dog a piece of your heart he takes it with you when he leaves but the part of his heart he leaves you with will be with you forever best of luck and god bless Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Dog training Alcoholics Anonymous Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asthma Equine conformation Sin City Shaggy dog story Mixed-breed dog Cat Fancy rat Simone Weil Kodocha Medicine Rabies Narcissism The Death Gate Cycle The Amber Spyglass Multiple sclerosis Migraine Sickle-cell disease Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Fecal incontinence Maison Ikkoku Babe Ruth Pitaten Sant Thakar Singh Guinea pig Friends Mother Teresa Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Procrastination Breastfeeding Stoicism Alaskan husky Blood on the Tracks Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Immortality Alcoholism Siberian Husky Pneumonia Housebreaking Tai Chi Chuan Book of Isaiah Hal Trosky Stomach cancer Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Oh My Goddess!
