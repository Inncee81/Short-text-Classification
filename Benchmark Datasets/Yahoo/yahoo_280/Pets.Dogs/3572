my friend hasn't taught her dog who is little and cute not to jump up on people and he just goes nuts jumping it's not so bad when i have longer pants on but am usually in shorts so my legs get scratched she keeps saying to him don't jump up but she doesn't stop him i love this little dog and i don't want to have to be the one to discipline him also she might be offended i forgot to say the cutie pie is about years old your friend is telling the dog not to jump so she obviously does not want it to but he is way past time for learning as he is it will take work to break him of this bad habit talk to her if she wants to train the dog not to jump she could use your help i have found one of the easiset ways to break them of this habit have her exercise the dog a very long walk to burn off some of the excess energy then you come over she needs to have control of the dog on a leash put the leash under her foot and do not give the dog enough room to jump at the same time put your hand out flat palm forward in a stop motion and tell the dog down do this for several days then give more room on the leash she may have to sit and keep control of leash pulling down at the same time the command is given each time the dog reacts as expected praise him good dog boy with practice and persiverance you can work up to no leash and a simple command will do most people make the same mistake with dogs dont jump up is too much for the dog to understand they really do much better and a lot faster with simple one word commands such as down sit stay and no Dog training Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Swingout Swimming Equine conformation Dog agility Kodocha Falconry Social rule Milton H.
