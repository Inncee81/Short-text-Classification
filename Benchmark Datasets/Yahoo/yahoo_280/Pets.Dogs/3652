pomeranian grooming help my male pomeraninans butt hair is kinda rough can i put my hair conditioner on it when i give him a bath ok i'm going to have to really differ with wendy and kit kat here first human grade shampoos and conditioners do have a different ph level and are to alkaline for dogs they can be used but only very rarely and they should be the best quality shampoos biolage if you use human grade shampoo you too much you will dry out your dogs skin and coat and create problems there are sooooo many good quality dog shampoos on the market that there is no reason to use human shamp biogroom espree francodex lambert kay and more please don't use hartz its cheap detergent and if some one is telling you to not use a human grade shampoo why would that person tell you to use fabric softener on your dog don't do this this product is for fabric not dog hair and skin same for dish detergent and other household cleaners these are not for animals for your question once is ok but its better to go to petsmart or petco and get a good cond and shampoo a good basic shampoo and cond would be an oatmeal base or hypoallergenic shampoo the dog then before rinsing put the conditioner on the coat and shampoo it into the coat you can use a good stiff plastic comb and comb through the coat especially around the pants and tail to comb out dead hair and mats then rinse well until you see no residue or bubbles shampooing this way adding the conditioner in allows the conditioner to work but the shampoo helps break the conditioner down to rinse it more easily don't over bathe once a month is ok and don't forget to brush and comb after bathing and drying or you can get matts pay attention to the pants area tail neck rough leg pits and belly Shampoo Sento Dishwasher Keeshond Plastic Soap Dairy Dandruff Textile manufacturing Dog Cat Laundry detergent Ranma __ characters Shetland Sheepdog Psoriasis Hard water Tooth enamel Procter & Gamble Urticaria Hamster Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing terminology Sesshomaru Jute Livestock Sewage treatment Halitosis Fancy rat Leather Acne First aid Poodle Laserdisc Pottery Dog training Kimono American Eskimo Dog Hair Domesticated turkey The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Aerial (dance move) Comanche Aloe Soap bubble Equine conformation Detergent Bulk vending Wool Basset Hound Shaving Brush Corrosion German Shepherd Dog Multiple chemical sensitivity Crab louse Wood American Bison Vinegar Strap-on dildo Havanese Eczema Welding Pubic hair Baldness treatments Human My Little Pony Solar cell Gray Wolf Manx (cat) Humphrey Bogart Peanut Illegal drug trade Horse Coat (dog) Wine Cashmere wool Japanese toilet Bonus Stage Glycerin Hair conditioner Leopard Tofu Basic English Drowning Airsoft Airedale Terrier Family Feud Building material Mixed martial arts Oral sex Massage Singlish Puberty
