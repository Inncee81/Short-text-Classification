why has my month old boxer puppy stopped eating hard food she will still eat moist dog treats chicken and cheese but not her regular food also she has diarrhea but that might be from not eating the right foods any ideas having boxers and raising two litters i can tell you that an occasional treat is fine but they have very sensitive stomachs and then gas i would stick to one type of food and leave all treats alone for awhile i feed mine newman's own organic dog food diarrhea is probably from the treats and not regular foods all dogs will get an upset tummy from time to time but with boxers you have to watch what you give them food changes need to be done slowly and your dog is the best indicator of something not right water is up to the dog as to how much and is not detrimental in any way water doesn't cause diarrhea diarrhea is a loss of fluids so they need the water to compensate boxers are a great dog with a fussy tummy and prone to gas and upset so watch what you feed good luck and enjoy puppy socialize and train they love to learn tricks and learn quickly they love to run and explore and of course be a part of the family daily if you feed table scraps they are smart to know that dog food isn't as good and will not eat the dog food to get the good stuff they are smart smart smart can't blame them for trying Diarrhea Guinea pig Dog training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Care Bears Dog Labrador Retriever Atkins Nutritional Approach Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cat Humphrey Bogart Fancy rat Breastfeeding Brian Griffin Kodocha Prostate cancer Boxing training Tooth enamel Livestock Garfield Nerpa The Daily Show Kitten Dog agility Pet skunk Chemotherapy English grammar Iditarod Chicken Food Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Animal Farm Omega-3 fatty acid Drowning Lisa the Vegetarian The Butterfly Effect Cuisine of Denmark Trailer Park Boys Socialization Gray Wolf Jewish cuisine Chocolate Potato Gastroparesis Mnemonic Kosher foods Characters in the Smurfs Ron Weasley Housebreaking Kitchen Hot dog RuneScape skills Fast-food restaurant Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lactose intolerance Rotavirus Dehydration Campylobacteriosis Puppy mill Tooth Kashrut Fox hunting Shaggy dog story Boxer (dog) Mixed-breed dog Characters of Naruto Coeliac disease RuneScape quests Hydrochloric acid Insulin Cheese Chinchilla Pneumonia Rocko's Modern Life Bloat Spidey Super Stories McDonald's Adjustable gastric band YuYu Hakusho Tofu Egg (food) Gameplay of StarCraft Charles Darwin's illness Ranma __ characters Teacher's Pet (Disney) Rocky Mountain spotted fever Decompression sickness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shark Scuba set Domestication Cuisine of the Philippines
