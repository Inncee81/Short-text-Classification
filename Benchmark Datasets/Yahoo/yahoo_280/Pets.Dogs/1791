buying a dog i'm going to buy a dog but would like to get people's opinions the most it would ever be alone for is hours at any one time is this too long in people's opinions would it be better to buy two dogs so that they have some company i was thinking one walk in the morning before work one walk in afternoon and then one walk in the evening each day leaving a dog alone for that amount of time is fine for most breeds if you get a puppy it is good to teach it how to be home alone because in reality we all leave pets alone either to go to work school etc i would recommend getting only one dog to start because two new dogs are already nervous being in a new environment and it would be chaos i would be able to help more with other info such as living space yard activities you plan to do with it etc Dog training Housebreaking Dog Socialization Dog agility Dog breed Golden Retriever Labrador Retriever Shaggy dog story Havanese Insomnia Fancy rat Obedience training Belgian Shepherd Dog Dobermann German Shepherd Dog Border Collie Nintendogs Rabies Alaskan husky Daylight saving time American Pit Bull Terrier Dog breeding Working dog Pets.com 101 Dalmatians: The Series Cat Hamster Guinea pig Puppy mill Dorama 2003 North America blackout Quill (film) Companion dog Steven Wright Mixed-breed dog Guide dog Keeshond Shetland Sheepdog English Springer Spaniel Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) KTTV Breed registry Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Pit bull Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina American Eskimo Dog Korea Jindo Dog Australian Cattle Dog Canonical hours Taikyoku shogi Herding dog Docking Neighbours Aphasia Reservoir Dogs WNNX (FM) Crufts Whippet WFAN (AM) Border Terrier Iditarod Pet store Breed standard Yorkshire Terrier Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Miniature Fox Terrier Krypto Crate training Skye Terrier Sydney Riot of 1879 Grammatical aspect RuneScape quests Pekingese MTV2 Greyhound West Highland White Terrier The Death Gate Cycle Skinny Puppy Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dog show Domestic rabbit Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Battle of Antietam American Kennel Club Hunting USS Yorktown (CV-10) Protests during the EU summit in Gothenburg 2001 Ferret Thermoregulation Mutual fund USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Police dog Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Laika ITV
