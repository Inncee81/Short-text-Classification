no gender offense just where are all the men gone when it comes to helping animals to the best of my knowledge those who are keen to help strays and volunteers in shelters are mostly women as least this is the case in china and i don t think there are vast differences in other countries in mainland china all the dog cat shelters i know are run by women one of them locates in beijing whose owner a great entrepreneur turned charitarian lady has been struggling to burden all the expenses and stresses another lady is a reputable professor with a top university in beijing she is more than seventy years old and almost all the volunteers are young girls which really makes me frustrated almost all the shelters here are no kill which is why it is quite difficult for them to maintain and give admission to more poor dogs and cats people involved just find it unacceptable to give a poor animal a second chance to live and then euthanize it only because it probably can never be adopted don t get me wrong and don t take offense there has to have a reason for men s absence out there i am really sorry if anyone of you think i have gone a bit too far i think that the maternal instint takes over so women enjoy caregiving more overall not to say men can't or don't guys are more of a relax with the dog throw him a bone type attitude Cat Animal shelter Infantilism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Education in the People's Republic of China People's Republic of China Transsexuality Divorce Gender role Rabies Social rule Breastfeeding Fathers' rights Pet skunk Rescue group Dog Animal rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Joke Empress Dowager Cixi New York Giants Tai Chi Chuan The Smoking Room Socialization Capital punishment History of the People's Republic of China Feral cat Feminism Jean Grey Maison Ikkoku Homosexuality in China Livestock Amy Dumas Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Graduate school China Obedience training Zhao Yun Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Family name Politics of the People's Republic of China Inuit Lethal injection Hillary Rodham Clinton Mail-order bride Biology and sexual orientation Conscription Friends Euthanasia Domestic violence Kodocha Standard Mandarin Chinese astrology Price discrimination Same-sex marriage Polygamy People's Liberation Army Jam (TV series) Prisoner (TV series) Stone Age Urinary incontinence Fancy rat Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China Philosophy of language Garfield Shark Faye Wong Morphology (linguistics) Iberian naming customs Taiwan independence Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cross-dressing American football Cowboy Bebop Contract Affirmative action United Nations George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Woman Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Brian Griffin History of the People's Republic of China (4/4) My Lai Massacre Trailer Park Boys Androgen insensitivity syndrome Yuan Dynasty China and the United Nations Peter Singer Jon Secada Sexual orientation History of Communist Albania Volleyball Anarcho-capitalism Ferret
