will getting my pit bull neutered help him to be less dog aggressive firstly i do not need ridiculous responses to this question i am looking for real quality responses i have an adba registered american pit bull terrier named atticus he is male and he is a year old i have another male pit that he got into a fight with and it's been almost impossible to keep the separated i have been playing doggie musical chairs with one dog in the grarage and one outside for months my bigger male pit is great for breeding and shows adba nkc ukc registered in short i can't get him neutered and he is my baby i have no problem getting atticus neutered if it will calm him down i have tried to find him a better home however everyone that wants him will either a put him on a chain or b i am worried they will fight him i would rather put him in training and get him neutered than have him abused by someone else i know as long as atticus is with me he will be safe so will neutering atticus help make him be more submissive and less likely to fight atticus is not nearly as nice a prospect for breeding as my other male is i dont believe everyone that has a registered dog should be breeding my choices with atticus are a keep trying to find him a home which i hate because only losers are calling me b keep doing what i am doing with separating them c try getting atticus neutered and get him in dog training i couldnt live with myself if i saw a picture of him abused hurt etc i hope that helps to understand my dilemma i have a fenced in backyard also with a 'x ' kennel however atticus chews through my wood fence and breaks out of the chain link kennel any advice would be extremely appreciated i have honestly done all that i know to do except for getting atticus neutered and try training well not that i can change it now but it's my mistake i should have never bought atticus to begin with i got doped into believing that since my big male was older and atticus was at the time only weeks that atticus would view my other male as the dominant dog and there would be no trouble not true the whole fight between them was over a squeeky ball that i threw what's funny is i threw two squeeky balls to them one for each the fight i think was really over my affection my biggest and concern is atticus safety atticus presents me with multiple problems he breaks through any fence i put him in he fights with the other dog i worry if i give him away or sell him someone will fight him or he will be abused not to mention the horrible responsibility i have on my shoulders that if i do give him away and someone abuses him what if he gets out and then hurts someone else it sounds like atticus is an alpha male and he is trying to assert himself as the top dog in the house he is also a year old and is starting to go through that my poop does not stink phase neutering him will help calm him down some get him into training with either a trainer or a behaviorist i would lean more towards the behaviorist as he is displaying unacceptable behavior you also want to make sure that both dogs know that you are the boss of the house and not them and that what you say goes please understand that there is always that chance that even after your have him neutered and are working with him that you may have to keep them seperated forever because while atticus is neutered your other male is not and could still cause an issue pitties are a hard headed breed and you need to make sure that you make him work for everything he needs a set schedule boundaries and guidance if it comes down that you may need to rehome him contact a pit bull rescue Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Pit bull Jack Russell Terrier German Shepherd Dog Housebreaking Dog training Cat EastEnders Dog agility Domestic rabbit Babe Ruth Shaggy dog story United Kennel Club Pet skunk Baseball Ferret Dog show Terrier To Kill a Mockingbird Equine conformation Professional wrestling slang Staffordshire Bull Terrier Mixed martial arts Horse Social rule Guinea pig Gray Wolf German grammar Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Domestic violence Vulgar Latin AFI 100 Years series Aerial (dance move) Obedience training Hamster Dog breed 2000 Australian Grand Prix Martial art Humphrey Bogart Anger management New York Giants Poker jargon Skye Terrier Nintendogs Shetland Sheepdog Kodocha Tai Chi Chuan Cockfight Gender-neutral language Schutzhund Keeshond Jennifer Lopez BDSM Extreme Programming Grunge music Jumpstart 3rd Grade Philosophy of language Tag Labrador Retriever Zoophilia Scientology beliefs and practices Expert system Working dog Rescue group RuneScape quests Bull Terrier Great Dane Fox hunting Breed-specific legislation Mad Money American Eskimo Dog Adoption Pok__mon Live!
