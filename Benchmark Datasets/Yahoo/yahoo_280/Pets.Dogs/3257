i'm and i need a friendly dog i'm years old and i'm pretty responsible and have lotts of extra time for a dog on week days school days and ecspecially during weekends i really want a small dog and pretty cheap i'd say at least around or in cost range and i need a dog puppy that will stay small all its life cause i travel every year to another state for vacation cause my dad doesn't live anywhere near my state and i wouldn't want to leave my lil baby behind and i'm an only child so i would like a good friend to play around with and give me something to do any suggestions on what kind of dog would be good for me best answer will be chosen d bichons are wonderful kids dogs but they appeal more to girls because of the white fluffy hair they are very feminine dogs if you would prefer a tougher looking dog try a small beagle bichons are really a little better for kids no shedding no yapping or biting and big enough to be sturdy yet small enough to be adorable beagles are wonderful little dogs too no biting a little shedding but not profuse easy to care for but beagles wander more and are harder to housebreak because they live by their nose Havanese Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Crate training Dog Dog training Maltese (dog) Housebreaking Beagle Pet skunk Doug Kender The Adventures of Pete & Pete Garfield Marilyn Monroe Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Joke The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Peanuts The Ashlee Simpson Show Shetland Sheepdog Theory of conduct Nintendogs Social rule L__wchen New Morning Invader Zim The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Charlie Brown The Den (television) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Labrador Retriever The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Snoopy Keeshond My Little Pony Hip hop collaborations Dog show Friends Characters in the Smurfs Kimi Finster AFI 100 Years series Rich Mullins EastEnders Recess (TV series) Breastfeeding Rubeus Hagrid Ren and Stimpy Kim Possible Hamster Basset Hound The Fairly OddParents Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Avenue Q Teacher's Pet (Disney) Boy Meets World Clown W.I.T.C.H.
