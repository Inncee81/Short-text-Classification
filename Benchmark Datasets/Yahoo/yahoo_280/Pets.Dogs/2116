red air alert will it affect my animals there are tons of fires in idaho recently and the smoke is making it so that idaho has a red alert for air quality and my dogs are acting strange can my dogs behavior be because of the air alert my dogs are laying under desks and stuff could this be because of the air quality if so how can i help them even if its not the air how can i help them breathe easier the air quality will affect them about the same as it does you only they'll be more sensitive to the smells if you have trouble breathing after time outside they will too you could try fashioning some sort of respirator mask for them i'm thinking a basket muzzle and a handkerchief but that would probably freak them out more than breathing the crud if you feel fine after going outside they are probably bothered by something else it sounds like they are more frightened than ill a lot of animals fear fire and a pervasive smell of burnt things could be freaking them out has anything else changed in their routine lately that could be making them anxious if it's just anxiety try ignoring their anxious behavior petting or consoling them will only make them believe that there is indeed something to be afraid of and get their minds off of it by doing tricks playing games etc eventually whatever it is that is freaking them out will go away or they'll get used to it and they'll be fine if you can't get them to play or take treats or if they start coughing or wheezing take them to the vet Dog Anxiety Asthma Obsessive-compulsive disorder Stuttering Cat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Guinea pig Sonic the Hedgehog Smoke-screen Dog training Garfield Asperger syndrome Rabies Pneumonia Carbon dioxide Spider-Man Shaggy dog story Charles Darwin's illness Nintendo Tai Chi Chuan Gaia Online Meditation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Star Wars Holiday Special Schizophrenia Drowning Diagon Alley Hydrogen sulfide The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychology Cannabis (drug) Theory of conduct Anorexia nervosa Blood (computer game) Gray Wolf Out-of-body experience Monster Rancher monsters Firefighter Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Darth Vader Characters of Naruto Dualism (philosophy of mind) Skunk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Scooby-Doo Decompression sickness Housebreaking Autism The Addams Family Air pollution The Smoking Room Rebreather Alexander Technique Grief Fancy rat Kim Possible Ty Cobb Milton H.
