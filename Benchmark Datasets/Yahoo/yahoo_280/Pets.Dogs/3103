our wk old puppy will not eat she is vomitting shaking and peeing alot we just brought her home from the shelteryesterday she played ate and urinated alot she drinks a lot of water too today just about she started to vomit and trembleshe will not eat but will play alittle she wants to lay down but mves around like she is not comfortable any idea why all puppies urinate a lot so don't worry about that be concerned about the vomitting though since she is so young as she could dehydrate quickly try to encourage the drinking of water to prevent that the fact that she does not get comfortable indicates she is in pain so since she has vomited she probably has a belly ache is there a chance she has eaten or drunk something she shouldn't have also if you have changed the kind of food she usually has it will affect her stomach it could also be the excitement and nerves at being in a new environment but since she is so young don't hesitate in giving your vet a call if she continues to vomit and particularly if she has diarrhea too as it could indicate a bigger problem and needs to be checked soon Stomach cancer Dehydration Prostate cancer Vomiting Fecal incontinence Charles Darwin's illness Dog training Guinea pig Hamster Urine Gastroparesis Rehydration Cancer Fancy rat Drowning Ebola Leptospirosis Breastfeeding Pneumonia Hyperthermia Chemotherapy Foodborne illness Cholera Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Sulfasalazine Binge eating disorder Marathon (sport) Food Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia The Shining (film) Water Botulism Sin City Adjustable gastric band Canine parvovirus Diabetes mellitus Ron and Fez Toilet Dog Hangover Pain Paracetamol Aspartame Kidney stone Polychlorinated biphenyl Theory of conduct Penis Toilet humour Alcoholism Chocolate Acupuncture Milton H.
