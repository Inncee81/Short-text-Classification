how do turn my very hyper month old puppy golden retriever lab mix into a house dog he's been an outside dog since i've had him his name is buddy and he really acts up when he doesn't get attention he is also the most crazy obnoxcious mess making get into everything little puppy i've ever known but i love him i'm moving into a trailor park that doesn't allow pets to stay outside while you're gone needless to say i'm scared to leave him alone with all the furniture and things he can tear bite and get into while i'm at work i can barely keep him under control when i'm there i can't imagine what he will do when he gets bored so i'm clueless on how to start disciplining please help get him a crate to stay in while you are at work he's going to whine and bark when you leave him in there but don't be a softie he'll get used to it it will protect your dog and your furniture exercise exercise exercise when you get home let him out of his crate and take him outside walk run and play let him burn out all that pent up energy obedience training be consistent and train at home or enroll him at petsmart for it's well worth the investment at months he should be able to hold it for or hours if you will be gone longer than this you will probably come home to a mess in the crate crate training will help immensely in house breaking as long as your crate is not too big and the puppy is not in it for longer than he can hold it he will not go in the crate they don't like to potty where they have to lay down i suggest getting a crate that has a divider your puppy is pretty small right now but a golden lab mix will get big good luck there are lots of articles in yahoo pets section about house training and crate training Housebreaking Dog training Obedience training Crate training Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Labrador Retriever Golden Retriever Skinny Puppy Nintendogs Dog German Shepherd Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Vegeta RuneScape quests Kodocha Garfield Fancy rat The Fairly OddParents The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Mixed-breed dog Beethoven (film) Theory of conduct Camp Lazlo The Ashlee Simpson Show Great Teacher Onizuka Animal Crossing Dog agility Hamster Havanese Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Keeshond Francis Bacon (painter) EastEnders Pitaten Sin City Guide dog Alaskan husky Australian Cattle Dog Maison Ikkoku Balto (film) Poker jargon Lady and the Tramp Piccolo Junior Saga One Tree Hill (TV series) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart Road Rovers Shetland Sheepdog Friends 101 Dalmatians: The Series Milton H.
