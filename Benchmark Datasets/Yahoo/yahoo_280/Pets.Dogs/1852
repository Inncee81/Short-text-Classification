what is the best puppy food for a small breed puppy when she is an adult she won't weigh more than pounds and she is on iams smart puppy small breed right now as that is what she was eating at the breeders but ive heard bad things about iams and good too just worndering if anyone had anything better nutro natural choice the reason i recomend this dog food is because they offer a wide variety of different types of dog foods for different types of dogs i e puppy small breed dogs large breed dogs and so on you can find nutro at any of you animal speciallty stores petco petsmart and other pet stores its the highest quality of dog food you can find at common pet stores so you dont have to special order it or go to speciallty stores to find it and even though its a little more expensive then you common dog foods it is much less expensive then the speciallty dog foods so its a realistic choice for most people who live in the real world now if you have unlimmited time and funds and truely want the best food for your dog then buying meat from a butcher and mixing it with the correct of grains is the absolute best route i know the and cut of meat that is best for large breed dogs but i dont know what it is for pomerinans or other small breed dogs your breeder will have this info for you if you want to go this route the nd best choice would be the designer dog foods that can be specialty ordered from your vet or other specaillty vendors the third best choice would be the nutro i described above good luck i hope i helped talk to you later p s i like canidae dog food the only problem i see with it is that they use fish meal in there food which requires them to use the persevative ethoxiquin which causes cancer in dogs and other health problems you can find a problem with all dogs foods though Dog Dobermann Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Puppy mill Mixed-breed dog Taboo food and drink Fancy rat Cat Dog food Docking Housebreaking Ferret Agriculture Gray Wolf Hamster German Shepherd Dog Dog breeding Pet store Dog breed Labrador Retriever Vegetarianism Domestication Discus (fish) Veganism Havanese American Pit Bull Terrier Korean cuisine Smooth Collie English Springer Spaniel Chicken Golden Retriever Pet skunk Apple Tofu Hot dog Domesticated turkey Alaskan husky Irish Wolfhound Great Dane Cuisine of Denmark Border Collie Socialization Roman eating and drinking Border Terrier Chocolate Obedience training Breed registry Dog training Chihuahua (dog) German cuisine Green Revolution Cheese Breakfast Working animal Rottweiler Vegetarianism and religion Healthy eating Australian Cattle Dog Potato Food storage Nuclear power Fish and chips Dachshund Dog show Dieting Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Food French cuisine Alaskan Malamute People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Cuisine of the Southern United States Unclean animals Canary Shetland Sheepdog Milk Insulin Whippet Cat food Atkins Nutritional Approach Gerald Durrell Rabbit Ramen The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Animal testing Raw food diet Bengali cuisine Watermelon Carnivore
