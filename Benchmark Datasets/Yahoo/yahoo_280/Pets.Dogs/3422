my dog has skinny short white things in his poop my chiuahuha puppy is about months old he just went to the bathroom he had an accident inside i noticed it was a very light tanish color had skinny short white things that looked like worms this is the first i've noticed it he uses the potty pads so i pick up his poop a lot so how serious is worms and what did he do to get worms thanks so much in advance your dog has fleas sounds like a tape worm segment walmart or other over the counter dewormers do not work for tapes you need to bring a fresh fecal sample into the vet to check for other worms and parasites they can give you medicine that will help get rid of the worms then you need to get either advantage or frontline to help kill the fleas tapeworm larvae is passed from the stools of infected animals the fleas eat the fecal matter and ingest the eggs then when your dog chews and eats a flea they ingest the flea and the larvae the larvae develop into adult tapeworms that attach themselves onto the dogs intestinal lining where they suck the nutrients from the dog overtime the dog will loose weight and can become ill if there is a large infestation from lack of nutrients your vet will give a dewormer that actually kills the adult tapeworms you will still see parts or whole tapeworms passed for a few days after the medicine is given this is because the medicine paralyzes the worm and it is passed with the feces but your dog will continue to get these until you do something to kill the fleas good luck but a trip to the vet is in order again the dewormers sold at walmart and petstores do not kill tapeworms the ones that say they do are highly ineffective Cestoda Ascariasis Coprophagia Flea Pet skunk Feces Schistosomiasis Echinococcosis Heartworm Trichinosis Baylisascaris Hymenolepiasis Animal Fecal incontinence Echinococcus granulosus Roundworm Dracunculiasis Acanthocephala Diarrhea Diseases of the honeybee Fancy rat Dog Guinea pig Taenia saginata Cat Hookworm Ulcerative colitis Pork tapeworm Earthworm Tsetse fly Tick Snake Crohn's disease Digenea Philip J.
