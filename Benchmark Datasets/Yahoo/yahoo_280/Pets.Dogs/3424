what to do with yorkie pup when school starts hes weeks old and barely potty trained we keep him in a crate at night feeding him at about am noon and pm and hes in his crate at night when school starts no one will be home from am until about pm what should we do with him during the day should he stay in the crate all day and how should we feed him considering no one will be around at his normal feeding time im also worried that during the day since no one can let him out he wont be potty trained properly should we litter box train him instead well you will do what you prefer cause some will say hrs is too long in a porter but i have always porter trained my dogs that way by leaving them in the porter or cage all day while we are at work because the pup could get seriously hurt by chewing on a wire or eating something and get choked plus you'd come home to a big mess all over the house wouldn't you and my dogs turned out fine and well behaved and potty trained at first they most likely will go potty in their cage or porter because they are too young to hold it that long but as they get a little older each week they will learn to hold it and will not go in the cage anymore you be sure to come right home after work everyday and the first thing you do is take your dog out of the porter and take it straight to the place were you want it to go potty take it to the same place everytime and always when ever its been locked up and you take it out you better take it right outside to potty cause they know when they get out its potty time and will go first thing also use a word for the command to go potty like potty and say good boy potty or girl this is how you potty train your dog anyway by doing it everyday at the same times too keeping your dog own a routine they get use to a routine so feed your dog at supper time and take it potty and at bed time put it in the crate and if it crys you just have to ignore it one day it will not cry anymore because it learns you will take it out when its time so in the morning time first thing when you get up take it out to potty you can feed it if you want too and take it potty before you leave about mins after eating a dog will potty so son't bring inside until you see the potty he done and before leaving put it back in porter and when you get home take it out first thing or who ever gets home first can take it outside to potty and it can stay out the rest of the time your home to watch it and play and stuff you might want to leave it a toy washable one when you go to work but trust me if you leave stuff in their it will get dirty and messy at first but you just clean it up and don't get mad at the puppy cause they have to learn to hold it plus they are too young to hold their bowls and stuff at this age but if you keep up the routine with your pup it will get better and one day you'll come home to no mess in their good luck Dog training Hamster Kodocha Housebreaking Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Crate training Magic (illusion) Domestic rabbit Guinea pig AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story Social rule Toilet humour Customs and etiquette of Japan The Fairly OddParents Ron and Fez Babe Ruth Professional wrestling match types The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie RuneScape quests Jon Secada The Sims Characters in the Smurfs Ferret 1957 World Series EastEnders Friends Poker jargon The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Alan Arnett McLeod Pitaten Japanese toilet SpongeBob SquarePants Our Gang Sin City About a Boy Dog Livestock Dog agility Jennifer Lopez One Tree Hill (TV series) Billboard Hot 100 The Adventures of Pete & Pete W.I.T.C.H.
