is it normal for my dog to rescue kids from the pool i have a german shepherd and even though he was not raised in a home with small children he absolutly adores them any time i take him out in public he cannot resist the urge to meet all of the kids around us he likes adults just fine but he goes crazy over children anyways my little cousin was hving a pool party at our house with three friends ages and and his baby sister that is years old my dog was in the backyard as he usually is when we are in the pool and for some reason he was paying extra speacial attention to the kids then they started playing and splashing around and one of the kids dunked underwater for about seconds my dog ran and jumped in the pool then hauled him out by the back of his pants at first we thought it was funny but the we realised how nervous and stressed out he was i put him in the house but he continued to watch through the windows what can i do to show him that everything is okay i want to be able to have him outside with us when the children are swimming but i don't want him to think that they are in danger it is nice to have him watching over when they are playing i would hate to have him stuck inside the whole time lol what your dog is doing is instinct he will continue to do this if you see him getting nervos you have to tell him to relax he may still try to rescue the kids but that's something i wouldn't want to break him of at all Swimming pool Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Diving Sento Swimming Beavis and Butt-head Doug The Brady Bunch Codename: Kids Next Door The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius The Life and Times of Juniper Lee About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Friends Baby Blues Care Bears Poker jargon Neighbours The Fairly OddParents Characters of Lost German Shepherd Dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Backstroke The Angry Beavers Reservoir Dogs Dog Cartoon Network Dog agility Avenue Q Bart the Daredevil The Death Gate Cycle Treehouse of Horror V Cranford, New Jersey Kim Possible What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
