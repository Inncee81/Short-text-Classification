i would like to hear from owners of west highland terrier i am considering getting a west highland terrier i live alone in a condo and would have to leave her him alone during the day i have started reading about this breed and they say that they sleep a lot and because they are independant dogs they are doing well if left on their own during the day i would certainly like to hear it directly from you guys who've been welcoming these dogs into your home thanks i have an month old westie right now and also grew up with one in my house as a kid my puppy sleeps all day my boyfriend does work from home but he hardly has to look after her during the day since she just gets up to eat and then goes right back to sleep usually i wake her up when i come in the door and then she is ready to play all night these dogs do well in smaller spaces and will be fine if you just take them for a walk when you get home from work the only thing i would advise is to keep the dog puppy confined to one room or area while you are gone because my puppy loves to chew she is a certified shoe bandit so you want to make sure you don't leave this breed on their own with anything you don't want chewed up they do get more relaxed as they age so this is really only a young dog issue other than that they are a wonderful breed that loves people and works well in a small living space Housebreaking West Highland White Terrier American Pit Bull Terrier Border Terrier Dog Dog training Fancy rat Nintendogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Crate training Miniature Fox Terrier Domestic rabbit Jack Russell Terrier Mixed-breed dog Avenue Q Shetland Sheepdog Basset Hound Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Tenterfield Terrier The Time Machine Terrier Cairn Terrier Kerry Blue Terrier One Tree Hill (TV series) Snoopy Hamster The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Toy Fox Terrier Pit bull Skye Terrier Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog show Capercaillie Humphrey Bogart Docking Breed registry The Shining (film) Yorkshire Terrier Ferret The Death Gate Cycle Time Out of Mind Toy dog Havanese Steven Wright Golden Retriever Dog breed Social rule Bull Terrier Whippet The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dobermann Fox hunting Maltese (dog) The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Scooby-Doo Dog breeding Portuguese Water Dog AFI 100 Years series Jayne Mansfield Crufts The Fairly OddParents Border Collie Sleeping Murder Socialization Labrador Retriever Sin City Customs and etiquette of Japan Breed standard Australian Silky Terrier Bryan Adams German Shepherd Dog Welsh Terrier American Kennel Club English Springer Spaniel Working dog Companion dog Livestock Guinea pig Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Obedience training Irish Wolfhound USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Italian Greyhound Beethoven (film) Staffordshire Bull Terrier Doctor Who (Enemy Within) John the Baptist Laika Boston Terrier McMansion Breed club Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Treehouse of Horror V
