how long did it take you to train your puppy i have a chihuahua terrier he does listen to me but he has a hard time understanding where to pee he pees on his pee pad but also on the carpet i dont get mad at him i just give him a firm no and bring him to his pee pad he pees outside too and he is on schedule to do so i dont crate train him cause he sleeps with my husband and i on the bed and he never wakes up until i wake up and i bring him straight outside so he can pee he started to learn sit he is weeks old how long is it going to take to train a puppy how long did it take you to train your puppy i crate train him when i am gone away from home i have read that it takes approx months before puppies can voluntarily control their toilet reflexes i have a wk old lab puppy who is doing well but still has accidents i find i have to watch her constantly and as soon as i see 'the squat' we take her out quickly as well as all the other usual times after dinner after sleep after play don't forget to go over the top with praise when they do do their toilet in the right place i've also read that teaching them to pee on a pee pad just encourages indoor toiletting i'm not an expert though this is just something i read crate training or watching for signs and taking them out a lot is the best sort of training we have taught our lab to 'sit' 'down' and 'back' for when we are putting her food down on the floor but she does have selective hearing i have noticed good luck months seems forever at the moment but hopefully it won't be much past that Dog training Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Mattress Ron and Fez Toilet Nintendogs Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Toilet humour Milton H.
