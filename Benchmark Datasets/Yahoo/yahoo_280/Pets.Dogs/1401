young yr old beagle he chews everything in sight is there a way to stop it also he howls a lot too and its so loud in the house that i get headaches i heard there was something in their throat that can be removed to stop the howling not sure i want to do this but has anyone else either had it done or know of something that can help to deter him from howling so much he has free range of the outside yard all day long we also have a lab at home with him i have a one year old beagle too in fact he will be a year old in days beagles need a lot of exercise and having free range of the yard all day long while you are gone is not exercise to a beagle beagles usually howl when they hear loud noises like ambulances and fire trucks and when they are bored and lonely take your beagle on long walks take him to a dog park and let him run and socialize with other dogs not just your labrador try getting your dog some interactive toys which would be mentally stimulating for him like a well stuffed kong toy or a buster cube keeping him occupied and mentally stimulated and well exercised should greatly help if not totally eliminate the problem with howling if he is howling he is trying to tell you something he is telling you to pay attention to him beagles need their people and need to be near their people beagles are pack animals and the minute you bring a beagle into your home he makes you part of his pack and being part of his pack means he wants and needs your attention they like to lay on you if you're watching tv they want and need you to play with them spend some good play time with him like a few minutes of tug of war playing fetch the ball or any other game the two of you can play together beagles are not labrador's and their needs are different and they can't be expected to act like any other dog would they are very smart dogs so you might want spend some time training him to do specific tasks like teaching him to shake hands speaking on command etc if you keep him socialized with other dogs well exercised by long walks or extended play times in a dog park mentally stimulated by interactive toys and spend some quality play training time with him the howling will probably stop he is chewing everything in sight because he is bored he is chewing things to get your attention even if it is only negative attention there is a saying that a tired beagle is a good beagle and a good beagle is a tired beagle it's the truth you'll notice a marked improvement if you'll try these things within a very short time remember he is still a puppy in many ways but he will settle down by the time he is don't expect him to act like your labrador expect him to act like a beagle there is a very good beagle forum on the web which i am a member of it is populated by people who are owned by beagles and i've received a lot of help and beagle information when i've needed it if you'd like it's address please email me and i'll be happy to give it to you if i can help with other beagle questions i'll be happy to if you email me good luck and enjoy your beagle Dog training Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Beagle USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Obedience training Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Charles Darwin's illness USS Wahoo (SS-238) Surveillance Labrador Retriever Nintendogs Scientology beliefs and practices Snoopy Mojave people Taikyoku shogi Baseball The Sims USS Uhlmann (DD-687) 1957 World Series The Inside Traumatic incident reduction Dog agility Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Procrastination Carl Barks Animal Crossing Babe Ruth USS Trigger (SS-237) Customs and etiquette of Japan Football (soccer) Poker jargon USS Whale (SS-239) Animal Liberation Front Animal testing The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex USS Chicago (CA-136) Publication of Darwin's theory Kodocha Tenshinhan Paintball Tai shogi Garfield Cognitive science The Shining (film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Combine (Half-Life 2) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sydney Riot of 1879 Natural Selection (computer game) Extreme Programming The Voyage of the Beagle RuneScape quests Strap-on dildo Bernard Williams USS Wallace L.
