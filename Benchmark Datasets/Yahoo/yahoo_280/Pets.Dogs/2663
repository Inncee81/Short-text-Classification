my wiener dog is pregnant help i have a ten month old wiener dog that is pergnant and i think she is in labor i have helped deliver many kittens but never puppies is there a big difference between the two what do i do dogs know what they need to do to give birth if she's in labor right now don't move her make sure she has a soft warm place don't put her near anything you don't want her to shred up though my best advice for you start making a whelping box so she'll have somewhere for the puppies to stay after they're born just monitor her to make sure she's not in distress of any sort also make sure she's eating the umbilical cord etc and cleaning off the puppies don't intrfere unless she ignores her babies then step in and help out get a kitchen scale and weight the puppies every day to make sure they're all gaining weight evenly i had puppy that wasn't wound up having to feed her replacement milk for a few days good luck Dog Childbirth Pregnancy Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron and Fez Guinea pig Premature birth Breech birth Obstetrics Fetus Dean Koontz Cat Fancy rat Chocolate Labrador Retriever Mattress 613 mitzvot Housebreaking Domestic rabbit Fecal incontinence Komondor Knife Socialization Milk Comanche Psoriasis Twin Kodocha Characters in the Smurfs Hot dog Crate training Cuisine of Denmark Singlish Humphrey Bogart Puppy mill Dog show Social rule Reservoir Dogs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Girly Elephant B-47 Stratojet Infant Dairy Atomic Kitten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Billboard Hot 100 Hamster Phoebe Buffay's songs Textile manufacturing Snoopy Paragliding Care Bears Heracles My Little Pony Clifford's Puppy Days RuneScape quests Toy Story Kitten Kitchen Neighbours Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Wind Richard Chase Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Umbilical cord Shaggy dog story Black Pete One Tree Hill (TV series) Scooby-Doo Tooth Mixed-breed dog Iditarod Plastic Game show User Friendly Vanilla Ninja Drill bit Ren and Stimpy Beethoven (film) Heinkel He 100 Chinese New Year Steven Wright Philip J.
