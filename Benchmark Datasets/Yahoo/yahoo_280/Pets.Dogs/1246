pomeranian and owners breeders looking at the pics here do you think this is a real pure akc pomeranian or a mix of i think yorkie http www hoobly com html if you click on the pics you can see them close up better no definitely not those puppies are mixed probably pomeranian and yorkshire terrier or silky terrier the adult shown is a purebred pom but not a quality one and who knows for certain if she's the actual mother or not she probably is as the puppies in the photo look black tan and sable which does lighten but the breeder is obviously not truthful if she's claiming the pups are purebred poms edit re color are you talking to me i know pomeranians can be black and tan too i'm not saying they're mixed because of color look at the picture of them without the adult the ears the coat etc it's obvious regardless of color i'm comparing the pups color pattern in the two different photos nothing more basically to tell if they're the same pups or not the color and pattern genes responsible are found in numerous breeds i'm no genetics whiz but i do understand it pretty well above average edit if me again color and pattern does matter if you are trying to determine if the puppies in picture are the same puppies in picture lol again the breeder isn't being truthful if she's claiming these puppies are purebred poms they're not soooo i wondered if she was even being truthful about the mother actually being the mother however since the puppies in picture and do match i would assume she is most likely the mother i don't know how to explain it any better you're totally misunderstanding me i know genetics but that's not what i'm doing see ay is sable and at is tan both alleles are found on the a locus the agouti series and are found in many breeds in fact even mice which i breed you know it would be interesting to see them as they age as far as i know the 'graying' gene is dominant it causes the black to silver blue color change yorkies and silkies are among a few or so breeds with the gene poms don't have it Dog Mixed-breed dog Cat coat genetics Dobermann Dog show German Shepherd Dog Guinea pig Keeshond Gene Border Collie American Pit Bull Terrier Toy dog Australian Silky Terrier American Kennel Club Great Dane Terrier Arabian horse Color Golden Retriever Jack Russell Terrier Gray Wolf Roan (color) Eye color Smooth Collie Dog breeding Border Terrier Airedale Terrier Rat Terrier American Cocker Spaniel Dog breed Genetics Puppy mill Tenterfield Terrier Dachshund Barbara McClintock Pekingese Species Staffordshire Bull Terrier Discus (fish) House Mouse Gray (horse) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tabby cat Australian Shepherd Mendelian inheritance Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Cairn Terrier Human skin color Boston Terrier Our Gang Miniature Fox Terrier Biology and sexual orientation Fancy rat Turkish Van Breed registry Black panther Obedience training Manx (cat) Nintendogs Tortoiseshell cat Whippet Pit bull Siamese (cat) Rottweiler Cheetah Liger Basset Hound Thoroughbred Human Korea Jindo Dog Color blindness Selective breeding Scooby-Doo Genetically modified organism Baldness Iris (anatomy) Homestar Runner Dog agility Breed standard Kerry Blue Terrier Incest Turkish Angora Meriones unguiculatus Color theory Genetic linkage
