i am trying to train my golden retriever to stay off our couch any tips we let him up there when he was a puppy and now we want to buy a new couch but i want him trained to stay off first before i buy a new one how old is he once they've learned it's ok to go on the couch it's very hard for them to un learn it however it can be done you have to be vigilant and don't let those big eyes get the best of you because they will pout every time he approaches the couch and look like he is about to jump up face your palm toward him and give a very sharp 'no' you will have to repeat this over and over now if he jumps on the couch remove him immediately put him on the floor on his side and hold him there tell him no hold him until there is a sigh that's when he will give up most important you have to be consistent don't ever let up i don't like to use treats for fear of ending up with a fat dog stick to the behavior change be the alpha dog this can take a while so be patient my girlfriend allowed my dog on her couch and i had to teach him and her it wasn't ok my dog changed his behavior though he still looks at the couch like he wants to get on it but restrains himself now Dog training Obedience training Dog Aerial (dance move) Dog agility Diving Little Britain Skateboarding trick Vegeta Milton H.
