is my lab puppy's weight normal hi again my month old labrador retriever puppy went to the vet the other day and she weighs pounds is this normal her brother from the same litter already weighs pounds but is healthy too why is my puppy smaller she wasn't the runt or anything did you raise this concern with your vet i'm sure that bone structures of each dog varies and she's a female so that might make a difference as well males tend to be the bigger animal most of the time call the vet and ask to talk with his technician if you are concerned hon Guinea pig Labrador Retriever Dog Mixed-breed dog Housebreaking Golden Retriever Fancy rat Dobermann Docking German Shepherd Dog Domestic rabbit Garfield Gray Wolf Puppy mill 101 Dalmatians: The Series English Springer Spaniel Ostrich Nintendogs Socialization Animal testing Brown Bear Radiation therapy Sick Puppy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breed registry Super Size Me Weight Hip dysplasia Body mass index Pet skunk Liger Pound sterling Puberty Tooth enamel Red Fox Greyhound Largest organism Clifford the Big Red Dog Veterinarian Dog breeding Sperm Whale Newfoundland (dog) Cat Mountain Gorilla Guide dog Prostate cancer Lion Dog breed Cairn Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Hamster Australian Silky Terrier House Mouse Thermoregulation Tiger Weighing scale Tuatara Elephant Leopard Dieting Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty First aid Mass Dialysis Blue Whale Insulin Atkins Nutritional Approach Knife Sea Otter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Clifford's Puppy Days SuperCroc Giraffe American Kennel Club Rabies Whippet Red Squirrel Australian Cattle Dog Smooth Collie Human height Baboon Basset Hound Iditarod Boxing Mountain bike Hormone replacement therapy (trans) TGV Animal euthanasia Apollo 15 Punisher Chocolate Puma Breastfeeding Havanese Hamburger Dog training Ferret Lady and the Tramp Golden Plates
