what kind of small dogs don't shed please post a reasonable answer i am thinking about getting a small dog so i would like to know some stuff about them thank you there really aren't any dog breeds that don't shed at all however if you are looking for a dog that doesn't shed due to allergy reasons there are a couple you might find for the price you want toy poodles bischon frise and maltese are a couple of your best bets these dog breeds can be pricey but if you find a breeder that has a dog that is of pet quality and not show or breeding quality the price decreases as long as you sign a waiver to them stating you will have the dog fixed so there is no unauthorized breeding this is merely to make sure that the breeder is not responsible for having a bad breeding stock and pass on recessive traits to their breeding line if you can't find a breeder that is willing to work with you going to a shelter or humane society more often than not there are unfortunately puppy mill breeders that have been relinquished of their licenses or give up their unsellable breeding stock at these places you will not only be able to save an animals life and make it better by giving it a home but be able to get a dog at a reasonable price i hope this helps or gives you a little more of an idea of what to look for good luck and happy hunting airedale terrier australian terrier basenji bichon frise boston terrier bouvier des flandres cairn terrier chinese crested havanese kerry blue terrier maltese miniature schnauzer norfolk terrier norwich terrier poodle all types schnauzer shih tzu soft coated wheaten terrier tibetan terrier welsh terrier west highland white terrier xoloitzcuintli yorkshire terrier heres a website with more breeds http www dogbreedinfo com allergy htm Toy dog Havanese Nintendogs Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Poodle hybrids West Highland White Terrier Mixed-breed dog Kerry Blue Terrier Jack Russell Terrier Yorkshire Terrier Border Terrier Airedale Terrier Cairn Terrier Cat Fox Terrier German Shepherd Dog Maltese (dog) Tenterfield Terrier Rat Terrier Bull Terrier Chinese Crested Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Coat (dog) Australian Silky Terrier Companion dog Miniature Schnauzer Welsh Terrier Staffordshire Bull Terrier Dog show L__wchen Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Boston Terrier Border Collie American Kennel Club Bichon Fris__ Dobermann Herding dog Hamster Australian Shepherd Golden Retriever Tibetan Terrier English Springer Spaniel Dog breeding Pit bull Dachshund Fox Terrier (Wire) Ferret Puppy mill Whippet Shetland Sheepdog Keeshond Skye Terrier Labrador Retriever Livestock Portuguese Water Dog Fox hunting Pet skunk Griffon Bruxellois Hunting Miniature Pinscher Toy Fox Terrier Pet store Shih Tzu Fancy rat Dog breed American Eskimo Dog Breed registry Australian Terrier Alaskan husky Australian Cattle Dog Siberian Husky Pomeranian (dog) Spaniel Korea Jindo Dog Docking Guinea pig Fault (dog) Rottweiler Cockapoo Great Dane Fox Terrier (Smooth) Pekingese Basenji Working animal Basset Hound Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Poker jargon Selective breeding Manx (cat) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Domestic goat
