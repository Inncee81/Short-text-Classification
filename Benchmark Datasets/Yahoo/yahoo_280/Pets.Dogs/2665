help my house we have two inside dogs that have done their business on our living room carpet we shampoo the carpet twice and it seems like the smell of urine is even stronger help what can i do to make it go away i have animals in the house cats dogs and highly reccommend enzyme cleaner this will take out both the stain and the smell i've used both nature's miracle and pee pee brands with success do not use amonia the only unfortunate thing for your current mess is that you used carpet shampoo first the chemicals in the shampoo will kill the enzymes that eat the pet mess try flushing the area with clear water and blotting several times and then apply an enzyme cleaner if the stain and mess is urine it's probably soaked into your carpet pad and will need throughly saturated with the cleaner you actually want it to dry slowly i cover messes with a plastic bag if that isn't totally effective i next rinse and blot again and dump a bunch of baking soda on the mess and let it sit for a few days then vaccuum if you're still getting smell from that check walmart or sam's club for a product called odoban it's a eucalyptus cleaner and i use it all over the house i usually dump a pretty good puddle of odoban on it and let it dry i've also followed it with pet odor febreeze also throughly saturated usually it doesn't take all this but i used this whole process on foam couch cushions my cat peed on and the smell came out and more importantly the cat didnt' go back to the spot proving the smell was really gone if you can't get the scent out they will often return to the same place i found my dogs all marked in a house we moved to where dogs had peed on the carpet before even though they are perfectly housebroken also sometimes in a newly built house dogs will go inside because they are confused as to where the family space is because it doesn't smell like people yet good luck Plastic Shampoo Upholstery Skunk Housebreaking Cat Fancy rat Toilet humour Carpet Japanese toilet Bong Flatulence Tofu Chair Vacuum cleaner Laundry detergent Menstrual cup Urine Mattress Urinal Mushroom hunting Polyethylene terephthalate Enzyme Cannabis cultivation AFI 100 Years series Poker jargon Sulfur Sento Natt__ Chocolate Obedience training Halitosis Western blot Tooth enamel American lobster Toilet Kim Possible EastEnders Olfaction Ron Weasley Kitchen Jute 1,4-dichlorobenzene Sodium hypochlorite Aromatherapy Ozone Natural gas Perfume Toothpaste Dairy Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Vitamin C Menstrual cycle Pet skunk Make money fast Trademark Shaggy dog story Brewery The Inside Guinea pig Aladdin (1992 film) Social rule Spotted Skunk Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Characters of Naruto Red Dwarf characters Baldrick HIV test Fire extinguisher Sin City Casting Kodocha Carbon dioxide Diabetes mellitus The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hydrogen peroxide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shoe Gram staining Haloalkane Thermal power station Strap-on dildo Friends Porosity Mid-levels Bread Fox hunting Dishwasher The Fairly OddParents Pitaten
