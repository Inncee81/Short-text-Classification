shetland sheepdog help im planing on getting a sheltie blue merle but i have heared that they are dogs that need much extercise im moving to an apartment soon but im willing to give it a long walk everyday and on weekends im planing to go back to my house outside the suburbs to let it run free is it possible to have a sheltie in an apartment with lots of exercise each day hi honey shelties are one of the top breeds of pups that are super intelligent i've read the answers people have posted here and yes they do tend to bark alot if not trained if you teach them to shush and go easy they learn to be quiet i presently have shelties ages yr x years year old the brother and sister i have age years one is a barker the other is quiet and only barks when she wants to play the brother is super intelligent and thinks he needs to herd all the others lol is is just adorable and i would take his barking any day of the week in an appt or a house we live in a house over any other breed they are so devoted to their owners and so beautiful you mention to let him her run free on the weekends since shelties will chase in an attempt to herd anything that moves letting a sheltie would not be wise unless it is in a totally fenced in area they have been know to be killed by being hit by cars by well intended owners to give them lots of freedom this is the most danagerous part of being a sheltie owner you must keep them in a fenced in yard and then they can run free as for your appartment i too have owned one in an appartment and when i went to work he would cry howl and yes some neighbors complained at first i went to each of them and introduced my shetlie to them they fell in love with the pup i never had any problems beause they are so friendly if raised properly they will never try out shy so give them lots of early socialization and your blue merle will be such a delight walk him her in the morning for no less than minutes actually jogging would be more like it lol walk him her again for around minutes in the evening so they have plenty to use up all that talent then roll the ball play fetch chase etc in your appt with your pup and he she will be more than content teach them plenty and they will give you years of comfort joy and so much love you will wonder how you ever lived without them many blessings patti mom to shelties indoor kitties teenagers Dog Gray Wolf Garfield Border Collie Australian Shepherd Obedience training Horse Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an RuneScape quests Alaskan husky Taikyoku shogi Shaggy dog story EastEnders Neighbours Keeshond Scooby-Doo Hamster Collie 101 Dalmatians: The Series Poker jargon Housebreaking Sheepdog trial Jon Secada New York Giants Ferret Carl Barks The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Golden Retriever Fancy rat Babe Ruth Tag Futurama (TV series - season 5) Charmed The Cure Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell Horse gait Anne Boleyn Avenue Q Satchel Paige National Football League Lore The Beach Boys Old English Sheepdog Wrigley Field Kodocha Columbine High School massacre Social rule Detroit Tigers Guinea pig Le Malade imaginaire Theodore Kaczynski Melanie Wilkes Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Pulp Fiction Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pure Pwnage Little Britain The Catcher in the Rye Days of our Lives Belgian Shepherd Dog Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Ren and Stimpy Munich massacre Damn Yankees Diwali Volleyball The Time Machine Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Country music Our Gang Yoko Ono Livestock The Isley Brothers Ayyavazhi mythology Smallville (Season 4) Rocko's Modern Life Hollyoaks Australian Cattle Dog Sydney Riot of 1879 Combine (Half-Life 2) John the Baptist Prisoner (TV series) Music radio Super Bowl XXXVI
