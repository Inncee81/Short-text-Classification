dog help please my dog started acting strangely today behavior wise when he is inside the run and i am out he has decided not to listen to me this is odd behavior because he would listen just yesterday he will behave well when we're both outside or both inside the pen and until this morning he would respond well with one out and one in as well ft away it wasn't simply ignoring i told him to sit and he began to go through playing motions hopping bowing etc i told him 'no' because it wasn't what i wanted him to do and repeated 'sit' more sternly i moved toward him when he continued to play and he took to his doghouse with tail between his legs i told him to come and petted him when he obeyed still outside the yard i then told him to 'sit' again and he began the behavior over again i had just been in the yard previous to this could he have seen us as still playing if so will his and my attitudes towards this incident change the way he'd responded to training i am simply asking because he had been responsive to this before my being outside the fence his being in and i would like to know if his not behaving in the yard may impact his not behaving out of the yard i went out and tried again he had been in his doghouse i called him to me and he came i petted him and praised him then backed up and asked him to sit he ran to his doghouse tail between legs and would not come out when i called again sorry for not giving all the info on the dog he is years old adopted from the pound did does seem very hand shy around men might have eyes flinch if i move too quickly but not enough to run away is walking running sitting except when i'm outside and he's in without problem so i would not suspect wounded paws i did go in the yard and not really spend much 'quality time' with him because both dogs were being kind of uppity bouncy not aggressive so i decided to try to train already knows sit but i was keeping him from getting rusty outside of the yard this didn't work there has been a raccoon or skunk stealing chickens eggs that kept him up for about three nights he sleeps during the night is mostly active during day but he did get sleep last night a lot happened yesterday most note worthy is that a dog ran down here he acted differently than he had in the past he's not dog agressive he began to bark ferociously standing up on the fence i caught the dog and told my own dog to get off of the fence as he climbs hops over very well he listened and calmed down a bit the dog i was holding was hyper not dominating and began jumping against me my dog riled back up and began barking i was handing the dog who was still bucking jumping against me over to my father when my dog climbed or jumped i wasn't watching the fence and rushed to us standing over the dog in a dominating pose i easily pulled my dog back and took him back in the yard this time chaining him up he pulled the chain taut and continued barking angrily at the dog and was pent up for a while after that though i did let him off the chain later once he'd calmed down he didn't appear to have any problems with sitting however as i also took him walking off lead if it matters and he heeled and sat in front of beside me whenever i stopped no problems it would seem to clear up i don't believe my dog has a vendetta against me but as i am training him myself without outside help and because i'm still mid teens i am worried about any failure that could occur for example were he to see that he could 'get away with it' with one on one side of the fence and one on the other i was curious if he would see fit to put it into practice outside or inside of the yard as well went outside again i first used bits of hot dog to get the dog to sit with me outside and him inside which i don't do often though and because he's very food driven after this i again asked him to sit he looked very bashful and i'm saying this as someone who's against the personification of dogs and sat down i hate to say this because again i don't agree with making dogs into people but it seemed like he'd known i'd gotten onto his act of running into the doghouse instead of sitting because after i made him do this he wandered off and sulked if that sounds 'believable' so the persons who cited moodswings i daresay are dead on to clear up i didn't yell at him or behave around him any differently than usual though given that he was doing something completely 'un sit' as opposed to what he knows is right sit he could have been scared because he knew he'd done something wrong but then as i am not a third party i could have unknowingly looked more threatening or raised my voice he is not acting especially unusual towards me definitely not behavior that would indicate he's frightened of me examining it thoroughly i now believe the cause of this was his finally having a restful night's sleep and wanting to play with me when i wanted him to sit which resulted in him being frightened he is now once more sitting laying down coming to for me under the same conditions i don't believe he's any worse for wear but i do think i'm going to let him wear himself out once it cools down first how old is the pup if he is around months to months i would say puberty and expect the unexpected if not take him for a check up if this continues things to keep in mind don't hold it against him once the incident is past just use it for future predications on his behaviour he has no moral code or hidden agenda he only understands safe and unsafe not right and wrong right now it is safe if you are far away he has found that doing his own thing is far more rewarding than doing what you want when you are far away i would take some positive training sessions with him put a yummy treats in your pocket go to him and give him a command ie sit when he sits praise and give him the treat then step out of his run and say sit when he sits give him praise and treat next move a bit further and repeat then do a little yard work or whatever and then out of the blue go toward him a little and say sit if he sits rush to him with treat in hand very excited about it if he stands make him sit to get the treat repeat as necessary and then only treat for the far away commands and then not so often take lots of time with this best of luck Sin City Poker jargon Ocean's Twelve Swingout Aerial (dance move)
