is weeks to young to get my dog spayed the place that i am taking her to get spayed said they like to spay dogs at months and next week she will be months the only problem is she is so tiny i am wondering if i should wait alittle longer to get her fixed or go ahead and do it at months thanks she can be spayed at this age it's mostly shelters that desex younger generally because of being able to desex before animals are adopted most vets in general practice would avoid desexing any animal of this age male or female it's better to wait until a dog is around months old ideally before she has her first season but if you don't quite make it it's not a huge issue and given that you describe your dog as 'tiny' i would certainly recommend that you wait until she is a little older there are a few reasons for this young animals especially if very small have a much harder time maintaining their body temperature under anaesthesia getting very cold will prolong their recovery from the anaesthetic at months they're able to tolerate the anaesthetic better because their bodies are more mature and more able to process the drugs used the uterus and ovaries are not so tiny so are easier to find and to work with i've spayed very small cats and dogs at around months old and even then you sometimes just about need a magnifying glass to see what you're doing hope that helps o Dog Socialization Cat Pet skunk Anesthesia Domestic rabbit Kitten Sexual reproduction Guinea pig Lethal injection Prostate cancer Abortion Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Sleep Heartworm Ferret Puberty Caesarean section Ovary Fancy rat Estrus cycle General anaesthetic Castration American Alligator Microchip implant (animal) Stomach cancer Hamster Tooth enamel Feral cat Drug addiction Manx (cat) Urinary incontinence Menstrual cup Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stuttering Ceramics Ketamine Shark Consciousness Female genital cutting Social rule Polycystic ovary syndrome Intersex surgery Sexual differentiation Diabetes mellitus Ovulation Anorexia nervosa Platypus Randomness Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Philosophy of language Pit bull Cold fusion Sheikh Abdullah Condom Swimming Dog training Testosterone Intersexuality Redundant array of independent disks Rabbit Lion Dialysis Marine aquarium CPU design Sauna Tiny Toon Adventures General anaesthesia Obstetrics Clinical depression Animal testing Circuit design Sex assignment Acne Knife Fertility awareness Female reproductive system (human) M16 (rifle) Controlled Substances Act Diazepam Tom Waits Carburetor Mandrake (plant) Pitaten Electrophysiology Jet engine Orgasm Spider Dobermann Stirling engine Sexual intercourse
