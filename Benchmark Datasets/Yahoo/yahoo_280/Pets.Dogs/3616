i am getting a german shepherd mixed with siberian husky the pup is months old any insight on german shepherds and will the extra mix with husky have an effect thanks and how big will it get roughly its a male and its adopted d i have a white german shepherd puppy of my friends have huskys and i met my puppies parents german shepherd's temperament when full breed and of good breeding practices is generally very affectionate loyal smart and laid back although they can be hyper as crap when they are little they can make wonderful family pets and can get along with cats well if they are introduced as a puppy they are usually eager to learn and the things you can teach them are endless as long as you use the right approach which is why this breed is used so often in the police fire and search and military forces they can get huge in fact my puppies father outweighed me by pounds and i'm years old her mother was about pounds lighter and quite a few inches shorter but she was an abnormally smaller dog huskys are generally more high strung and excited although i have met some perfectly well behaved adjusted ones they are beautiful dogs as well and with a lot of patience can become great family pets both breeds need a lot of exercising so prepare to spend time with your dog it will probably be stunningly cute especially as a puppy i wish i could see a picture it's ears will more than likely stand up like typical german shepherd dogs since huskys have that trait as well it will also probably have longer fur than common german shepherds but i think that only makes them more beautiful both breeds require lots of excercise as i mentioned before and lots of socialization as early in life as possible as long as they are up to date on their shots enrolling in petsmarts puppy class is a great place to start and let your puppy meet your family all different ages and races of people and different dogs as well the more the merrier this allows it to learn to distinguish between normal behavior and suspicious behavior this is very important if you wish you dog to be in any way protective it promotes intelligible guarding instead of a dog that fears any and everyone that knocks on your door or tries to shake your hand also both breeds require you to develop good grooming practices with your dog and there are several dog books out their that will teach you how to do this correctly since both breeds shed it is important to brush the dog at least once every few days but don't think this will be an overwhelming problem cat hair is a million times worse than these two breeds of dogs will ever be i suggest getting several books all of which i have sitting on my coffee table right now don't even wait until you have your puppy they will be handy now head to your local library or a bookstore if you feel like it and grab these please they are wonderful kathy santo's dog sense very good book and a surprisingly easy and interesting read for the love of the dog by patricia mcconnell why does my dog act this way by stanley coren the art of raising a puppy by the monks of new skete great insight to the german shepherd breed but do not follow all the guidelines of this book religiously as some are slightly outdated as most people don't want to have as dominating of a relationship with their pet lots of different possibilities in what it may look like white german shepherd http www hoflin com images image gif white german shepherd as a puppy http www polarbearpuppies com files puppy hug jpg traditional german shepherd dog http www cck com german index jpg german shepherd puppy http www best dog photos com images german shepherd puppy jpg typical husky http www hickerphoto com data media husky jpg mix http www dogbreedinfo com images mixalaskanhuskygsdmixchico jpg mix just looks like a wgs http skwigg tripod com sitebuildercontent sitebuilderpictures sam jpg mix http www rufflife com images dog gif Dobermann Dog training Siberian Husky Mixed-breed dog Shetland Sheepdog Alaskan husky Dog agility Labrador Retriever Horse Guinea pig Keeshond Smooth Collie Alaskan Malamute Domestic rabbit Nintendogs Havanese Belgian Shepherd Dog Gray Wolf Poodle Hamster EastEnders Species Elvis Presley Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Obedience training Fancy rat Korea Jindo Dog Theory of conduct Garfield HyperText Transfer Protocol Border Collie Microeconomics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Brian Griffin Social rule Azumanga Daioh Greyhound Tai Chi Chuan Stereoscopy Floppy disk Skye Terrier Friends Schutzhund Golden Retriever World Wide Web Iditarod Domestication The Ashlee Simpson Show Livestock Yorkshire Terrier Finnish Spitz The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Characters in the Smurfs Manx (cat) Equine conformation Milton H.
