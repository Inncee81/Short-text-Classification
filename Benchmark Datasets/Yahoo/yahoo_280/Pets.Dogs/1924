accidental dog bite i was wrestling my dog because he dug up a root of some plant and attempted to eat it and so i was grabbing onto him but he got free and ate the root then i noticed on my arm there was like a scratch i dunno wheather it might be his teeth which accidentally scrached my arm or my nails now it's kinda swollen the scratch is like mm thick and varies in deepness and the swollen bit around it is about a cm thick what do u think it is my dog or me ah the root he ate part of it and i managed to get the rest of the root later on the scratch bite made me bleed a little but the wound isn't very deep and it's a little reddish but not very red now it is defintely not a dog bite a dog bite will not leave a single scratch a dog bite will either leave a nasty bruise or puncture the skin a dog bite will not leave a scatch as for the nails that is probably what it is a dog scratch is really nothing to worry about a cat scratch on the other hand can be infected very easily if the skin around the dog scratch is red then it is infected you should go the the doctor if this happens if the skin isn't red just put some antibiotic cream on it and it will be fine Cat Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog Cellulitis Bruise Ulcer Drill bit Guinea pig Intravenous therapy Tooth enamel First aid Acne Livestock Vampire Pug Rabies Woodworking Wound Tarantula Stomach cancer Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Tick Kakapo Mango Eczema Oral sex Textile manufacturing Bubonic plague Bread Siegfried & Roy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Characters of Lost Allergy Diving Traumatic brain injury Kim Possible 2005 Iditarod Characters of Naruto Psoriasis Knife Doom enemies American Alligator Scabies Aloe Conspiracy (TNG episode) Chronic fatigue syndrome Anthrax Piccolo Junior Saga Elephant Manicure Dermatology Shaggy dog story Tattoo Hamster Nail (anatomy) Flea Hookworm Snake Spider Brewery Characters in the Smurfs Domestic rabbit The Legend of Zelda series enemies Potato Amateur wrestling Philip J.
