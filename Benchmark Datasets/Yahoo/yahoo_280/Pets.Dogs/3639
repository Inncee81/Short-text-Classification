looking for an ultra strong dog toy that also squeaks we adopted a yr old st bernard this spring from a shelter he has never really been played with etc and we have discovered he loves toys that squeak however he chews them up as fast as we can buy them i worry about him swallowing pieces from these we found one that said it was made from the same material as a firehose but he didn't seem to care for the material if we could find a ball toy that squeaks made of something very strong that would be great so i thought i would ask here as so many have pets too any that you can suggest for us to try we have petsmart and petco nearby if it is something they carry or i would order online and i don't even mind spending a little extra if it would just hold up he is so disappointed when he finally destroys it and it no longer squeaks i don't think it's possible to find a toy that squeaks that the strongest toy destroyer couldn't destroy i don't know if your saint falls into that category though my recommendation is bamboo this is a less well known brand that makes excellent pet products they have stuffed toys called combat a friend who has a dog that is very rough on his toys told me that these were excellent you also might want to check out katie's bumpers some of their toys are made out of fire hose and have squeakers good luck in response to yj do not use gorilla glue many dogs find this very attractive and have actually eaten the glue out of the container resulting in a very sick dog and an expensive vet visit there's something in that that dogs find attractive and that makes them sick and unable to digest it Hamster Garfield Dog Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga The Critic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kasparov versus The World Care Bears Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Plastic Kodocha Upholstery RuneScape quests Knots Landing The Smoking Room One Tree Hill (TV series) Fancy rat Friends 1957 World Series One Piece minor characters Mattress Spidey Super Stories Vegeta Mouse (computing) A Day in the Life Aladdin (1992 film) The Star Wars Holiday Special Pet skunk Wal-Mart Kim Possible EastEnders Working dog Futurama (TV series - season 5) Brian Griffin Ron Weasley Tooth enamel Bamboo Social rule Electrophysiology Guinea pig Ferret Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Pet The Amber Spyglass Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transformers: Cybertron Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Our Gang YuYu Hakusho Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an StarCraft: Uprising M16 (rifle) Taikyoku shogi Border Terrier Toy Story 2 Micronauts Infantilism Little Britain St. Elmo's Fire (film) The Fairly OddParents Invader Zim Code: Lyoko Maison Ikkoku Sin City Dog training Cat Grammatical aspect Time Out of Mind W.I.T.C.H.
