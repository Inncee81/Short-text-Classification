have trouble walking dog i have a year old pitbull and she loves walks but as soon as we leave the house she wont stop pulling me she goes to the pee at the same spot so she knows where to go and shes really strong she brokes a couple or collars and harnesses i have a choker chain but she does the same and i sounds like she choking but she doesnt care and she cuts herself on it she goes crazy when there are other dogs to i cant controll her cuz it really hurts my hand from all the pulling so if u have any suggestions that can help it would be great thanks maybe go to the stock shop and get those heavy duty harness's i had a lb pit bull so i know what your going through lol but we went there and got a pretty strong harness and when you walk her just make sure you let her know who's boss it takes time to work with them but if walking doesn't work maybe take her to the dog park and let her run around for her exercise or just any open area if she doesn't get along with other dogs good luck Dog training Atomic Kitten Humphrey Bogart Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories American Pit Bull Terrier Strap-on dildo Kodocha Professional wrestling holds Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Horse tack Dog Singlish Sonic the Hedgehog Bondage (BDSM) My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult Teen Girl Squad Pit bull Dog collar The Shining (film) Jon Secada Toilet humour Professional wrestling match types Pok__mon Live!
