i have a new puppy she's weeks old she's a lab beagal mix last night she started shaking is this normal the shaking was like she usually does after a bath and is cold and mad but it wasn't cold i had just woke her up from a bad dream i guess and was holding her to calm her down and she would not stop shaking i tried wrapping her up and petting her but it didn't stop until she went back to sleep is this normal what causes this yea it sounds like she was just scared to me if she continued doing it when she went to sleep that might be something different or if she is still doing it when she woke up again dogs can be scared pretty easy it all depends on the animal i don't think you have anything to worry about at this point but if it gets worse or is persistent take her to the vet Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Skinny Puppy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Housebreaking Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters in the Smurfs Hip hop collaborations EastEnders AFI 100 Years series Sin City Dog training The Fairly OddParents Insomnia Ranma __ characters Garfield Milton H.
