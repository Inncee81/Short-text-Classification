i have some questions about puppy vaccinations my puppy has recieved his first vaccination the in and coronavirus how long are you supposed to wait in between shots and how many sets should be given will suffice or is it better to be extra cautious and give them i almost completely agree with dane lover her advice to follow dr dodds protocol is great however if you ever attend a seminar from dr dodds you will interpret the protocol different the rabies vaxx is given at months of age because of legal issues only and not for the better health of your dog in most large and giant breed dogs the rabies vaccination should not be given at months of age i would not vex a great dane until year minimum unless forced to do so by the authorities if ever if there is one animal law that needs to be revisited it is rabies vaccination on such young puppies but it is the law of the land so you have to decide what you will do you can start the protocol of puppy shots as outlined by dr dodds you can also have a blood titer done to find out if the immune system has developed immunity to parvo distemper etc if your puppy has immunity to these diseases there is no reason at all to subject your puppy to more vaccinations instead of automatically vexing every year titer instead if immunity ever falters then re vaxx being cautious is to not over vaccinate that has the opposite affect that you are hoping for over vaccinating is thought to be the smoking gun behind thyroid disease and a host of other medical problems http www weimclubamerica org health update html here is a study from uc davis regarding hod a severe disease of bone growth that effects great danes and many other large to giant breed dogs in weimeraners hod is correlated to rabies vaccination at a young age while this study is for a specific breed type it should not be over looked for other breeds that also suffer from hod no one shold be vaccinating every year anymore those days are long over any vet or person still offering yearly vaccinations for the health of our pets should really go back to school or retire also bordettella kennel cough is the most worthless vaccination ever developed that is still given and even insisted on by boarding kennels Rabies Dog Cancer Pet skunk Ferret Pneumonia Asthma Common cold HIV vaccine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vaccine Tuberculosis Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Mixed-breed dog AIDS Great Dane Dobermann Malaria Autoimmune diseases MMR vaccine Docking Thimerosal Influenza Homeopathy Vaccination Dog training Animal testing Medicine Domain Name System Fox hunting Allergy Housebreaking Alzheimer's disease Andrew Wakefield Influenza pandemic Herpes simplex virus German Shepherd Dog Controversies in autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Epidemiology Cytomegalovirus Smallpox Vaccine controversy Genetically modified food Antiviral drug Autism epidemic Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Livestock Human papillomavirus Dog show Streptococcus pneumoniae Puppy mill Mumps Louis Pasteur Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Growth hormone treatment Duesberg hypothesis Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Quarantine Ethics Externality Measles Medical record Poliomyelitis Prostate cancer Cat Coronavirus Crohn's disease Psoriasis HIV test Medical analysis of circumcision Chagas disease Tobacco smoking World Wide Web Pasteur Institute Nintendogs Anthrax Infectious disease HyperText Transfer Protocol Contract Cannabis (drug) Hepatitis Tocopherol Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Microeconomics Kyoto Protocol Fancy rat Hearing impairment SAML The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Gray Wolf Colorectal cancer Guinea pig American Kennel Club
