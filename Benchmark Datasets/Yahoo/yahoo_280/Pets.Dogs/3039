am i ready to get a dog of my own i live at home with my parents and we have two dogs a collie lab cross dog and doberman staffie cross bitch both came from a local animal shelter and i love them like you wouldn't believe i turned on the st august and got access to some compensation money from when i was in an accident as a youth to the tune of about although i owe about to various places i was hoping to use some of them rest of the money to get a dog although it is more likely to be the fee for the pound than a breeder as i would rather re home a dog that needs it however i'm not sure if i'm ready for a dog on the one hand i am only and i am due to go to university in september so i'll be reasonably busy although university is actually only hours of lectures a week which is far less time than most dog owners spend in work and i will also be looking for accomodation and i know a dog will make that more difficult i am also aware that i will be committing a lot of my life to dog since they live a long time my parents aren t too keen either especially since my favourite dogs are newfoundlands which i fell in love with when i did some volunteer work at an animal pound obviously these dogs are large meaning a lot of money on food a lot of time on exercise and a lot of space taken up however at the moment i am living with my parents and i am not in any real rush to move out and this house has just over an acre of garden so on top of walks that s plenty of exercise for any dog so i m not sure i m in the right situation for a dog but on the other hand i have wanted one for many many years so i m sure i m not going to go off of the idea i have volunteered at farms and animal pounds so i know the effort that goes into taking care of dogs and living in a house with animals helps too i have the money to buy a few years health insurance from the off which will tide me over until i m in a situation where i m earning a decent wage and i have found that walking my parents dogs and just spending time with them does wonders for my mental health i have problems with depression and they always make me feel happier and because part of my condition as it were makes me quite paranoid about intruders and burglars and such like having a dog around makes me feel really safe both my dogs are great with other dogs so long as they re not little dogs when the boy one gets a bit growly and before getting a dog the most important factor would be that it got on with the other two do you guys think i m ready for a dog or would it be best to leave it for now all answers appreciated emma x you can't say bitch in the dog section are you kidding me it would be better to wait and see what its like for you when you start school wait to see how your finances work out and although you might not have too many hours devoted to lecture homework research etc takes up quite a bit of time Dog Social rule About a Boy Hamster Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Dobermann Philip J.
