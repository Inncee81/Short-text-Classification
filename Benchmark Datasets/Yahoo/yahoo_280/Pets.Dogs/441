dealing with the loss of a pet i had a month old puppy he was like a baby or little brother to me he was small because he was part shih tzu i also have to big german shepherds something went wrong days ago saturday and they both attacked him and injured him extremely badly that whole day we were at the vet with him and the vet was giving us fals hope that he was okay we were getting ready to take him home and bring him back in the morning when blood leaked from his stool we went to an emergency pet hospital and she told us there was bad internal injuries and the only way to solve it was surgery and she still couldn't guarantee he would be alright it was around we definitely couldn't afford it so we had to put him to sleep me and my mom cried and cried and cried i can't sleep my eyes are swollen i have terrible headaches flashbacks i'm sore and depressed please help me by the way he was my dog i took care of him and everything how am i supposed to cope with this the german shepherds have absolutely no history of being aggressive they are family dogs we can't get rid of them so we bought them shock collars and are now training them i know it sounds brutal but in the position we are in now nothing else will work more effectively children aren't allowed in the backyard without them being kennelled up we're trying our hardest oh darling i'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your baby i've had to make this very difficult decision several times and it's never easy i wish there was some magical thing i could say to take away all the pain you feel now but alas it is just something you will have to go through points find a new vet sounds like yours may not be the one for you if you can't trust what he tells you if you get another dog maybe you want to think about its size relative to your shepards if you do decide to get a small dog again always supervise the dogs when they're together and get some training education about dog psychology so you can learn to see problem situations and do something before they become a problem sometimes the most loving thing you can do for your beloved pet is to let them go there are times when extraordinary measures to save the animal's life are simply selfishness on your part and would prolong your baby's suffering it sounds like you made a very brave unselfish loving decision and your puppy would likely thank you for it if he could go to your shepards and pour your heart out to them also forgive them for their part in this love them with all your heart Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Traumatic brain injury Pitaten Childbirth Ferret Housebreaking Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Characters in the Smurfs EastEnders Days of our Lives German Shepherd Dog Jon Secada W.I.T.C.H.
