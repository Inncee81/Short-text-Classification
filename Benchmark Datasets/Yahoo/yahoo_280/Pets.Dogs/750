i got to thinking i know that is bad do dogs need all the shots when i was a kid growing up we had dogs that never went to a vet they never got rabies or heart worm or distemper and lived to be years old are we being taken by the vets and drug companies by things that are a hit and miss occurance should we ignore all the shots and take our dogs to the vet if they get sick years ago why is it we never heard if heart worm is this something new do dogs really need the boster shots every year or are we getting ripped off to stop all you people that want to tell me how bad i am i will tell you my dogs get their booster shots every year and rabies shots ever three years i treat my dog better than i did my kids when they were growing up no dogs do not need all vaccinations no they do not need yearly boosters and no heartworm distemper rabies are not new diseases back when i was growing up many kittens puppies died from distemper however many people didn't realize this is what it was since they didn't know waht distemper was and never took their pets to the vet in the 's parvo really did an upswing and became more more common and more more wide spread and more more deadly in the 's rabies cases started to rise and in some states almost became epidemic until the late 's 's heartworm was mainly an issue in southern states rarely heard of in other areas some of these things weren't heard of by a lot of people because no one took their pets to the vet if a pet became ill it simply died on it's own or was taken out ot the back and disposed of there are now tests to check for things there weren't years ago also it is well to remember that people travel a lot more now as do their pets so along with this travel comes the spread of diseases to other areas no most vets the drug companies aren't out to rip you off actually at least one of the major drug companies is at the forefront of testing and the new protocol recommendations since vacciantions various tests have come into play the incidences of parvo distemper has dropped dramaticly as has the cases of rabies however unfortunately since so many people are starting ot jump on the no vaccinations ever bandwagon these illnesses are starting ot be on the rise again with the new protocl for vacciantions from the aaha avma and all vet schools there is no need ot vaccinate yearly and it is not recommended nor are all vaccinations the only core vaccines needed by all dogs are distemper parvo canine hepatitis adenovirus and rabies these vaccinations only need to be given every years studies show that distemper parvo are actually good for life some dogs may need lepto parainfluenza lyme and kennel cough bordatella depending on if they are at high risk of exposure or not no dog should ever be given coronavirus giardia or adenovirus it is recommended that all vets in the us follow the following protocol weeks distemper parvo hepatitis adenovirus weeks repeat weeks repeat for rd and final in the series weeks or older rabies one year from date of last vaccination a booster and then no more for years puppies should not be vaccinated under weeks of age iti nterfers with natural immunity can supress the immune system can cause future problems with vaccinations and can leave a puppy suseptible to the very illnesses you are trying ot protect it from for more info check out dr jean dodds site dr ron schultz site also there is an excellant article on vaccinations in the november issue of the whole dog journal Pneumonia Dog Pet skunk Heartworm Vaccine HIV vaccine Ferret Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Thimerosal Tuberculosis AIDS Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma MMR vaccine Influenza H5N1 Malaria Controversies in autism Antiviral drug Herpes simplex virus Common cold Vaccination Dog training Gray Wolf Hepatitis B Autism epidemic Anthrax Ebola Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Asthma Cytomegalovirus Multiple sclerosis Mumps Vaccine controversy Spanish flu Foodborne illness Lung cancer Pasteur Institute Cat HIV Marburg virus Smallpox Paracetamol Socialization Hepatitis Sin City Duesberg hypothesis Allergy Adenoviridae Docking Measles Autism Lassa fever OPV AIDS hypothesis Chagas disease One Tree Hill (TV series) Prostate cancer Road Rovers Avian influenza Antiretroviral drug Island Fox Mathematical modelling in epidemiology Diabetes mellitus Garfield Lyme disease Progress of the SARS outbreak Human papillomavirus First aid Cervical cancer Psychosis Poliomyelitis Mixed-breed dog Epidemiology Shaggy dog story Billboard Hot 100 German Shepherd Dog Tattoo Items in the Metroid series Extreme Programming Infectious mononucleosis DDT Influenza pandemic Alzheimer's disease Microchip implant (animal) Colorectal cancer Mesothelioma Hearing impairment Group A streptococcal infection The Ashlee Simpson Show HIV test Equine conformation Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hypoglycemia
