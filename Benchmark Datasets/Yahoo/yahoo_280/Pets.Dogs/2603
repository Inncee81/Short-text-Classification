why do dogs hate cats dogs and cats use body signals to talk both use the same signals but with different meanings so let's say when a dog sees a cat swooshing his tail in a bog swinging motion and bounces over to say hello expecting a happy greeting what happens he gets scratched and bitten why when a dog wags his tail with a big swinging motion it's a friendly signal when a cat wags his tail this way when he's angry this dog thinks the cat is a liar and will never trust another cat the good news dogs can learn to understand the cats they live with other cats however are still liars and enemies Cat Humphrey Bogart Dog Gray Wolf Lie Wag the Dog Swingout Truth Taikyoku shogi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Weather lore Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Animal communication Morphology (linguistics) The Strangerhood Tai shogi Garfield Cats (musical) Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Amber Spyglass Alaskan Malamute Maka dai dai shogi The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Leopard Phoebe Buffay's songs Care Bears Manx (cat) Dean Koontz Sonic Heroes Late Night with Conan O'Brien Dog training Timeline of alternative rock Piccolo Junior Saga Sesshomaru Rocko's Modern Life Ren and Stimpy Felix the Cat Spot the Dog The Wiggles Weebl and Bob The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Doug Harry Potter (character) InuYasha Creatures in Bionicle Sinfest An American Tail Equine conformation Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them Socialization Bollocks Obedience training The Smoking Room Toilet humour Professional wrestling attacks Trailer Park Boys Dobermann Life expectancy Paranoia Agent Races of Final Fantasy Happiness Krypto the Superdog Pitaten Catgirl God Emperor of Dune Whip Essential amino acid Buttocks Ranma __ characters Sonic the Hedgehog Mutts Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling Professional wrestling throws Azumanga Daioh Cheetah Paradox W.I.T.C.H.
