how can i make sure my puppies get a good home they were born june th we arent giving them away just yet they are eating regular food and everything well we put water in it and they seem to be doing fine but i was just wondering what can i do to be sure they are going to a good home i love all of them soooo much i wish i could keep them all lol and yes my dog is going to be fixed soon so please dont say anything about that its getting pretty old we are already planning on charging dollars because we hand fed them and it was really expensive considering she had puppies but we are sending a bad of purina puppy chow with each one of them also just to get them started what else can we do i'm having the same trouble with my kittens i would just ask questions ask ask ask questions to ask do you have a house apt or condo do you have a fenced in back yard do you have any small children have you owned dogs before do you currently have any dogs and remember this all depends on what kind of puppies they are if they are good apartment dogs then no worries if the people live in an apartment but i wouldn't worry too much just make sure they look like good people who will take care of your pup if the people live somewhere where they can't have animals and they say they are aloud honestly theres no way around that unless you are part of an animal shelter or animal rescue program you do not have the right to call the apt complex where they live and ask but if its an aggressive dog make sure you let them know not to have it around small children things like that if you don't know too much about the breed then google your dog get some info about her breed that will help a lot www dogbreedinfo com if you have anymore questions just email me when my fiance and i got our australian shepherd the lady said she wouldn't let him go to anyone living in an apartment well we knew in about a year we would be moving out of our apt into a house so we just lied we really liked him and we have seen numerous people around our complex with bigger dogs then this so i honestly wouldn't be too picky i would get them into the vet for their first shots and everything i wouldn't of purchased my pup if he hadn't if they look like they are good people loves dogs and show that they really like the animal let it go good luck Golden Retriever Dog training Hamster 101 Dalmatians: The Series Livestock Theory of conduct Ralston Purina Company Gray Wolf Kodocha Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Socialization Pet skunk Garfield Cat Fancy rat Humphrey Bogart Social rule Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests German Shepherd Dog Housebreaking The nature of God in Western theology Reservoir Dogs Sin City Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret Puppy mill Scooby-Doo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pok__mon Live!
