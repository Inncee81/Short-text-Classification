my dog passed on after years of unconditional love my question is that when i went to work i told the staff my dog had passed there are many dog lovers in my office one of the staff lost a dog a few weeks ago and took some days off we all simpathised with her now my dog is gone and all they can talk about is there new pets i have asked if they could keep there comments to there self however they have not i cannot simply get another dog i just cannot make that move has anyone been in this situation at work and how did you deal with it thank you first so very sorry about your pup's passing we've gone through this a couple of times over the years and it's never an easy thing i know sometimes other people making comments about their animals cuts deep it hurts to know they have something you don't have any more asking them to stop talking about their pets isn't the answer though it's a lot like when we lose a human loved one be it through death or things like a falling out of a friendship a divorce any kind of deep loss our emotions are so raw that we pick up on anything other people say related to our loss and take it personally when my father died years ago it seemed like everywhere i went or every place i looked even on tv commercials there they were fathers and daughters my heart ripped out every time fact was i couldn't stop that from coming or other people from living their lives they weren't really being intentionally thoughtless they were savoring and enjoying what they had chances are good that when you first got that dog you loved so much someone somewhere saw you enjoying that pup and was cold inside because they'd had a loss what i'm getting at is that you really have to lean into the grief for it to work itself out when you see or hear anything that upsets you try not to lash out at others that's really a defense mechanism against the hurt healthier to duck into the bathroom and have a cry and try to remember everything about that dog that made you smile when our last one passed from cancer i cried myself to sleep for a week and then made a memory book just for me pictures of him comments about his favorite things and about his personality when i was done i read it over and over i still miss him but the piercing pain eventually lessened be gentle with yourself and others and remember the things about your dog that made you smile i think it's the only way to get through it Theory of conduct Pitaten Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Grief Friends The Shining (film) Richard Rahl Ron Weasley Time Out of Mind Piccolo Junior Saga The Inside Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Garfield Neighbours Happiness The Ashlee Simpson Show Eddie Guerrero Cliff Richard Dead Like Me The Death Gate Cycle The Smoking Room Reincarnation Cindy Sheehan Have I Got News For You Sant Thakar Singh Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist YuYu Hakusho Plame affair Care Bears Good Times Le Malade imaginaire Hamster Human sexual behavior The Subtle Knife The Lovely Bones Mojave people The Contender (television series) Sin City Nicomachean Ethics RuneScape quests Ferret Paul Is Dead House of M Billboard Hot 100 Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Jennifer Lopez Blonde on Blonde Babe Ruth Maison Ikkoku Coyote Fight Club Zhao Yun One Piece minor characters Hip hop rivalries Random Harvest Pok__mon Live!
