how could i stop my two dogs from fighting and peeing and how old is too old when it comes to getting fixed ok to break it down a bit my older dog sam well he's become very grumpy as he's gotten older him and my younger dog bentley can't even be in the same room together without growling at one another sam usually starts it but bentley instigates it a bit anyway it's worse if my mom and i are in the room sam is definitely a ladies dog and bentley well it doesn't seem to matter how much we walk him he still pees randomly around the house it's like he saves pee for when he comes inside he's been known to pee almost as soon as he comes in we've thought about getting them fixed but my mom's husband thinks they're too old to be fixed we guess that sam i probably at the very least years old and bentley is about anyway answers to any of my questions would be greatly appreciated thanks bentley isn't peeing per say he's marking his territory he knows that sam is older and he's making his stance for becoming the dog when sam goes fixing them both will help a lot as it will break their dominance habits Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Dog training Theory of conduct Cat EastEnders 24 Hours of Le Mans Kyle Broflovski Franklin (television series) Piccolo Junior Saga The Strangerhood Kim Possible Dog The Inside Charmed Cindy Sheehan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pok__mon Live!
