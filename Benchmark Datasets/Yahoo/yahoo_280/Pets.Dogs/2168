when will my pups get to come home i have a boy and girl dog that are months old we are taking them to get fixed in a few weeks they have never been away from us all night they dont do well around other dogs and they bark forever at people they have never seen basically they dont trust people easily im just wondering if i will get to bring them back home the same day or if they will have to stay over night we are using a place called animal works in tennessee they are a low cost spay and neuter no kill clinic i hope because of that they will need us to take them back the same day we have to take them in between and am most animal hospitals do their surgeries early in the day so the patients can go home that evening the only reason they would have stay overnight is if they experienced any complications during or after surgery they will most likely sleep the rest of that day and probably still be somewhat sleepy the day after surgery as well the veterinarian should send them home with pain medication and possibly antibiotics as well they'll both have to have their exercise and playing limited until they're fully healed since it's a low cost clinic they might not use stitches or staples to close the incision if they do you'll have to go back to days after the surgery to have the sutures removed at that point they'll both still have to have limited exercise for another week or so especially the female since a spay surgery is more involved than a neuter hope this helps Dog Cat Guinea pig Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Pet skunk Urinary incontinence Ferret Medicine Pneumonia Castration Traumatic brain injury Veterinarian Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin LASIK Atherosclerosis Feral cat Clinical depression Colorectal cancer Diabetic retinopathy Cornea transplant Suture First aid Adjustable gastric band Acne Animal testing History of intersex surgery Anorexia nervosa Obesity Crohn's disease Sterilization (surgical procedure) Dog training Female genital cutting Penis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Weight training Hypoglycemia Skin graft Migraine Surgery Sleep Narcolepsy Cryptorchidism Caesarean section Rabies Paget's disease of bone Intraocular lens Physician Childbirth Traditional Chinese medicine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy rat Housebreaking Ulcerative colitis Group A streptococcal infection Animal euthanasia Replacement joint Intersex surgery Chiropractic Sex reassignment surgery Medical prescription Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hip fracture Malignant melanoma Physical therapy Kodocha Lethal injection Paracetamol Socialization Hospital Diazepam Cholecystectomy Sigmund Freud Gastric bypass surgery Plastic surgery Soap opera 2005 Iditarod Transsexuality Folic acid Health insurance Gray Wolf Common cold Cystic fibrosis Sex assignment Intravenous therapy Person Syphilis Breast cancer Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pit bull
