how to stop puppy from biting i know this has been asked but nothing is working my month old puppy is biting every time she can reach your hand if i try to pet her she bites if i try to fix her leash outside on a walk she bites she has a ton of chew toys and rawhides and even a teething ring she does not respond to no sometimes it feels like all i'm doing is saying no over and over she thinks it's a game if i tap her nose she wants to bite it more i tried spraying her with water but she liked it i tried to shake a can with marbles in it but she wanted to play with it i know she's very young still i want to play with her but all she does it bite my hands and arms are literally covered with bites and scratches is this normal i mean will she grow out of this and i just need to wait thanks in adance sometimes you have to be very dramatic to make a pup notice that something's not going over well with you in the litter puppies play and bite each other all the time it's a time for them to practice bite inhibition controlling the strength of their bite how do they do this when a pup's been bitten too hard by a littermate it lets out the most bloodcurtling scream and runs away game over this usually makes the pup who made the bite shocked by the scream and then disappointed that the game has stopped if you watch a litter of pups growing up you'll always see this dynamic taking place mother dog doesn't interrupt the action either she knows that pups need to learn this lesson it is not wise for a pup to be learning to play with its teeth i don't know what breed she is but it really doesn't matter as an adult her teeth are going to be blunt and her jaw is going to be much stronger how many people are going to want to play and interact with her if she's learned to scratch and bite as her play style and she'll never know why unless you show her now how much you dislike this behaviour from now on when she bites or scratches teeth on skin or nails on skin yell ouch pull away your hands arms feet or whatever leave the room and shut the door say nothing else she doesn't speak english anyway do not hit her because she'll likely misinterpret this as more play this is going to continue the education she had in the litter that biting made play stop she must learn to inhibit her bite there's no getting around it all dogs need to learn this to interact happily with other living beings humans and dogs you have to try to convince her that humans are unbelievable wimps who can't tolerate so much as a tooth scraping on their skin or they recoil in pain also please don't play slappy hands games with her you're just confusing the hand with a toy and will encourage more biting use her toys as playthings if everyone in the house can agree on these rules and be consistant you will have a gentle mouthed dog in a short time please remember that she is indeed a little baby and has only been on the earth for short months gentle firm and constant training goes a long way you'll be amazed at how quickly she catches on Shaggy dog story Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
