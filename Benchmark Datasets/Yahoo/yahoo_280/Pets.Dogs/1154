help on getting my dog to bark well i've got a year old gsd and she is absolutely wonderful except for the fact that she doesnt bark a lot shes not dumb i mean she knows plenty of tricks and she does bark the only time she barks is at night when shes in her dog house and i think its to get my attention anyone know any tricks to get her to bark ive tried blowing in her face but that only gets her to run away from me and i tried holding a treat above her and forcing her to just stare at it but that doesnt work either are there any tricks to get her to bark that i havent tried like i said before she can bark but she never does when i need her too my point is to try to get her to bark when the doorbell rings or someone is at the door thanks for your help ive also shown her plenty of videos of barking dogs and i even made a compilation of barking noises on my ipod and played them to her still no result shes barked when my neighbors dog came over and played with her so i know she can bark its jus ti need some suggestions on how to make her so excited she will bark by doing some sort of action that's an interesting ahh problem that some of us would like to have personally i would think that the doorbell is enough signal that someone is at the door unless you have difficulty hearing and can use a little extra help with that i think the fastest route would be to get another dog to even stay with you for awhile one that does know to bark when someone comes to the door if it is a dog that is unaccustomed to your house it will take some time for the new dog to feel like it's his home and his to protect then your dog will learn from new dog they can learn a lot from each other assistance dogs are trained to signal their companions for a variety of things such as ringing phones door bells or smoke detectors as for barking you can reward her with love and hugs galore when she does bark so that she knows barking is something you want her to do then you can have a friend help you and ring the doorbell and reward her when she barks with understanding patience and huge loving rewards for a job well done she will get what it is you want her to do on the other hand a quiet dog is a joy too Dog training Hearing impairment Shaggy dog story Carl Barks Obedience training Social rule Housebreaking Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Brian Griffin Schutzhund The Shining (film) Kim Possible RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix Crate training Meat Loaf Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Care Bears The Apprentice 2 Joke Avenue Q Theory of conduct The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) 101 Dalmatians: The Series Power Rangers: SPD Trish Stratus Phreaking German Shepherd Dog John Stewart (comics) The Cure Dyslexia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Late Night with Conan O'Brien Keeshond The Fairly OddParents Police dog Sin City Dog agility Australian Shepherd Goodness and value theory Toilet humour Magic (illusion) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Working dog The Hobbit God Emperor of Dune InuYasha (character) Traumatic incident reduction The Jazz Singer Combine (Half-Life 2) Characters in the Smurfs The Contender (television series) Don Rosa Scrooge McDuck War of the Worlds (2005 film) Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Philip J.
