why is it that so many people think they have the right to chew others out for breeding i have been breeding health guarantee and returnable lab pups for years i am experienced all thought i have not had all the problems that others have my bitches are all on nd and rd litters and do most of the welping on their own yet when i do have a question that i would prefer someone who is a breeder themselves answer i have all these uneducated ppl telling me to spay and neuter my dogs where do these people come from by the way all you adopt dont breed people of my dogs are purebred rescues and yes they are spayed and neutered so before you go running your mouth about rescuing i have rescues pure bred and mutts all big dogs so please if you are one of these people please tell me where it is that you get off insulting others all the people that think i am so bad need to look at all the horible pet owners out there the dogs in shelters are not because of good pet owners they are because of bad pet owners and people that cant afford or dont have time to take care of their pets i understand that shelter employees and volunteers get burnt out but i want everyone to know that all my pups are micro chipped and i will take back any of my pups and give their money back to buyers i have dogs most of which are pups i take back from ppl that dont do enuff research before they bring a dog into their home so before you get mad at me for what i do get mad at those who dont do what they should gerty mac this is what i was talking about i am by no means mad and to each his own i just wanted to get at least one answer that might help me to see the other side of the road so before you go spouting off about what i should or shouldnt do check yourself cuz i know i could definately go without hearing from you again believer i have never put any of my dogs to sleep and microchipping prevents my dogs from being in shlters for longer than it takes me to drive there and pick them up also i only have litters a year and my females only breed every other year i have two children myself and it was rough so i would never wish or force that on another but i also live in a high hunting community in northern minnesota so most of my dogs go to this community and almost everyone i sell to has or of my pups and yes i take in a lot of the rescued dogs from the local shelter and if they can be trained and become promissing hunters companions i give them that chance and sell them for only what the spay or neuter cost is and shots also a pup doesnt leave my home until it is almost a year old so if you are looking for puppy love you wont get it here they aint puppies when they leave me they are educated adults i would love to pick a best answer but there isnt one i was looking for some perspective from both sides of the road and i noticed myself getting mad about some of the answers but after a few updates i realized i was defending myselfand that wasnt my intention it was to get some perspective i also noticed that a lot of rescue a dog pushers are not looking at what is best for people and their families they are looking into getting homes for the homeless i would never let a rescue dog be with my small children or in my home how do i know where he came from or what happened to him there or what may set him off to attack or any other problem that may occure so i say thank you to all of you that took the time to give me the perspective i was looking for i can now go about this answering and asking differently because people tend to be narrow minded and judgemental i agree with spaying and neutering mixed breeds unpapered purebreeds and dogs that are just going to be pets there are too many pets in the shelters no doubt but it's not the responsible breeders who have caused this problem it is it the puppy mills and owners who let their dogs breed just because they are too lazy or too cheap to have them fixed i breed too i am breeding a rare breed bulldog that i truely love and feel it's worth preserving i also own a chow that i rescued and is spayed and an elderly spayed pug i will never understand why people have to be rude on here some of us really want and need real answers just because you are an experienced responsible owner or breeder it doesn't make you an instant expert how does anyone learn if they don't ask questions please people let's try to respect each other just because we are safely at home hiding behind computer screens it doesn't make it right to be disrespectful no matter what our opinions are Mixed-breed dog Domestic rabbit Pet
