puppies playing rough together i have a month old pug puppy tonight i just adopted a month old dane mix at first they didn't seem terribly fond of each other and you could tell sibling rivalry was already sparking but they seem to have just started playing together both dogs running in circles looking at each other but never really touching my pug would show his teeth zoom in a circle come back and face her bark and then zoom and grab a toy is he being territorial or is he just playing rough my dane mix would zoom in a circle and bark none stop my pug was not wagging his tail but she was is this just how they get to know each other do you think they're just playing it's very startling because it they both almost seem to be showing aggression do you think this behavior will stop or do you think they will always play in a very loud and aggressive manor a pug and a dane wow what a size difference you have to keep in mind that different dog breeds can play in different manners and because their play modes are different one may misinterpret the other's play as aggression and respond in kind your dane may be wanting to play but the pug is responding in a resource guarding territorial manner which makes us think they're not communicating like they should be if it's play you should see the classic play stance somewhere in the interaction in the play stance the dog will get down in its elbows with its butt up in the air from your description it sounds like you've got two dogs that may not be speaking the same language you'll have to keep an eye on them and supervise their interaction give them both corrections if the play gets too rough or too loud correct any misbehavior immediately at this time in their life because as they get older and more set in their ways it will be harder to train them as they get older and your dane gets much larger you'll still have to supervise the play even if they become best buds often larger dogs don't comprehend how heavy they are and can inadvertantly harm smaller dogs it's not uncommon for pugs to end up with popped eyeballs because of the pressure put on them by larger dogs Dog Pug Housebreaking Mixed-breed dog Nintendogs Skateboarding trick Autism Gray Wolf Philosophy of language Fast bowling Obedience training Dobermann Shaggy dog story Socialization Horse Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
