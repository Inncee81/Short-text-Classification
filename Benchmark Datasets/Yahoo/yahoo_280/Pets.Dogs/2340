i have a wk old chihuahua weenie dog and he wont stop biting i know he is teething but how can i stop him from trying to bite my hand or other thing i dont want him to bite there is a thing called bite inhibition that dogs will naturally learn if they are in a pack at that age you will have to supplement for the littermates since they aren't around when he bites make a really loud yippp oooouch even if it doesn't hurt at all even if his teeth just touch your skin immediately turn your back to the pup and ignore him completely for a few minutes don't even look at him keep up with that consistently and it will only take a few times it really works well don't act angry when you come back just go back for more fun like a puppy would after the pain goes away Dog training Dog Breastfeeding Horse tack Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kim Possible First aid Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Housebreaking Gray Wolf Shark Kodocha Doom enemies Atomic Kitten Hansel und Gretel Nine Inch Nails Dualism (philosophy of mind) Philosophy of language Vegeta The Death Gate Cycle Obedience training Guinea pig Piccolo Junior Saga Ron and Fez Milton H.
