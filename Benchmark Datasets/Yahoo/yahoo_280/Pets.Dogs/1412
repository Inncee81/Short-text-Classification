spaying shelter or vet i have an month old maltese mix she's already had her first heat and i absolutely need to have her spayed but i was wondering is it safe to have her spayed for free at a local shelter or should i pay the and do it at her regular vet she is my baby and i am scared that something might happen at a shelter but it's so expensive to do at the vet please let me know of your experience btw i live in los angeles thanks wow for a spay i would call around get other prices that is way too high i only paid i have never had a spay done at the shelters so i can't give you advice on that one but i'd think they would have a licensed vet doing it Pet skunk Dog Cat Socialization Guinea pig Domestic rabbit The Joker's Wild Animal shelter Feral cat Sterilization (surgical procedure) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kitten James Herriot Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Australian Qualifications Framework MMORPG Autonomous building Fallout shelter Malta Punisher Wal-Mart Taxation in the United States Life insurance SCO v.
