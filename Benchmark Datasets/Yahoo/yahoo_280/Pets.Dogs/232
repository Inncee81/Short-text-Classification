i really need help dog scrapes so after training my dog went out of the car with out his leash on so he kinda ran away once he ran away i did this trick to make him go home which is running to my house but once i did this my dog went in front of me so i tripped on him now he has so many scrapes on his leg and one deep scrape also i am supposed to take a shower for him today but i wonder if i can use the shampoo on him what should i do help but please do not say vet because i am just a teen but still can't drive okay let's think about this carefully your dog's leg got scraped up what's the first thing you do when you get cuts or scrapes you wash it lol a bath won't hurt at all unless we're talking something that would require stitches just be very gentle around that area no hard rubbing applying triple antibiotic ointment to the scrapes will help heal them perfectly safe to use on your dog if there is a deep scrape use gauze pads over it and get some tape at the store that's self sticking it's right by the bandage tapes usually and meant for people with skin that's sensitive to bandage tape good luck your dog will be fine First aid kit Dog training Aloe Tattoo Psoriasis Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid Knife Sento Fecal incontinence Teen Girl Squad Hard disk Massage Skateboarding trick Dog Fancy rat Comanche Dobermann Chair Eczema Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Babe Ruth Swimming Professional wrestling match types Textile manufacturing terminology Reservoir Dogs Batting (cricket) 24 Hours of Le Mans Social rule Mojave people Textile manufacturing Violin Sin City Aerial (dance move) Tourniquet Shampoo Acne Upholstery Obedience training Guinea pig Escape from New York The Price Is Right Dialysis Land mine Drill bit Humphrey Bogart Vampire One-time pad Tarantula Leprosy Hamster Equine conformation Happy Tree Friends Scarification Customs and etiquette of Japan Embedded system Paragliding Trapping Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wart Dredge Sonic the Hedgehog Bleeding Computer forensics Shawn Michaels Diving Professional wrestling holds James Augustus Grant Strap-on dildo Hyperthermia Ice hockey Hazing Scabies Hydrotherapy Gilding Washroom Skin graft Floppy disk Trench warfare Theory of conduct Housebreaking Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Drag racing Greg Valentine Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Tire Collecting fossils Explosive material Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mattress Olduwan Manicure Diving suit Care Bears Gresham's law Sound recording
