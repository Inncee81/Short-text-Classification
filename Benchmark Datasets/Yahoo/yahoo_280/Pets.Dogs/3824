australian shepherds we are thinking about getting an australian shepherd what are they like are they good w other dogs are they happy outside aussies are great dogs they love the outdoors i had them for years and then found out one of the things i was allergic to was the dander their skin puts off i took allergy pills for as long as i had them when the last one died the cough stopped and i realized only then what had caused it i thought i just had severe allergies to everything if you have no allergies you are good to go and if you ever have one aussie you may never want a different breed i'd give anything to have another one but just don't dare beware if you get a pupy be aware of the fact that toooo much white on the dog might mean the dog is prone to be deaf or blind white markings on the feet face and around the neck large collar are acceptable and gorgeous my all time favorite were my blue merles with tan points and white markings if both parents were merle it's not a good cross deafness and blindness often result from that kind of breeding just think you should know all the ifs if you find a healthy one you will absolutely love it and forever be glad you got one best wishes to you Dog Cat Australian Shepherd Shetland Sheepdog Allergy Mixed-breed dog Hay fever Hearing impairment Smooth Collie Dobermann Havanese Milton H.
