what would you do with these dogs okay i voluteer for an org that helps shelter dogs recently we were on the front page of the newspaper and since then we have been getting all sorts of come pick up my stray calls in every case we have told the person we cannot do that call animal control well we got a call the other day from a woman who's friend have over dogs she's a backyard breeder and the friend is sick and needs help they wanted us to come and take half of them we are a small group and dont have the room for them so the head of the organ told her that would take pict and try to find a rescue that would take them we would also foster as many of them as we could in one condition she signs something saying that she cannot breed again she wants to keep dogs but we told her only if she gets them fixed if not we could not help her if she doesn't comply within day we will call spca and report her the shelter will just euthanize them all so that's not a good thing what do you think god bless you and your organization i hope that breeder signs that she will no longer breed again i think another front page advertisement is needed hopefully you will get many needed foster homes i am sure that your adoption coordinator has a list or emails of area rescue groups put out a plea for help to all of the area rescues even go across state line to area states can you tell me what state you are in if you are near me i could help you i could even foster i work with about rescue organizations and i am a rescuer myself i am sure if you were somewhat close to me i could assist you there are plenty of volunteers that do nothing but transport for rescued animals from state to state as well don't give up take some of these suggestions and use them the goal would be to save all of the dogs and it can be done with the right help there are also some really big organizations that can offer great advice and sometimes financial assistance one is best friends in utah you could also try calling the aspca for a list of organizations that you can rely on i have some other ideas for you you can email me Rescue group Golden Retriever Animal shelter Dog RuneScape quests People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 Kashmir earthquake Cat ASPCA German Shepherd Dog Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Plame affair Animal euthanasia Working dog Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Joke Kodocha Characters of Lost Firefighter Community emergency response team Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Drowning MoveOn Pretty Good Privacy Alcoholics Anonymous Dog agility Sin City Taxi Driver Domestic rabbit Infantilism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Critic Dog training Anarchism and society Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act American Red Cross Ron Weasley Social rule Rabbit Theory of conduct Schutzhund New York Giants Michael D.
