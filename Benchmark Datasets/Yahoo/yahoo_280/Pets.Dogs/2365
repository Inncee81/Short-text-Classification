month old german shephard who won't stop biting we have a little puppy dog who wont stop biting she doesn't chew furniture but she is always going to bite or chew our hands arms legs feet basically everything thats attached to us she is in the middle of loosing her baby teeth and thereofre i am aware that that may be the problem but as i say its only us she chew not anything else we have tried punishment praise ignoring her which is hard when she is biting every bit of your body ha but nothing seems to work and she isn't learning that she is not allowed to bite us i have narrowed it down to the fact that it happens more when she is excited or when we are playing with other dogs she is absolutly great no biting growling no signs of aggression at all its getting to the point that i am putting her in her cage as punishment all the time and its not fair on her but i cant have her biting us puppy playbitting is the means by which dogs develop bite inhibition and a soft mouth the more your puppy bites and receives appropriate feedback the safer her jaw will be in adulthood at this age she's learning her bite the puppy should learn that her bite can hurt long before she develops jaws strong enough to inflict injury the greater the pup 's opportunity to play bite with people and other dogs and other animals the better her inhibition will be as an adult good bite inhibitions means that should the dog snap and lung her teeth will seldom make skin contact and should the bite will cause little if any damage this is an easy one and it works i know from experience every time and i mean every time she bites you say with a loud voice ouch you then pick her up holding her away from you make it very uncomfortable for her with out any eye contact and place her in an area like a bath room play pen some where she can't get out close the door do this for about seconds and then let her out and go back to playing with praise what she'll think is hey what's gong on why did we stop playing we were having so much fun if you stay on this what she'll soon understand is man those human's sure are delicate much more then my fellow dog friends try this and let me know how it works if you stay with it you'll see as fast difference Equine conformation Dog Housebreaking Trapping Fancy rat Hamster Cat Domestic rabbit Tetrapod Guinea pig Shark Breastfeeding Diving Glossary of American football Crate training Skinny Puppy Hearing impairment Professional wrestling match types Tobacco smoking Unreal Strap-on dildo Tooth Puberty Elephant Glossary of partner dance terms Electrophysiology Spider Ron and Fez Doom enemies Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stuttering Fecal incontinence Snake Vegeta Kodocha Milton H.
