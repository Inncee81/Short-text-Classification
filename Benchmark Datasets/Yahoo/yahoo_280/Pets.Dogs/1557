my dog escaped while my mom was outside and bit a water meterman chased my dog and a block to beat him wi lucky went out of the house and attacked a water meterman i wasn't there but my mom told me that the guy wacked lucky with a long iron rod chased him half a block and then was senselessly beating on him with it my mom yelled tellin him to stop but he ignored her and continued his act by the time i came out i saw my dog lying on my neighbor's lawn lucky's face was drenched with blood he had a big open wound right above his right eye and was breathing hard i instantly went to inspect lucky to see how bad the injuries were all the while not realizing that i was ignoring the meterman standing behind me later when lucky was able to stand up and i took him to our porch away from the sun the meterman came to our front lawn and asked for water to wash his wound then he said he would call his supervisor on us i believe that if he could he would press charges on us i mean he had the hearted to beat my dog to near death i'd like to hear the water man's side of it because somewhere between his story and yours lies the truth you are liable for his wounds since your dog was not under control and he may be liable for your dog's wounds if his actions really were as you say but he will probably tell it differently without a video tape it's your word against his and you weren't there so honestly you don't know what happened is your dog up to date on his rabies vaccine if he is not then legally the water meter reader can demand that your dog be tested for rabies which involves euthanizing your dog and sending its head to a lab to have the brain analyzed you really should talk to a lawyer about this Episodes of Lost (Season 1) First aid The Adventures of Pete & Pete Dog training Captain Thunderbolt Joke Plame affair Pet skunk Game show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Reservoir Dogs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog One Piece minor characters Family Guy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Vegeta Escape from New York Tag Theory of conduct Muslim ibn Aqeel Poker jargon Charles Graner Piccolo Junior Saga Shen Gong Wu Sin City Humphrey Bogart The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Tupac Shakur Social rule Fred Phelps The Invisibles Volleyball Xiaolin Showdown Richard Chase Tennis John F.
