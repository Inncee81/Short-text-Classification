help my dog has a weird skin thing and im worried she's an year old english springer spaniel and she's never had anything seriously wrong with her but about years ago she started getting these bumps almost like zits i took her to the vet and the vet said they were just oil filled pores and as long as they didn't hurt her they were harmless ok fine then about a year ago she had a giant bump almost like a goose egg on the back of her neck much bigger than the zit things so again i called the vet to take her but before i got there it basically exploded open lots of blood so i took her to emergency they stitched her up and she was on her way then a few months ago i started noticing that those zit things were more like little scab things so i took her to the vet and they said she had dried skin to try medicated shampoo well i've done that and now the scabs are yellow they're pracitcally covering her body under her fur and when you pick it fur falls off with it i dont think it's coincidence what's wrong with my puppy my dog was just treated for what sounds like the same thing you are describing the vet diagnosed it as mites there are two types of mites demodex mites are easily seen with a skin scraping while the mites that cause sarcoptic mange are more difficult to see my dog had the type that did not show up on the scraping she was treated with a flea medication called revolution which also kills mites she was also given an antibiotic she was completely better a week after treatment started i would suggest seeing a different vet Guinea pig Fancy rat Mange Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Psoriasis Rosacea Dog training Ferret Wound Group A streptococcal infection Shaggy dog story Diseases of the honeybee Penis Skin Heartworm House dust mite Stomach cancer First aid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Leather Allergy Characters of Naruto Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rocky Mountain spotted fever Shampoo Intravenous therapy Stroke Traumatic brain injury Comanche Urinary incontinence Insulin Massage Tuberculosis Aloe Scarification Livestock Medicine Blood on the Tracks RuneScape quests Garfield Smallpox Canary Cro Metastasis Asthma Tofu Fox hunting Chronic fatigue syndrome Equine conformation Skinny Puppy EastEnders Bat Red Hot Chili Peppers Pain Piccolo Junior Saga Shark Radiation therapy Chinglish Happy Tree Friends Thermoregulation Diving suit Sexually-transmitted infection Gastroparesis Cancer Clothing The Inside Pet skunk Minor Harry Potter Beasts Traumatic incident reduction Dog show Dinosaur Veterinarian English Cocker Spaniel Lupus erythematosus Domestic rabbit Eczema Rabies Sperm Whale Otitis externa Dog agility Honeybee Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Dandruff Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diabetes mellitus Conker's Bad Fur Day Anxiety Biological pest control Hip fracture Wound healing phases Antibiotic
