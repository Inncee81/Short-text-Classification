territorial dogs i have two dogs and one cat my cat and one of my dog are not territorial to food because we raised them if we are near them when we feed them they do not growl or mind but a dog that we got when she was year old was not raised well does not come constantly picks up anything that's on the floor socks and growls bites and attacks anyone who is near her food when she is eating how do we get her to not be territorial about her food it depends on whether she guards her food against you or against the other dogs if it's against you usually the best thing to do is you hand feed her all of her meals measure her food into a second bowl and put her empty bowl on the floor in front of her keep the full bowl very close in to your body so she can't get anything from it and it is obviously yours give her the kibble a couple pieces at a time by placing it in her bowl this gets her to associate you being near and your hand going into her bowl with getting to eat if she's so bad that she guards the empty dish feed her directly out of your hand away from the dish and slowly get your hand closer to the dish until you can place the food there if she is so bad that she literally bites the hand that feeds her try tossing the food a few pieces at a time into the empty bowl and gradually get closer and closer until you can place it there this may take a long time don't expect to get there in just a few meals it could take weeks if she does really well you can dump the rest of the food into the bowl as a jackpot reward for making excellent progress you always want to end on a high note like that eventually she won't mind you being near her when she eats because she is so used to eating only when you are right there now for guarding against the other dogs that's a little more difficult because obviously you can't have the other dogs give her her food if you can live with feeding them separately or at opposite ends of the room then that's probably the best solution otherwise you might try hand feeding her while the other dogs are eating and if she growls or snaps at the other dogs she doesn't get any food you stop her with a good sharp no and make her do something like sit or lie down to get the next piece of food start out with the other dogs far away from her so she isn't too bothered and slowly get her closer and closer to them until she's okay where you want them all to eat Dog training Japanese tea ceremony Fast bowling Chopsticks Korean cuisine Customs and etiquette of Japan Hamster Volleyball Brown Bear Poker jargon RuneScape quests Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Textile manufacturing Kakapo Garfield Kitchen Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Obedience training The Amber Spyglass Taboo food and drink Milton H.
