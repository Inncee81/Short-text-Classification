i need help with my blue nose pitbull puppy i've recently gotten a week old puppy now i'm really afraid to bring the puppy out for the fact that i believe i heard the doctor tell me that he shouldn't be outside and that there is still more shots for him to take i've given his first one umm also another problem i have his i got floors of indoor stairs to run down before i get anywhere outside does that effect anythin how exactly is that supposed to work also infront my home isnt of best shape my city is having a hiffi fit with the garbage men and the government so it's pretty terrible out here in vancouver i need someone help or advice i have the pads and he's gotten it once or twice and i praised him like he was my lord just know i didnt have to get up and get the cleaner it's small floors of inside stairs and outside isnt the best of condition for his paws plus the park is a block away do u have an idea of how is should work or am i thinkin of it the wrong way cause i havent tried it out he can go out to potty but he shouldn't be out all the time like being housed outside and he shouldn't be with a lot of other dogs until his immunity builds up a pit bull is probably not the best dog for a third floor apt next time i would get a chihuahua or other small dog all dogs love to eat and dig in garbage so you will just have to leash him and keep him away from it and i thought they were banned in canada or maybe just the uk and aus Dog Skinny Puppy Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Cat The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Stairway Professional wrestling aerial techniques Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Garfield Characters from Arrested Development Characters in the Smurfs 2000 Australian Grand Prix RuneScape quests Ferret Fox hunting Fancy rat Crate training American Pit Bull Terrier Weebl and Bob The Ashlee Simpson Show Hamster Air-raid shelter Real Love (song) Piccolo Junior Saga Kitchen Epistemology Livestock Wario Pet skunk Elvis Presley The Apprentice 2 Lady and the Tramp Drawn Together The Brady Bunch Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mixed-breed dog Escape from New York Dobermann Chatsworth House 101 Dalmatians: The Series Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Nintendogs B-47 Stratojet Sin City Ren and Stimpy Avenue Q Socialization Finch (TTC) Mange Volleyball Pump It Up Nuclear weapon design Fair use Psychedelic music Sick Puppy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia Tobacco smoking Basset Hound Dilbert Philosophy of language Professional wrestling match types Brown Bear Dog agility Dog show Redbone Coonhound Singlish Jean Charles de Menezes American Black Bear Discordianism A Day in the Life German Shepherd Dog Jennifer Lopez Kylie Minogue Ben Johnson (athlete) Urinary incontinence Border Collie Italian Greyhound The Time Machine Toronto Subway and RT Great Sphinx of Giza Urbana, Illinois Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Scenes from a Memory Memorial Stadium, Clemson John F.
