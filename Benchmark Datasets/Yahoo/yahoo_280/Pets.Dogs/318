anyone have min pins i'm thinking about getting one in the future and i was wondering what yours act like i've read all about them online but i want some real life stories are they okay in the car do they like water i will most likely take mine kayaking how often do they bark are they good around kids and babies are they good with other pets tell me your story and for everyone else that is going to tell me not to get one because they bark or that little dogs are stupid go somewhere else because i don't care to hear that i do like big dogs but i'm going to be in an apartment for several years and i really want a dog and don't worry i'm allowed to have one where i am i have never owned one myself but several friends have over the years i have always found them to be very endearing dogs i am a big dog person the bigger the better but i have always said that if i was going to have a small dog that is what i would have i don't know about how they do with kids though all the ones i knew traveled fine one friend had hers while she was living on her boat as for barking if you are diligent about training they only bark to alert you frankly i am quite taken with them i found this that might be helpful http www canismajor com dog minpin html Carl Barks Humphrey Bogart Philip J.
