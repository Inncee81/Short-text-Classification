my puppy likes to bite things sometimes he is biting our feet if you try to stop him from biting he would run around the room playfully and then again he will try to bite again he would never listen to us he would continue to bite things especially my house slippers how would we stop him another thing is me and my husband are working so we cant concentrate on teaching him to pee or poo in the loo we always leave him inside the house so everytime we come home i have to clean the floor for his pee and tom wipe the floor for his poo how can we be able to teach him to go to the loo for this matter we work hours a day so everytime we're home we just want to have a rest please answer any vets or experts your puppy is teething this can last till the dog is months old when your puppy bites yoru feet firmly poke your puupy in the neck firm enough to get his attention btu don't hurt him if that doesn't work buy a gentle leader and when your puppy bites gently jerk the leash again firm but don't hurt the puppy when the puppy is chewing on something you don't want him to ignore him get a preferred chew toy and you play with it flip it around and get your pup to want what you have of course i recommend you consult a professional trainer Dog training Dog Housebreaking Ron and Fez Aerial (dance move) Hamster Fancy rat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Socialization Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rich Mullins Japanese toilet Milton H.
