why is it so difficult to adopt a dog through a rescue we are thinking about getting another dog we already have a wonderful boxer who is the baby of our family and knows it she is spoiled rotten at first we thought about going through a rescue so we applied to the boxer rescue and after a couple of attempts gave up because the interaction we had was not positive everytime we spoke to the representative she made me feel like i wasn't taking care of the dog i have now and doubted that we could handle another we own our own home there is someone home almost all day we are financially stable have a fenced yard our boxer is an inside dog i don't know what else they expect we just felt it was getting ridiculous so we think we will find a breeder and buy a puppy i know we are good doggy parents but i don't know why it's so hard to rescue a dog i needed to add that when questioned about why she doubted us she said i just can't give my dogs to anyone she couldn't give me a specific reason why she felt we weren't taking care of our dog other than she is a bit overweight i do dog rescue for breeds under lbs i know what you are saying our group is very thorough and keen on placing the right dog with the right person family many times it's a fine home but the particular dog they want isn't a good fit that always creates hurt feelings on their part in my travels i have met other rescue groups that are hard to deal with their restrictions are so tight that if you work you can't have a dog if the dog is left alone for more than hours you can't have a dog etc etc in our opinion rescue groups need to be sensible and cautious but they also need to place dogs often times rescue groups start out with the best intentions and hearts and end up getting and keeping too many dogs because they cant find a good home you hear about them on the news getting busted with too many dogs in deplorable conditions not all but quite a few do have you also been to you local shelter go in and talk to the staff and let them know what you are looking for Dog Theory of conduct Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Golden Retriever Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon Jon Secada Contract Kodocha Dog training Joke The Death Gate Cycle Sydney Riot of 1879 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Housebreaking Friends U.S. presidential election, 2008 The Apprentice 2 Shaggy dog story Polyamory Humphrey Bogart Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an American Pit Bull Terrier Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) RuneScape quests Pet skunk Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Pitaten The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Philosophical skepticism Strap-on dildo Mixed-breed dog Adoption Doug Internal ballistics Milton H.
