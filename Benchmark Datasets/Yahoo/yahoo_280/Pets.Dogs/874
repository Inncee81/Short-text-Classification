new puppy jealous older dog hi everybody i just brought home a new blue merle pomeranian puppy who is only two months old i currently have an year old lab named honey honey is okay around other dogs and that's about it we never considered buying a another dog until one day we found an abandoned yorkie in the back yard that we decided to keep unfortunately we found the yorkie too late and she died shortly after anyways honey was just fine and didn't seem to mind her after she died that's when we decided we'd buy a puppy the puppy is all about play play play and sometimes when he messes with honey too much she'll grunt or growel at him honey doesn't like him or hate him she just tolerates him i'm really disappointed because i thought everything would work out better i'm hoping this is just a phase for honey because she's not used to living with a puppy and when the puppy gets older she'll get used to him and everything will be okay what do you think and or suggest i should do just be patient honey will adjust but may adjust slowly puppies can be a little too much playful to an older dog always rem to let honey know she isnt be replaced and don't stop giving her attention and you might add a little more at this time for her reassure her everything is alright and let her adjust make sure honey has her same routine she is used to time will tell on this one Skinny Puppy Housebreaking Dog Shaggy dog story Dog training Shetland Sheepdog Characters in the Smurfs Futurama (TV series - season 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Billboard Hot 100 Major League Baseball television contracts Kodocha Vegeta Social rule Hip hop collaborations Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Clifford's Puppy Days Yorkshire Terrier Yoko Ono Bringing It All Back Home Viva La Bam Honey and Clover Marilyn Monroe Ranma __ characters Everwood Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) The Death Gate Cycle Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban EastEnders Border Collie Snoopy Ministry (band) Blonde on Blonde The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape quests One Tree Hill (TV series) Dead Like Me Tom Petty Reservoir Dogs Socialization Golden Retriever Steven Wright Code: Lyoko Australian Cattle Dog Detroit Tigers Insulin The Four Tops Nintendogs Piccolo Junior Saga Scooby-Doo Rabies 2000 Australian Grand Prix Labrador Retriever Honey Eddie Guerrero The Smoking Room Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Lisa the Vegetarian Fancy rat Tag The Star Wars Holiday Special Louis XV of France National Football League Journey (band) Roxette Maria al-Qibtiyya Livestock Coming of Age (TNG episode) Daria Philip J.
