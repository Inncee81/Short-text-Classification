pit bulls in ontario i think this ban is a bunch of dog sh t a few months ago when i searched pet finder for adoptable dogs in my area hamilton burlington ontario there were a ton of pits or pit crosses available for adoption now there are hardly any i have searched the internet for rescue agencies and haven't found much are there still places in ontario where you can get pit bulls or pit bull crosses are people breeding them illegally where can i get a pit bull or pit cross in my province i read that a pit cross is exempt from these laws now anyways http west petfinder com shelters on html 'if you did not own a pit bull when the law can into force someone else in the province is allowed to give you one existing legal pit bull but you can never have more than one ' so i can get a pit bull but i cant adopt one from a shelter it has to be a rescue or from a breeder and what exactly is a 'legal' pit bull does this mean i can only ever own one pit in my life time or one at a time this is so ridiculous i love pit bulls but as people have said i want my dog to get proper veterinary care and i dont want to risk an animals life my understanding is that show pits do not have to be neutered so show dogs may still be producing litters people tend to misunderstand the ontario ban you can own one 'dangerous dog' bs imho or however many you owned before the ban for the rest of your life so breeders can always have say ' ' because that's what they had before the cross is not exempt any dog who looks like it may be part pitbull or pitbull cross is counted and considered in the number you are allowed to own and they must be muzzled whenever in public from hamilton's webpage after the ban came into effect a person who did not own any pit bulls on august will be able to acquire one restricted pit bull a person who owned one or more pit bulls on august is able to acquire more restricted pit bulls provided they do not own more pit bulls than what he or she owned on august the giving and taking of a restricted pit bull must comply with dog owners liability act requirements http www myhamilton ca myhamilton cityandgovernment citydepartments planningecdev buildinglicenses animalcontrol dog owners liability act htm here's more info http search petfinder com search search cgi tmpl exact breed pit bull terrier animal dog here are some pits pit mixes in niagara falls and toronto good luck Pit bull American Pit Bull Terrier Pet skunk Cat Domestic rabbit German Shepherd Dog Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Working dog Ferret Docking Staffordshire Bull Terrier Mixed-breed dog Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Fox hunting 400-Series Highways Jack Russell Terrier Cross site scripting Motion picture rating system Hamilton, Ontario Corporation Dobermann Microchip implant (animal) Animal shelter Contract Convention on Psychotropic Substances Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Terrier Bullfighting Constitution of Ireland GO Transit Google Same-sex marriage Uniform Resource Locator Zoophilia United Kingdom corporation tax Dog breed Intellectual property Dog fighting Politics of Ontario Same-sex marriage in Canada Dog breeding Abortion Internet censorship in mainland China Toronto American Bulldog Drag racing Keeshond European Convention on Human Rights Breed standard Tax Tooth enamel The Amazing Race Puppy mill Gun politics World Wide Web British nationality law Whippet Havanese Tobacco smoking Partial-birth abortion Abortion in the United States Media in Canada Polygamy Insurance Burlington, Ontario Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Rescue group Cockfight Ontario Liberal Party Judicial review Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Child pornography Dog agility HTTP cookie Hamster Guinea pig Something Awful Forums Ontario Food and Drug Administration Patent Animal husbandry Dairy cattle Cattle Involuntary commitment History of British nationality law Federal assault weapons ban Housebreaking Animal testing Franco-Ontarian
