r they or are they not fighting my year old male maltese who seems to be fighting with my month old stray i think my male maltese is dominant but i am not entirely sure also i don't know if my month old male is challenging him for the alpha position i do think the malese are above my females my maltese keeps growling at him when he comes to close to his food and the puppy does back off he then growls when they r in the lounge when the puppy is next to him and sometimes does bite him but not hard no blood or anything the puppy is then also not screaming in pain he actually keeps playing and wagging his tail he is on his back in a submissive position but i really don't know anymore are they fighting or not is my maltese putting this stray in his place eventhough this stray is almost twice as big as him thanks size has nothing to do with anything when dogs are establishing the alpha dog i brought home a tiny puppy once who attacked my year old german shepherd the puppy was establishing his dominance and frankly the german shepherd couldn't have cared less about it i currently have dogs and they get along great of the time however i should tell you that food is something that i think needs to be kept seperate somehow my non alpha dog doesn't take any crap off my chow when it comes to food and the chow is undoubtably the alpha dog i think you need to keep the dogs somewhat apart when you feed them good luck Dog Dog training Gray Wolf Dobermann Humphrey Bogart Cat Mixed-breed dog Housebreaking Professional wrestling match types German Shepherd Dog Nintendogs Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Maltese (dog) Skinny Puppy Professional wrestling holds Shar Pei Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog show Labrador Retriever Clownfish Kodocha Reservoir Dogs Animal testing Basset Hound Docking Ralston Purina Company Rottweiler Blood (computer game) American lobster 101 Dalmatians: The Series Ron and Fez Dog agility Havanese History of Malta AFI 100 Years series Pittsburgh Steelers Notable lines in the Star Wars series Vegeta Crate training Craps AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes Shaggy dog story K' Socialization Chow Yun-Fat Korea Jindo Dog Scooby-Doo Guinea pig Fancy rat Belgian Shepherd Dog Nestl__ Love and Theft Spitz Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pack (canine) Mixed martial arts Schutzhund Clifford's Puppy Days Stephen Chow Beethoven (film) Tenshinhan Livestock Ranma __ characters Yorkshire Terrier Waking the Dragons Pok__mon Live!
