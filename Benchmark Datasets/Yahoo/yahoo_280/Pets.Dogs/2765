how do i get my chihuahua to stop barking at strangers visitors who come over i have a chihuahua and he's not very nice everytime we have visitors at my house he'll bark non stop and to strangers who walk by i'm not sure if i should buy a shock collar for him it seems kinda cruel to do are there any other ways options to make him stop barking my beagle does the same thing when people come to visit he barks and lunges at them we enrolled him in an obedience class at petsmart he listens a lot better now whenever people come over we put him in his harness and on the leash so we have more control over his actions he is always made sit in the same spot by the door where he can still see the people the visitors are not to even acknowledge his existence until he calms down if he still doesn't calm down our trainer told him to lay him on his side and hold him there until he stops struggling and barking if you only have the problem with barking then put him is his spot and tell your friend not to look at him till he stops barking if he is calm enough let them give him a treat he will learn that visitors are good and come running for treats my dog is getting way better with the people who he sees most he gets over the fact that they are strangers much quicker than he used to another thing you should do is socialize him if there is a petsmart or other store that will let you bring your dog take him there some day on the weekend and get him used to being around people it might take a little while but having people over won't be stressful anymore after some training hope this helps Dog training Obedience training Nintendogs Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Dog Carl Barks Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog agility The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe God Emperor of Dune Horse Futurama (TV series - season 5) Housebreaking Kodocha Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophy of language Reservoir Dogs Leash Crate training The Death Gate Cycle Le Malade imaginaire Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fight Club Schutzhund 1957 World Series Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist RuneScape quests Charles Darwin's education April Fool's Day The Butterfly Effect Pok__mon Live!
