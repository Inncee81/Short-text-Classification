what happens if a mother schnauzer breeds with her son i have two schnauzers a girl the mother and her son her son isn't neutered we had had them separated but one dog escaped some how and they got stuck it was a couple of minutes after i pulled them apart is she pregnant for sure is it okay to have the puppies or will they come out with promblems it wasn't on purpose and i didn't really pull them apart i just turned the male around so that he could not continue mating oh dear well i don't like to admit this but i had the same problem a few months ago i have two cockerspaniel mix pups brother and sister who 'got stuck' before anyone bitches she did have a spay appointment the next week we didn't know she was in heat the mother could indeed be pregnant and if so there could be an increased risk for genetic disease in the puppies i would definatly call the vet and make an appointment for her to be spayed make sure you tell them that she's been hooked up and she may be pregnant they'll do a pregnancy test and if nessissary abort the pregnancy it could cost a bit around but there are clinics and places the aspca and such that offer low cost vet care and surgery for the spay they only charged me about it costs around but mine was higher because i wanted pain medication for her if she had needed the abortion it would have been around a hundred dollars i really recommend that you call up your local vet or aspca for help i'm also including a link to spayusa which is a reference site for low cost spay and neuter clinics goodluck Dog Guinea pig Pregnancy Cat EastEnders Abortion Pet skunk Miscarriage Domestic rabbit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate Ferret Folic acid Obstetrics Knots Landing Marilyn Monroe Infertility Migraine Breastfeeding Socialization Housebreaking Friends Prostate cancer Iditarod In vitro fertilisation Great Dane Turner syndrome Days of our Lives Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Neighbours Abortion in the United States Pit bull Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Controversies in autism Roe v.
