does your dog do this i was just wondering if anyone else had a dog that does this and knows what it is anywho this is what my year old pomeranian does when he gets really excited he starts to have an asthma attack he wheezes uncontrollably for a minute or more after a while he's ok and continues what he was doing but sometimes the attacks last for five minutes i was wondering if anyone knew the cause what it's called and had a dog that does this thanks please no rude comments does it sound like a snorting honking or gasping noise what you probably witnessed is the condition in dogs known as reverse sneezing it actually has nothing to do with sneezing but is a spasm caused by irritation of the soft palate the soft palate is a soft fleshy tissue extension of the hard palate or roof of the mouth small dogs in particular can exhibit this behavior and certain breeds may be susceptible to it during the spasm the dog will usually turn his elbow outward and extend his neck while gasping inwards with a distinctive snorting sound gently massaging the throat area or pinching the dogs nostrils shut so he must breathe through his mouth will help shorten the episode sometimes taking the dog outside in the fresh air stops the spasm once the attack ceases all goes back to normal if your dog experiences this behavior fairly frequently and the episodes are severe a trip to the vet is in order to determine other possible causes which can include viral infections polyps excessive soft palate tissue and nasal mites however many cases of reverse sneezing appear to have no identifiable cause i have chihuahuas and they do it sometimes i know how scary it looks and sounds it scared me half to death before i knew what it was just keep and eye on him and like i said if he does it too often or if it's severe and lasts a long time have the vet check him out i hope this help have a great day Cephalic disorder Asthma Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Epilepsy Equine conformation Dog Sleep apnea Cancer Breastfeeding Cat Influenza Hypoglycemia Hay fever Tetrapod Cocaine Massage Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Group A streptococcal infection Diazepam Professional wrestling holds Myocardial infarction Hiccup Elephant Methamphetamine Hearing impairment Angina Place of articulation Vowel Vampire Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Decompression sickness Pneumonia Polish language Stop consonant Dog agility Narcotic Palatalization Fibromyalgia Insulin Chicken Addiction Milton H.
