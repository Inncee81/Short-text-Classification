a question about dogs being pack animals first i want to share this yesterday my aunt got her dog back he was lost since last month and was reunited because of the microchip so people tag your pets anyway i was wondering i have watched a lot of national geographic and discovery channel animal planet is under discovery episodes about wolves and sometimes about wild dogs and i never saw a pack member stray too far from the pack if so then why is it that a lot of dogs run away from their homes or packs in the us alone or whenever they have a chance just like what happened to my aunt are dogs really pack animals please tell me how it works yes they are pack animals the dogs are not really running away it is their nature to roam and explore their territory when they get out and take off they have no intention of not returning but end up getting lost or someone picks them up this is another reason why their daily walks are so important if we as pack leaders take the dogs on minimum half hour walks a day the dogs need to roam would certainly lessen and it establishes us as the pack leader Pack (canine) USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dog Housebreaking Cat Working dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lady and the Tramp Dog training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Animated television series Domestication Fox hunting Feral The Joker's Wild Guadalupe Mountains National Park Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ferret Teacher's Pet (Disney) Puma Futurama (TV series - season 5) John McDouall Stuart Rabies Microchip implant (animal) Balto (film) Pet skunk Mamoru Oshii Unreal Wolf's Rain Dairy Elephant The Brady Bunch Red Vs.
