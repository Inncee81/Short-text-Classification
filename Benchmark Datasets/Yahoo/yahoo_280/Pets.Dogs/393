during an inspection of your home to adopt a dog what do they look for i think i'm good but just in case thanks in advance vet tech i'd really like to ask them about your smoking policy whats your website i volunteer for a rescue and when i do the home visit i'm just looking for anything that stands out as weird i don't go through every room in the house although some people show me anyway if they say they have a fence i'll make sure it's secure and doesn't have big holes etc i bring a dog with me usually the dog they want to adopt and see how they react to the dog doing dog stuff my last foster dog came in their house and peed under their table right away another dog ran in and got on their furniture right away i just see how they react to that sort of thing if they get upset about the dog doing that kind of stuff that's a red flag for me i use the time to talk to the adopters about their pets how they feel about the new dog obviously if i walk in and they have dogs and trash from floor to ceiling they're out but i wouldn't worry too much about the homecheck if i were you like i said a big part of it is how you react to the dog and what you say Garfield Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kitchen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct The Brady Bunch RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Firefighter Dog training The Smoking Room "Weird Al" Yankovic Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Golden Retriever The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Fire fighting The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Social rule Buckingham Palace Late Night with Conan O'Brien Maison Ikkoku Invader Zim Pet skunk Ron Weasley The Critic RuneScape locations Sin City The Inside Toilet Taxi Driver Milton H.
