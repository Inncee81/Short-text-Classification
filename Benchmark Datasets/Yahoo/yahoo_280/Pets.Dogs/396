i can't effort toys help what i mean by that is i don't have much money for my dog toys what kind of toys do dogs really like and cheap i'm guessing you have a big dog i have the same problem i used to spend alot of money on toys i myself have a german shepherd and anytime i bring a toy into the house it is destroyed within the hour i suggest shelling out bucks for one good durable toy that you will never have to replace kong is one of my favorite brands and my dog loves it too dogs usually get bored with only one toy so you can give him old tennis baseballs waterbottles rags you can cut them into strips and braid them to make a pull toy or even old children's toys that you have inspected to make sure that they are safe an have no removabel parts that your dog can choke on i buy those little wiffle balls for and fill them up with plain yogurt then i freeze it overnight and give it to my dog to gnaw at he has a blast and it gives me hours of peace they are also reusable depending on how much your dog chews at it if you do have a big dog or a dog that simply loves to chew then these won't last very long however they are very inexpensive and easy to replace it doesn't take much to amuse them alot of people spend a fortune on stuffed animal toys and other things that won't last a day simply because they assume that you have to buy expensive dog toys from a pet store in order for your pet to have fun it is unnecessay and over time gets to be an expense please remember that dogs are a big responsibility and they do cost alot of money to maintain and keep happy they are like children in a sense you should always make sure that your dog gets plenty of food and takes trips to the vet for examinations times every year even more if it is a puppy it is always a good idea to have toys around otherwise it will end up costing you more money replacing other things that your dog has chewed up good luck with everything Fancy rat Dog training Garfield Hamster Dog Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Ferret Bulk vending Care Bears Game show Gross domestic product Toy FoxTrot Energy development Space Shuttle program The Fairly OddParents Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryonics The Price Is Right Shaggy dog story M16 (rifle) Gramophone record Microeconomics Guinea pig The Apprentice 2 Domestic rabbit Strap-on dildo Social rule The Star Wars Holiday Special Paintball Satchel Paige Toy Story Mattress Hot dog Animal Crossing Emergency preparedness Rugrats Pitaten My Parents are Aliens The Adventures of Pete & Pete Time Out of Mind Tenshinhan Table tennis Capital accumulation Toy Story 2 Pinball Calvin and Hobbes Unclean animals Homestar Runner Our Gang Autobot Matrix of Leadership Wheel of Fortune Socialization Sears Holdings Corporation Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Apprentice 3 German Shepherd Dog Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Eric Cartman Extreme Programming Docking Wal-Mart It's Walky!
