i need advice on how to housetrain a puppy anyone i have a month old puppy she is mildly paper trained i usually have her either in my room or in the back yard in my room i put some news papers on the floor and she has peed there sometimes mostly outside though the thing with the newspapers is she's starting to chew on them and when she's playing and running she moves them out of place so they won't serve their purpose anymore i'm thinking of getting rid of them altogether but i don't know how i'm suppposed to handle this if accidents happen in the house i have been praising her with treats everytime i see her peeing outside but as soon as i tell her 'good girl' while she's peeing she looks at me and appears to cut the pee short to come running to get her treat should i wait to praise until she's done will she get that it's because she peed outside i've read some tips on this but i need someone to explain this to me based on the info i give here please thanks hi this is the number one question dog owners always ask me how to housebreak their dogs you have to understand the basics what goes in must come out and you have to know when that is you have to put your pet on a schedule sit down and make a list of times your going to feed and water them make sure you give enough time for them to consumpe both an example would be when you get up in the morning take them out then bring them in and feed water leave it down for about minutes then take them out agian if their puppies your going to have to do this several times aday but do this atleast times aday and give a little water in between the feeding that's right you have to pick the water up too you don't have to leave water down all the time if their in a controlled eviroment like a house outside is different but once the food and wtaer is down for miutes pick both up write down the times your going to do this plus the times you take them out stick with it if they have anaccident in the house don t yell at them just writhe down the time and see if there's a trend of going that time of a several day period if there is adjust the schedule to make sure they go out at that time some dogs are very hard to housebreak but with a schedule atleast they will know when their going to be feed and taken out if your going out crate them and then when you return just continue on with the schedule if you have any other questions feel free to email me best wishes Housebreaking Dog training Crate training RuneScape quests Dog Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Tag Toilet humour Dog agility Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Customs and etiquette of Japan Domestic rabbit Ron and Fez Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Garfield Theory of conduct Kitchen Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Blonde on Blonde One Tree Hill (TV series) Sydney Riot of 1879 The Inside The Catcher in the Rye Pee Dee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
