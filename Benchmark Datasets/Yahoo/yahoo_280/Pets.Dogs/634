behavior problems can you help my white german shepherd lily is weeks old we never leave her home alone unless it's for a short shopping trip since i work in the mornings until four and don't work every day and my husband goes to work at five we spend a lot of time with her and have ever since we got her when she was weeks old i've gotten four different books the art of raising a puppy kathy santo's dog sense for the love of the dog and why does my dog act this way and we have put a lot of time and effort into training her but she still has a lot of problems first off i want to mention that she was breed well i have loads of information on her blood line and her parents were beautiful well mannered championship dogs i wanted to take them home with me when i met them lily is cute but that can hardly keep her out of trouble forever she constantly bites it's like she has no urge to do anything else in order to pet her or rub her tummy you have to keep her from biting you the whole time and it's left so many injuries on my husband and i we've tried everything from a soft mouth bite inhabition aproach yelping like a puppy everytime she bites and ignoring her when she continues closing her mouth shut and saying close your mouth no no bite looking her in the eyes while grabbing the scruff of her neck trying to use our finger to pinch her gums while she is biting to hiting her on her nose this is really bad though and we have been persistent when trying to teach her when we try the ignore method she won't even let us get away without biting us like five times more it's impossible to really get away and she tears our clothes she doesn't care one bit when we ignore her if we ever successfully do and the next time you see her she's ready to bite your hand off again and these are not tolerable bites when we yelp she hardly responds like maybe once she'll cock her head to the side but then continue to bite and she'll just get really excited and start biting more with a playful growl the only thing she responds to is getting hit on her nose or head when she bites and this is a technique that my husband and i do not approve of and do not wish to use with her but it's the only way we can get her to stop in some situations even then she'll come back to bite maybe five more times and when we say no in a deep growl and hit her she gets all mad and excited biting even more until she finally feels bad and leaves but later it's the same thing all over again i do not wish to use any painful techniques and i feel that hiting her makes everything about dominance and who's stronger this is not a relationship i want with my dog especially since her dad outweighed me by pounds who knows how big she'll get it's near impossible to hook her leash onto her collar when taking her for a walk because of her biting even though she wants to go outside she'll bite our hands and arms terribly and then the leash until you finally get her outside it's a struggle to do anything with her even when we play with her when she brings back the toy and we take it to throw again we have to put up with her biting us until we throw it again ignoring her and stopping play does nothing she'll just run back and start attacking you like nobody's business she screams like crazy when we put her in her crate and we were dumb enough to get a collapsable one that's soft so all night she screams and cries and bites the thing to wear it pops up and down and up and down when we put her in the crate for biting she doesn't understand at all and she screams like we're killing her i can't even describe it it's awful also she's not really a destructive dog as she doesn't tear up the house when we leave her alone but she does however rip apart paper in the trash can if we leave the bathroom door open while we're here she also has chewed the corner of one door frame and ripped a vertical molding type thing off of the wall in our bedroom no idea how we're going to fix that she also is less potty trained now than ever she will use the bathroom outside but she'll use the bathroom inside almost as quickly even though she has no problem scratching on our bedroom door while we're asleep to let us know she's bored she will not scratch on the front back doors to let us know she wants to go out sometimes she'll let out one small whine somewhere in the house and then that's it she'll never come up to you or really do anything as a sign we take her outside soooo often and it's consuming our life last night alone we took her outside at o'clock o'clock o'clock and then this morning and this is after we've had her for six weeks of course after all that she still pooped in the kitchen after we let her out into the rest of the house because she was chewing the molding at least she only pees poops in the office and the kitchen i would not be able to put up with it the two bedrooms i feel disgusted every time i come in our office even after all of my cleaning it up and lysoling the carpet should we buy training pads for her sorry for the long post i need all the help i can get also she is supposed to start petsmart's puppy school sometime soon if we drive the miles to sign her up yesterday my husband and i noticed a pampered poochies a few minutes from our house and it said that they offer training on their sign also their is a sign in our vets office from a lady that says she offers training i guess maybe she comes to your house my husband and i want lily to be a smart loyal dog that we can take anywhere and we were planning on enrolling her in every level of dog class that petsmart offered so that she could learn as much as possible should i call the other trainers has anyone else tried petsmart it's really far from our house so i was just wondering if you thought i should try something else first thanks everyone so much for reading all of this we tried the monk's book first and i had heard so much good stuff about it that i used it like a bible unfortunately she didn't respond to grabbing the scruff of her neck and later i was told that these techniques were out dated and not the best thing for my puppy so i don't know that i should rely on that book as much as i thought i should of course she has toys around the house to chew on some she really likes and we always give her one when she is biting us she'll bite for a few seconds and when we say good girl lily she'll remember about us and just come back to bite us again wow you really have some issues with lily part of it is that she is still a puppy and i can tell you that these things will go away at least part of her biting problem is because she's a puppy and it hurts even more because she's got sharp puppy teeth it's normal for puppies to be really mouthy and need to bite a lot of stuff to relieve the teething however i do think she's biting too much getting up at all hours of the night to take her out is unfortunately another normal puppy thing we went through this with our dog when he was potty training dogs can't hold it that long until they're a little older maybe hours but it does eventually get better the most important thing you can do for your dog's potty training is to resolve the crate training issue crate training is the best way to potty train and you need to have a crate trained dog for other reasons like if you ever have to leave for long periods of time or take her on a trip this is what i'd do i'd either put her in the crate and let her howl for a few weeks and get myself some ear plugs or get her a bark collar for when she goes in the crate get her one that beeps or sprays citronella not the shock kind it will beep spray when she barks and she won't like it but it will quickly correct her barking and howling in the crate the only problem with this is that she won't be able to bark when she needs out to go potty so you'll have to pay special attention to when she might need to go with my foster dogs i crate train all of them even if it kills me i just let them howl all night it's hard but it's what's best for me and them but i have used bark collars before with a lot of success the house destruction is probably part of her being a mouthy chewy puppy it probably won't continue just correct her if you catch her doing it unfortunately you'll just have to wait until she outgrows it and then try to repair what she's done for the smell in your carpet i'd recommend buying a carpet steam cleaner it is the best i've ever spent to treat a spot i buy this stuff called nature's miracle or mix some oxiclean in water and pour it on the stain i try to do this right after the dog makes the mess i soak up the pee with a paper towel then soak the area in oxiclean nature's miracle then i soak that up with a paper towel then i use the steam cleaner on it with pet odor shampoo people even come over and tell me my house smells good even after all the dogs who have peed on my floor lol since you've got a pup who's going to be very large i think you should take her to obedience classes now she has to learn that you are in charge period especially if she's going to be bigger than you german shepherds can be very well trained well behaved dogs but it takes lots of training i think she's ready now for a puppy class with all commands she's going to learn she has to obey you and that will help with all her problems even the biting she has to learn to submit to you so you'll have to be very on top of things with her obedience training the biting this is where i think you might have a real problem i think i know what you are talking about because i once handled a german shepherd puppy who constantly attacked my arms and legs and it was even scary i had never seen a pup like that i am assuming you are talking about that kind of problem the important thing to understand here is that if you don't get this under control you might have a dog so out of control that she has to be put down she's a puppy now but imagine her acting like this when she's older it looks like you have tried every possible way of fixing this and she isn't responding i really think you'll have better luck with this as her obedience training comes along usually i don't suggest such heavy handed methods but it looks like you have tried everything else so here's what i would try now a shock collar continuing hitting her on the nose filling a can with coins and shaking it at her when she bites rattling newspaper at her don't have to hit her or getting a spray bottle filled with water and spray her in the face when she bites i know you don't want to have this kind of relationship with your dog but with a breed like a german shepherd you have to you have to have a relationship where she understands that you are the leader and she must obey you if all this doesn't work call a dog behaviorist to work with you because this is serious i really hope you can get things going better with her good luck Time Out of Mind Teen Girl Squad Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ferret Eddie Guerrero Domestic rabbit
