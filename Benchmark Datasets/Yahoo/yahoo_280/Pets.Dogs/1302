does this sound like mange to you i work at a shelter and we just recently got in a collie mix who i suspect has mange to his credit his fur is fairly thin by nature probably from malnutrition but there's a spot on the back of his neck that is so thin it's almost bald and looks dirty with a brownish kind of tint to it i haven't had the chance to give him a bath yet so i'm not sure if it really is simply dirt or is there is something else amiss i know i didn't give much of a description but does it sound like mange to you if so what kind i've been handling him very carefully and washing my hands frequently in case he does have it because obviously i don't want it spreading to other dogs i'm just a volunteer and as such i'm not allowed to take him off the premises but i have already mentioned it to the shelter manager and i'm sure she already has a vet appointment scheduled for him but for now what are your opinions if this is mange it seems like an early case thank you first off for volunteering i wish more people would when i was able i loved doing volunteer work with animals honestly it just sounds like malnutrition which can cause hair to fall out and skin irritation as you know when they come in like that you have to be extra careful of transmittable disease but it doesn't sound like this one is anything to worry about if you'll be washing him tomorrow pay close attention see if your washing it causes itching as you stimulate it by washing see if he leans into your hand if it causes itching it could very well be just a case of nerves or a bite of some sort check out the link below unless there are sores evident then i'd just suspect skin irritation or nerves again bless your heart for what you're doing Urinary incontinence Mange Eczema Prostate cancer Skin Psoriasis Hamster Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shampoo Dog Theory of conduct Cat Scabies Traumatic brain injury Tenshinhan Itch Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Pet skunk Hypoglycemia Gray Wolf Shaggy dog story First aid Mosquito Jock itch Breastfeeding Hair Androgen insensitivity syndrome Textile manufacturing Violin Aerial (dance move) Anus Tasmanian Devil Herpes simplex virus Autoimmune diseases Timpani Chronic fatigue syndrome Fancy rat Oral sex Marilyn Monroe Dandruff Japanese tea ceremony Radiation therapy Social rule Fox hunting Massage History of male circumcision Yoko Ono Pneumonia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Allergy Conjunctivitis Keeshond Erogenous zone Tocopherol Philosophical skepticism Domestic rabbit Hearing impairment Professional wrestling holds Tarantula Garfield Game programming Acne Slot machine Horse Rabies Eye Knots Landing CPU cache Microchip implant (animal) Poker jargon 613 mitzvot Babe Ruth Humphrey Bogart Leprosy Body piercing Sin City Bleeding Adoption Goofy Dog training Pitaten Aspartame Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Tattoo Certified Nursing Assistant The Amber Spyglass Clothing Time Out of Mind Stem cell Brush The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy
