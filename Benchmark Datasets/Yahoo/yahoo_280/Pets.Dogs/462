what breed do you think this is i was told my puppy was an akita lab mix when i adopted him but that was just a guess as the rescue did not have either parent around his features are very akita like and even an akita breeder confirmed that she felt he was akita but he's very small for the breed at just under months he weighs only lbs typically a male akita would be lbs at that age i think he may be mixed with shiba inu instead of akita which would account for the smaller size shiba can get up to lbs not what the standard says i know but not all dogs are perfect examples of the standard looking for ideas from others oh and no he's not chow i'm sure of that http www flickr com photos n what a beautiful boy definitely part akita he could be akita mixed with a smaller breed and may stay small we have a corgi and even though she is registered and a great quality dog i intended to spay her before i could get her to the vet to have her spayed hubby let her out one day and didn't pay attention i was out of town and had no idea she had been out until she was showing signs of pregnancy anyway the dog that was hanging around was a small french bulldog much smaller than my corgi and the resulting pups were mini corgis none of them ever got over pounds and are adorable tiny corgis hahaha soooooo cute and so funny i'm guessing the akita mixed with a very small dog wow did you get lucky to find this designer pup i know i know breeders of pure breds are death on mixed breeds especially designer pups but big bucks are being shelled out for designer pups and yours is a gorgeous example of beautiful design whatever he is best of luck to you and your little beauty Dog Mixed-breed dog Akita Inu Guinea pig Shiba Inu Spitz Domestic rabbit American Pit Bull Terrier Great Dane Nintendogs Docking Kodocha Jack Russell Terrier Scooby-Doo Dog breeding Dog show Cat Hamster Housebreaking Golden Retriever Boston Terrier Pembroke Welsh Corgi Gray Wolf Bulldog Welsh Corgi Pit bull Garfield Game show German Shepherd Dog Dobermann Breed registry Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Chihuahua (dog) Domestic goat The Price Is Right Pekingese Pet skunk Tosa (dog) Labrador Retriever Kylie Minogue Irish Wolfhound Hachiko English Cocker Spaniel Shetland Sheepdog Poodle Puppy mill Yorkshire Terrier Breed standard Rottweiler Liger Our Gang Species InuYasha (character) Akita Prefecture Taikyoku shogi American Kennel Club 101 Dalmatians: The Series Best of Breed English Springer Spaniel USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Girly Powel Crosley Jr. Whippet Australian Cattle Dog Fancy rat Pound RISC American Cocker Spaniel Greyhound Dog breed Dachshund Selective breeding Coyote Smooth Collie EastEnders American Bulldog Havanese Australian Silky Terrier Apple Computer Shrek 2 Tenterfield Terrier Breed-specific legislation Ferret Fast breeder Australian Shepherd Dog agility Manga Cardigan Welsh Corgi Manx (cat) Newfoundland (dog) Cockapoo Hip hop rivalries Hip dysplasia Frankie Laine Miniature Fox Terrier Toy dog Paragliding Rabbit The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex
