which type of brush should i use on my puppy's hair i have a five month old puppy who currently has medium length hair she is supposedly a labrador terrier mix however according to our vet she has a lot of setter in her and i was recently told by someone who had a setter that her hair is very similar to that dog's hair in any case the brush we were using when she was much smaller and had much shorter hair is no longer working well enough any suggestions the brush we have right now has two sides one side has metal bristles and the other some sort of synthetic bristles neither of them seems to do a very good job a brush that has soft ends those kind tend to work great for medium sized haird dogs Dog Mixed-breed dog German Shepherd Dog Volleyball Shetland Sheepdog Skye Terrier Boar Yorkshire Terrier Jack Russell Terrier Hair Toothbrush Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Labrador Retriever Havanese Golden Retriever West Highland White Terrier Guinea pig Carding American Pit Bull Terrier Fur Smooth Collie Building material Painter and decorator Plastic Floppy disk Violin Housebreaking Airedale Terrier Border Terrier Keeshond Nintendogs Kerry Blue Terrier Haircut Gas metal arc welding Double bass My Little Pony Drill bit Gun dog Carbon nanotube Puberty Coat (dog) Dog agility Australian Silky Terrier Textile manufacturing terminology Cello Acne Cat Tibetan Terrier RuneScape quests Typewriter Maltese (dog) Cairn Terrier Griffon Bruxellois Drawing Companion dog Strap-on dildo Chinese Crested Dog Finnish Spitz Hot dog View camera Korea Jindo Dog Basset Hound Grunge music Radar Mange Troll Literature Drug test Dog training Professional wrestling match types Socialization Dog show Fast bowling Gray Wolf The Ashlee Simpson Show Poodle Knife Tooth Shotgun Border Collie Fox Terrier Code: Lyoko Audio tape length and thickness Pit bull Headgear Miniature Fox Terrier Aquatic ape hypothesis Radio controlled airplane Snowboard Bladderwort Tenterfield Terrier Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Terrier Vowel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bull Terrier Plame affair Scooby-Doo Docking
