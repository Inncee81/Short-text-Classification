why does my dog always lay on me he is a chihuahua so i sometimes think he does it to get my body heat or does he do it because he loves to be next to me i can't decide he sleeps in my bed under my covers with me every night when there are plenty other places he could sleep but chooses to not he is asserting his dominance over you dogs still live in the pack mentality he is showing you he is the alpha it has nothing to do with love or staying warm sadly enough unfortunately we see this alot with small breed dogs because they really are lapdogs by allowing a dog to sit on you or sleep on you you are giving him power two places of power in the house are the couch and the bed if they are allowed on either piece of furniture it should be by invitation giving you the power once a dog believes it is the alpha it is extremely difficult to convince it otherwise oftentimes resulting in bites to strangers kids other dogs and sometimes even the owner Dog Dog training Cat Mixed-breed dog Housebreaking Gray Wolf Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sleep Obedience training Dog agility Mattress EastEnders Avenue Q Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shetland Sheepdog Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Pug Pack (canine) Pit bull Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Death Gate Cycle British House of Commons Bed (furniture) Strap-on dildo Sleeping Murder Bed and breakfast Italian Greyhound Manos: The Hands of Fate Social rule Insomnia Toy dog Sin City Iditarod Another Simpsons Clip Show Theory of conduct Nintendogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) A Milhouse Divided Aphrodite Marilyn Monroe Kitchen Democratic Party (United States) Blankets (graphic novel) Dobermann Out-of-body experience Late Night with Conan O'Brien Pekingese Korea Jindo Dog Crate training Rosa Parks Golden Retriever The Shining (film) Buckingham Palace Pope John Paul I Pok__mon Live!
