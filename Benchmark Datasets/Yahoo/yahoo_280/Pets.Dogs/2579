i have heard and read some articles on litter box training for puppies to get them started potty training has anyone did this or have any thoughts on it i have and they learn quick at pet store they sell this litter that apparently has dog urine smell or something on it and they love it sometimes they want to play in it like a sandbox too but it totally worked for me i had two puppies that i bought about months aprt and each one learned if you don't clean it out they will do their business elsewhere but it worked for us eventually you can switch it to newspaper and they will be fine with it but when just teaching them stick with the litter you need to reinforce it with praise excitement and a dog treat each time and they'll totally get it Housebreaking Dog training Domestic rabbit Dog Hamster Fancy rat Crate training Guinea pig Labrador Retriever Cat litter Cat Pet skunk Puppy mill Socialization Skinny Puppy Beethoven (film) Nintendogs Toilet humour Kurt Cobain Dog agility Golden Retriever Brian Griffin Shaggy dog story Breed registry Toilet training Urinary incontinence Dog breeding American Eskimo Dog Havanese Dog breed Pet store Into the West (miniseries) Japanese toilet Sick Puppy Dobermann Belgian Shepherd Dog Elimination communication Chinchilla Ron and Fez Spot the Dog Ralston Purina Company 50 Cent Animal Farm Obedience training Border Terrier Zoophilia Toy Ron Weasley Joseph Smith, Jr. The Fairly OddParents Aphasia Toilet Resident Evil (film) Scenes from a Memory Litter Snoopy Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Calvin and Hobbes Nintendo Docking Bill Clinton Tobacco smoking The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Rugrats Santa's Little Helper Michael J.
