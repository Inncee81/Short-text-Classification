does anyone really have a clue i love coming in here to the dogs section to see how many people really don't have a clue i am not sure who is worse the askers or the answerers what do you think you have people who think that they have a agressive puppy because it growls and barks at them come on folks have you done any research before getting the dog and then you have idiots saying smack the puppy when it growls yeah no the rocket scientist there does anyone have a clue then when someone who knows what they are talking about they are sent nasty e mails i think what really drives me nuts is that when it comes to the best answers these brainless wonders pick someone with thumbs down please do a little research take the dog to the vet when it is sick and hasn't eaten for a week and if you ask a question expect that there are a few people in here who know what they are talking about and times as many who don't now would that be so hard hi kats as one of those people who saw a well bahaved dog in the park and wanted that i can say well i am dumb i knew that having a well trained dog was work i just didn't know how much i went and adopted a dog and you know what my criteria was ohhh he likes to play ball and when he brings it back he drops it he doesn't run away or hold onto it whilst i try and rip pry it from his jaws yea i know great criteria stupid me and i brought him home and we started with leash pulling he is part husky and that is exactly what he acted like whining barking separation anxiety not kennel trained i mean this was my first dog could i have picked a bigger challenge for myself so in today's fast food society i think that lazy people think their first resource is the internet yahoo answers chat groups while the internet is a powerful tool and i found a lot of information about my dog and training you have to be educated enough to know a good site from a bad one i teach that in my classes i know what to look for i immediately when i was having behavioural problems picked up the phone and called my vet of all people they recommended obedience class and guess what i went and guess what else i did my obedience class homework it's not difficult to have a well trained dog it's just work it's not hard work it's not like building a skyscraper it's not like calculus it's just work and time and you have to be willing to put in that work or you shouldn't get a dog i think that should be a question that breeders ask their potential puppy's parents and the aspca and humane society how many hours a week are you actually going to put into training this puppy if they say then don't give them a dog i spend every minute of our walk working on things with my dogs they are still fairly young i got lucky when he was almost a year old through stupid off leash dogs and several dog altercations he is now leash aggressive which means more training people need to understand that depending on the circumstances training a dog can be an everyday thing my dogs must sit and be calm before they eat when we first learned this it took minutes for them to actually get their food now they sit and get to eat within seconds but every once in awhile we have come commotion and need to settle down training and obedience last the lifetime of the dog and practice makes perfect as they say i agree with your vet comment when there is an issue the vet is the first person i call i don't run to my computer and type on yahoo answers to see what a bunch of people who have never met lucky say my vet sees my dog theoretically once a year but we have things that crop up usually times a year broken tooth aggression vaccinations hurt knee i don't get it these people when you find a good vet love animals and want nothing more than to see balanced happy pets call them oh crap i am preaching to the choir aren't i well i am off to walk the dogs one by one this takes time people and more training wish me luck Social rule Shaggy dog story Obedience training Theory of conduct Garfield The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Housebreaking Dog agility Pet skunk Sin City Ron and Fez Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Time Out of Mind Little Britain Jumpstart 3rd Grade Socialization Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shit I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Game show Aerial (dance move) Autism Extreme Programming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Avenue Q RuneScape quests Microeconomics The Adventures of Pete & Pete Docking Milton H.
