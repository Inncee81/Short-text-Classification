laser light am i mean ok so i just so happen to come across a laser light today and my dog was chasing it like a mad man is this bad for him in any way i am not pointing it directly in his eyes just back and forth on the floor he seems to enjoy it and not to mention getting good excercise anyone with experience with this thanks i have gotten many a tap on the shoulder from trainers advising me to not play with my dog with those i agree too much of a good thing a laser pointer will cause the dog to develop an ocd so i would just say that since he loves it have him work for it by doing tricks and limit his exposure to it Laser safety Tag Laser Laser pointer Dog Obsessive-compulsive disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Cat Dog agility Dog training Volleyball Welding Anti-aircraft warfare Bad Wolf Weight training David Bowie Mouse (computing) Weebl and Bob Laser applications Directed-energy weapon Obedience training Meat Loaf Gun dog Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Inertial guidance system Confocal laser scanning microscopy Aerial (dance move) Socrates The Wiggles Homestar Runner GunBound Hearing impairment Laser-guided bomb Professional wrestling aerial techniques Galileo spacecraft Chevy Chase Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics VF-1 Valkyrie Invader Zim Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Garfield Laser diode Our Gang Luck The Shining (film) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mojave people Speed of light Hiberno-English Super Metroid Howard Hughes The Contender (television series) Camp Lazlo Laser lighting display Acne Parachuting Refractive surgery Philip J.
