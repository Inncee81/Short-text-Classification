puppy showing food aggression my new rescue a half great dane and half american bulldog months old is being food aggressive with my other dog a pug who is months old my pug will come over to see what shes eating the fur on her back will stand up then she'll bark and chase him off i'm afraid this will get very ugly later in life when she's well over a hundred pounds my new pup was chained to a pole in the city and starved so this doesn't come without good reason but how can i break her of this habit and teach her there will always be plenty of food for her i also meant to say she is fine with me taking the food and placing it back down and touching her while she is eating to the women who stated that if she bites or growls at me she needs to go it is because of people like you people with your mentality towards animals that so many end up in shelters and then are euthanized it is a behavioral problem and with work it can be fixed my question was how would you go about doing it if someone tied you to a pole and starved you wouldn't you be protective of any food you got afterwards i do not treat my dogs like humans thank you i do not dress them up i do not parade them around i don't cradle them like a baby you my friend need to stop being a sexist moron i have had this puppy for a grand total of two days i simply noticed a behavioral problem and was asking advice on how to fix it my last dog that was that way when it was meal time i made him eat from his bowl with me there and keep talking to him petting etc and then move the bowl a little this happened over maybe a month or so and each time i'd move it further while keeping him where he was soon enough i was able to remove the bowl growing up we had a dog that was also this way and we 'free fed' her with a big bowl with plenty of food of course at the beginning she overate a lot but not long after she realized that there was no need to compete for and protect her food be patient and stern but not abusive the best tool i've found for discipline is a section of newspaper maybe pages so or maybe full sheets when fully open rolled up and at the moment of aggressiveness a swat on the snout or butt will get their attention most of the time i would merely hit my own hand with it and the noise was enough to have him stop what he was doing and come to me for those of you that see discipline and think hit or beat or whip that is not ok and was never done maybe corrective action is better to say Dog Dog training Gray Wolf Cat Housebreaking Pet skunk Kodocha Garfield Guinea pig Hamster The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Spanking Socialization Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Poker jargon Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Animal Farm Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Breastfeeding RuneScape quests Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling throws Brown Bear Shaggy dog story Binge eating disorder Friends Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anorexia nervosa Shark Terri Schiavo Acorn Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Volleyball Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Traumatic incident reduction The Time Machine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Japanese tea ceremony Brian Griffin Elephant Dog agility Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lady and the Tramp Milton H.
