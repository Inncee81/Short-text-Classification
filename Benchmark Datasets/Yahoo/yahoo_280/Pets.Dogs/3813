do i pretend too much from my puppie please whoever decides to write something won't take it lightly i am seriously worried and over stressed to read stupid comments i just wish people who have or have had dogs tell me whether or not my expectations are too high i got this weeks jack russell female i got her just a week ago at the beginning so much joy but now is becoming me and my boyfriend's nightmare first of all she poops and pees all around the house we got weeks holidays from work just to be with her at the beginning constantly and try teaching her some manners ok i know she is little but still we put also a litter box in the balcony so that she can go there whenever we don't take her out still nothing but that isn't the worse part since we got her is a miracle if we sleep or hourse per night we put her in the bedroom in the cute crate that she loves during day but all she does is whining and criyng and getting nasty u surely understand that after a week this is getting too much if i let her sleep in bed she is happy but i don't want to get her used to that plus i wouldn't want her to to her stuff in it we take her to the park we take her for a walk she complains wants to sleep all the time and totally hates the leash i've seen puppies even younger going with it so well she sits and whines refusing to move i always have to carry her she has no interest in playing or going out she sleeps during day and makes us mad in the night and as if is not enough she scares to death my little kitties now my point is maybe i am not the right person to take care of a dog maybe is the breed that is too excessive i don't know if i had the certaincy that things will change by the time passing i will do all my sacrifices to be patient but what if it doesn't please i ask with all the humanity i have should i keep her or perhaps look for someone who could take better care of her and have more nerves i don't want to wait till i love her too much but i do not want to be dominated popotitozz first thanx for ur useless correction second i am italian sorry if my english isn't that good do u speak italian if not shut the fuck up anyway for serious people in case u didn't understand me i meant expect or something anastacia i expected people like u that's life your comment was surely helpful to have an idea of how useless u are on yahoo answer bye sloppyjakekisses i would take her for a walk sure no problem but just if she would walk she sits down and refuses to move guys i do take her for walks to the park i always take her with me since i got her but she won't move she won't play how can i think she wants to exrcise if all she does is crying and stops moving this is a really stressful situation but this is what happens with puppies and is very normal dogs don't gain bladder control till their about to months depending on the breed they really need to walked every hour until they understand this is where i go i your dog uses a litter box but is on the porch it may be afraid of going out their alone or she is not sure how to get out their try keeping the box inside until she know this is where i must go another thing that you really need to do is enroll in an obediance class this will help and you will also meet a lot of people that will be able to give you great advice un fortuantly the whining at night is the only thing i have not be able to fix that one try to not give the puppy attention for what she is doing and make sure that their is something in the cage that makes her comfortable like a favorite toy or a blanket that she loves this will take sometime but she will get over this soon good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Housebreaking Theory of conduct Dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Characters in the Smurfs Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Knots Landing Kodocha Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Urinary incontinence The Death Gate Cycle Friends Time Out of Mind Insomnia The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass The Star Wars Holiday Special Singlish Pok__mon Live!
