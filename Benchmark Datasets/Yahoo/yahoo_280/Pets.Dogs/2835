questions for dog trainers and savvy owners please help i got a puppy aprox weeks old i've had her for a week i adopted her after finding her on the street i really want to train her to go potty outside sit stay be quiet and for her to stay in her 'pet taxi' at night and when i can't be with her when i first got her she would pee on the news paper only there were few accidents but yesterday she peed on the floor right besides the paper i've been praising her everytime she goes outside but i'm not sure if i should just ignore the peeing inside or should i act disappointed i don't want her to think it's ok to 'go' inside i've read some articles on the internet on the subject but it's not clear to me what they mean when they say to not let her get away with things i don't know if she might be training me and i haven't even noticed will someone please explain how i should go about with the training what should i try to teach her first or various things at the same time there are problems with newspaper it goes against natural instinct dogs don't go in the den by allowing her to go in the den you are telling her it's okay the other thing with newspaper or puppy pads is once they get close to them and smell them they assume that's where they go their little butt isn't always over top of the newspaper as soon as they smell it they go assuming that's the correct spot pee pee goes outside so you buy a crate and you put her in at night she'll need to go out before you got to bed and because she is weeks old she'll likely need to go out again at approx am and then likely by am immediately when you let her out take her outside i do not lead puppies from the crate to the door i either have the crate by the door and lead them out or i pick them up and carry them to the door the less chance they get to pee on the carpet the better off you are there is something very wonderful about peeing on carpet i believe when you are a puppy i take them out approx every hour no matter what they are doing if they are eating playing sleeping etc i take them out to pee i have a bell tied to the door that i ring when i open the door letting them know that the ringing of the bell will open the door when they go out you go out with them then you are standing right there and know that they peed and you can praise them praise is what is going to get them housetrained when you are inside you watch them like a hawk if she starts to pee you say no peepee outside you pick her up and you take her outside give her a minute to recoup from the surprise and you let her finish peeing and then you praise her if you can't watch her you crate her when you go away you crate her you don't put any paper or anything in the crate you don't want her thinking that it's okay to go in the crate just like you don't want her thinking it's okay to go in the big crate the house when you are outside and watering the garden and you see her pee tell her good girl go pee pee every chance you can have to tell her she is good for peeing outside is a point toward being housetrained if i have a dog that isn't getting it i put their water dish outside puppies find it much easier to tell you that they want a drink of water than they do to tell you that they have to pee if you are going out for a drink of water you might just as well pee while you are out there voila you are housetrained thanks you grandma m Dog training Crate training Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Toilet humour Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Sin City RuneScape quests EastEnders Monty Hall problem Aerial (dance move) G-Man (Half-Life) Friends Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Sento Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Japanese tea ceremony Milton H.
