jealous dog ihave a ywear old female golden a nd a month old femle great dane the golden retriever is very jealous and i know that she is trying to say that she is the alpha female but every time the puppy plays with a toy she gets jealous we have had the puppy for about one month but my golden still shows her teeth what can i do heather giving equal attention is one of the worst things you can do your pack needs a defined structure ie everyone knows who's in charge and what their place is equality confuses the heck out of them top dog of course should be you all good things come from mommy teach them that it's ok for you to take their food away but give it back after a few moments if they're calm same with toys etc only give affection when you're ready not if they come up and nudge you or try to make you sounds like next in line is your golden she has to teach this pup now who's in charge because soon it will be too late if you interfere too much the pup will learn that she can get away with it and will lead to bigger problems teeth will be shown to make a point just make sure no serious biting etc nips are part of how a puppy learns it's place in the pack from it's mother siblings etc and the golden needs you to reaffirm that she hasn't been replaced in the pack as give her special time with you without pup interfering if you stick to it everyone should quickly get the picture and settle down good luck Dog training Dog Hamster Golden Retriever Scooby-Doo Kodocha Socialization Our Gang Care Bears Guinea pig German Shepherd Dog Nerpa 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
