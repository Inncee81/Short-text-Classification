my pit is starting to bald around her eyes and a few other random spots im not really sure whats wrong with her i noticed it about weeks ago she had gone outside and gotten very dirty and i gave her a bath and used human shampoo because i didnt have anymore dog shampoo and a few days later it started i washed her again today with puppy shampoo and i was just wondering if she could just be having an alergic reaction to the human shampoo because my moms friend is a vetnarian i cant spell sorry and she said that it is possible and that it didnt look like mange but i am also seeing a redish rach on the skin by her hind leg could this all just be a reaction to the human shampoo yes it is possible she is having an allergic reaction plus human shampoo is too strong for dogs depending on type of shampoo this can strip their natural oils on top of causing skin reactions do not wash your dog for a while ask the vet about using a balm on the red spot where she's balding but definitely have a vet check that red spot for mange or ring worm ring worm is highly contagious and can pass from animals to humans and definitely not something you want trust me be sure to wash your hands after handling your dog just in case it is contagious ok you can also add a tablespoon of vegetable oil to her food to help her coat along and some cottage cheese or eggs she could also have fleas which would explain a reaction too good luck Shampoo Psoriasis Pet skunk Mange Fancy rat Dog Ranma __ characters Garfield Dandruff Dairy Guinea pig Keeshond Gray Wolf Horse Insulin Hair Ascariasis Teen Girl Squad Flea Sento Scabies Tattoo Kodocha Cat Fecal incontinence Tofu Soap bubble Urticaria Livestock Breakfast Shar Pei Cheese Schistosomiasis Fox hunting Social rule Docking Socialization Lisa the Vegetarian Eczema Characters of Naruto Crohn's disease Hamster AFI 100 Years series Shark Food Piccolo Junior Saga Leptospirosis Shaggy dog story Cantonese cuisine Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Agricultural wastewater treatment Scar Pizza The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy God Emperor of Dune Sulfuric acid GunBound Heartworm The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Soap Elephant Skunk Dog training Omega-3 fatty acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Skin Tarantula Urticating hair Kangaroo Honeybee Smegma Explosive material Chicken Paint Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 613 mitzvot Urinary incontinence Alopecia areata Wok Homestar Runner Ferret Eye Giraffe American Pit Bull Terrier Hay fever Vampire Foodborne illness Mayonnaise Acid Kosher foods Chili con carne Joke Procter & Gamble Tocopherol Pern Ultraviolet
