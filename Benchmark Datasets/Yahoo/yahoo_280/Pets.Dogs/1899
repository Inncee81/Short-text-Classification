in the top ten most dangerous dog list do you know where these three dogs are placed german shepherd shepherd mix great dane dogs st bernards the reason i ask is that a lot of people i meet say my breed of dog is dangerous and bad with other dogs and people they fail to realise however that german shepherds are way more dangerous and even great danes and believe it or not st bernards so go on try and guess oh and by the way for all labrador owners out there in they were number five on the most dangerous dogs list are they really as cute as people think i think not just making you aware of facts akita's are not attacking people anywhere near as much as other breeds like german shepherds labradors etc their placings depend on what city or state you are in and the popularity of the breed here is a suggestion for you instead of only worrying about your breed you should worry about all of the breeds that are being considered for bsl and help people realize that the absolute number one factor that determines whether or not a dog will become dangerous is ownership humans are most reponsible for dangerous dogs humans are responsible for creating the circumstances and behavior that lead to dog bites or maulings dogs bites wouldn't be an issue if people would research their dogs breed and or breeder before bringing them home and do some basic socialization and training it's not difficult folks but most people put more time into choosing a car than their dogs once enacted bsl will spread like wildfire to all breeds so why not work for the elimination of bsl altogether instead of defending only your chosen breed the next time i am writing letters and getting signatures for petitions against bsl do you think i should reconsider and only worry about the breed i love your breed like it or not has a bad reputation like mine so quit trying to shift the blame or rather the danger and be part of the solution not the problem in il all those breeds are on the so called list but so is yours because breed popularity drive the stats this is the list of some of the dogs that are considered dangerous or have been considered for bsl american pit bull terrier american staffordshire terrier staffordshire bull terrier in a several places bull terrier monticello centerville alburnett hiawatha iowa grandview mo n little rock ar ky wa akita ulyssas ks il alaskan malamutes fairfield ia american bull dog north little rock ar aurora co akron oh belgian malanois fairfield ia boerboels fairfield ia cane corso aurora co chow chow travelers rest sc newport ri lynnville tn il doberman pincher fairfield ia sisston sd westfield il travelers rest sc lynnville tn buffalo center ia dogo argentino aurora co english mastiffs yale ia fila brasileiro also known as the fila brazilian mastiff aurora co german shepard il fairfield ia lynnville tn great danes fairfield ia il irish wolf hounds fairfield ia mastiffs fairfield ia malamutes fairfield ia presa mallorquin also known as the ca de bou aurora co presa canario lanett al aurora co rottweiler north little rock ar buffalo grove il fairfield conrad lake mills lockridge ia walkerton in inman ks carl junction salisbury mo binghamton ny velva nd pawtuckett ri travelers rest sc lynnville tn smithville ut neah bay wa buffalo center ia scottish deerhounds fairfield ia shar pei's smithfield ut siberian huskies fairfield ia tosa inu aurora co if your dog is over lbs in fairfield iowa it is considered a restricted breed Mixed-breed dog Breed-specific legislation Spitz German Shepherd Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Akita Inu Alaskan Malamute Dobermann Staffordshire Bull Terrier Nintendogs Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005) Terrier Iditarod Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 Dog fighting Argentine Dogo Boston Terrier Gray Wolf Tosa (dog) Labrador Retriever Dog breed Belgian Shepherd Dog Great Dane Livestock Dog agility Working dog Siberian Husky Breed standard Alaskan husky Ferret Police dog Schutzhund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus State university Mange Obedience training Tibetan Mastiff Docking Krypto the Superdog Artificial selection Medieval hunting Yorkshire Terrier Domestication Cattle Irish Wolfhound Shar Pei Sled dog Inuit Species Dalton McGuinty New York Giants Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Road Rovers Connecticut Toy dog Rottweiler Theory of conduct Divorce Fox hunting German Shorthaired Pointer American Bison Fast bowling Airedale Terrier Weimaraner Housebreaking God Emperor of Dune American Bulldog Texas locations by per capita income 1925 serum run to Nome 21 July 2005 London bombings Border Terrier Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Mushing Hunting West Highland White Terrier Dog show Alpha Epsilon Pi Dachshund Microeconomics National Historic Landmark Chris Amon Cat British monarchy Pet skunk Hamster Babe Ruth Italian Greyhound Taboo food and drink Manx (cat)
