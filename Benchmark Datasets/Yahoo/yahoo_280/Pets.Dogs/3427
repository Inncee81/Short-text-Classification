does my dog have roundworm my dog just vomited up around one inch cream colored segments that looked like worms but when i went to clean up the vomit with a paper towel the segments crushed with the texture of velveta cheese could this be roundworm or something else i have never seen roundworms in person and couldn't tell by the photos posted on the internet my dog was dewormed when i bought him april st and he is and a half months old i would just go to petsmart petco and get some nemex wormer and worm him just to be sure once tomorrow and again in two weeks nothing will happen if he doesn't have them otherwise he may have a little constipation when ridding himself of the dead worms because if he did barf worms he will have alot the wormer won't hurt him either way they can get worms from the environment a walk another dog etc just routinely worm him and he will be fine he hasn't been wormed for afew months it is time especially if they didn't finish worming him one dose is not enough i worm my dogs monthly and if there is ever a wiggler i go back to every two weeks until it is cleared up Pet skunk Heartworm Ascariasis Animal Roundworm Philip J.
