do you think this is right yes or no graphic video please veiwer deicresion advised please be wanred its distubing do not watch if you think you can't take it http www youtube com watch v szfeyhqan o personaly i think its wrong but i wanan hear other peoples prospective if someone has a reasonable answer thats saying it is right i want to see so yes i do i have seen this video before it is absolutely disgusting as a chinese person myself living in australia many people ask me do you eat dogs as much as this outrages me i can understand why they think so china is known to be one of a few countries to eat dogs and cats many of us think this is wrong since we have domesticated these animals and made them our loved ones a family member who will shall never give up due to china's over population many residents cannot find a job let alone a good one as a result these people can barely support themselves so taking good care of a pet is completely out of the question for those who do own pets most of them dont take good care of them and the ratio of a vet to a doctor has a big difference when irresponsible breeding occurs the puppies are thrown onto the streets to fend for themselves so it isnt a surprising sight seeing so many homeless dogs on the streets alone scared hungry cold with no one to love or care for them i believe it is horrible the way this happens but once again i do understand the severity of their situations whether we like it or not as horrible this crisis may be not all chinese people are like this animals are killed all over the world for our consumption but us meat eaters dont complain do we dog and cat is meat too and the only reason we find this such a horrific and terrible sight is because we domesticated these animals would you feel the same about a cow if it was your pet would you be able to defend it like you would your dog everyone deserves a chance at life even if its crappy if you think about it you dont know what it's like to live in a country like china i visit it often and i know the atmosphere the people what they do what they like how they live you dont they are only doing what they need to do to survive and its only natural and everyone must respect that if you cant infer from this i don't have a specific answer there are two sides too everything and they are both equally fair i can understand what you are saying but i can also see their side as well i hope i have given you a little insight into this topic and even though i dont have an opinion on this i hope you can understand this a little better than just omg thats so disgusting and so wrong good day Taboo food and drink Theory of conduct Dog Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Garfield Ferret Animal rights Ranma __ characters Simone Weil Singlish Livestock Capital punishment Guns, Germs, and Steel Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Buddhism Housebreaking Socialization Guinea pig Pet skunk Sin City Domestication Sola fide Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Gray Wolf Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Fancy rat Fathers' rights The Smoking Room Friends Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Zoophilia Criticism of libertarianism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Goodness and value theory Feral cat Tiger Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aphasia Intelligent design Contract U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Chicken Prostate cancer The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Jam (TV series) Joke Skinny Puppy Theodicy Puppy mill Cattle German Shepherd Dog Tooth enamel Unclean animals Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sharia Lion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hunting Kashrut RuneScape quests American Psycho Lisa the Vegetarian The Fairly OddParents Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vegetarianism Moral Politics Korea Jindo Dog Fox hunting Sydney Riot of 1879 Book of Isaiah Philosophy of language Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Pig Muhammad Ali Randomness Docking Poker jargon Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meat Infantilism Koan Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Escape from New York Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ghost
