chihuahua with issues we recently kinda adopted a teacup chihuahua when i say kinda these people threw her out of their van like two weeks ago on our road we took her to the vet and everything checked fine she gets along great with our children and our other shih tzu the thing is with adults shes cowers with the kids shes fine but when me or my husband approach her and pet her her ears go back tair between her legs and she cowers to the floor to my understanding this means she was abused right we try not to approach her and let her come to us she comes and cuddles on the couch and follows us everywhere but shes so scared of adults does anyone know if this will get better with time is there anything we can do besides be patient the vet did check her for internal injuries when we saw this happen we picked her up and took her to our vet and waited until they could get us in they actually kept her overnight she will eventually learn to love you both and not cower too bad but she will probably always be wary of strange adults one thing about chis is that they flirt this way to they wiggle back and forth with their hips cower to the ground and slither up to you and roll over for their tummys to be petted then they jump up and run back and forth all around you with that silly smile not all of them do it all the time our alpha male doesn't do it as often but sometimes he will our tiny girl will slither up and roll over when she meets strangers she loves all people and has never been yelled at or hit at all it's just a chi trait they slither and smile and wiggle after they have been petted and adored they lick your nose and even chew on it if you let them so some of what you are seeing might be that after she greets you with that flirty slither she might start to run and play and kiss and act more like a dog you would know ours do it all the time to everyone even our alpha female will do it it's how they greet people Sin City Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Dog Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Dog training Kender Humphrey Bogart Dog agility Hall & Oates Father's Day (Doctor Who) Avenue Q Ren and Stimpy Professional wrestling attacks Squidward Tentacles The Fairly OddParents Friends Toy dog Escape from New York Chihuahua (dog) Kodocha Fancy rat Dead Like Me The Inside Ron Weasley The Marshall Mathers LP Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jam (TV series) Traumatic incident reduction Little Britain Professional wrestling aerial techniques Ranma __ characters Horse Equine conformation Phoebe Buffay's songs Rocko's Modern Life One Piece minor characters Terry Bogard The Beach Boys Smile (album) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Butters Stotch I Want to Hold Your Hand Saints and Soldiers EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Children of God Piccolo Junior Saga Miss Saigon Cliff Richard Daryl Hall Transactional analysis Good Times Invader Zim Cat Silent Night, Deadly Night Professional wrestling holds Babe Ruth Happy Tree Friends Elvis Presley FLCL Camp Lazlo Pitaten Hearing impairment The Shining (film) Nintendogs Guinea pig Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tai Chi Chuan Beavis and Butt-head Night of the Creeps Yoko Ono Conspiracy (TNG episode) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Boston Public Side pass (dance move) Milton H.
