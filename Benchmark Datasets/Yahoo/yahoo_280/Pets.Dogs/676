why do people answer questions when they don't know what they are talking about when i answer a question i know the answer if it is something i don't know but i think one of my wonderful contacts might be able to help with i star the question and tell the asker why i did if you don't know the answer why say anything but i have seen answers in here that make my skin crawl i own a pest control company i know how to treat for fleas and ticks properly i live in florida i wouldn't have a company anymore if i didn't and some people go in and give stupid if not dangerous answers i just saw one today that told a woman to use more bug bombs than they recommend and that she shouldn't vacuum since it doesn't kill fleas well dang the bug bombs are poison and the label states how many to use because the epa tells them that is how many is safe more than that is dangerous and not vacuuming is plain dumb there aren't any chemicals labelled to kill the flea eggs you have to vacuum to remove the eggs before they hatch i know there are products that when combined can possibly affect the eggs but that is a flea biology lesson for another day and then there are questions like i have an aggressive puppy where people tell the asked to smack it that just causes more aggression in a place where aggression probably wasn't even to begin with then there are the questions about the dog is sick or the dog has allergies and people tell them what over the counter medicines to give the poor dog they don't tell them how much per body weight just a name brand and that's it omg i wonder how many dogs have died from that type of advice anyway my rant is over did i miss anything kat asked anyway my rant is over did i miss anything tony comments yep you forgot to mention the person that answers with the authority of a seasoned pro but whose expertise is in some totally unrelated field oh they come off pretty good listing sources and everything but then you start to realize that listing sources is really all they seem to have to back up their thoughts and opinions so then you look at those sources and lo and behold you see that what they've offered is really only a restating of the source material like they have no experience or at best too little experience to actually put an original thought on the screen in the first place people asking questions about dog aggression should first qualify the actual experience of the persons replying to them before they place any confidence in the answer and let me clue you in the person whose experience is in trophy hunting with their own dog in an agility or rally ring has probably little to no experience with what to do with a pissed off presa whose intent in life appears to be the total destruction of the neighbourhood's cats dogs children and old people want proof ask the question and see how many of the type i've described above come back with 'kill the dog ' Theory of conduct Dog Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule The Apprentice 2 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape quests Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Joke Theodicy Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Fancy rat Russian joke Characters of Naruto Friends Little Britain Dog training The Silence of the Lambs God Emperor of Dune 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Karl Rove Xenomorph Abortion Gypsy moth The Amber Spyglass You Don't Know Jack A Course In Miracles Cancer The Lovely Bones Paul Is Dead Killian documents Richard Feynman The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Flea Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q Cat Past teachings of Prem Rawat Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Scientology beliefs and practices Rei Ayanami Sharon Tate The Death Gate Cycle The X-Files (season 1) Eddie Guerrero The Shining (film) Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq The Star Wars Holiday Special Characters of Lost Biblical inerrancy Yusuf al-Qaradawi G-Man (Half-Life) Anne Rice Roswell UFO incident Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dilbert The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Children of Dune The nature of God in Western theology Kill Bill Origin belief Poker jargon Jeopardy! in culture Livestock Columbine High School massacre The Ark in Space Time Out of Mind Secretar__a de Inteligencia Pet skunk Debugging House of M Traumatic incident reduction James Dobson Indianapolis 500 Eugene Wigner Cindy Sheehan One Tree Hill (TV series) Mojave people Sexual orientation
