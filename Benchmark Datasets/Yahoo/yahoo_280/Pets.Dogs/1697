does anyone here know how to make a dog poop when you want him to i have a dog who has been trained to only potty on command however there are times when we are traveling and i know he's about ready to potty but he won't i hate boarding him when i know he has to go but chooses not to i have heard from certain dog trainers that there is a very easy method to getting your dog to poop but should only be used when extremely necessary i don't think it requires any products you can get the dog to go right there on the spot but how does anyone know they said they had to pay good money to learn this technique so they don't usually share it with anyone anyone willing to share it with me i'm semi successful but don't really work on it enough to really get it consistent i just use positive reinforcement when he's about to go poop i tell him to poop or some other word that's unique after he poops i give him a treat and tell him he did a good job so he has a command for the action and a benefit in regards to pooping on command it's more of an encouragement to do it now versus sniffing around but it's not a command like sit where they will just stop and do it also i've found that if my dog is needing to go but distracted i stop and he is stuck in the same area he'll stop sniffing and being distracted since he's already sniffed up the area so he poops i don't know if this is the secret method that you're referring to but just something i've been trying out Obedience training Dog training Housebreaking Pitaten Clown Dog agility Toilet humour Crate training Advertising Deck (ship) Contract Alexander Technique Inflation Milton H.
