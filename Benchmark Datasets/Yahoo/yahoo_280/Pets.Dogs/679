what are some tips for controlling a biting puppy my friend has a puppy but old enough to know better by now i would think who chews on everything when his owner is in the house he's in a crate during the day when his owner is at school he gets taken on a mile walk every day about an hour after he's recovered from the walk he's regained all of his energy and goes a little crazy at night his owner has tried all sorts of approaches to get him to stop chewing things he has plenty of chew toys and when he's told he can't chew on furniture and speaker wires and whatnot he's given the chew toy instead he plays with it for a minute then goes back to chewing on furniture sometimes he'll even bite the owner hard thinking it's a game when he's put into submission it takes a good minutes to calm him down i can't think of anymore tips for my friend because he seems to be doing everything consistently already i'd love some dog training tips suggestions to pass along please read the details before answering he does have chew toys and his owner does take him on long walks he's had his rabies shot he was adopted from humane society and his owner shows dominance by putting him into submission i'll definitely suggest the dog whisperer thing about owning the couch i forgot to tell him about that and it's worked wonders on my own dogs keep 'em coming i don't usually believe in hitting dogs but in this instance i would say i would smack it under the yaw sometimes convention ways don't work and it sounds like your doing everything right this puppy just doesn't get it so help him get it the next time he chews on something other than what he is sup post to smack him and drag his ass to his crate and leave him there for a time out min every time he is caught doing something he is not sup post to you smack him and say no and drag his ass to the crate eventually you will only have to say no because the dog will not want the consequences its as easy as that give the dog a consequence for its actions and it will think before it does things Dog training Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Crate training The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Social rule Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Animal Crossing Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Inside Fancy rat Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babe Ruth The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Little Britain Piccolo Junior Saga Ferret Tenshinhan Blonde on Blonde Ron and Fez Traumatic incident reduction Kurt Angle Hey Jude Avenue Q I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Beethoven (film) Cliff Richard Skinny Puppy Late Night with Conan O'Brien RuneScape quests One Tree Hill (TV series) Mercury Atlas 6 Garfield Wrigley Field Rabies Aerial (dance move) Apollo 8 Milton H.
