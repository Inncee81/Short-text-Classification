my year old bulldog was called a pit bull today groan what the heck does the public think a pit is anything with a big chest and muscles hes very fit for a bully seems to be the culprit breeds of dog are mistaken as pitbulls how would you tell a stranger what a pitbull looks like i've come to the conclusion that most people just don't have a clue i hear things like this all the time at work plus the general public don't know breed color or even general anatomy and this applies to dogs cats birds reptiles whatever i've seen boston terriers french bulldogs mastiffs boxers and even a pekingese that had been shaved called pit bulls and don't even get me started on the colors of cats there is a difference between a gray tabby and a brown tabby and a calico yet i see the same cat called each and it's actually a tortoise shell but my all time favorites are telling owners that their female cat is actually a male due to the lumps you see under his tail and telling the puppy's owner that those lumps between his rear legs are normal for boy puppies and you don't have to be concerned so just smile and gently inform these people of their mistake and try not to think ill of their ignorance sometime somewhere you'll come across something that you have no clue about and the person with the right knowledge will do the same for you Dog American Pit Bull Terrier Mixed-breed dog Cat Mastiff Tabby cat Boston Terrier German Shepherd Dog American Bulldog Terrier Horse Dog show Turkish Van Cat coat genetics Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bull Terrier Fancy rat Maine Coon Tom and Jerry (MGM) Pekingese Dog breeding Labrador Retriever Professional wrestling throws Rottweiler Bengal cat Shetland Sheepdog Gray Wolf Jack Russell Terrier Social rule Dobermann Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Scooby-Doo Breed standard Siamese (cat) Argentine Dogo Dog training Border Collie Equine conformation Professional wrestling aerial techniques Mange The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kakapo Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Tortoiseshell cat RuneScape quests Ferret Sherlock Holmes Housebreaking Tenterfield Terrier Breed registry Stuttering Reptile Kerry Blue Terrier Turkish Angora Chicken Morphology (linguistics) Lion The Amazing Race Inception of Darwin's theory Buttocks Cairn Terrier Shaggy dog story Species Portuguese Water Dog Ren and Stimpy Docking Garfield Yorkshire Terrier Vegeta Spanking Domestic rabbit Breed-specific legislation Tibetan Mastiff Peafowl Nintendogs Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Kodocha Bullmastiff Bulldog Platypus Puppy mill Color Trish Stratus Egg (biology) Korea Jindo Dog Sphynx (cat) House Mouse Sinfest World Series Cheetah Iris (anatomy) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tiger The League of Gentlemen (comedy) American Alligator
