is it safe to cut a notch in joists and rafters in my attic the people who put the electrical system in my house put all the electrical cords over the joists and rafters instead of using a hole saw to put the cords through the boards now that we own the house we want to put a floor in the attic so the electrical cords must be placed lower than the surface of the boards so we don't nail through them and keep the boards flat my thought is to cut a notch in the boards just deep enough to lower the electrical cords below the surface my concern is whether i will weaken the roof support or cause any other damage to the house by doing this due not notch as your rafters will lose strength disconnect the wires if you are able or call a electrician and drill your hole through the center of the rafters Glossary of partner dance terms Swingout Baseball Lindy Basic Contredanse MapleStory Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation Social Democratic Party (UK) Atomic Kitten Professional wrestling throws Back to the Future Professional wrestling match types Mattress RuneScape Mini-Games Topps Crash test dummy RuneScape quests Knife Passenger car RS-232 Pole vault Magnet Casting Kirby Aerial (dance move) InterCity Express Mac OS X Double bass Liberal Democrats (UK) Punch (strike) Piledriver (professional wrestling) Compass Station wagon Autogyro Textile manufacturing Drill bit The Ersatz Elevator Relative clause The Inside Pools of Darkness Gothic metal Circle (dance move) Baseball Stars Ocean's Twelve Surveillance Balboa (dance) Suplex Short selling Swing state Golf Castle of the Winds Bridge Big5 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Politics of Scotland The Chronicles of Riddick Jennifer Lopez Crinoline Softball BoA United Kingdom general election, 1992 Auction Method Man Home Box Office USS Aaron Ward (DD-483) Bond Sugar push Swing bowling Professional wrestling holds Futurama (TV series - season 5) Bicycle frame Yorkshire Engine Company Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation Bleed American Canal lock 24 (television) Skittles (sport) Henry Bessemer Emirates Stadium United Airlines Flight 93 Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game R46 (New York City Subway car) Memorial Stadium, Clemson Hellraiser Richard Steele (boxing referee) 2005 World Series United Kingdom general election, 2005 $ale of the Century Changeroom Jerry Coleman Pittsburgh Steelers Casualty lifting Mario Hersheypark Dodge Neon Eddie Guerrero United States Postal Service John Hancock Tower Bob Wills Internet fraud
