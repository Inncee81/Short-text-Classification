rewiring a ceiling fan reinstalling existing fan lights work fan does not however there is a slight audible hum coming from motor has separate controls is could the wires be connected wrong or is the motor burned out in addition this fan worked before removal so if the motor is damaged can you cause this to happen if it was hooked up wrong also happened to my fan on range hood thanks in advance to all who understand electricity this is so frustrating ok proper hook up sounds like you have swapped a hot wire for the neutral no problem for the motor as it is on the same phase so you have two wires coming from the switch on the wall you say independent controls this is on the fan itself the black wire from the wall switch should be placed on wire going to the light switch and the wire one of them going to the fan motor the real problem is this one of the wires to the switch of the fan is a common the others are for the speeds you need to get an ohm meter and see which wire is common to all the other output wires this is where the black wire from the switch goes to the others go to the coil if the fan for speeds if these are not attached it is nor real important at this time to get those right just hook them to the motor i would leave the light wiring alone as you say it is ok the humm is caused by the wiring being crossed on the switch you won't blow the motor the white wires combine to attach to the white wire going to the switch some older homes may have two blacks coming to the light socket in that case you need to get a volt meter and figure out which is hot and which is neutral a little trial and error it'ss work fine Tile Masonry Drywall Ra (board game) Wallpaper Dominoes Gypsum Tile-based game Mahjong Home repair Carcassonne (board game) Seismic retrofit Acquire Wallpaper group Atomic Kitten Basement Prim's algorithm Guastavino tile Varnish Warhammer 40,000 Titanium Roof Brush Dundas Square M.C.
