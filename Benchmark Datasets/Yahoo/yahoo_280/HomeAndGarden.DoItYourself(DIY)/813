how can i get rid of roaches in an apartment i live in an apartment complex and there is a really bad roach infestation we have complained to the office many times and they say they are treating for them we get these little notes from the bug man who say he is going to come spray for bugs but they only spray the outside of the bottem apartments we have them so bad that i have had to move all of my food out of the pantry because of a huge roach nest that is in it yuk also i had to throw away my dogs bed because they made a nest in it they are just all over i am tired of being told its getting taken care of when it is not so my question is what can i do to get rid of them being that i live in an apartment i mean we can't bomb the house and that wouldn't work anyways would it be possible to get some kind of exterminator to come and then we just give them the bill i mean i know you can do that if you live in a house and would it even do any good to spray for roaches in just my apartment we live in one upstairs i don't need to know of an exterminator i know one who wiped them out of our last house for us i just don't know if it would be ok to call him and have him treat only our apartment i don't know if that would do any good and if i did that i would want the apartment people to pay for it ok i'm insulted my apartment is very clean i'm just poor and live in crapy apartments i've complained several times to both the apartment manager and the pest company but they refuse to do anything except spray the bottom outside apartments my neighbors are filthy and their nastiness is coming into our apartment i don't know what kind of legalities there are for such a problem so if you know some texas renting laws let me know if you only have stupid answers don't waste my time i am very serious and am even considering talking to lawyers about this it is unlikely that just treating your own apartment will get rid of the roaches but it would probably help control them a little you can buy boric acid at home depot or some other hardware type store and put it in all of the cracks and crevices you can find you can also buy your own insecticide and spray whether or not you can hire an exterminator and force management to pay depends on your state county or city laws do you have rent control if so try to locate the nearest rent control office and call them if not most big cities have some kind of governmental landlord tenant association whose job is to help tenants and landlords work within the law and to inform them just what that law is they will know if you can hire an exterminator and either force management to pay or withhold the amount you pay from the rent another option is to contact the board of health and explain the situation to them if it's bad enough it may be actionable in which case the board of health will go after management don't feel guilty about complaining if it's that bad they need to be complained about good luck Whois HTML British small press comics Glacier Postage stamp Plastic Internet fraud Live 8 Drill bit Opera (web browser) Gramophone record Rubber Tax Paper size Textile manufacturing terminology Offset printing Autograph Gmail Diving suit Table tennis Dairy Bank Tire Mach kernel Flat file database Japanese tea ceremony Software engineering Glass Amazon.com Casting ZX Spectrum Cascading Style Sheets The Foundation Series Leaf Landfill Shoe Inventory Mozilla Firefox Grand Teton National Park Motorcycle helmet Phishing MIME Repouss__ and chasing G__del's incompleteness theorem Wallpaper group Denial-of-service attack Sushi Enigma machine Cross site scripting Independent Media Center IPod Internet Explorer for Mac Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Welding Legal research Europa (moon) Minstrel show Binary and text files Sea ice Richard Stallman Vulcanization Mattress E-mail spam Pontianak, Indonesia Online auction business model Bulk vending Botany Coir Homer Simpson RAS syndrome T-800 Spam (electronic) Chlorophyta Typewriter Mirror Programming language Massage Softball Domain Name System Skype Brodie helmet Reactive armour Geology of Venus Internet Group Management Protocol Advance fee fraud Roswell UFO incident Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Continuously variable transmission The Shining (film) Battery (electricity) Direct marketing Kazaa Violin Wal-Mart Nagercoil Congress of Industrial Organizations MobyGames Enceladus (moon)
