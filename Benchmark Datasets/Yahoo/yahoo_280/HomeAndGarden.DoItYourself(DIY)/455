how do you make an outdoor fish pond from scratch i have never tackled a project like this so i need as many details as you can give me i'm going to put in goldfish just regular commet goldfish i'm willing to do anything for this project and it will be in the shade will it need a filter aeration systems how do i protect it against predators i've heard putting wire mesh over it helps i really want my fish to live a good happy life oh and i need to know how to prevent algae growth it will be in the shade but will that be enough the diy sites can be very confusing i try to simplify first you have to dig a hole to the size of pond you wish to have next remove any rocks that are of any size next you will need to put in sand to cover the bottom and pack it down making sure that no rocks can be felt at this point you can do one of two things either buy a premade liner or use ml plastic purchased at any local hardware store to line the hole i prefer the plastic that way you can make the shape the way you want it next place the plastic in the hole and put in enough water to form the plastic just to where the sand ends next pull the side in a little at a time and fill sand in up the side and fill with more water continue this till you reach the top when you get to the top fold the edge on the ground and place a few rocks or other objects on to weigh it down and mulch pebbles or what ever to dress the edges after this you can put in a filter or a fountain anything that adds air to the water now as far as predator go if your in the country bigger predators will be hard ie raccoons etc but village and city simple screen mesh over the pond just below the water so you can lift up to feed will do Firearm Internal ballistics Cartridge (firearms) Blood (computer game) Fire extinguisher Transformers: Cybertron Shotgun Thermal power station Shotgun shell V-1 flying bomb Barbecue GunZ The Duel Torpedo Explosive material Campfire Battery (electricity) Fire fighting Diesel engine Shell (projectile) RuneScape quests Lighter Electroshock gun Naval mine Balloon (aircraft) Hand grenade Wal-Mart Fire balloon Plastic Seismic retrofit Glossary of nautical terms Paintball Sponge Spark plug Hydrogen Model aircraft Cannon Reading spark plugs for racing Anti-aircraft warfare M16 (rifle) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Lechaina Escape from New York Iron Piccolo Junior Saga Codename: Kids Next Door Steel Robot Master Mattress Two-stroke cycle John F.
