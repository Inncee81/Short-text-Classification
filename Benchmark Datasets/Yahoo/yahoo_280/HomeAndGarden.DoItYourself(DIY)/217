what kind of paint or lacquer should one use if applying to the back of a guitar fretboard or neck actually to make the neck lighter i'll be sanding off the heavy and painted finish off of it and thought to help fretboard hand dexterity i should reapply a certain amount of clear lacquer well to make things simple laquer is laquer there are no differences otherwise it is not laquer use the brushable laquer laquer is needed on there otherwise it will absorb moisture from the air and warp the neck Fuse (electrical) Stage lighting Relay Split phase Oscilloscope Electrical wiring Lighting Circuit breaker Switch Thermostat Three-phase electric power X10 (industry standard) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Digital circuit High-voltage direct current Transformer Electrical generator Alternating current Volt Ethernet Residual-current device Electrical wiring (UK) Electricity meter Burglar alarm National Electrical Code (US) Tesla coil Diode Potentiometer Logic gate Ground and neutral Spark plug George Westinghouse Circuit design Gas metal arc welding Christmas lights Telephone tapping Transistor Spark gap Distribution board Antenna (radio) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Incandescent light bulb Electrical network Voltmeter Light switch Loudspeaker Electricity distribution Solar cell Autonomous building Overhead lines Hall effect Resistor Vacuum tube Electrician Battery (electricity) Impedance matching Street light Electricity Operational amplifier Electrical element TGV Power line communication Electric power transmission Impedance Enigma machine Dimmer Digital Overhead powerline Direct current Ring circuit RLC circuit BS 1363 Particle accelerator Ground (electricity) Electrophysiology Electricity pylon Rail terminology Series and parallel circuits Electric motor Current (electricity) Fluorescent lamp Lightning rod Lightning Telegraphy Transmitter Ohm's law Voice over IP Fencing Maxwell's equations Light pollution Inductor Mercury-vapor lamp Solar power Bombe Universal Serial Bus Light-emitting diode
