would a garden material make a good cover for my ft pool to make it warmer it is in the sun all morning i have ft of black ft wide gardening material the kind that lets in rain used to keep weeds out of your bush areas that i want to stitch into a cover for my small ft pool this is not black plastic but it is the new black material that absorbs water should the cover sit on the water surface or stretch across the top for the most effectiveness this material is not designed to be used in direct sunlight it is supposed to be used under mulch a better possibility would be black plastic or a black tarp that you tie down on the sides there are black mesh tarps available that have holes stitched around the sides that would allow water through and you could use bungee cords to hold the tarp tight i would say stretch tight so that the material doesn't sit in the water Knife Woodworking Paint Genericized trademark Screw Brush Bong Textile manufacturing Drill bit Fire fighting Pottery Gramophone record Wood carving Poker jargon Combine (Half-Life 2) Sento Toilet paper Professional wrestling match types Floppy disk Leather Fecal incontinence Punch card Stairway Woodturning Fan (implement) Plane (tool) Tofu Carburetor Punt (boat) Christmas tree Drawing Roller hockey M16 (rifle) Ammunition Climbing equipment Mouse (computing) Lighting Rococo Chair Lawn mower Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ultraviolet Agar plate Collecting fossils First aid kit Electrical wiring Glossary of wildland fire terms Glass Glossary of climbing terms Cruising (maritime) Vermicompost Painter and decorator Apollo Command/Service Module Marine aquarium Softball Curling Welding Lathe Enlarger Handloading Wood router Hydroponics Strap-on dildo Goaltender Violin Manicure Menstrual cup Sundial Ice cream Dundas Square Movie projector Drywall Drill Professional wrestling throws De Lorean DMC-12 Motor oil Hamster Casting Motorcycle helmet __atalh__y__k Tool Squash (sport) Fancy rat Bulk vending Guinness Totem pole
