soundproofiing i have a room in the basement i want to put drums in and it has concrete walls i need to know how to soundproof them and the ceiling its a small room with small window and i need to do it cheap i need it so my parents wont here right above me the only way to properly create a sound isolated room studio is creating a room within a room sound waves travel through matter and travel best through dense materials so what you want to do is minimise the contact the of the inner shell with the rest of the house drums are the hardest because low frequencies travel furthest through dense material so what you need to do is build a timber structure that is freestanding inside that room have as little connections to the walls and ceilings as possible it would be too much of a hastle to raise the floor so maybe just put that aside another thing is that you can install accousitic insulation accoustic woll in the cavity that will exist between the inner room and the original room walls its very important to have you doors seal as tightly as possible you want to try to make the room as air tight and disconected from the structure of the house as possible to minimise sound waves from taveling out of your studio if the room door opens inwards have it made to open out then when you build your inner structure have its own door open inwards its very important to have two good doors as exits and vents are the most vulnerable points where sound will escape with sound isolation what you pay for is what you get trying to save a bit on it will just not do it the tiniest detail can affect it and it would be pointless a few things to take into consideration would be the internal accousitcs of the room if you can afford installing accoustic panels on the walls it would dramatically improve your studios accoustics especially if you would be recording or jamming in there if you wanna save a bit you can just have the walls carpeted or hang wooden frames with stretched fabric on them like an artists canvas that will improve the accoustics of your room it would also be best if you can seal the window or block it with particle board Wood Light-frame construction Drill bit Seismic retrofit Poker jargon Screw Welding Stud poker Lumber Textile manufacturing Rigging Timber framing Equine conformation Straw-bale construction Building material Sail-plan Bass guitar Katana Ship Plane (tool) Archery Upholstery Platform framing Floppy disk Panama Canal Passenger car Betting (poker) Dinghy Golf Violin Imperial stormtrooper CPU cache Log cabin Glossary of climbing terms English longbow Stave church Earring Cheating in poker Artillery Bolted joint Zuiderzee Works Bicycle frame Saw Piano Tally sticks Campfire Masonry Einstein-Cartan theory Movie projector Appalachian Mountains Tank landing ship Extreme Programming Casting Optical fiber Rise of Nations Age of Empires Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Universal Century Technology Type VII U-boat Flax Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Rope Construction Nicomachean Ethics Interstate Highway Double bass Rail terminology Atrial septal defect Knot GunBound Mouse (computing) HMS Ramillies (07) Sword Hadrian's Wall Democratic Party (United States) Liberal Party (UK) Sawmill Stairway Woodworking Passive solar Architecture of the California missions RuneScape quests Chopsticks Glossary of nautical terms Geology of the Appalachians Diamond Draw poker Babylonian law Money Radio controlled airplane Hebrew calendar Economic history of Canada Bassoon Wood carving Morse Code Glossary of American football Solar power Carbon nanotube Homebuilt aircraft Age of Mythology
