do ac units blow at the temp set on the thermostat i am trying to understand how to operate my thermostat i am being told that depending on what i have the temperature set at the ac unit will blow at a temp that is more or less cool i am not in agreeance with this what i have always understood was the ac unit blows at one cool temp and if the fan is set on auto the thermostat will shut the ac off once the room reaches the temp you have set it to if the fan is set on on the ac will blow nonstop regardless of what the temp is set to am i mistaken or can i stuff a sock in my advisors mouth ill try to make it as clear as possible lets look at the components of an ac system the compressor which cycles the coolant through the coils it is either on or off the thermostat switch is a temperature sensing switch it turns the compressor on when the return the air coming back into the ac temeperature rises above the set temperature the fan control switch which controls the speed of the blower fan now lets look at how they all work together lets say you have the thermostat set to degrees c f the compressor will keep running until the room temperature reaches c once the set temperature is reached the compressor will shut down until the temperature goes over c again thats why the noise of an ac changes now about the fan setting normally there are fan settings hi mid low and auto the manual settings hi mid low stay the same once you set them they dont get affected by the temperature and just keep blowing at the set speed the auto setting runs in conjunction with the thermostat if the room temperature is much higher than the set temperature the fan will run at a higher speed once the temperature drops to the desired temperature the fan speed will drop to lower speeds to reduce noise and electrical consumption i hope i made sense if you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact me Seismic retrofit Guitar Light-frame construction Drill bit Transformer Soundproofing Deck (ship) Glass Laminal consonant Stairway Timber framing Mattress Wood Sound Drywall Straw-bale construction Acoustic guitar Squash (sport) Dishwasher Parquetry Acoustics Equine conformation Casting Nuclear weapon design Piano Cello Tide Nuclear magnetic resonance Violin Gramophone record Wind turbine Volleyball Spark plug Helicopter Solar cell Space elevator Radar Sun Atherosclerosis Welding Asbestos The Parting of the Ways Door Optical fiber Radar cross section Wind power Insulation Plywood Brewery Suppressor Resonance TV-FM DX Fire fighting Fan (implement) Supersonic transport Antenna (radio) Diode Stuttering Bass guitar Explosive material Carburetor Cosmic Era technology Saxophone Naval mine Gas metal arc welding Tank Wood carving Helium Air-raid shelter Jet engine Sound effect Thermal power station Plastic Subtractive synthesis Electronic filter Laser Digital-to-analog converter Electric guitar Ionosphere Microphone Sewage treatment Solar power TGV Equal-loudness contour Vacuum Magnet Big band Carpet Lighting King Khalid International Airport Particle accelerator Upholstery Phase (matter) Golf club (equipment) Quantum mechanics Audio system measurements Vacuum tube
