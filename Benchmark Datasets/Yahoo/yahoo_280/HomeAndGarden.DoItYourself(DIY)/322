hard wood installation problem i was watching a friend of mine who was doing hard wood installation for the first time he used hydrolic nailer with a noisy compressor for each plank he was nailing special nails into the groove of the plank but when trying to insert the next raw we noticed small gaps even if you hit them with the hammer the gap want go away the cause was that the nails inside the groove in first row where not fully flushed with the surface by using a big nail and hammer we manually pushed those nails inside the groove after that the gap disapeared and with little effort the second plank was fitting perfectly so where did we do the mistake why the nailer didnt insert the nail deep enough thanks for answers there is a depth adjustment on the air nailer hard to tell you where to look without knowing which model or even a brand of the gun but most have an adjustment usually takes a hex key or torx key to make the adjustment also if the compressor is not producing enough air volume the hose is too small or there is a leak in the air system you can have the same problem Paint Glaze Manicure Casting Stucco Galvanization Mirror Coat of arms Sandpaper Painting Solar cell Vitreous enamel Tempera Primer (paint) Paper marbling Shroud of Turin Panel painting Light-emitting diode Pottery Heraldry Circuit design Acrylic paint Glass Epoxy Abstraction Deck (ship) Plastic Wok Table tennis Friction Optical coating Wallpaper Superconductivity Caracas Seed Szlachta Lacquer Impressionism Gesso Diving suit Corrosion Printed circuit board Gabriel's Horn Capillary electrophoresis Cosmic Era technology Cosmetics Coat of Arms of Canada Oil painting Photographic paper Ultraviolet 2D computer graphics White phosphorus incendiary Teutonic Knights Capacitor Stealth technology Airsoft Flag of Denmark Anti-reflective coating Brazing Aluminium A Tale of a Tub Art gallery Fashion Pavement (material) Unseen University Molybdenum disulfide Pompeii Flood geology Fluorescent lamp American Paint Horse Papal Tiara Coat of Arms of Slovakia Single bullet theory Cadency Powder metallurgy Fur Bonampak Coat (clothing) Thermal printer Varnish Fruit Art Cave painting Fuel injection Masonry Geology Metal leaf Technicolor Graphics Upholstery SS Morro Castle Lane Extreme Programming Production I.G.
