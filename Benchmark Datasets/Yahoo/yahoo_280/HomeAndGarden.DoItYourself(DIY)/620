we are pretty sure we are going to put laminate tile in our bathrooms however my wife has some reservations the reason we are not going to go with regular tile is time we have a year old and a newborn at home so i don't know when i am going to find the time to do it so i don't have a problem with the laminate tile however my wife is concerned about water we have had water damage under laminate in the past and it buckles but that isn't our concern in a bathroom i don't know how water would get underneath her concern is abotu water from the bathtub and shower what happens to that water that gets on top of the tile does it eventually soak down under and cause problems or is their a sealant i can put down to make sure this can't happen i know this stuff is waterproof but i want to cover all basis thanks your wife's concerns are valid and right on target and are the reason i don't recommend laminate in a full bath there really isn't a way to seal the laminate seams and topical moisture will penetrate and cause the boards to either cup or buckle laminate is not waterproof you can lightly mop it but it cannot handle excessive moisture not only that laminate is a floating floor when you reset your toilet and bolt it to the floor the floor is no longer floating properly because it's bolted down in that area this can make the floor buckle as well i would recommend either sheet vinyl or solid vinyl tiles both have come a long way in styling since they first cam out if you use the solid vinyl tiles i would recommend the ones without the peel and stick back moisture will eventually make those come off the floor Seismic retrofit Drywall Timber framing Drill bit Masonry Light-frame construction Poker jargon Wall Screw McMansion Insulation Alhambra Platform framing Iranian architecture Stucco Stairway Architecture of the California missions Straw-bale construction Capernaum Kitchen Christiansborg Palace Stud poker Le Corbusier Toronto-Dominion Centre Seven-card stud Siding Sicilian Baroque Radiometric dating Tudorbethan architecture Passenger car Wrigley Field Adobe Door Badshahi Masjid Wood Age of the Earth Arlington House Wall Street Belair Stud Vault Draw (poker) Maya civilization Assonet, Massachusetts Natural building Furnace Kremlin towers Five-card stud Moorgate Capitoline Museums and Piazza del Campidoglio Mission Revival Style architecture Irish Houses of Parliament Wood County, Ohio Social rule Sundial Amalienborg Palace Rococo Angkor Wat Sears Catalog Home Plame affair Texas hold 'em Hoo Peninsula Domus Aurea Navigation Baby Blues Royal Mile Sod Tire Mouse (computing) Stanford University Community card poker The Shining (film) The Wall Great Brickhill Mac OS X Witch-hunt Finders Keepers Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Earring Rathfarnham White House Diamond simulant 10 Things I Hate About You Pevensey Computer virus Casting Violin Rail transport modelling Passive solar Rigging Massachusetts State House Richard Cassels Braeswood Place Collision detection Lighting Avionics Stave church Portsmouth Block Mills Warren Buffett Miyamoto Musashi Stan Ridgway
