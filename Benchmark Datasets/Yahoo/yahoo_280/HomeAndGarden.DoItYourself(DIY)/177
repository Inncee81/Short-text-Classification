refinishing built in cabinet so i've been sanding a big built in cabinet basically like a dining room hutch that used to be in our kitchen it's so old it has the flour and sugar bins built in our house was built in my question is if i want to stain it again do i have to sand it down to pristine wood or can i simply remove the top layers of the old stain right now there is a shade difference between areas that have been sanded with a power sander and the areas i have had to do by hand we plan on staining it really dark so i'm wondering if it will take and if there will be a huge color difference if i don't have it all matching before we start staining i don't mind if it ends up having some character but i don't want it to look horrible any advice would be welcome oh and the areas i have done by hand feel like wood now but its the color difference i was wondering about no you don't have to take it down to bare wood and yes it will give the piece added character as long as you've removed any varnish or wax that would block the stain stain away if you need to even up the tone simply leave the stain on longer in those areas especially in a functional piece like you've described i think an old piece of furniture cabintery should look old be proud of that time worn patina Porosity Bathing Dialysis Diode Pottery Textile manufacturing Bong The Inside Top-bar hive Casting Knife Soil pH Sento Otitis externa Dishwasher Drill bit Fecal incontinence Poker jargon Upholstery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Second Battle of the Atlantic Asbestos Alum Motor oil USS Wasp (CV-7) Tobacco Sauna Internal ballistics Neutrino Sin City Betting (poker) Tooth Australian constitutional law Floppy disk Climbing equipment Hemp Chair Sewage treatment Domestic water system Hard water Dishwashing Shotgun Sodium hypochlorite Carbon dioxide Soap Professional wrestling throws Mattress Firearm Water (molecule) Gold mining Big Brother (USA TV series) Magic (illusion) Gramophone record Mineral County, West Virginia Handloading Nudity Ultramarine USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Strap-on dildo M60 machine gun Shoe Smoking pipe Changeroom First aid Water purification Gilding Limestone Headgear Intravenous therapy Jackass: The Movie Solar system Stucco Tuff Siegfried Line Grog Ethidium bromide Air pollution Flue gas desulfurization Tiberium Mesothelioma Tooth enamel Citric acid Psycho Hydroponics M16 (rifle) Vinegar Theory of conduct Computer virus Columbine High School massacre Psychiatric hospital Sugar beet Hard disk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling match types Asset Team Fortress Classic Caving Futurama (TV series - season 3)
