is it fairly easy to convert sliding glass doors to french doors i have a sliding glass door leading to my deck and would really like to convert it to french doors is this easy and inexpensive other than the cost of the new door if you have ever installed a single door window it's pretty much the same except a bigger hole sliding glass doors are about the same size as a french door units i would take off the inside molding and measure the rough opening the frame construction the door is mounted in and take it to where you plan to buy the new door and they can match up a door for the project after that you may need to shim and level for square and ease of operation but with one other person to help with the lifting not a hard project just to add these doors either or are usually held in with screws on the side under the side usually under a molding not sure how much experience you have before replacing inside molding on the new door be sure to insulate for weather with either a non expandable foam or fiberglass Drill bit Seismic retrofit Mosaic Masonry Tile Sento Plaster Menstrual cup Kitchen Asbestos Thermal power station Architecture of the California missions Tessellation Basement Upholstery Concrete Casting Japanese toilet Mattress Roof Textile manufacturing Drainage Electrical wiring Toilet paper Spark plug Dam Brewery Domestic water system Wood Antioch, Pisidia Stucco Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Lighting Sauna Urinary incontinence Hard disk Violin Sewage treatment Fiberglass Diving suit Radio controlled airplane Carburetor Hamster Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Oscilloscope Textile manufacturing terminology Glass Dundas Square Home repair St Albans Cathedral Bong M16 (rifle) Equine conformation Gas metal arc welding Perl STS-114 Condom Combine (Half-Life 2) Carpet McMansion Woodworking RISC Tent Toxic mold Gypsum Printed circuit board Water Propeller Wildfire Stan Ridgway Mortar (weapon) London Underground Wallpaper group Fire extinguisher Iowa class battleship Wire Stonehenge Straw-bale construction Taikyoku shogi Artillery Windsurfing Ra (board game) Towel Desert Urinal Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February
