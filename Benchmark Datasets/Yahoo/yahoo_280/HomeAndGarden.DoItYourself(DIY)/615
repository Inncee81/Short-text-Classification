how do i fix a worn magnetic strip on a credit card the magnetic strip on my most often used credit card wears out quickly i am in europe right now and getting a replacement card from the us takes time is there a quick and simple way to fix the magnetic strip i have seen cashiers wrap thin plastic around the card and swipe it that way which has led me to believe that applying a strip of scotch tape should do the same thing or is there a better solution short of getting a new card i worked as a cashier for about years we weren't allowed to accept strange looking credit cards putting tape on it would not have been accepted by our store the plastic bag works when it wants to pretty much you have to call the company of the card but you should get a small envelope for credit cards they usually lose their ability to work cause they rub against other cards or things in your wallet putting it in a small envelope that is made for them is the best bet it's only regular paper you could make one yourself sometimes the banks have them but you have to ask for them Knife Violin Label Screw Snooker Seismic retrofit Drill bit Billiards Timpani Bulldozer NWo Manicure RuneScape quests Scrapbooking Nail (anatomy) Upholstery Car handling Tire Fencing Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling Pottery Textile manufacturing Suture Bulk vending Table tennis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Toilet paper Helicopter Genericized trademark Saw Batting (cricket) Double bass GunBound Terminal ballistics Powerbomb Woodworking The Inside Gramophone record Duct tape Chopsticks Bowie knife Sailing Razor Professional wrestling holds Printed circuit board Chess strategy and tactics Katana Mail Professional wrestling throws The Shining (film) Fan (implement) Volleyball Postage stamp Scissors Shogi Shroud of Turin Textile manufacturing terminology Wind turbine Electrophysiology Autogyro Postage stamp separation Boat building Punch card Kenny McCormick Softball Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Reversi Coin flipping In-N-Out Burger Shaving Cello Drag racing Mattress Professional wrestling attacks Knitting Guitar Paper size Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Champagne (beverage) AC/DC OV-10 Bronco Epoxy Domain Name System Kylie Minogue Sword making Harp Magical objects in Harry Potter Intelligent design Glossary of climbing terms Timeline of alternative rock Friction Glossary of American football Movie projector Tenshinhan Radio controlled airplane Casting
