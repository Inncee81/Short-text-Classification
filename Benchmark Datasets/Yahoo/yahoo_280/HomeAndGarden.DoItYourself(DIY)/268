how to paint a high ceiling in a stairwell the basement stairs to the house has a really high ceiling and it's painted a horrid shade of dirty pink even with an extension on a roller i cannot reach it and how would i even get into the corners my tallest ladder is not tall enough and it's scary to contemplate trying to lean the ladder against the back wall setting on one of the steps how do painters reach a really high ceiling when directly below it are steps leading down help how do painters do it they have longer poles than you they have taller ladders they have configurable ladders that can be used to create platforms where one leg is shorter than the other to accommodate the stairs go to the home depot and take a look at configurable ladders they aren't cheap at about but they do let you create nice scaffolding on the stairs from there you can use a shorter pole or get a longer ladder keep in mind that the safest thing you can do is have the bottom of the ladder pushed up against a stair or the wall many people don't trust a ladder on stairs but if it's wedged into the stair it's not going anywhere i have the same situation and when i'm ready to paint this part of my house i might pop for a pro paint what you can yourself and spend the money on a few specific jobs where you simply cannot do it Kitchen Refrigerator Frankfurt kitchen IPod Knife Drill bit Israel's unilateral disengagement plan De Lorean DMC-12 Gas metal arc welding Internet Welding Mattress Dishwasher Solar cell Viva La Bam Dairy Best Buy Electrical wiring World Wide Web Battery (electricity) Cookware and bakeware Bad Wolf Panzer I Passenger car Steel Wire Krag-J__rgensen De Lorean Motor Company Xbox 360 RuneScape quests Japanese toilet Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 3 Uniform Resource Locator Hydrogen economy Nintendo Apollo Command/Service Module R46 (New York City Subway car) Yacht Toyota Camry Brewery Cathedral of Learning Oplan Bojinka HyperText Transfer Protocol Mutual fund Transformation problem Naval mine XML Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Stainless steel Microeconomics Elevator Pioneer Zephyr Thermal power station Tire Suspension bridge Titanium Experiment Home Box Office Berkshire Hathaway RISC Externality Barbed wire Piano Nintendo 64 Common Agricultural Policy EMD F3 Lionel Corporation Baldness BS 1363 Common Unix Printing System Harp Electrophysiology Vacuum Web crawler The Brady Bunch Supply and demand Economics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Enron Corporation Columbine High School massacre Tao Te Ching Geodesic dome Baroque chess View camera Electronic commerce Poker jargon Rigging Hell's Kitchen (television) Ethernet Porsche 911 Audiophile Dundas Square Telegraphy Stock Spark plug M16 (rifle) Transformer
