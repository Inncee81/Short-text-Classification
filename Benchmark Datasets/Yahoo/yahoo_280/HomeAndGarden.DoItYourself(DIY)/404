repaneling walls ok i live in a trailer and it has this horrible dark wood panneling for walls we are looking to repanel is it something someone can do themselves with out professional help is it relitively easy i've looked on the diy websites and i have been unable to find an articles explaining the process i've lived in mobiles and am in one currently i've remodeled every one i've just re paneled my living room with bead board and i'm pretty satisfied the usual situation is in fact that paneling or even cheap inch drywall is ft wide hence the need for studs to be on or near inch centers the problem might likely arie in that the perimeter of the mobile is paneled or dry walled before interior walls are installed hence occasionally creating a situation where you might have a ft room a inch thick wall and the next stud will be approximately ft into the adjacent room in your case and for ease of achieving what you want i suggest you pull any molding be it cove base or window door trim and check for concave or convex of the current wall material if it all seems flush i'd panel over what you'll lose in floor space will equal less than inch probably will suit your desire for whatever you choose and give you an additional sub surface to tack into i'd also get an air compressor and brad staple gun to do the job narrow crown staples are what was and is used often anyway and they do an adequate job you could if you wish use contactor adhesive such as liquid nails as well as the stapling but it's not strictly neccesary the issues will only be in ripping the paneling at corners perhaps where equal multiples of ft aren't the case and measuring from floor to ceiling as some mobile ceilings are slightly less than the ft length of a piece of paneling if you have a cathedral type ceiling you'll have to adjust for that with waste or purchase extra sheets steven wolf Hazing Diamond Dude, Where's My Ranch?
