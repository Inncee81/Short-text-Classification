what should i use on my concrete driverway to reduce it's angle hi i live in a caulasake my driveway slops downward made of concrete when one backsout of the driveway and when one has a small car like a kia rio for example the car actually bottoms out we have to turn the wheels at the last second to prevent this so i thought i would use something like quick crete to smooth out that dropoff at the beginning of the driveway would quickcrete do it or would the snow rain rip it apart what would work best how would you solve this problem o my dont listen to that one guy that is really messed up what you need to do is talk with someone that does asphalt they might be able to pave the end of your driveway so you dont have as much of a slope or you can have a construction company come in and remove the last ' or so of your drive way and repour it on a reduced slope Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring (UK) BS 1363 Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jack plug Universal Serial Bus D-subminiature Incandescent light bulb Residual-current device Ethernet Electrician Transformer Fluorescent lamp Oscilloscope Resistor Three-phase electric power Impedance matching Dimmer TRS connector Circuit design Relay Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DIN connector Lineman (occupation) Extension Cord Power strip XLR connector RCA connector Antenna (radio) Electricity meter Series and parallel circuits Christmas lights Thermostat Switch Battery electric vehicle Gender of connectors and fasteners Electrical wiring Split phase National Electrical Code (US) Lighting Welding Advanced Technology Attachment Impedance Microphone Gas metal arc welding Coaxial cable Overhead lines High-voltage direct current Stage lighting RS-232 Mains electricity DVD Canon T90 Mattress Decibel Conductor (material) Electrophysiology PC motherboard Ring circuit Solar cell Direct current Ribbon cable Maxwell's equations Seismic retrofit SCSI Electrical element IPod Light switch Digital circuit Operational amplifier Knife Vacuum tube Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Serial ATA ATX Electrical generator Power cord Gender Volt Light-emitting diode Capacitor Light rail Lighter Ground (electricity) Wire wrap Lawn mower Electric motor Registered jack Alternating current Electricity AppleTalk Wrench Screw Apollo Guidance Computer Rapid transit Electrical resistance Commodore 64 Time-domain reflectometer
