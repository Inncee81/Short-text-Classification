why doesnt my toilet flush all the way my toilet wont flush right even if you try to flush it with nothing in it it wont flush you have to plunge it a couple times and then it will go down why take the lid off the toilet and look inside most toilets have a chain plastic or metal that is attached to the flushing handle on end and to the flapper on the other end there shouldn't be much slack but it shouldn't be taut either make sure that the flapper itself is all the way down so that water can fill up in the tank with the tank lid still off flush the toilet and watch for the flush handle actually pulls the chain and flapper up far enough to let most of the water out of the tank and into the bowl see if anything is stuck where the flapper hole is never use those chlorine bleach tabs or any other kind in the tank look at the mechanism that lets water fill up the tank it should function smoothly and stop filling the tank before the water reaches the tube in the center called the overflow or flush valve the filled tank's water level should be about an inch below the top of that overflow tube if none of that seems to help then consider this probably of the reasons a toilet won't flush when the 'guts' inside are otherwise working normally is something got flushed that won't go out the bottom of the toilet q tips are a common cause as are pampers tennis balls little plastic juice bottles tampons big wads of toilet sanitary napkins etc etc etc buy borrow or rent a closet auger a kind of snake made specifically for toilets also i've found that pouring a wastebasket or or of hot water into the toilet letting the water recede in between basketsful if you don't feel comfortable doing plumbing yourself hire a licensed plumber or handyman to do it for you and look at anywhere from to depending on parts material labor time etc Drill bit Screw Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic water system Thermal power station Spark plug Hydraulic machinery Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hard disk Floppy disk Mach kernel Shotgun Textile manufacturing Solar power Pipe organ Universal Serial Bus Equine conformation Cartridge (firearms) Seismic retrofit Brassiere Sento Japanese toilet Wrench Timpani Flush toilet Plumbing fixture Trombone Chevrolet Corvair engine Electrical wiring Bicycle frame Drill bit sizes Paper size Tire Dundas Square Irrigation Whip Pachypodium bicolor Headset (bicycle part) Central heating Kitchen Marching percussion Nintendo GameCube Supply and demand Bristol Grammar School Best Buy BS 1363 Mark I (tank) Glossary of partner dance terms Hydropower Screw thread Laptop Stairway Eyepiece Machine tapers Rigging Caliper Handloading Apollo Command/Service Module Golf club (equipment) Gong Terminal ballistics IBM PC compatible Kammerlader Firearm Bong Earring Scale model Mattress Strap-on dildo Coaxial cable Caliber Billiards Stage lighting Roller hockey Pachypodium ambongense Mossberg 500 Movie projector Weapon Toilet paper Rail terminology Human penis size Prisons in the United States Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Internal ballistics Gramophone record Digital photography Guitar Basement Uilleann pipes Perl Wind power Torpedo Wood Audio tape length and thickness Anemometer RISC Solar system Anchor USB flash drive
