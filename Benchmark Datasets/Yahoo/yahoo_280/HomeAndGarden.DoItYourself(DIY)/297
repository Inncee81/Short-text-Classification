i have an ' diameter circular inflatable pool ' deep how much bleach should i add to disinfect it south florida is under water restrictions so emptying and refilling it ever other day is not an option i have a small pump and ran it for hours yesterday but have heard that i should add bleach i just don't know how much based on the measurements you gave you pool is about gallons to increase the chlorine by ppm part per million you need about ounces of standard bleach a normal pool should have between ppm of chlorine since you probably don't have any stabilizer you should add this amount daily preferably in the evening since the sun destroys the chlorine if you wanted to add stablizer about ounces of cyanuric acid will do it but then you would probably want to test the water before you add more bleach as the stabilzer will prevent it from breaking down and you could build up the chlorine level over time Seismic retrofit Construction Truss Timber framing Collapse of the World Trade Center Truss bridge Screw Brooklyn Bridge Air-raid shelter San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Stave church King Khalid International Airport Light-frame construction Roof Bridge World Trade Center Geodesic dome Fuselage Structural analysis McMansion Guitar Arch bridge Wayne Corporation Electricity pylon Covered bridge Deck (ship) Architect CPU cache Enzyme Log cabin C plus plus Buckingham Palace Suspension bridge Space frame Cantilever Homebuilt aircraft STS-62 BASIC programming language House Radio controlled airplane STS-97 RISC HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building Queen Anne Style architecture Strap-on dildo Wood carving Piano Floppy disk Constructed world Straw-bale construction Explosive material Monocoque Retailer Buckminster Fuller Building Junk (ship) Compiler optimization Platform framing Kitchen Virus Railroad car Hawaiian architecture Loudspeaker Architecture of the California missions Central processing unit Elevator Natural building Computer Traditional animation Variable Internal ballistics Virtual memory Tacoma Narrows Bridge Mechanical floor Magnet Crane (machine) Altair 8800 Freedom Tower CPU design Cheyenne Mountain Addressing mode Outpost 2 Integrated circuit Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge Canadian National Exhibition Digital circuit Technology in the Stargate universe Class (computer science) Glossary of climbing terms Mathematics STS-92 General Motors Electro-Motive Division USB flash drive Passenger car Guild Le Corbusier Digital camera St Pancras railway station Apostrophe (mark)
