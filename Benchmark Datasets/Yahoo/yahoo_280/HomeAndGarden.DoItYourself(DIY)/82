painting furniture as i was not smart enough to do some research before painting a cabinet i used a brush and small sponge roller however i now have blots unwanted droplets and thick runs on corners and other places is there a safe way to get rid of these and keeping the cabinet still looking good you are going to have to sand off your runs drips and errors to get a smooth finish use a fine grit sandpaper i actually prefer the sanding pads you can get at the home improvement centers as they are easier on the hands a lot of furniture can be spray painted with less effort than rolling or brushing and i often find i get a better finish once you sand off the runs use a tack cloth to clean off the dust and paint it again Beanie Baby Textile manufacturing Window Upholstery Window blind Traditional animation Carpet Leather Drill bit History of Microsoft Windows Pottery Apple Macintosh Bish__jo game GIF The Brady Bunch PostScript Super Nintendo Entertainment System Comanche Textile manufacturing terminology Sound Blaster Dice Nail (engineering) Unusual types of gramophone record OS-tan Modem Colours, standards and guidons IBM PC compatible Windows 2000 Perl IPod School bus Brush Mac OS X Garfield Wood carving Windows XP Architecture of the California missions Computer virus Humphrey Bogart Undergarment McMansion Heraldry Tire Apple Computer Japanese tea ceremony Thermal power station DiC Entertainment Sewing machine Commodore 64 Logo programming language Chatsworth House My Little Pony Color blindness Trail blazing Art Azumanga Daioh RISC Sesame Street Roller chain Lisp programming language Tokusatsu Glossary of firefighting equipment Shawn Michaels Suspension bridge Dodge Charger Strap-on dildo White House Gothic Lolita Anchor NeXT Glass Kilt Compiler optimization Doom 3 Baby transport BMW Z1 Leica Stuffed animal Superliner (railcar) House Table saw B3ta Amiga W.
