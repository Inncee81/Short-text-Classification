help how do i fix a wire that broke off from my outlet my water cooler was putting out room temp water so i put my tester in the outlet and it didn't light up i shut off the power removed the receptacle and about inches of the black wire was just laying there connected only to the outlet i gave a tug at where it broke off and it wouldn't budge so there is no slack to use i know i have to cut into my drywall and the box is broken on the bottom screw hole so i will need to replace it but how do i deal with the problem of not having enough wire could there be more slack outside of my outlet box perhaps if you're cutting into your drywall just remove the existing box and put a new box in inches higher that's if the wire comes in from above either way inches lower if it comes from below then you can joint a piece of romex to the existing wire and run it to the original box location and just put a single gang blank on it to cover it up if you take a hacksaw blade next to the existing box and work at the nails holding it to the stud you should be able to get the box loose wihout cutting drywall if it comes from way up high try to get the staples loose good luck and put a receptacle up high then mount a flat screen panel tv up there to cover it up ideally if you could get to th point of origin from that wire you could remove it all and then re run it but i'm sure that's not really gonna be so great but i think that if you've already decided to cut and patch drwall just put a new one in a little higher or lower however much you need to get the wire in the box and on the receptacle code does say at least inches from the point of enterance good luck to ya Pottery Casting Sandpaper Brewery Brazing Woodworking Leather Upholstery Drill bit Diving suit Gilding Martini cocktail Manicure Brush Friction Violin Bong Solar cell Knife Dry cleaning Wok Sewage treatment Stucco Hemp Plastic Sea-Monkey Nuclear fallout Carbon dioxide Tofu Wine Glacier Paint Printed circuit board Drawing Collodion process Printmaking Sand casting Shroud of Turin Ice resurfacer Car washing techniques Fire extinguisher Dog E85 Repouss__ and chasing Laser engraving Wine making Tar sands Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Soldering Eraser Bread Cosmic Era technology Typewriter Dairy Ink Sand art and play Synthetic diamond Shotgun Water purification Radio controlled car Towel Building material Gristmill Photography Risotto Flour Wood finishing Crucible Glass Bulk vending Glossary of wildland fire terms Eolian Specular highlight Hamster Motor oil Hay Wood Desert Dog agility Vitreous enamel Compact disc Soap Thermal power station Halitosis Vacuum cleaner Mattress Mahangu Textile manufacturing terminology Amateur telescope making Primer (paint) Ice cream Fecal incontinence Wildfire Radio controlled airplane Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Stalag Luft III Collecting fossils Heinkel He 100 Shampoo
