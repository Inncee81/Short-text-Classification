best bathroom spackle and primer i am getting ready to paint the bathroom it is an older house without vent fan but nice window to allow for moisture to escape here is the issue the old paint appears to be peeling on at least of the wall surface also the old fish border applied by prior owner that i am removing is soft and peeling like skin it is not dry flaky peel but rather moist sticky peeling underneath appears to be a combination of spackle and this brown sheet rock of sorts anybody know what this brown stuff could be it is very smooth i am looking to find a top quality spackle and primer that is guaranteed to adhere to the surface without this future mass peeling if you will i am willing to spend the extra to make sure i don't have to repaint next year i have spackled in the past only to have paint not really stick well any thoughts would be greatly appreciated after a bit more research and due to the age of the home i am guessing that this is called brown coat the layer of plaster between the first and last coats of plaster it is definitely not drywall and definitely not paper coated anything i am aware of kilz but based on past experience i am not certain that it is the best available and now since i am thinking that this is brown coat do i need a more specialized product to seal it or what also if i decided to tile that area what would be needed over the brown coat i guess these questions would be well directed to a plaster person who has worked with the old lath and plaster applications thanks ah good old horsehair plaster it is a pain in the butt to play with i will run a few suggestions by you to hopefully help you out if you are going to tile over there are a few things you should know putting tile over old plaster is a no no small impacts to old plaster could sent your new tile to the landfill in a hurry the best way to cure that happening is to install a cement backer board they sell this at local building supply stores it gets installed using around inch sheetrock screws the only way to make this stuff look good is to rip it out or cover it up don't think twice about applying a or drywall over the top of the old plaster you will thank yourself for saving the headaches with cracks holes and the whole scraping and scaling paint issue i wouldnt be surprised if it wasn't lead paint seeing its got the old plaster hope this helps if you get more info please contact me i have been playing with stuff like this for about years also kilz sucks i always use zinsser primer it has complete stain control and coat seals about anything Drywall Masonry Sento Tile Basement Drill bit Dundas Square Wall Wallpaper Gypsum Construction Stan Ridgway Plaster Bridgwater Alhambra (board game) Seismic retrofit Sauna Sears Catalog Home Washroom MS-06 Zaku II USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Mahjong McMansion Changeroom Dymaxion house Carcassonne (board game) Customs and etiquette of Japan Alhambra Bathroom St Albans Cathedral Electrical wiring (UK) Ra (board game) Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Autonomous building Hammam Genericized trademark Hemel Hempstead Wallpaper group Bathing Building material Gay bathhouse Niddah Social rule Orde Charles Wingate Roof Stanford University Home repair Thermae Technicolor Toronto-Dominion Centre Scrabble Fort Dodge, Iowa Sydney Opera House Quarantine Mahjong tiles STS-114 Little Britain Meteor shower Architecture of the California missions Central heating Piccadilly Circus Great Wall of China Urolagnia Hydrotherapy Krzeszowice Japanese toilet Ice hotel Toxic mold Fan service The Apprentice 2 Adi Shankara Woodlands, Singapore Michael Bloomberg St. Petersburg High School Antioch, Pisidia Elfenland Al Green (musician) Manorialism Billboard (advertising) King Khalid International Airport Leicester City Centre PRINCE2 Screwdriver Dim sum Mortar (masonry) Boarding school W.I.T.C.H.
