can't unscrew my showerhead hi i want to change my showerhead but i can't for the life of me unscrew it i've tried with wrenches and it doesn't even budge i think i've even scraped up the side of the nut because it's too tight it looks like there is a white seal in the threads any advice on how to get this darn thing off thanks in advance you must be careful when doing this as you do not want to loosen the pipe joints behind the wall make sure you use one wrench to back up the the wrench you are using to twist off the shower head place the backup wrench on the pipe behind the head and apply pressure in a clockwise direction now with the wrench on the shower head turn the wrench in a counter clockwise direction if it will not loosen perhaps you need a longer wrench to get more leverage use a pipe wrench they tighten as you apply pressure hope it works for you Portland cement Mortar (masonry) Plaster Casting Stucco Pottery Incineration Calcium Calcium oxide Cement Explosive material Gypsum Masonry Ultramarine Steel Titanium Calcium hydroxide Aluminium Silicon Magnesium Metallurgy Glass Tofu Kiln Silicon dioxide Sand Calcium carbonate Iron Brick Alum Architecture of the California missions Welding Industrial process Sintering Mineral Sulfur Pozzolana Straw-bale construction Terrazzo Caliche Eifel Aqueduct Soil pH Weathering Fire extinguisher Quartzite Drywall Natural building Adobe Aluminium oxide Tile Coffee Plastic Ammonia Dam Hard water Reinforced concrete Corrosion Arch bridge Rust Drill bit Bauxite Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Aggregate (composite) Toothpaste Igneous rock Compost Building material Plutonium Mission San Juan Capistrano Diamond simulant Pavement (material) Diatomaceous earth Salt Turquoise Soap Alabaster Timeline of materials technology Bridge Fly ash Marble Shotcrete Limestone Gas tungsten arc welding Concretion Tungsten Pozzolanic ash Glossary of sculpting terms Water purification Cerium Coal Glaze Chromatography Blast furnace Shell (projectile) Tuff Sugar Thermite
