how easy is it to install a bathfan replacing two old bath fans with two new ones very small bathfan for a medium bath i know a little about electrical but not what wires are what do you just take off the old fan and put the wires into the new one will there be a designated place to put the wires and how many wires are there to dis connect thanks not all fans need to be installed from the attic i installed many without needing to go to attic only reason to go to attic would to maybe add additional supports assuming the new fan is same size as the old one there is wires that would be disconnected unless there is no ground which then would be hot black wire and the neutral white wire turn off the power remove the cover remove the fan housing look at the sides of fan there could be some screws remove these screws if you dont' see the screws you can either use a recipicater to remove them or go into attic and remove them manually for some reason they may be up there remove ducting and electrical conections attach ducting and elecrical connections white with white black with black there will be either a green screw or thin copper wire attach this to the bare copper wire if you have one depending on age of your house you may or may not have ground this is a whole nother question use wirenuts for its size and secure it by wrapping electrical tape clockwise around the wirenut and wire this will keep the cap from working its way loose also you may want to istall a grommet plastic that surrounds the metal hole so wires dont get frayed when installing the wire through the hole some fans have this built in some dont' install the new fan in hole flush it with the drywall secure it with screws follow rest of directions that should be supplied with fan Electrical wiring Electrophysiology Wire Wire wrap Brush Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Overhead lines Antenna (radio) Nail (engineering) Skateboarding trick Naval mine Staple (fastener) Drill bit Transformer Earthing system Coaxial cable Suspension bridge Category 5 cable Overhead powerline Cruising (maritime) Nine Inch Nails Screw Directed-energy weapon Team Fortress Classic Action potential Seismic retrofit BS 1363 CLAMP Guy-wire Ribbon cable Fuse (electrical) D-subminiature Electric power transmission Wall Machine gun Floyd Rose Professional wrestling match types Dipole antenna Financial services USS Turner Joy (DD-951) B-47 Stratojet Firearm Time Out of Mind Economy of Russia Rail terminology Solar power Gambling M60 machine gun Glossary of climbing terms Bolted joint Magnet American wire gauge TIA-568A/B Retaining wall Mad Money Anti-tank Bookbinding Barbed wire Cable television Diving suit Public transport Donald Neilson Radio masts and towers Railgun Energy development Ethernet Anchor Wardenclyffe Tower Memoir '44 Ra (board game) Power cable Agricultural fencing Microeconomics Transmission line Bond Asbestos Die (manufacturing) Telephone tapping Wireless access point Insulator Home Box Office MTV Tesco Archery Conductor (material) McMansion The Apprentice 3 Doom enemies History of radar Rigging Circuit design USA PATRIOT Act OV-10 Bronco Upholstery Bank SCO-Linux controversies Bread Yu-Gi-Oh!
