i have a leaky window in the front of my house the front window leaks when it rains really hard and i was wondering if anyone knew how i could fix it also i am not if it is only the window it does it every once in a while and the water comes out of the bottom of the base board the caulking around the window is probably dried out i would get some caulk and a caulk gun a simple tool not a real gun and run a bead of caulk where the window casing meets the house don't pay attention to mj your house is not going to burn down the reason i know it is not the roof is because all houses have an overhang so the roof leak would have to be a couple of feet back from the edge of the roof the window probably only leaks when the wind is blowing the rain against that side of the house you should try to fix it because the water inside the wall will wet the insulation if there is any and mold could form Geodesic dome Basement Glossary of nautical terms Window Straw-bale construction Seismic retrofit Soldering Passive solar Insulation Asbestos Thermal power station Air conditioning Architecture of the California missions Casting Plame affair Boat building Deck (ship) Autonomous building Shotgun house Diving suit Wood carving Campfire Tire Glossary of firefighting equipment Light-frame construction Vinyl roof Roof Home repair Fan (implement) Noah's Ark Electrical wiring Drill bit Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Lake District Glossary of climbing terms Fire fighting Door Glossary of firefighting terms Internal ballistics Spark plug Strap-on dildo Hamster Sento Windows XP Kitesurfing Syphon Filter Guns N' Roses Solar power Precipitation (meteorology) Wildfire Wrigley Field Molding (decorative) STS-114 Xanadu House Irrigation Natural building SS Morro Castle Timber framing Blood Simple USS Tunny (SS-282) Circuit design Glass Mud People Karl Rove Carnivorous plant Skateboarding trick Bicycle brake systems Collyer brothers Transformer Diving Jon Secada Car body style Rail terminology Volleyball Windsurfing Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Furnace Knife ITunes Naval mine Windows Vista The Empty Child Sin City Climbing equipment AmigaOS Microsoft Windows Mattress Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ice Escape from New York Stage lighting Naruto jutsu Fenway Park Supercell Anemometer Cruising (maritime) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hurricane Rita Rigging
