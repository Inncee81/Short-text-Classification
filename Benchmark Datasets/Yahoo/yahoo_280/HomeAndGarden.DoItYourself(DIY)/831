dryer and range cords the same cord two grounding cords we just inherited a very old electric dryer probably years old not really sure but still working well it had a three prong cord whereas our apartment has a prong outlet i did a little online research and found we could just change the cord i went and bought one and tried to plug it in and it looks like it should plug in but just barely doesn't fit then i noticed it said it was a range cord on the packaging i was under the impression they were the same cords also when i screwed in the three wires black white and red to the dryer there was the fourth wire green that i know is meant to be grounded the dryer had a green wire coming out of it that was grounded but that was not attached to the prong cord we removed does this make sense do i need to ground both green wires or can i unscrew the green one that is attached to the dryer please help since the stove cord is heavier gage it could be used for a dryer but the difference is that the ground on the dryer is a different shape as the stove one so you have to replace the cord or the receptacle its easier to just replace the cord the green wire on the cord is a safety ground and is supposed to be hooked to anything that connects to the case of the dryer including a ground wire hanging loose on the dryer none of these other guys even portray a nice blue hat like i do Knife Acetone Explosive material Silly Putty Plastic Bong Textile manufacturing Kitchen Dishwashing Hydrogen peroxide Baseball Stars Halitosis Agarose gel electrophoresis Organic peroxide Arcade cabinet Paint stripper Emergency preparedness The Shining (film) Dishwasher Tofu Chromatography World War Three (Doctor Who) Western blot Chemical-mechanical planarization Sushi Woodworking Airsoft Table saw Technology Theory of conduct Soldering Shaggy dog story Cruising (maritime) German grammar Teen Girl Squad Scar Mouse (computing) Jack the Ripper Beavis and Butt-head Glass Upholstery Bagel SDS-PAGE ALGOL 68 Striptease Hannibal Lecter Paul Is Dead Nitroglycerin Mach kernel Water purification Aerogel Macbeth Biodiesel Polyethylene terephthalate Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Phase (matter) Mac mini Gaia Online Menstrual cup Gram staining Radio controlled airplane Oakland Athletics Solvent Acetone peroxide Drill bit Ashton-Tate Staining (biology) YuYu Hakusho Stage lighting Duke Nukem 3D Common cold Comanche Sewage treatment Steely Dan Collecting fossils Catastrophic Florida Hurricanes: 1900-1960 Vacutainer Beatmania IIDX Violin Breast implant Seppuku Silicone Video game controversy Dustbin Tooth enamel RuneScape quests Speedloader Glass transition temperature Mathematician Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Taxi Driver RAF Bomber Command Dimethyl sulfoxide Kosher foods Chair Shaving Molecular biology
