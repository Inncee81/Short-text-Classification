how do i fix a very large hole in my ceiling o k so i'm renting an older house turned into an apartment building and a friend of mine went into the attic and fell through the ceiling after we told him not to he's going to help us pay for a fix it but we're not sure how to go about doing it the hole is probably ft long and ft wide and it looks like its drywall i thought maybe get a large peice of drywall cut it nail it to the beams in the attic and then blend it into the rest of the ceiling with some kind of putty its a drywall ceiling with no texture i've been reading about having to get mesh tape and boards with holes in it frankly i'm confused with so much information out there is anyone who has done this before and had it be a success or any best way of doing it my landlord does know about this which is the least of her problems because we're willing to fix it she's got other tenants who broke a toilet fixture and then left letting it leak all over the floor and warp it so she's pretty pleased we're nice enough to fix it haha you already have the basics you state in your q large suggests spanning beams rafters with a piece of drywall at the thickness probably inch making sure that the cut back area is at least centered on the beam even if you remove screwes to replace them the beam is approx inches allowing you inche for supporting the existing remaining adjacent ceiling as well as the patch that may mean cutting away even more than the damaged area and certainly to square up the patch in any case the cuts you make on the patch will not all be at the depressed side sides or the drywall but can be if you enlarge the damaged hole a sheet of drywall is ft wide most usually that would allow that only cut ends would be flush with the existing ceiling mesh tape is best and is usually modestly adhesive don't nail use drywall screws mud is best done in no less than steps as it shrinks in drying think of it this way even if it takes more time with regard to mud in this case less is more even the best can't expect a flush non sandable surface in one swipe hot mud is a technique you should probably not even investigate obviously adding tape and mud will require sanding an eventual repainting the issue with regard to invisible is so often an illusion in that when you mud then sand you're feathering the patch to make it appear in a decent job that it too is flush and vanishes to accomplish that as a diy you can use ceiling paint lightly rolled over your best patch efforts to judge any rise or depression etc i want to assume you're honesty in alerting the landlord but i'm not the ooops police steven wolf thousands of sq ft of drywall hundreds of gallons of mud and paint Knife Sharpening stone Woodworking Drill bit Mug Sword making Tea Bowie knife Japanese kitchen knives Ceramics World Wide Web Japanese tea ceremony HyperText Transfer Protocol Pottery Essential oil Bong Pencil sharpener Chisel Blade Stone tool Mango Web server Ski Hong Kong-style milk tea Glass Drink HTML Amateur telescope making Mattress Klingon Hiberno-English The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breakfast Uniform Resource Locator Coffee Cannabis (drug) Cuisine of Singapore Yerba mate Unicode and HTML Crayola Razor Pocket knife Damascus steel Spear Stockade Greasy spoon Alcoholic beverage Turquoise Katana Kukri Textile manufacturing Casting Linear Pottery culture Lightning rod Conker's Bad Fur Day Herbal tea Burns supper Survival skills Drinking culture Yohoho!
