fahrenheit mildred and montag can you please describe the relationship between montag and mildred do they ever show feelings for each other in the book i read this book a while ago but trying to remember i don't really think they did all mildred cared about was her family tv and her seashell radio her life sucked so much she tried to kill herself and though montag was worried about her then which shows he may have cared they never really had a loving relationship after all neither could even remember when they met and when montag gets caught mildred ditches him without a second thought all she cares about is her own safety and i can't remember but maybe she was the one who sold him out to the fire department at the end of the book montag kind of worries about her but he's more worried about the fact that she is dead and he should care but doesn't which disturbs him since that's not how husbands and wives should be i'm assuming this is for a school assignment i doubt this gives you enough to write a paper or something but i hope it helps Fahrenheit 451 Dead Like Me Philosophical skepticism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) History of SNL:1980-1985 Marilyn Monroe Fahrenheit 9/11 Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Guy Montag EastEnders Phoebe Halliwell Hey Jude Mildred Pierce The Ashlee Simpson Show Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Laura Schlessinger Death of a Salesman Sex and the City The Lovely Bones St. Elmo's Fire (film) Infantilism Major League Baseball television contracts Surveillance Another Simpsons Clip Show Euphemism Neighbours A Series of Unfortunate Events Miss Saigon Transactional analysis Bowling for Columbine Little Britain Highlander: The Series Futurama (TV series - season 4) Characters of Lost Friends The Critic The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular The Marshall Mathers LP Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pitaten The Secret of NIMH 2004 Republican National Convention Garth Brooks Ten Commandments John F.
