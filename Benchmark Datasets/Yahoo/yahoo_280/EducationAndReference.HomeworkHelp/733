i have an assignment that need data to be presented in a form of as graph can anyone help me use excel type in the data and then create a graph using the graph wizard you can make bar graphs line graphs pie graph scatter plots anything you can think of it'll prompt you to select the range for the independent and dependent variables then the rest is simple Glossary of graph theory Graph theory Compiler optimization Expert system CPU cache Function (mathematics) Reference counting SAS System Normal distribution Matroid Graph (mathematics) Domain-specific programming language Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Static single assignment form Extrapolation Polynomial Long-range dependency Directed acyclic graph Supply and demand Independent set problem Correlation Serialization NP-complete Linear equation Complex number Solar variation Algorithm Musical notation Spreadsheet Scene graph Binary decision diagram DirectShow Quantitative marketing research Compiler Derivative C plus plus Variable Chaos theory Reference (computer science) Web crawler Search algorithm Ancient Greek Class (computer science) Adjacency matrix Feynman diagram Bessel function Data clustering Combinatorial species PHP C programming language OpenOffice.org Existential graph Hasse diagram Bayesian network Decision tree Linear regression Modem Non-standard cosmology Intelligence quotient VFO Economics C syntax Combinatory logic Visual Basic Structured programming Make MUMPS Prim's algorithm Diffraction Tree data structure Transformer Titration Phase-shift keying In-place algorithm Lotus 1-2-3 Trigonometric function Planar graph Programming language Signed graph Dataflow language Spline (mathematics) Genetic algorithm Common Unix Printing System Oscilloscope Pattern matching Solar cell Sea level rise Nomogram Mathematics Graph coloring Quantification Lisp programming language Unicode Mode choice TI-89 series Model (economics) Open Inventor Variable star
