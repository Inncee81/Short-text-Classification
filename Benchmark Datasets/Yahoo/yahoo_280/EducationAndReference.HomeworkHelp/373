solve this inequality p basically the same idea as if it were an equation if you are solving for p you need to isolate p on one side of the inequality p add to both sides p divide by on both sides p the only twist to solving an inequality as compared to solving an equation is if you multiply or divide by a negative number that did not happen in this particular situation but for example if you had something like this p you would need to divide through by to solve when you divide an inequality or multiply by a negative number you must reverse the inequality sign therefore you would end up with this p just a little extra tidbit for future problems of this sort Inequality Conic section Dirac equation Quartic equation Quadratic equation Microeconomics Polynomial Dimensional analysis Trigonometric function M__bius transformation Quaternion Joseph Louis Lagrange Gaussian elimination Absolute value Basel problem Algorithm Two's complement Jean-Jacques Rousseau Welfare economics Simplex algorithm Cissoid of Diocles Ordinary differential equation Square root Complex number Fluctuation theorem Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Potential theory Computer numbering formats Economic inequality Exponentiation Optimization (mathematics) Projective transformation Random walk Contract bridge Vedic mathematics Recurrence relation Operational amplifier ___1 (number) Quantum computer Income inequality metrics Discrete Fourier transform P-adic number Mean field theory Computer Sobolev space Chemical equation Distribution (mathematics) Heat equation Negative and non-negative numbers Quadratic sieve Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Quantum harmonic oscillator Linear differential equation Mental calculation Mathematics of general relativity Economy of Africa Trip distribution Traveling salesman problem Daubechies wavelet Entropy Partial differential equation Sturm-Liouville theory Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges Bose gas Quicksort Newton's method Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Separation of variables Transmission line Market failure Invalid proof Experiment Phase-locked loop Force Clifford algebra Dynamical system Luminiferous aether Clauser and Horne's 1974 Bell test Prime number Particle in a box Large numbers Mathematics Federal Communications Commission Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Temperature State space (controls) Quantum tunneling IP (complexity) Signed graph Control system Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Solar cell Star Trek Customizable Card Game RISC Matrix (mathematics) Karma Trigonometric identity George Biddell Airy Strategic management
