can someone please help me on these math problems i tried and tried and cant seem to figure these out please help what is the locus of points in the plane of an angle that are equidistant from the sides of the angle what is the locus of points in space that are equidistant from two parallel lines what is the locus of points in a plane that are equidistant from points a and b in the plane thank you a would be line that bisects the angle b it would be a line halfway between the parallel lines and also parallel to the two lines c if you would connect a line from a to b it would be the perpendicular bisector of this line Circle Parabola Angle Triangle Descriptive geometry Map projection Cissoid of Diocles Wallpaper group Conic section Symmetry combinations Circumcircle Euclidean plane isometry Duality (projective geometry) Ruler-and-compass construction Fundamental polygon Curve Perspective (graphical) Complex number Voronoi diagram Hyperbolic geometry Orthographic projection Point groups in three dimensions Projective transformation Tetrahedron Non-Euclidean geometry Geometry Pappus of Alexandria Ham sandwich theorem Moir__ pattern Huzita's axioms Geodesy Geographic coordinate system Euclidean geometry Euclidean group Polarization Euclid's Elements Roman surface Einstein-Cartan theory World line Symmetry group Orthogonality Perspective projection distortion Manifold Rotational symmetry View camera Symmetry Ordinary differential equation Graphical projection Sphere Incidence (geometry) Meiosis Parallel postulate Antenna (radio) Theodolite Vector (spatial) Arthur Cayley Parking Ellipse Color CIE 1931 color space Stress (physics) 3-sphere Sundial Volleyball Orthogonal matrix Polygon Anatomical terms of location Fourth dimension Quadrilateral Haversine formula Reflection (mathematics) Affine transformation Aberration in optical systems Distance Orthogonal group Softball Coordinate rotation Rotation Coordinates (mathematics) Drawing Pythagorean theorem Lens (optics) Parallax Trigonometric function Coquaternion Schwarzschild coordinates 49th parallel north Rigid body Plane (tool) Cerebellum Polynomial interpolation Gyroscope Euclidean space Mirror image Delaunay triangulation Stereoscopy Interactive geometry software Similarity (mathematics) Mitosis Aberration of light
