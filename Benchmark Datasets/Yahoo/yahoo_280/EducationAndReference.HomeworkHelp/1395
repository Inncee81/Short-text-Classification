math problem i need help a gardener has meters of fencing to enclose two adjacent rectangular plots what dimensions will produced a maximum enclosed area could you please help me with this problem and please put your solution or an explanation on how did you get the answer thanks two rectangular boxes side by side provides a top and a bottom width w and three side heights h the area of the combined boxes is h w we know that h w and h w a we want amax which will require a derivative but we can't do a derivative with two variables so let's simplify h w for w and substitute it into h w a h w w h w h substitute into l w a h h a h h a h the maximum of a h can be found where the derivative of a h with respect to h or d a h dh and d a h dh h assuming you can do derivatives so the value for h where h will provide the maximum a h h h using h w we can determine w and find the area w w w w amax h w for our derived values amax amax meters squared Particle in a box Derivative Normal distribution Elementary algebra Maximum likelihood Spline (mathematics) Welfare economics Sudoku Baseball Complex number Transformation problem International Phonetic Alphabet Stairway Mathematics Ordinary differential equation Original Amiga chipset Dynamical system Labour economics Maxwell's equations Quartic equation Wallpaper group Crossword Debye model Gravity TI-89 series Artificial neural network Diamond cut Lebesgue integration Principle of maximum entropy Eight queens puzzle Cellular automaton Bell's theorem Production function Determinant Dimensional analysis Doomsday argument Integral RLC circuit Calculus Trigonometric function Computer algebra system Area (geometry) Microeconomics Labor theory of value Multiple integral Linear regression Israeli West Bank barrier Kalman filter Mathematics of general relativity Supply and demand Regression analysis Nondimensionalization Minesweeper (computer game) Fibonacci number General relativity Unicode Finite element method Central processing unit Stress (physics) Tennis Einstein-Cartan theory Common Lisp Chinese character Numerical integration Football (soccer) Panamax Parallax X86 assembly language Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Flag Visual Basic Heim theory World Geodetic System Hydrogeology Joseph Louis Lagrange Phase-shift keying Quadratic equation Slide rule Door Collision detection Geodesy Fuel injection Ethernet Antenna (radio) Simplex algorithm Derivation of the partition function Production theory basics Astrodynamics Explosive material G__del's incompleteness theorem Path integral formulation Transformer Torque Leica Kepler's laws of planetary motion Linear differential equation Black-Scholes Optimization (mathematics) Resistor DVD
