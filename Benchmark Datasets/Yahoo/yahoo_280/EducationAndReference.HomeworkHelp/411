as ac acid solution is added to aneutralize a base solution the oh concentration of the base solution a decreases b increases c remains the same i suck at chemistry could someone explain i don't even know what oh concentration is the oh concentration decreases in acid solutions you have more h ions in base solutions you have more oh ions this concentration is usually expressed in terms of ph the ph number is somewhat deceptive though because it stands for negative of the power of of the concentration of h ions neutral solutions such as water are ph that means that the concentration of h ions is more acidic solutions have lower ph numbers which means that their concentration of h is higher for example ph has a concentration of h ions which is times more than ph the whole h and ph thing come from the fact that a certain amount of water is in ionic form most of it is a molecule h o but a certain number of those molecules actually breaks off into an h ion and and oh ion those concentrations are in water in normal conditions by adding certain substances to water as they dissolve in water they release h ions this increases the h ion concentration and causes the solution to become acidic on the other hand there are certain substances that capture h ions as they dissolve those substances decrease h ion concentrations and make the solution basic but the concentration of h ions is tied to the concentration of oh ions as the relative concentration of one increases so the relative concentration of the other decreases because recombination takes place ions combine to turn into molecules thus preserving the combined concentration of h and oh ions i hope this helped a little good luck Water (molecule) Concentration Ammonia Base (chemistry) PH Enzyme Acid Carbon dioxide Electrophysiology Corrosion Hydrochloric acid Ion Self-ionization of water Coulometry Alkane Action potential Sulfuric acid Hydrogen Biochemistry Buffer solution Soil pH Hydrogen peroxide Alcohol Hydrogen bond Chemistry Chlorine Hydrogen chloride Acid dissociation constant Ethanol Photosynthesis Chemical reaction Acetic acid Nuclear fusion Ozone depletion Soluble Protein Mass spectrometry Citric acid Hydronium Salt Explosive material Fluoride Haloalkane Ozone hole Water purification Acid-base reaction theories Sodium chloride Origin of life Ion thruster Oxidation number Ionosphere Electrolyte Systematic name Ion exchange resin Ion selective electrode Parts per notation Cracking (chemistry) Nephron Insulin Formic acid Temperature Liquid crystal Soil Battery (electricity) Organic chemistry Membrane potential Macromolecule Glass Gastric acid Fluorine Soap Plasma (physics) Atom Ra (board game) Spacecraft propulsion Hydrolysis Sulfur Hemoglobin Alum Phosphate Mole (unit) Blood Sodium sulfate Amine Helium Titration Osmosis Dialysis E85 Carbonic acid Signal transduction
