if a line contains the points and what is the slope of a line perpendicular to it if line ab contains the points and what is the slope of a line perpendicular to line ab also if you could help me with this one that'd be really great a circle centered at the origin runs through the point what is the radius of the circle ps i'm not cheating or anything just studying for the sats and confused tip find slope for the line ab say m the slope of the line perpendicular to ab is m m tip to find slope of line passing a and b slope m yb ya xa xb where a xa ya a b xb yb b circle centered at the origin runs through the point what is the radius of the circle tip radius of the circle at origin running through the point x y radius sqrt x y radius sqrt sqrt radius sqrt Circle Trigonometric function Conic section Cissoid of Diocles Angle Duality (projective geometry) Pentagon Huzita's axioms Ellipse Multiple integral Manifold Parabola Roman surface Sphere Coordinates (mathematics) Slope Great-circle distance Ruler-and-compass construction Methods of contour integration Apollonian gasket Projective transformation Radius of convergence Lagrangian point Centripetal force M__bius transformation Latitude 3-sphere Phase-shift keying Great circle Escape velocity Boy's surface Hyperbolic geometry Special relativity Vector (spatial) Fresnel integral Area (geometry) Tangent Ulna Trigonometric identity Proper time Earth radius Pi Hohmann transfer orbit Point groups in three dimensions Abel transform Stress (physics) Antenna (radio) Square root Aliasing Curve fitting Haversine formula Coriolis effect Pentagram Frame fields in general relativity Mandelbrot set Euclidean geometry Descartes' theorem Hockey rink Geodesy Margin of error Gravitational redshift Map projection Tetrahedron Langmuir probe Rotational symmetry Brachistochrone curve Cycloid Kepler's laws of planetary motion Geography of Alberta Pendulum Lens (optics) Differential geometry of curves Geometry Spark plug Hyperbolic function Precession Line at infinity Cyclotron Snooker Orbital period Complex number Schwarzschild metric Line (mathematics) Ballpoint pen Sphere packing Drill bit Halo (megastructure) Curvature Euclidean plane isometry Angular velocity TGV Versine Stereographic projection Craps Circular motion Jet engine Apsis Horizon Wallpaper group
