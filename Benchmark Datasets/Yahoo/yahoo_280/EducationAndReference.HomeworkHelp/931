solve xsquared x the squared is like x to the second power thanx a lot x x this means squared x x transpose x to the other side becomes negative while on the left side of the equation x is added but when transposed to the opposite side we reverse the function so it turns to negative x x divided by is multiplied on the left so if transposed to the right it must be divided x x divided by is negative x x x when transferred to the other side should be divided x x divided by x is equal to x and that's your final answer Quartic equation Elementary algebra Complex number Matrix (mathematics) Trigonometric function Quadratic equation Exponentiation Square root Determinant Polynomial Conic section Quaternion ___1 (number) Vedic mathematics Clifford algebra Chess opening Dirac equation Stress (physics) Fischer Random Chess Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Operational amplifier Force Transposition cipher Gaussian elimination Dimensional analysis Contract bridge Cissoid of Diocles Binary numeral system Linear least squares P-adic number Orthogonal matrix Mental calculation Fluctuation theorem Trigonometric identity Invertible matrix Pascal's triangle Projective transformation State space (controls) Inequality Cubic equation Basel problem Cholesky decomposition IP (complexity) Linear regression Tetration Linear differential equation Invalid proof Gravity Circuit design Characteristic polynomial Rigging Resistor Matrix exponential Musical set theory Discrete Fourier transform LU decomposition Derivative Sturm-Liouville theory Computer numbering formats Microeconomics Angle Two's complement Path integral formulation Temperature Bra-ket notation Power (physics) Joseph Louis Lagrange Stationary point Symmetric matrix Slide rule Membrane potential Ordinary differential equation Negative and non-negative numbers Exotic matter Circle Heat equation Pi Quantum computer Derivation of the partition function Apollo Guidance Computer Recurrence relation Prime number Chemical equation Variance Multiplication Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Inversion (music) Bayesian inference Particle in a box Tai shogi Twelve-tone technique Combinatorial species Separation of variables Smith (The Matrix) Term logic Self-adjoint operator Entropy Negative feedback Exponential function
