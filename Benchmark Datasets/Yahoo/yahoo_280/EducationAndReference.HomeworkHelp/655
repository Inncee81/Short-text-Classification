how do i find the y intercept the two coordinates are and thus the slope is how do i get the y intercept refer to this pic http i photobucket com albums g idioticmonkey graph jpg and show and explain to me step by step you need to start with the correct slope to find the slope you need to take y minus y over x minus x meaning reduced your slope is to find the y intercept you need to use the equation y mx b m is the slope and b is the y intercept use either of the x y coordinates to find your y intercept b b add to both sides b or b b b y intercept is Linear equation Trigonometric function Cissoid of Diocles Projective transformation Newton's method Conic section Microeconomics Tangent Polynomial Slope Algebraic geometry Quartic equation Minkowski diagram Drill bit Parabola Trajectory Stairway Derivative Jet engine Square root Supply and demand Labour economics Pascal's triangle Cournot competition World Wide Web Quantum harmonic oscillator Curve fitting CPU design Natural logarithm Manifold Laplace operator Action (physics) Circle Gaussian elimination Quadratic equation Solar thermal energy LR parser Production function Opportunity rover Dirac equation Collision detection Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Production theory basics Duality (projective geometry) Mercator projection Force Plus and minus signs Expert system Graph theory Modern portfolio theory Yield curve Luminiferous aether Web crawler Volleyball Roman surface Incidence (geometry) Equation of time Wi-Fi Calculus Zero-knowledge proof Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Slippery slope Map projection Special relativity Dice Amateur telescope making Explosive material Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Mathematics of general relativity Federal Standard 1037C Vector (spatial) NTFS Instruction pipeline Line at infinity Geographic coordinate system Carnivorous plant Random walk Two-body problem Control system Orbit equation Dimensional analysis Musical mode Quintic equation Electrical resistance Legendre transformation Super Bowl V Cartesian coordinate system Ordinary differential equation Calculating the day of the week Geometry Universal Time Apollo Guidance Computer New York Giants Wallpaper group Battle of the beams Frame fields in general relativity Action potential Super Bowl XXXV Lagrangian Maxwell's equations
