how would i find the radius of the circle with equation x y x y how would i find the radius of the circle with equation x y x y i'm pretty sure i have to complete the square but i'm not really sure how to do that i think to complete the square of the x i need to add a to both sides but what do i need to do to complete the square of the y if you answer please explain your answer thanks yes you are going to have to complete the square which is sort of tough to explain in writing but here goes nothing first you want to group the x and y terms together and move the constant term to the other side x x y y now you have to complete the square for x and for y what you do is take the term that is not squared in each group so first look at the x take the and divide it by and square it add this number to your bracket and to the other side so you will have x x y y now you want to do the same thing in your other group so look at the y term you take half of which is and square it to get so you add to both sides x x y y now you have perfect squares on the left hand side so factor the groups to get x y from this you can tell the center of the circle and the radius the radius is the square root of the number on the right hand side r sqroot Trigonometric function Quadratic equation Square root Projective transformation Escape velocity Ruler-and-compass construction Dimensional analysis Cissoid of Diocles Circle Elementary algebra Napier's bones Planetary orbit Pi Orthogonal group Gaussian elimination Coriolis effect Gravity Complex number Mental calculation Triangle Polynomial Irrational number Fibonacci number Kepler's laws of planetary motion Black body Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace M__bius transformation Gee Modular form Sphere Equation of time Galois theory Flag of the People's Republic of China Normal distribution Dirac equation Shogi Floppy disk Electric field Quaternion Archimedes Radius of convergence Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Joseph Louis Lagrange M__bius strip Magic square Cubic equation Bra-ket notation Map projection Renormalization Elementary arithmetic Fischer Random Chess Z-transform Quadratic sieve Equation of state Haversine formula Antenna (radio) Wood carving Path integral formulation Taikyoku shogi Ruffini's rule Linear differential equation Longitude Vedic mathematics Centripetal force Planck units Force Cricket Pythagorean theorem Matrix (mathematics) Modified Newtonian dynamics Cube root Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry Explosive material Sun Proper time Stairway Langmuir probe Hypergeometric series Slide rule Potential energy Circular motion Maxwell's equations Hipparchus (astronomer) Orbit equation Stereographic projection Great Pyramid of Giza Geographic coordinate system Radius (bone) Figurate number Tide Formal power series Microeconomics Contredanse Root mean square Dynamical system Polarization Riemann zeta function
