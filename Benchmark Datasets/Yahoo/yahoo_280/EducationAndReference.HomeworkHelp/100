geometry help a regular pyramid has a base area of sqrt a base perimeter of in and a slant height of sqrt in its surface area is thats all i know how do you figure it out hey kid if a is side of base then a a we have triangles each of base and height sqrt area of traingles sqrt sqrt total area sqrt sqrt sqrt answer Triangle Area (geometry) Boy's surface Circle Tetrahedron Trigonometric identity Pi Golden ratio Pentagon Trigonometric function Pentagram Heron's formula M__bius transformation Polygon Conic section Trajectory Geometry Pythagorean theorem Archimedes Simplex Multiple integral Platonic solid Debye model Pendulum Escape velocity Angle Square root Heat equation Roman surface Ellipse Analytic geometry Octahedron Great Pyramid of Giza Langmuir probe Cissoid of Diocles Volume John Wallis Random variable Laplace operator Euclid's Elements Manifold Great-circle distance Sphere packing Algebraic geometry Euclidean geometry Combinatorics Rotational symmetry Parabola Norm (mathematics) Hyperbolic function Johnson solid Crystallographic restriction theorem Volume form Ellipsoid Distance Phonon Square root of 2 Kepler's laws of planetary motion Spherical harmonics Immirzi parameter Absolute value Quartic equation Proper time Riemann integral Tangram Bell's theorem Orbital period Wallpaper group Lp space Congruence (geometry) Frame fields in general relativity Regular polytope Ruler-and-compass construction Quantum tunneling Polyhedron Vector (spatial) Inner product space Trigonometry Catalan number Ricci curvature Estimation theory __tale cohomology Pascal's triangle Christoffel symbols Linear differential equation Schwarzschild metric Phase-shift keying Euclidean space Maxilla Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Invalid proof Pyramid Ludwig Schl__fli Arthur Cayley TI-89 series Reuleaux triangle Irrational number Stirling's approximation Black-Scholes
