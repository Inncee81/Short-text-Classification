my little sister needs help with her schoolwork complicated situation can anyone give me advice ok i have two sisters one older one younger my older sister and i both moved out of home last year we lived with our dad our younger sister lives with our mum she's y o my little sis is having some trouble at school and my mum only makes it worse by saying that if she doesn't understand it by now then she's just stupid my big sis and i have rachael lil sis on alternate weekends and were wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to how to make learning fun so we can help rach with her homework in a fun way that she can use even when she's not with us any advice would be greatly appreciated thanx obviously you have little control over what your mother says to your sister or her living arrangements your youngest sister is very fortunate to have two older siblings who are willing to advocate for her well being i think it might be helpful to see if you can enlist the help of your her father in this situation one of the posters mentioned contacting your sister's teacher however a problem with that is that your sister's teacher cannot share information openly about your sister's progress information about your sister would have to be shared with a parent legal guardian this is where having dad make contact and maintain contact with your sister's teacher would be more helpful than you contacting the teacher yourselves he could explain some of the background involved with your current family situation to help the teacher have a better understanding why your sister is experiencing the teacher may have some good ideas how to get her back on the right track it's likely that your sister's school has a website and a link with the faculty information phone numbers email address you could have this handy for your father but he's really the one who needs to contact the teacher to keep your sister interested in learning keeping her mind open to learning see what activities art museums history museums science exhibits are going on in your area before she comes to visit find out the when where cost and let your father know you'd really like to go sometimes these museums have very kid friendly and fun exhibits going on that are about learning but don't have the clasroom feel to them so your sister may have fun without the pressure she feels to perform well if your father isn't yet ready to become involved or being an advocate for your little sister's well being is there an aunt uncle adult family friend you could talk to and share your concerns you might even consider talking to your own school's guidance counselor he she may have some good suggestions to offer as well your sister is a very lucky girl to have the two of you looking out for her Social rule Avenue Q Pitaten Fathers' rights The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Phoebe Halliwell Melanie Wilkes Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix My Parents are Aliens Friends Scientology beliefs and practices FoxTrot Charmed Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters Education Infantilism Kimi Finster Plame affair Richard Feynman The Fairly OddParents One Tree Hill (TV series) Intelligent design movement Current teachings of Prem Rawat Asperger syndrome Earth Girl Arjuna Parachuting W.I.T.C.H.
