will my line of symmetry be affected if my x axis is labelled wrongly hi all i just have my math exam and i believed i did something wrong i labelled my x axis wrongly instead of cm to unit i put cm to unit i asked my teacher if my whole graph is wrong then he said only your presentation is wrong and maybe some other parts so i was wondering if my gradient of the graph will be wrong and my line of symmetry be wrong if i labelled my x axis wrongly please help me is a sec topic by the way thanks i hope there will be more answers i got one already from the guy below thanks will rate you after hours thanks lucky only mark for presentation no it won't the scale does not affect your gradient line of symmetry y intercept etc it only elongates your scale to make it look wider horizontally basically it doesn't change anything Symmetry Wallpaper group Trigonometric function Point groups in three dimensions Coriolis effect Extreme Programming Mathematics Morse theory Random walk Frieze group Parabola Spontaneous symmetry breaking Polyhedron Rotational symmetry Sundial Minkowski diagram Economics Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Symmetry group SAT Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Microeconomics Slope Gradient Theory of conduct Wind turbine String theory Social rule Coordinates (mathematics) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Graph (mathematics) Physics Second Avenue Q Coxeter group Supersymmetry Internal ballistics Vector (spatial) Spacetime Stress (physics) Graphics Supply and demand IP (complexity) Sexual orientation Order theory Gravity Flag of the United States Symmetry combinations Sudoku Tetrahedron Oscilloscope Polyomino Multiple integral Unix time Nomogram Calculus Stare decisis Baccalaur__at GED Tonality Glossary of graph theory Mandible Magnetic declination Luminiferous aether Transformation problem World line IS/LM model Grade (education) Fundamental domain Philosophy of space and time Production theory basics Potential energy Membrane potential Evil Map projection Theodolite Modern naval tactics CPU cache Xiangqi Fast bowling The Star Wars Holiday Special Scientology beliefs and practices Jumpstart 3rd Grade Paleoclimatology Sampling (music) Perspective (graphical) Milankovitch cycles Conway's Game of Life Radio controlled airplane Great Pyramid of Giza Biblical inerrancy I Ching Aesthetics Self programming language Time travel Baroque chess Special relativity Time Out of Mind Ice age
