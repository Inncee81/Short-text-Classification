what mathematical questions could be asked about an average can of coke also what kind of questions could be asked about a dodecagon sided shape for the can of coke what is its volume what is the surface area of the can how much empty space is in the can for the dodecagon what are the measures of the interior angles what are the exterior angles where does this shape appear in real life you can always come up with questions if you put a bit of thought into it Polygon Measure (mathematics) Circle Geometry Infinity Space Mathematics Black hole Polarization Similarity (mathematics) Map projection Lebesgue integration Sun Sphere Vehicle armour Leaf Opportunity rover World line Philosophy of space and time Geology of the Moon Ruler-and-compass construction New Coke Ricci flow Angle Manifold Milton H.
