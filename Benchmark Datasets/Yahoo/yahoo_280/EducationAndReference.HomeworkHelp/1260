what is the square root of if the square root of is square root of if the square root of is square root of the square root of is sqrt not sqrt or sqrt so what is the square root of since and are prime numbers the square root of sqrt it cannot be simplified any further you can get a decimal approximation which is good luck in your studies mitch Square root Square root of 2 Irrational number Complex number Quartic equation Normal distribution Real number Quadratic sieve Pi Standard deviation Cube root Golden ratio Imaginary unit Fibonacci number Euclidean distance Cubic equation Invalid proof Ruler-and-compass construction Root of unity Root mean square Duodecimal Tetration 2 (number) Quadratic equation Timeline of mathematics Exponentiation Rabin cryptosystem Prime counting function Pell's equation Newton's method Mean RLC circuit Debye model Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Sexagesimal Gamma function Four fours Discrete Fourier transform Figurate number Pitch (music) Boy's surface Combinatorics Factorial Linear differential equation Napier's bones Exponential function Margin of error Catalan number Cholesky decomposition Mental calculation Real closed field Phonon Trigonometric function Squaring the circle Abacus 1000 (number) Matrix (mathematics) Polynomial Chi-square distribution Chebyshev polynomials Greatest common divisor TI-89 series Meantone temperament Platonic solid Ruffini's rule Maximum likelihood Higher-order function Phase-shift keying Mathematical coincidence Trajectory Prime number theorem Recurrence relation Slide rule Joseph Louis Lagrange Determinant Quantum state Quantum harmonic oscillator Random walk On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Impedance Quaternion M__bius transformation General number field sieve Resonance Latitude ENIAC Trigonometric identity Conic section Logarithm Pearson's chi-square test Elliptic integral Central limit theorem Irreducible polynomial Galois theory Hyperbolic function Decimal Crystallographic restriction theorem Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges
