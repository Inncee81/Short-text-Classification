please help me on this question when you write husband does it have to be in capital like husband or does it be like husband im not talking about after a full stop or the start of the sentence in like the middle of a sentence if you help me i will choose you as best answer in mins husband is not a proper noun therefore should not be capitalized when in the middle of a sentence if perhaps it is used as a name which some writers will do then it will be capitalized or if it comes at the beginning of a sentence it will be capitalized but if you write a sentence like this she asked her husband for the butter then no it is not capitalized Capitalization Noun Punctuation Egyptian language Pronoun Wheel of Fortune Hiberno-English Figure of speech Singlish Leet Arabic alphabet Old Irish language Full stop Korean language American and British English differences Gender-neutral language Esperanto grammar Existence Romanian language Latin alphabet English grammar Aramaic language Taiwanese (linguistics) Chinese grammar Esperanto orthography Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
