i need a scientific topic with the iv dv cv definition of iv dv and cv it below iv independent variable dv dependent variable cv constant variables please no rude answers this is what i think i remember from science class iv is a variable that can be manipulated by the person experimenting and the effects of the iv on the dv is measured the iv is also independent of changes in the values of other variables cv is something that is unaffected by either dv or iv like r in pv nrt r is a constant variable dv is dependent on the independent variable it is affected by the iv hope this helps hopefully someone else answers and they kinda coincide with mine Variable Statistics Quantum mechanics Function (mathematics) Random variable Bell's theorem Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Probability Normal distribution Statistical independence Gravity Scope (programming) Naive Bayes classifier Solar variation Psychology Causality Human Economics PID controller Entropy Ordinary differential equation Stochastic process Derivative Species Quantitative marketing research Compiler optimization CHSH inequality Mathematical model Special relativity Uncertainty principle Nondimensionalization Science fiction Color EPR paradox Model (economics) Free variables and bound variables Identical particles Software engineering Scientific method Linear regression PL/SQL Mathematics Measurement Dimensional analysis Common Lisp Probability density function Mathematical logic Renormalization group Class (computer science) Stuttering Nuclear magnetic resonance Variable speed of light CIE 1931 color space Social psychology C plus plus Multiple integral Datatype Abstraction (computer science) Dimensionless number Expert system Information entropy Force Sexual orientation Bayes' theorem Static single assignment form Ozone depletion Equivalence principle Science Explosive material Transformer Social research Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Variance Determinism Integral Coercion Transformation problem Experiment PH Global warming Biodiversity Natural deduction Hydrogeology Creationist cosmologies Pixel Particle in a box Hidden variable theory Meteorology Units of measurement Anthropic principle Regression analysis Bell test experiments Philosophy of space and time Thermodynamics Action potential Lambda calculus Constant capital
