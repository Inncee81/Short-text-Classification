please help me how do i how do i simplify x x x x x x x x x the first fraction first you factor x x the x 's cancel leaving you with x x x that's for the st fraction x for the nd fraction factor out an x in the numerator and factor out x in the denominator you then have x x x for the nd fraction x x x you have to realize is the sum of two cubes so as the formula goes for factoring the sum of two cubes see the link that i'm including when you factor you get a b a b a ab b so in our case of x a is x and b is so x x x x so that is the denominator for the nd fraction oh and don't forget the x in front because for the nd fraction you had x x remember x x x x x x x x x if you notice above the x 's cancel and the x x 's also cancel so you are left with x x x x x Duodecimal On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Partial fraction Vulgar fraction Continued fraction Projective transformation Vedic mathematics Complex number Decimal Trigonometric identity Fibonacci number Pi Computer numbering formats Recurring decimal Exponentiation Addition Egyptian numerals Astrodynamics Debye model Hausdorff dimension Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula Polarization Z-transform Black body Exponential function 200 (number) 1 (number) Local ring Elementary arithmetic Ruffini's rule Binomial coefficient Egyptian fraction P-adic number Units of measurement State space (controls) Empty product Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Power series Division (mathematics) Cissoid of Diocles RLC circuit Shor's algorithm Localization of a ring Binary numeral system Modified discrete cosine transform Rational number Irrational number Elementary algebra Pascal's theorem Renormalization Phase-locked loop Speed limit Surreal number Identical particles Hexadecimal Nuclear fission 1000 (number) Microeconomics Ideal (ring theory) Pythagorean theorem Square root John Wallis Egyptian mathematics UBASIC Riemann zeta function Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm Naive Bayes classifier Discrete Fourier transform The Best of Both Worlds (TNG episode) Adjoint functors Real number Money supply Perfect number Catalan number Factorial Uses of trigonometry Determinant Quartic equation Standard deviation Gravity Greatest common divisor Frequency mixer Polynomial Principle of indifference Srinivasa Ramanujan Newton's identities Logarithm Quadratic equation Minimum phase Discrete cosine transform Goldbach's conjecture Laplace operator Generating function Information entropy Dice Percentage Radiosity Farey sequence Root of unity Price equation
