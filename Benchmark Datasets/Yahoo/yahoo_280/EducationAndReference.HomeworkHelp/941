'i am from' poem my teacher is making us write a poem about us i good at writing poetry just not when its about myself so i was wondering if anyone could help if they had any examples or just something that might spark some inspiration basicly it just has to be about people you know places you live phrases you say traditions smells sounds tastes food sights activities and or clothing trends i start with a central image where i can compare myself with then i let the descriptions flow from the image as if it were me talking you can use freestyle verse so the flow of your feelings dont stop just because you need to follow a certain meter example like sunflower basking from the warm orange sun there i was sitting under with coffee warming in my hands little trickles of sweat it's summer again i remember the sound of trickles from the stream where i used to play i remember me Poetry Kigo Japanese tea ceremony Synaesthesia Rhyme Singlish Lost in Translation (poem) Sauna Bong Japanese poetry Waka Rapping Surrealist techniques Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Socrate Meter (poetry) Alliterative verse Clothing Poetry of the United States Tofu Water Hiking Irish poetry Sunflower English literature Hip hop rivalries God and gender Social rule Yehuda Halevi Koan Sant Mat Breakfast Time Out of Mind Swimming George Oppen Alexander Blok Dundas Square Literature Homer Emily Dickinson Statius Percy Bysshe Shelley Tattva Louis MacNeice The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Thermoregulation The Waterboys Haiku Freestyle music Gothic rock Limerick (poetry) Atomic Kitten Epic poetry Yoga Ozone depletion Jewish music Sacred Harp C.
