i need help with a two math equation read details im failed my math exam twice and this is my last make up exam so they gave me a revision paper and im realy weak in math so plz sumone answer this question me and if u are able explain a lil bit the questions are in a polygon with n sides half the interior angles are each degrees and the other half are degrees calculate how many side are there abcb is a rhombus bd cm and ac cm calculate the size of abc you need to use the exterior angles the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is deg when the interior angle is deg the exterior angle is deg and when the interior angle is the exterior is deg so you have n angles at and n at so n n so n so n the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and they also bisect the angles through which they pass so if the point of intersection of the diagonals is e then eb and ae and tan abe find abe then double it to find angle abc hope this helps twiggy Circle Polygon Wallpaper group Triangle Trigonometric function Ruler-and-compass construction Quadrilateral Constructible polygon Symmetry combinations Geographic coordinate system GED SAT Point groups in three dimensions Pi Degree (mathematics) Regular polytope Parabola Angle Trigonometric identity Pentagon Education in Romania Spherical trigonometry Mathematics Aberration in optical systems Cissoid of Diocles Grade (education) Lattice (group) Geography of Africa Pythagorean theorem Slide rule Conic section Napier's bones Polyhedron Archimedes Spline (mathematics) Parallel postulate Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ordinary differential equation DVD Orthographic projection Navigation Euclidean plane isometry Trigonometry Quaternion Sundial Jaime Escalante Bloodstain pattern analysis Ko shogi Complex number Richard Feynman Circumcircle Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Celestial navigation Galois theory Josip Plemelj Similarity (mathematics) Speed of light Timeline of mathematics Seismic retrofit Tai shogi Trajectory Slope Polarization Matrix (mathematics) Taikyoku shogi Golden ratio MathCounts Electrophysiology Equation of time Linear regression Black hole Polyomino Sun Table tennis Hex (board game) Euclid's Elements Joseph Louis Lagrange Great Pyramid of Giza Planetary orbit Euler characteristic Convex hull Poker jargon Cross product Riemann___Roch theorem Magnification Parallax Quaternions and spatial rotation Projective transformation Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Clementine mission Family Feud Jeopardy!
