n b expectatation x is the expectation of the function x given some probability density function p x consider the pdf p x p x kx exp lambda x x between minus infinity and infinity where lambda and k are both constants show that k lambda sqrt of pi without explicitly integrating any function exlain why the odd moments of p x are all zero ie e x n n you know p x dx by definition of a pdf so you need to find kx exp lambda x dx using integration by parts twice and then equate it to will give you the required value of k it is much too long and tedious for me to do for you here e x n x n p x dx let f x x n p x x n kx exp lambda x kx n exp lambda x kx n x exp lambda x then f x k x n x exp lambda x kx n x exp lambda x f x so f x is an odd function and you are probably aware that if you integrate ie find the area under an odd function over a symmetric interval of the x axis that it equals zero hence e x n f x dx for n Normal distribution Exponential distribution Weierstrass's elliptic functions Principle of maximum entropy Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Poisson distribution Riemann zeta function Quantum harmonic oscillator Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution M__bius transformation Statistical mechanics Identical particles Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Heat equation Survival analysis Partition function (statistical mechanics) Pi Continuous Fourier transform Determinant Quaternion Dirac delta function Gas in a box RLC circuit Planck's law of black body radiation Integral Doomsday argument Projective transformation Probability Failure rate Probability density function White noise Recurrence relation Exponential function Exponentiation Taylor series Multivariate normal distribution Elliptic curve Bell's theorem Edgeworth series Sturm-Liouville theory Log-normal distribution Kalman filter Formal power series Debye model Stirling's approximation Metric tensor (general relativity) CIE 1931 color space Self-adjoint operator Matrix exponential Linear differential equation Estimation of covariance matrices Orthogonal matrix Bose gas Lambda calculus Particle in a box Diffraction Cubic equation Multiple integral Bayes' theorem Estimation theory Mathematics of general relativity Functional programming Derivation of the partition function Maximum entropy probability distribution Jacobi's elliptic functions Dirac equation Phase-shift keying Polylogarithm Riemann integral Lorentz group Green's function Laplace transform Quantum statistical mechanics Inner product space Jensen's inequality Newton's identities Negative binomial distribution Square root Escape velocity Mathieu function Skew-symmetric matrix Airy function Mercer's theorem Polynomial Modular form Particle in a spherically symmetric potential Standard deviation Ellipse Path integral formulation Cumulant Symmetry Expected value Gamma function Local hidden variable theory Poincar__ metric
