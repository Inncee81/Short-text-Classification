given f x x find f x a sqrt x b x c x d sqrt x e sqrt x and why f x can also be written as f x so substitute x for x on both sides of the equation f x x and you get f x x good luck Square root Quartic equation Trigonometric identity Quadratic equation Linear differential equation Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Conic section RLC circuit Boy's surface Cubic equation Dirac equation Quantum tunneling Recurrence relation Heat equation Particle in a box Frame fields in general relativity Coordinates (mathematics) Pendulum Debye model Trajectory Exponentiation Spherical harmonics Proper time Trigonometric function Normal distribution Triangle Quaternion Cissoid of Diocles Harmonic oscillator Imaginary unit Black-Scholes Bessel function Laplace transform Gas in a box Projective transformation Golden ratio TI-89 series Creation and annihilation operators Parabola WKB approximation Ruffini's rule Invalid proof Nondimensionalization Methods of contour integration Autoregressive moving average model Correlation Pentagon Mathieu function Stirling's approximation Quantum harmonic oscillator Augustus De Morgan Root mean square Green's function Gamma function M__bius transformation Dimensional analysis Roman surface Damping Hyperbolic function Klein-Gordon equation Factorial Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Standard deviation Diffraction Maxwell's equations Generating function Relativistic mass Analytic geometry Quintic equation Ellipse Meantone temperament Gloss (material appearance) Random walk Absolute value Kepler's laws of planetary motion Continuous Fourier transform Einstein-Hilbert action Multiple integral Square root of 2 Student's t-distribution Astrodynamics Ruler-and-compass construction TeX Error function Laplace operator Langmuir probe Haversine formula Escape velocity Modified Newtonian dynamics S matrix Catalan number Pi Speed of sound Semi-major axis Identical particles Cholesky decomposition Siphon Wave Phase-locked loop
