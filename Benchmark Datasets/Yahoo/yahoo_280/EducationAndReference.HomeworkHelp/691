if a triangle has sides of measure x x and x find all the possibnle values of x each side must be greater than zero x x x the first two give you x the second one gives x if x and x then that just means x now let's see if there is an upper limit the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side let's take two sides x and x their sum must be greater than the third side x x x x x x subtract x from each side x divide both sides by x flip x so we have x and x do you know of any number that satisfies the above i don't so there are no possible values for x ie these cannot represent the side lengths of a triangle Trigonometric function Vector (spatial) Real number Triangle Trigonometric identity Pascal's triangle Complex number Fibonacci number Inequality Lebesgue integration Wallpaper group Computer numbering formats Riemann integral IP (complexity) Continued fraction Quicksort Cissoid of Diocles Vulgar fraction Mental calculation Level of measurement On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Lattice (group) Napier's bones Numeral system Binary numeral system Dimensional analysis Catalan number Riemann zeta function Surreal number Tessellation Probability Binomial coefficient Trigonometry Euclidean plane isometry Function (mathematics) Two's complement Negative and non-negative numbers Addition Normal distribution Slide rule Elementary algebra Mean Pythagorean theorem Polygon Quantum harmonic oscillator Circle Collision detection Irrational number Stairway Spherical trigonometry Glossary of graph theory Proportional representation Padovan sequence Series (mathematics) I Ching divination Absolute value Point groups in three dimensions Spline (mathematics) 400 (number) Golden ratio base Grade (education) Truss Gross domestic product Mann-Whitney U Information entropy Pentagram Hipparchus (astronomer) 0 (number) Standard deviation Pi Traveling salesman problem Principle of indifference Ordinary differential equation Principle of maximum entropy Calculating the day of the week Mathematics of general relativity Metric (mathematics) Dice Affine geometry Euclid's Elements Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Stochastic process Large numbers Median Ternary Decibel Golden ratio Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Square root Area (geometry) Vedic mathematics Cross Sums Archimedes The McGuire Sisters Annuity 60 (number) Construction of real numbers Data clustering Distance Invalid proof
