can anyone help me on this math problem prove the tangents to a circle at the endpoints of a diameter are parallel state what is given what is to be proved and your plan of proof then write a two column proof hint it will help you to draw a diagram with the points labeled given to prove plan can someone please help me write this proof lets call ab the diameter the circle is called o center point is o line xay is tangent to circle at point a lbm is tangent to circle at point b given circle o with diameter ab aob is the diameter prove xay is parallel to lbm proof line xay is perpendicular to line ao reason tangent line is perpendicular to circle at point of intersection line lbm is perpendicular to bo reason same a above angle xao is equal to obm reason perpendicular lines from right angles which are equal to each other xay is perpendicular to lbm reason two lines are perpendicular if the alternate interior angles are equal Circle Triangle Cissoid of Diocles Angle Trigonometric function Wallpaper group Parabola Tangent Geometry Euclidean geometry Ruler-and-compass construction Conic section Parallel postulate Vector (spatial) Hyperbolic geometry Map projection Descriptive geometry Huzita's axioms Stress (physics) World line Trigonometric identity Non-Euclidean geometry Einstein-Cartan theory Archimedes 3-sphere Pentagon Point groups in three dimensions Mean value theorem Haversine formula Slope Pi Antenna (radio) Geodesy Tangent space Frenet-Serret formulas Rotational symmetry Euclidean plane isometry Circumcircle Dividing a circle into areas Kepler's laws of planetary motion Coordinate system Pappus of Alexandria Orthogonal matrix Perspective (graphical) Orthographic projection Euclidean group Sphere Apollonian gasket Engineering drawing Root system Polygon Derivative Projective transformation Heine___Borel theorem Symmetry combinations Curve Parallax Dynamical system Apollonius of Perga Perspective projection distortion Great circle Polarization Tangent half-angle formula Billiards Johnston diagram Theodolite Boy's surface Sextant The Wedge (border) Symmetry group Sundial Electrophysiology B__zier curve Bloodstain pattern analysis Spline (mathematics) Geographic coordinate system D-brane Lorentz group Morse theory Drawing Incidence (geometry) Recursion Differentiable manifold Mathematics of general relativity Quadrilateral Spherical trigonometry Pythagorean theorem Complex number Josip Plemelj Area (geometry) Rotation Aberration in optical systems Coquaternion Time travel
