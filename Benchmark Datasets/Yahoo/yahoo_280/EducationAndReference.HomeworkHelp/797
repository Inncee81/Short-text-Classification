equation f x x which is parabola how can i identify that it doesn't intersect the x axis you could plot it however it is obvious that f x is always negative since the term x can only be positive since any negative or positive number squared is and the two terms are negative x is negative since x is and of course is negative the maximum value is when x because that makes the term x if you are into calculus another method is you can take the derivative which is x and set it equal to zero which is the maximum therefore x is the maximum and substituting back into the original equation the maximum for f x therefore it never reaches the x axis Conic section Quadratic equation Trajectory Derivative Planetary orbit Complex number Parabola Square root Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Exponentiation Trigonometric function Cissoid of Diocles Polynomial Archimedes Cubic equation Ordinary differential equation Astrodynamics Negative and non-negative numbers Projective transformation Slope Dirac equation Aberration in optical systems Ellipse Microeconomics Circuit design Kepler's laws of planetary motion Timeline of mathematics Random walk Calculus Normal distribution Equation of time Doomsday argument Determinant Semi-major axis Siphon Escape velocity Longitude Quaternion Desargues' theorem Profit maximization Imaginary number Quartic equation Stationary point Combinatory logic Partial differential equation Explosive material Resistor Function (mathematics) P-adic number Lens (optics) Exponential function Fundamental theorem of calculus Division by zero John Wallis Orbit equation Basel problem Particle in a box Maximum likelihood Declination Derivation of the partition function ___1 (number) Chinese calendar Path integral formulation Curvature Situation calculus Amplitude Natural deduction Hyperbola Collision detection Coordinates (mathematics) Bose gas Orthogonal matrix Action potential Methods of contour integration Calculus of variations Maxwell's equations Binary numeral system Two's complement HSV color space Tensor Quantum harmonic oscillator Covariance and contravariance Frenet-Serret formulas Elementary algebra Lagrangian mechanics Real number Dynamical system Photoelectric effect Recurrence relation Polylogarithm Phase-shift keying Lambda calculus Negative liberty Integral Multiple integral Probability Quintic equation Cartesian coordinate system Categorical syllogism Heat equation
