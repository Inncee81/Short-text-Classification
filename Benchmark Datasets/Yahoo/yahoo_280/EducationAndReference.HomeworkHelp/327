inspired by j k rowling when i grow up i want to write like j k rowling's harry potter series becuase i can control what happens next but i am stuck can't think anything sometimes i wonder if j k rowling never thought of harry potter i would have thought of it help well i would definately do something you would remain interested in especially if you want to do a series if you like harry potter i would stick to fantasy type stuff mix it up use different characters different setting that way no one could ever say you were just trying to copy j k rowling try a set of sisters or brothers instead of friends change it to a college setting instead of a school for younger children like i said it just depends on the type of things you are interested in sit down and create a list of things you like and go from there you can take your list and create stories that have the things you are interested in from you list keep me updated i would love to see someone create something similar to the harry potter series i loved it Harry Potter J.
