what are some study tips that improved your grades use different colored pens if your teachers allow it the brain loves color so this will help you to learn and also to remember what you have learned whenever i had to study vocabulary or a subject with lots of content like a science or humanities course it helped me to write down all the main points in fabulous colors i even did this with statistics and it helped me remember all those wacko formulas if you are trying to learn some content with a friend you can drill each other while tossing a ball back and forth this movement also enhances learning and memory as you are engaging your proprioceptive sense where your body is in space and besides that it's fun you can also change this idea the only limit is your imagination suppose your friend asked a question and demonstrated a dance move then you answered the question while repeating the same movement fun fix a nice snack like carrot sticks and dip or a bag of m m's hehe and allow yourself to take a break and enjoy only after you've put in a solid minute study time no ims etc that way you are training yourself to be more disciplined but also feeding your brain some energy food when preparing for a test make up your own multiple choice or fill in the blank practice test and drill yourself and your friends like crazy until you all know it well they will really appreciate your help if you have a lot of assignments you have to do arrange with your study buddy to chat after you've finished or maybe before school the next morning so you can compare notes and make sure you are both ready to face the day sometimes reviewing and discussing your work together cements the concepts for you and again helps you to remember them good luck to you GED Extreme Programming Science Alexander Technique A Course In Miracles Second language acquisition Education Autism Psychology SAT Mathematics Martial art Professional wrestling match types Neuro-linguistic programming Avenue Q Son Goku (Dragon Ball) CPU cache Shaggy dog story Memory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Mnemonic Meaning of life Philosophy of perception Scientific method Marching band The nature of God in Western theology Pitaten Teen Girl Squad Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Drawing Sydney Riot of 1879 Eye Amiga Power Psychokinesis YuYu Hakusho Special relativity Current teachings of Prem Rawat Blood on the Tracks Great Teacher Onizuka Education in Romania Columbine High School massacre Sexual orientation Deconstruction Milton H.
