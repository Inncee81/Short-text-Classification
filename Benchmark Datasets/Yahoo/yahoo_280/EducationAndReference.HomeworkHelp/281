pcr primer question what is the point of running a pcr with two primers eg ovalbumin olgio and insulin oglio we were only interested in the ova band i assume insulin is the negative control there is an insulin band in all the columns but what is it for maybe it was used in order to show that the pcr actually worked that is you had intact dna and the conditions in your machine were conducive to replication if you didn't use a ladder in the gel then the insulin bands could be used as molecular weight markers ovalbumin is a protease inhibitor prevents catabolism or breakdown of proteins while insulin regulates anabolism and consequently carbohydrate breakdown so they kind of regulate opposite reactions did you extract the dna yourself maybe you had to use both in order to show that your extraction methods were reliable did you manipulate the organism sample cell before you extracted dna maybe there's a pathway that would involve both insulin and ovalbumin where insulin came first and you needed to show that the lack of insulin was not a factor in the lack presence of ovalbumin Insulin Polymerase chain reaction Molecular biology Protein Enzyme Glucokinase Sequencing Cell (biology) Gel electrophoresis Agarose gel electrophoresis Whole proteome analysis Cancer HIV test Primer (molecular biology) Diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemia Western blot Genetic fingerprinting Antiretroviral drug Signal transduction Anabolism Lesch-Nyhan syndrome HIV Thermus aquaticus Genetic engineering Growth hormone Nutrition Biochemistry Metabolism Citric acid cycle DNA replication Protein sequencing Sleep Chain termination method Coagulation Gene expression DNA repair Virus Antiviral drug Gene Alzheimer's disease Jurassic Park Origin of life Glucocorticoid Crohn's disease Mitochondrial genetics Mutation Growth hormone treatment Cloning Bioinformatics Wound healing phases Plasmid Site-directed mutagenesis Biophysics Mitosis RuBisCO Genetics Gene therapy Ultraviolet Hepatitis B HIV structure and genome Biology Insulin-like growth factor Serine protease Clinical depression Schizophrenia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Programmed cell death SDS-PAGE Morphogenesis Pharmacology Chemotherapy Telomerase Staining (biology) Transcription (genetics) Bodybuilding Subcloning Chromatography Species Cystic fibrosis P53 Milk Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia Hormone Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Insulin resistance Helicobacter pylori Obstetrics Central dogma of molecular biology Atkins Nutritional Approach
