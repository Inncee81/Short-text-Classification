math problem could somebody please help me with this math problem the tickets to a concert cost for the lower level and for the upper level a total of tickets were sold for a total amount of how many lower level tickets were sold thanks steps would be appreciated you have two equations in two unknowns let x be the number of lower level seats and y the number of upper level seats now what do you know about these you know that x y x y if you know linear algebra you can solve this using that if not then use the fact that y x in the second equation you get x x now you have an equation in one variable solve for x then plug that number into the first equation to get y Ordinary differential equation Elementary algebra Mathematics Numerical analysis Algebra Microeconomics Supply and demand Gaussian elimination Linear algebra Newton's method Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Partial differential equation Orthogonal matrix Cholesky decomposition Root-finding algorithm Polynomial Exponentiation Nonlinearity Numerical ordinary differential equations Cubic equation Calculus System of linear equations Exact solutions in general relativity Linear equation LU decomposition Algebraic geometry Matrix (mathematics) Exponential function Vedic mathematics Mathematics of general relativity Dirac equation Linear programming Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Quartic equation Perturbation theory Heat equation Distribution (mathematics) Finite element method Two-body problem Mathematics education Clay Mathematics Institute Welfare economics Recurrence relation Diophantine equation Complexity classes P and NP Lebesgue integration Green's function Einstein's field equation Navier-Stokes equations Profit maximization M__bius transformation Land use forecasting Newton's identities XSL attack Fermat's last theorem Particle in a box History of mathematics Derivative Matrix exponential Polynomial interpolation Laplace transform Planetary orbit Molecular orbital Quadratic equation History of computing hardware Basis (linear algebra) E85 Computational fluid dynamics Model (economics) Oliver Heaviside Transmission line Linear differential equation State space (controls) Orders of magnitude (numbers) Prime number Timeline of mathematics Hamiltonian mechanics Route assignment Infinity Functional equation Computer algebra system Prices of production TI-89 series Transformation problem Jet engine Hydrogeology Algebra over a field Fibonacci number Fluid dynamics Artificial neural network Stackelberg competition Separation of variables Linear Quintic equation Slide rule Linear regression Production function Harmonic oscillator Einstein-Cartan theory
