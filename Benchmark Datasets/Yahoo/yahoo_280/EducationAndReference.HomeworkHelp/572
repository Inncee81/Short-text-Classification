how do you find the slope of a line that is tangent to a circle equation x y point a line that is tangent to a circle is always perpendicular to the radius of the circle find the slope of the line from center to the slope is the slope of the tangent would have to be Circle Tangent Conic section Cissoid of Diocles Slope Angle Parabola Map projection Tangent space Derivative Duality (projective geometry) Differential geometry of curves 3-sphere Huzita's axioms Apollonian gasket Descartes' theorem Manifold Roman surface Tangent half-angle formula Triangle Dynamical system Stereographic projection Tangent bundle Projective transformation Sphere Trigonometric identity Circular motion Stress (physics) Geodesic Angular velocity Haversine formula Great circle Apollonius of Perga Mean value theorem Geometry Ruler-and-compass construction Rhumb line Coriolis effect Centripetal force World line Curve fitting Euclid's Elements Hyperbolic function Line bundle Mason-Dixon line Legendre transformation Cycloid Differential geometry and topology Ellipse Newton's method Line at infinity Halo (megastructure) Quaternion Frenet-Serret formulas Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry Linear equation Covariance and contravariance Hyperbolic geometry Exponential map Mathematics of general relativity The Wedge (border) Dual polyhedron Line (mathematics) Frame fields in general relativity Van Stockum dust Length of an arc Geographic coordinate system Versine Hyperbolic motion Pentagon Circumcircle Brachistochrone curve Einstein-Cartan theory Kaluza-Klein theory Geodesy Incidence (geometry) Elliptic curve Multiple integral Vector field Potential flow Lorentz group Calculus Square root Archimedes Topographic map Sextant Stationary point Antenna (radio) M__bius transformation Radius of convergence Production function Covariant transformation Curvature of Riemannian manifolds Precession Latitude Welfare economics Almost complex manifold Tensor field
