how do i solve x x x x thanks for your time one factor is and another is i used synthetic division to get these numbers i actually don't remember how to do possible rational zeros prz's but with that you get these two numbers once those are factored out the equation is x x x x and the other solution is imaginary cause using the quadratic formula the solution is sqrt i or i Square root Complex number Quadratic equation Quartic equation RLC circuit Ruffini's rule Trigonometric function Imaginary unit Linear differential equation Irrational number Cubic equation Trigonometric identity Galois theory Exponentiation Ruler-and-compass construction Vedic mathematics Quadratic sieve Impedance Polynomial Quaternion Root of unity Heat equation Irreducible polynomial Ordinary differential equation Elementary algebra Combinatorics Prime number Discrete Fourier transform Quintic equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Conic section Binomial coefficient Determinant Julia set Newton's method TI-89 series Pi Grover's algorithm Negative and non-negative numbers Riemann hypothesis Gamma function Continued fraction Particle in a spherically symmetric potential M__bius transformation Harmonic oscillator TeX Number theory Recurrence relation Trajectory Bessel function History of mathematics Large numbers Cissoid of Diocles Daubechies wavelet Quantum tunneling Arthur Cayley Random walk Partial fraction Real number Proper time P-adic number Quantum harmonic oscillator Exponential function Laplace transform Algebra Standard deviation Fibonacci number Special relativity Clifford algebra Cholesky decomposition Clay Mathematics Institute Pell's equation Particle in a box On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Imaginary number WKB approximation Prime counting function Calculus Continuous Fourier transform Cube root Root-finding algorithm Coordinate rotation Mathieu function Schr__dinger equation Two-body problem Vorlesungen __ber Zahlentheorie Algorithm Golden ratio Damping QR decomposition Mathematics Discrete sine transform Airy function Dirac equation Partial differential equation Group (mathematics) Polylogarithm Integer factorization
