i don't understand this question i'm finishing a reading assignment for a book and i don't understand one of my questions here it is tell how the setting and historical context of the work is important in understanding the other elements of the work such as plot characterization or theme the book that i am doing is the jungle by upton sinclair can anyone tell me what i have to do in words that i can actually understand explain how the place and time of the story affects how the characters behave the story plays out or the overall meaning of the story for example west side story is basically romeo and juliet set in the west side of new york so the setting means that the romeo is part of a street gang instead of a nobleman's son and they are fighting with knives and guns instead of swords with the jungle you might imagine how the story might have played out in hong kong instead or on a farm would the story have had to be different would those settings changed the characters what if it had been set in japan during the shogun dynasty would the historical context changed it hope that helps Romeo and Juliet Chinese character Shakespeare on screen Upton Sinclair Social psychology Wuxia Drama The Book of Five Rings Martial art West Side Story Extreme Programming Confucianism Shogun Juliet Simplified Chinese character Samurai Deeper Kyo James Clavell Feudalism Philosophy of language Writing system Theory of conduct Yu-Gi-Oh!
