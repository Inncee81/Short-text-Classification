scared of the dentist i went to the dentist about weeks ago due to a toothache he told me that i needed to have root canal done and gave me some antibiotics which i took they didnt take away the pain so i went back he gave me another lot of antibiotics and i have just finished taking them and the pain still hasnt gone its more weeks till i can have the root canal theres no way i can go to another dentist as im registered with him and have to have a years worth of treatment before i can change there is a way to get rid of the pain completely by having the tooth pulled but im too scared to have a needle please dont say your not alone as i already know that and it doesnt help solve this they wont let me have gas either and im only and dont want to have a gap in my mouth from where the tooth was what should i do the biggest accomplishment i have is getting over my fear of the dentist i feared the dentist like the plague and never went for years a saying from my mum is your teeth are your best investment and i believe that to be true your teeth generally are the first thing people notice even more so if you have terrible teeth and something you'll need for the rest of your life now is your chance to look at keeping them and looking after them honestly what's the worse that can happen you feel a little prick in your mouth and the you go numb you get paper cuts that sting much worse i manage a small team and two team members were also as scared to go as i used to be my suggestion take the day off work to have it done and enjoy your time off you'll feel much better for having it done and really think why you worried so much about such a small inconvenience you can do it hope this helped Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mouth ulcer Dental caries Textile manufacturing RuneScape quests 2000 Australian Grand Prix Babe Ruth Glen Jacobs Milton H.
