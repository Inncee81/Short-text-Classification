how can i cure bleeding gums ok i did not have the best oral hygene when i was younger and it seems as though my gums have always been inflamed and irritated but i do brush and floss regularly now but my gums still bleed very easily what can i do without having to visit the dentist a very traditional and reliable method of helping gums become firmer is to rinse gargle with salt water mix several tablespoons of table salt into a glass of tap water and swish the salt water solution in the closed mouth for one and one half minutes three times a day it will take two weeks to see the results however the results are far more effective than conventional over the counter remedies which in my opinion are overpriced also do not buy a firm toothbrush but instead use one with very soft bristles Halitosis Tooth Toothbrush Gingivitis Dental caries Oral hygiene Dentistry Psoriasis Dental floss Plastic Methamphetamine Bulk vending Diarrhea Bread Tofu Dietary fiber Vinegar Homeopathy Hydrogen peroxide Collodion process Rehydration Acne Dishwasher Charles Goodyear Stomach cancer Oral sex Kosher foods Hiccup Listerine Cyanide First aid Oral cancer Sodium chloride Ammonia Brush Warfarin Gum arabic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Medical prescription Electrolyte Dental brace Traumatic brain injury Cheese Common cold Yarrow Electrophysiology Mattress Eczema Toothpaste Nasal congestion Hangul Salt Acetic acid The Dentist Bleeding Gums Murphy Fluoride therapy Anthrax Casting Bong Hamster Shaving Sterling silver Body piercing Haggis Marine aquarium Sauerkraut Sea-Monkey Menstrual cycle Bladderwort Sodium Topps Chewing gum Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Flax Breastfeeding Hydrochloric acid Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Edible salt Vernon Schillinger Urticaria Sodium hypochlorite Koala Magnesium Cocaine Oral contraceptive Decompression sickness Leukemia Water Hard water Glossitis Ham Sewage treatment Dentures Lodge Committee Electric motor
