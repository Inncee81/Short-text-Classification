i lost my top retainer i was at a carnival last night and my retainer was in its case in my purse all night but when i got home only the bottom retainer was in there idk how it happened but i know that my dad will kill me if i tell him my teeth havent moved at all over night and ive forgotten to wear my retainer before for a few days at a time and only my bottom teeth shifted is it worth all the money to get it replaced your gonna have to tell your dad he might get made at you but when he is calmed down he will probably get you a new one so your teeth don't get messed up again and he would have to pay even more to get you braces again Dental brace Bottom (television) Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Drill bit Dad's Army Manual transmission The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Orthodontics Wheel of Fortune Make money fast Poker jargon AFI 100 Years series Grandview, U.S.A.
