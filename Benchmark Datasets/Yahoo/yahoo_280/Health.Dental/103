dental hygienist i need info about it like i'm thinking of a major that i can do for college and i heard this one being good in money and it wont take that long in brief i will really thank you if you can give me more info about this carrer and if i could also become a dentist after i become a dental hygienist thanks dental hygienee is a great career if it is something that you really like and are interested in the thing about dental hygien programs that do not include a regular bachelors degree is that they really are only good for dental hygiene as far as time goes as long as you can get into a program it takes at least years however it is hard to get into many programs so there is often a waiting list after you get in and graduate you still have to pass the boars after another thing that you need to think about is that because it is a licensed profession you can only work in the state that you have a license if you want to move to somewhere else you will have to take that states tests the states all have different laws and things that the hygienist can do and you will have to be educated about those things also while it is only a yr program you will have to keep up with new information with continuing education programs many employers will pay for these classes but not all of them will if you do not keep up with these and get enough credits each year you can loose your license over all its a great profession but not something you should choose because its quick in school and makes good money its a lot of work and you have to love people and working with them and care about their health or it wont be worth what you can make best of luck in whatever you choose Dentistry Oral hygiene Baylor College of Dentistry Physician Nurse Lawyer Juris Doctor Graduate school Doctorate Dental hygienist Education in the United States Education in Australia Architect Education in Germany Tooth Medical University of South Carolina Temple University Columbia University Chinese University of Hong Kong Tooth enamel University of Indonesia Education in Canada Publicly funded medicine Paralegal Medicare (Canada) General practitioner Kwantlen University College No Child Left Behind Act Social work Software engineering National Health Service Education in the People's Republic of China Education Medical school Dental caries Insurance University of Michigan Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences University of New England, Maine Seton Hall University University of Connecticut Law school Student loan University of Maryland, Baltimore Pitaten Health profession Education in Sweden The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Teacher Public policy Methamphetamine Social rule Medical prescription Bachelor of Arts Community college Grade (education) Master of Laws Gwinnett University Center Stony Brook University Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Credit card Tufts University Georgetown University Health care in the United States Northeastern University, Boston Driver's license University of Central Florida Education in Finland College admissions Education in Hong Kong Education in the Republic of Ireland City and Guilds of London Institute Harvard University Bologna process Monopoly (game) University of Phoenix Canadian and American health care systems compared Affirmative action GNU General Public License Academic degree Chiropractic Dental brace Health care in Canada Emerson College Copyright law of the United Kingdom Athabasca University Athletic trainer Canada Health Act Education in Japan Child support Health insurance Social Security (United States) Florida State University Education in Romania Crown (dentistry) Air Education and Training Command GED
