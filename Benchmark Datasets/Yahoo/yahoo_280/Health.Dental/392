crest whitestrips thinking about using the crest white strips how do you use them you simply dry off your upper and lower front teeth and then place a thin strip on them to wear for hour it is best not to drink eat or talk excessively while using or they may move some gel will get in the mouth but not be harmful to you overall i would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the crest whitestrips some more than others the results are usually pretty quick noticeable in the first few days best in a week or longer our office uses crest supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more vs you can purchase the drugstore version but if you can do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup tartar or plaque will impede their ability to work also don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on same reason the strips are probably your best low price alternative much less than in office whitening or custom trays about i am also hearing happy reviews with the aquafresh whitening trays unlike the strips they don't have the tendency to slip or move all of the methods strips trays custom trays in office whitening have the potential to make your teeth temporarily sensitive but will not harm the enamel if you get sensitive use the product every other day in conjunction with a sensitive tooth toothpaste you might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again good luck jamrdh a dental hygienist Fluoride therapy Tooth Toothpaste Fluoride Hydrogen peroxide Dental brace Oral hygiene Mouth ulcer Plastic Explosive material Cocaine Transformer Tooth bleaching Microeconomics Oral sex Dairy Psoriasis Japanese tea ceremony Equine conformation Inflation Dentures Breastfeeding Maxilla Coffee Supply and demand Cosmetic dentistry Tobacco Bong Drill bit Hamster Insurance Mattress Allergy Crown (dentistry) Textile manufacturing Tetrapod Domestic rabbit Hypoglycemia Western blot Coeliac disease Theory of conduct Coca-Cola Bicycle lighting Insulin Menstrual cup Chewing gum Titanium Chocolate Diamond enhancement Welding Illegal drug trade Sento The Legend of Zelda series enemies Social rule Upholstery Urinary incontinence Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Chronic fatigue syndrome Microphone Poker jargon Deflation (economics) Growth hormone treatment Agarose gel electrophoresis Nutrition Audio data compression Fancy rat Vampire Medical analysis of circumcision Free trade RuneScape weapons Rum Motor oil Corrosion Severe weather terminology (United States) Siphon Food Houseplant Knife Prostate cancer Economics Customs and etiquette of Japan Androgen insensitivity syndrome Pottery IPod Sewage treatment Ultraviolet Overclocking Hygiene
