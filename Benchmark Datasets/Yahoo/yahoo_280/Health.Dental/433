i just started grinding my teeth two weeks ago how can i stop i didn't even notice i was doing it at first until my teeth started hurting i think i'm doing it because of stress are there any tricks i can do to stop myself it's only been going on for a couple of weeks or should i just go and see my dentist i just saw him for a cleaning check up a couple months ago so i'm not due for an appointment for awhile try chewing sugar free gum it'll distract your teeth if you do it at night go to a dentist and have a plastic retainer or tooth guard made for your teeth i also think they sell products to stop teeth grinding at night but i wouldn't rely on something not designed for my teeth Chewing gum Dentures Dental caries Dental brace Gingivitis Hamster Dentistry Bruxism Tooth enamel Fancy rat Plastic Marilyn Monroe Topps Tobacco Eddie Guerrero Oral hygiene Cocaine Halitosis Dental floss Domestic rabbit Drill bit Manual transmission Dog training The Dentist Journey (band) Toothbrush New England Patriots Mouth ulcer Nine Inch Nails Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Traumatic incident reduction Meat Loaf Orthodontics First aid Bubblegum Wisdom teeth The Apprentice 2 Kim Possible Hun-Apu Janet Jackson Mojave people Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Richard Rahl Polyols Root canal Negima FoxTrot Tetrapod Skateboard Shark Tenshinhan Raisin Piccolo Junior Saga Diamonds Are Forever Ocean's Twelve Queen (band) Dental fillings Vernon Schillinger Dirty Weekend The Inside Breastfeeding Certified Nursing Assistant Satchel Paige Motor oil Sawfiler Street-Legal Late Night with Conan O'Brien Futurama (TV series - season 3) Torquay United F.C.
