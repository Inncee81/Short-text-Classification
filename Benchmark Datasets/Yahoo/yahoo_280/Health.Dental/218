how long does it hurt when you first get braces hi i just got braces today and i wanted to know how long it hurts and hurts to eat hello i had braces for and a half years i don't anymore but i still remember lots about having them for me they hurt for probably a week then they were okay but i took it easy for probably weeks and then i hardly noticed them my friend recently got braces though and they didn't hurt her at all so i guess it all depends on you as a person your tolerance to pain and what braces you have got some hurt more than others but generaly speaking they shouldn't hurt for longer than a week like extreme pain and you should be able to eat close to normal after a week i think the best thing to do is to get your teeth used to eating with braces as soon as possible hope that helped best of luck with the braces i miss mine Social rule Theory of conduct Jon Secada Barbed wire Drill bit The Fairly OddParents Rich Mullins Bracket Hurt (song) Shaggy dog story Year of the Spider Carpal tunnel syndrome Bart Sells His Soul Anderson Cooper Kim Possible Spidey Super Stories Breastfeeding Sharon Tate Nine Inch Nails Equine conformation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hiberno-English Blood on the Tracks Carpenters Pitaten The Shining (film) Characters in the Smurfs The Emancipation of Mimi Insulin Password The Basement Tapes Billboard Hot 100 Yogiisms Last Exit to Springfield Evil Richard Rahl Dental brace Kodocha Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Stuttering The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy EastEnders Mutha's Day Out C programming language Etiquette Garfield Doom enemies Alcoholics Anonymous One Tree Hill (TV series) Cindy Sheehan Hip hop rivalries Recumbent bicycle Reggie White Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Stone Cold Steve Austin Skinhead Spanish verbs Maison Ikkoku Ron Weasley Syntax highlighting Mortification of the flesh Glen Jacobs Recurring South Park characters Timon and Pumbaa The Inside Transactional analysis Pain Tooth Aerial (dance move) Diving The Apprentice 2 Snake Fruits Basket Little Britain Cro Stomach cancer Time Out of Mind Liam Gallagher Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gia Carangi Scoliosis Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Indent style Philip J.
