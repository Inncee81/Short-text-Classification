david beckham was it for hype or an actual chance of winning he has the number one jersey sales in the united states outsells any other sports figure in the world but has the us fans seen him play or they just heard of him and seen him pose in my opinion beckham is here for the money dont believe the bs about bringing soccer to america the usa has the largest youth soccer in the world but when it comes to the big game with big talent they just suck no coaching skills by an american when is the last time you heard of an american male soccer star beckham will play for england but as for his heart being in the mls only money would keep it beating the question is what is david beckham there for answer for the money and fame but he's so damn rich and famous already answer for purely football reasons even worse bull as if a player thinks that going from real madrid to la galaxy is a step up answer to change american's perspective on soccer and generate more interest hopefully in future americans would love soccer as much as they love their nba of course it's answer sure even a rich man would love to get even richer but we can all assume that money is not the number one reason for becks to come to mls it might be just one of the many other minor reasons the main and most important reason is because becks thinks that he can or has the potential to make soccer in america much more popular than its current level of interest this is where his fame comes in he is so famous through out the world probably even more so than football legend pele though not for footballing reasons i'm sure even americans who claim they have never heard of this name must feel curious and wonder why is this man so damn famous that is already what david beckham wanted to make even non soccer fans become curious and interested that was his aim and he has achieved that already the mls is already generating interest and money like never before and no one can deny that david beckham is the main catalyst for this change beckham is not the snob that everyone makes him out to be he is just an english lad wanting to give the best in whatever he does in this case it's football and hopefully achieve his aim he might be over ambitious in thinking that he can single handedly make soccer very popular in america during his time there but at least he did create much more interest and publicity for american soccer he did what so many before him failed to do so to answer your question david beckham's arrival at the mls was indeed hype but more than that he was trying to make soccer popular in america it was not a personal agenda abouting earning fat millions or signing autographs it was for the good of football he did not want to conquer america he wanted football to conquer america David Beckham Major League Soccer Spice Girls Manchester United F.C.
