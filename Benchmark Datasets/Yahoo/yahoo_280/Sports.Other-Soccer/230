making varsity okay im a freshman and pretty much im trying out for varsity there is no jv team because there aren't enough people and the varsity has only people the coach keeps compimenting me when im not listening i really want to play varsity soccer this year even if i am on the bench i am decent at soccer im not great but im also ' and im lol but anyways what can i do to have a chance at varsity i always try but im playing against people that are ' and its hard to defend them on that small a team it's almost a guarantee that you'll make it i say this because soccer is a game with a lot of injuries if two people run into each other during practice and hurt each other even for one game you're down to only one sub and it's good to have all the warm bodies you can fit on a roster making the team will not be an issue especially if the coach compliments you being a starter however may be difficult i hate to be a downer but your height will work against you to counteract this you will need to be fast and strong you need to weightlift and run hills or you will get eaten the fact is though you will make the team simply because you are alive and willing as long as your coach isn't a complete moron Indiana Pacers Baseball Football (soccer) Georgia Institute of Technology Toronto Raptors Washington State University Junior varsity 1957 World Series New York Knicks Norway national football team Los Angeles Clippers Cincinnati Bengals Pittsburgh Steelers National Hockey League All-Star Game Major League Soccer Vince Lombardi Yao Ming National Basketball Association Orlando Magic New York Giants Carolina Panthers Steve Nash Cleveland Browns Tulane University Ice hockey Theory of conduct Sandy Koufax Sport Football (soccer) positions Extreme Programming Formation (football) Toronto Blue Jays The Mighty Ducks (movies) Major League Baseball All-Star Game Southeastern Conference Paintball Toronto Lynx Glossary of American football Duke University Volleyball Football Fast bowling Fencing New York Jets One Tree Hill (TV series) Houston Nutt Babe Ruth American football Ultimate (sport) St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXV Virginia Commonwealth University Quake III Arena Star Trek Customizable Card Game Salary cap New Mexico Lobo Basketball Moe Berg Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ty Cobb University of Tennessee Bowl Championship Series Memorial Stadium, Clemson Water polo Detroit Pistons Seventh Sea (collectible card game) American Youth Soccer Organization Ben Johnson (athlete) Sheepshead Team Fortress Classic Luther Head Brian Close Equine conformation Ricky Ray NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 College soccer Iwan Thomas Rugby union positions Boston College Athletics Toronto Blizzard Table tennis NBA Finals Varsity Stadium Kansas City Chiefs FIFA Series Diving suit History of Test cricket (to 1883) American football strategy Canadian Interuniversity Sport Field hockey Super Bowl V FC Rostov Detroit Red Wings 2005 World Series Seattle Mariners Brazil national football team Poker jargon 2004-05 NHL lockout Oakland Raiders Lou Gehrig
