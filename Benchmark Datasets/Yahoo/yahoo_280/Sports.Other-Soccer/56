soccer juggling help i have been juggling the soccer ball for almost a year now and max out at about touches before the ball hits the ground this has been my max for about months what could i do to take it to the next level and starting getting more like or touches before it touches the ground i also want to incorporate my thighs to make my juggling more complete but for some reason i can't find any consistency at all juggling with my thighs any help is appreciated ok i've been doing soccer since i could walk so all you need to do is keep practicing even if it gets hard or boring that's the biggest way to accomplish your goal but juggling with your thighs is very easy all you need to do is switch back and forth between the two when juggling starting out on one thigh will help then eventually switch back and forth keep doing this till you get really good then eventually you'll be able to do it with your thighs feet and head altogether d Aerial (dance move) Baseball Volleyball Fast bowling American football Toss juggling Tag Breaststroke Glossary of ballet terms Strap-on dildo Softball Field hockey Laws of cricket Rugby union Mills Mess Four square Canadian football Professional wrestling holds Glossary of American football Devil sticks Broomball Major League Soccer Skateboarding trick Equine conformation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mixed martial arts Salute Table tennis Indoor soccer Batting (cricket) Basketball Mortal Kombat Football Ultimate (sport) Akuma (Street Fighter) Badminton Baseball statistics Horse gait Dog training 1957 World Series Super Mario Bros.
