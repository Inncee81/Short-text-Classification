explain why a naughty or time out chair is not appropriate as positive discipline strategy guiding behaviour i was asked to explain why a time out chaire is not appripriate and is in fact not recommended for use in a child care setting in canada as a positive discipline strategy instead my submitted a how to guide to using time out just to clarify the time out chair is used in canadian preschools however the time to be alloted for the child during time out should not exceed his her age for example a child who is three should not be on the time out chair for more that minutes this strategy is more of a negative reinforcement because sitting away from his her friends is not an enjoyable feeling isolating the child should be done immediately after an undesirable action but there should be an adult to explain to the child why he she will be isolated time out gives the child a moment to think and reflect about his her actions however if there is no explanation given to the child about his her punishment the child might not be able to see what his her time out is for a time out is truly a negative reinforcement it is a punishment given after an unacceptable behavior examples of positive reinforcements telling the child that you will give him her a good mark stamp or star or sticker or a reward present if he she finishes his her work or is he she does not bite a classmate whatever behavior is being avoided for that day giving a hug or simply a high five when he she does something positively expressing your own feelings for example a child hit a classmate the teacher can say to the child do you think that is nice i felt sad when you hit name of the classmate do you like me to be sad you know what i think i will be really happy if you hug him her instead of hitting and then show the child how to hug and say sorry to the classmate he she hit there are so many ways to reinforce children sometimes it's for the teacher to find out ways and means to discipline them Spanking Infantilism Theory of conduct Happiness Motivation Nicomachean Ethics Punishment Reinforcement Transactional analysis Social psychology Alexander Technique Second language acquisition Prisoner's dilemma __mile Durkheim Avenue Q Efficiency wages Past teachings of Prem Rawat Dog training Physical intimacy Ludwig Wittgenstein Altruism Graduate school Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Child time-out Transsexuality Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microeconomics Empathy Hikikomori Education in Japan Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus School discipline Poker jargon Economics Sexual orientation Behaviorism Addiction Burrhus Frederic Skinner Singlish Columbine High School massacre Milton H.
