is there any way to increase your chances of getting the dream fastpass at disneyland ca my friend and i are going tomorrow any ways we can increase our chances nope it is totally random however from people i know that have gotten them they seem to be given out earlier in the day and usually have just come off a ride in order to give people time to use them so probably around opening somewhere in the park will be the best chance if you have park hoppers you can also head to california adventure at their opening and take a walk around to see if you see any dream squad cast members but even if you don't win be sure to take advantage of the regular fastpass especially on splash mountain and space mountain Disneyland Star Tours Walt Disney World Resort Happiest Homecoming on Earth Disneyland Resort Paris Disney's California Adventure Space Mountain Tomorrowland Magic Kingdom Amusement park Splash Mountain Disneyland Resort Soarin' Over California DisneySpeak Walt Disney Hong Kong Disneyland The Haunted Mansion Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Aerial (dance move) Disneyland Monorail System The Walt Disney Company Big Thunder Mountain Railroad Water park California Screamin' The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Remember...
