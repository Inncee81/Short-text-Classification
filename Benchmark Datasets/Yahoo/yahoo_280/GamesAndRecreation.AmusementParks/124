day trip to disneyland with teenager tips tricks i plan to take my year old to disneyland on saturday sunday i need some tips on making the best use of the fastpass the fun rides for teenagers the most efficient way to get to the rides that we like thanks go left why most people are right handed and naturally start off at their right side or those with small kids head straight into the castle for all the small kid rides i usually start with indiana jones then pirates splash moutian haunted mansion then i hop the train do a whole round the park and stay on one extra exit into toon town i ride the roger rabit cars yep its kiddie but it's fun and then get on the materhorn the line that starts closer to the kids alice in wonderland ride on the right from the entrance always seems to be shorter since it's closer to the kids area after that i check out the indy cars that line is always long and the fast pass helps about here and check the line for space mountian i get a fass pass for later on space mountian if the line is really long then its about lunchtime so sometime the line is short and then i head out of the park going left and walk a half a block to the mcdonald's right there accross the street enjoy my meal have an ice cream yep they got the dollar menu after lunch i stroll back to the park and do the indy cars and space mountian if i hadn't had a chance earlier i also usually do star tours because the line has really shortened by now for the rest of the afternoon i usualy just enjoy the atmosphere and maybe try to jump back on indiana jones by going as single riders your group gets broken up but hey you already rode it once together late afternoon i do big thunder mountian the line gets really short around dusk and maybe dumbo and a few kids rides i get a chimichanga or turkey leg from the cart across from the materhorn and maybe torture myself but i love it with small world then i head over to in front of the lake to find a seat for fantasmic if you get there about an hour or minuites before showtime there is a grouping of tables that are ment for seating for the fast food restraunt there that serves funnel cakes and such many people are just eating and if you keep an eye on those they will get up and leave the area and you can snag seating rather than stand while waiting for the show my hubby and i take turns on who's going potty and we usually pick up some hot chocolate and maybe a funnelcake to snack on while waiting for the show when fantasmic begins you may need to stand but don't stand on the chairs unless you kid is realy short so you don't block those behind you after that we really have seen and done most of the major things and we might wrap it up with a few of the smaller kids rides mr toads wild ride is really fun or we just head on out we stayed away from shopping all day carrying things or putiing them for later pickup in a long line is a hassle so we step right out onto downtown disney and the first shop is a big disney store that has just about anything you can find in the park and we spend a little time looking around there before we head home ps its just me and my hubby no kids so we concetrate on the big stuff if you are doing a hopper not really recommended since dl really takes a few day head over to ca adventure in the late afternoon and the lines for the few good rides there tower of terror the coaster soarin' and the swinging carts on the faris wheel are shorter the park is much smaller and anyone who planned on doing a full day in there has already done everything and left good luck and have fun Magic Kingdom Walt Disney World Resort Skateboarding trick Walt Disney Hersheypark Amusement park Indianapolis 500 DisneySpeak Alton Towers The Family from One End Street Swingout The Haunted Mansion Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shaggy dog story Disney-MGM Studios Indiana Jones Adventure RuneScape quests Equine conformation Epcot Professional wrestling holds MTR Disneyland Resort Paris Audio-Animatronics The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tiny Toon Adventures Trailer Park Boys Coney Island Professional wrestling throws The Walt Disney Company Spidey Super Stories The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cuisine of Denmark Textile manufacturing Tokyo Disney Resort The Phantom Manor Recess (TV series) Bicycle Drag racing The Amazing Race Roller coaster Space Mountain The Fairly OddParents Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Professional wrestling attacks Pittsburgh Steelers Indiana Jones Volleyball Hey Arnold!
