can i transfer a time warner dvr recording to an ipod i have so many shows recorded from my dvr box and its too full so i want to transfer them to my ipod how do i do that yes you can if you load the dvr into your dvd readable compatible disk drive open explorer not internet just the actual computers one find the disk drive and click on it on some computers it will actually play the dvd if it does this then right click the disk drive and click either open or explore after that copy the files onto a free program called gp convertor which can convert mpg avi mpeg etc to ipod psp mobile other files which are compatible with the products go onto google and type in gp convertor and it will be on the first page once loaded less than mb extract the zip files and click setup exe which will configure the type of file you want to change it to it might be in japanese but you can change to different languages in a drop box near the bottom after that it will be on the drag and drop screen where you can set the quality higher quality will be a bit slower and lower quality will be a bit faster and the out put folder where the new file will be saved you can chage to where ever you want once it has reached if you have itunes open it will add the file automatically to the itunes movies section where once you have connected your ipod you can drag from there and drop onto your ipod i tunes will then copy file to ipod if you have ipod syncing then once connected it wil automatically copy itself to your ipod i hope this has helped but i use this program because it is less than megabyte and it is fast and efficient and free PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 Digital video recorder Apple Computer Floppy disk Windows XP USB flash drive AmigaOS Digital rights management DVD ILife IPod shuffle Apple Macintosh MP3 Macromedia Flash Redundant array of independent disks ITunes Music Store Virtual memory Macintosh Finder Podcasting Apple typography Screenshot Windows Vista Hard disk Gramophone record Emacs Gmail Warez FireWire Zip drive System/36 File system Btrieve CPU design QuickTime Online music store NeXT Atari 8-bit family Forth programming language Disk image Mouse (computing) Walkman Commodore 64 Creative Zen High-definition television IBM PC compatible NTFS PlayStation 3 Knoppix DV Ebook IPod nano PlayStation 2 FairPlay BitTorrent Early IBM disk storage Advanced Audio Coding Apple II family Visual Basic IMac File Allocation Table IBM PC System/34 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Hello world program Data General Nova Xbox Windows 3.x Mozilla Firefox Embedded system Computer Common Unix Printing System Amstrad CPC Universal Serial Bus Vorbis Bluetooth ZX Spectrum X86 assembly language Compact disc Enterprise content management TRS-80 Manual transmission SonicStage Mac OS X Master Control Program Flash memory Digital photography System 7 (Macintosh) Skype History of Microsoft Windows Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mac OS X v10.4 Loudspeaker
