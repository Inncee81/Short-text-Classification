how do i get start acting props to alex b for the info i can see that there those in the know here that try to help the masses of uninformed people asking about how to get started in acting i just wanted to add something that i think is important for aspiring actors to know even after you move to los angeles get an apartment study acting get your photos and resumes together you still have to get an agent i was recently doing business at a medium sized agency in la and saw the mail being brought in for the day my eyes almost popped out of my head there were thousands of yellow manila x envelopes when i asked one of the agents how many they get each day she just pointed at all the envelopes and said this is a slow day they have people working there who do nothing but sort through the submissions and they were telling me that they can't even open all of the submissions and many just get tossed in the garbage when i started out in this business back in my agent used to only get a few dozen submissions each day now there are so many many more people in la trying to make it and the number of new people coming into the city starting out far outnumber those who are leaving now even when you do get a sag card which costs plus annual dues and actually sign with an agent reality really sets in because you will be lucky to get or auditions a month and that does not include call backs and nd call backs things have changed quite a bit in the last years work is becoming more and more scarce not only because there are tons more people trying but also because there are way fewer shows to work on there is just a fraction of shows to work on now compared to years ago just look at all of the prime time game shows and reality shows and there are a huge number of productions and filming being done in toronto and vancouver now it's called runaway production and it is a huge problem in hollywood right now so as i have stated before i never try to discourage someone from chasing their dreams god knows i dropped out of college and chased my dream but i just can't stand to see people with these great false expectations and seeing them in so much pain and frustration after reality sets in i love people and i really love to see people happy and successful i am only attempting to do my part in getting some real information out there before people dive in head first and then realize there is no water in the pool peace out alan note to tony below i liked your link you have some very useful and insightful information plus you aren't trying to suck money from newcomers or give false hopes i admire that very much The Inside Sharon Tate Wheel of Fortune Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Plame affair Economics Cordelia Chase Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Let's Make a Deal Kevin Smith Days of our Lives Hollywood, Los Angeles, California National Football League Toronto Blue Jays Past teachings of Prem Rawat Humphrey Bogart Spam (electronic) Oplan Bojinka New York Giants Jon Secada Battle of the Bulge 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Meat Loaf Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Gross domestic product 2000 Australian Grand Prix Our Gang Professional wrestling throws Theory of conduct Whose Line Is It Anyway?
