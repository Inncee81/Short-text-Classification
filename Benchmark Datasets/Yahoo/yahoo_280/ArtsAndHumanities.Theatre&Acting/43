describe to me the typical sequence of events from the moment a director meets an actor to the start of the shoot also a little information on how that particular actor came to be the one there being interviewed or auditioned would be interesting ie are they friends of friends are they someone youve seen in a film or on tv and youve contacted their agent are they a bunch of actors a casting director has sent you that they think might be suitable basically what is involved in the selection process and what sorts of things do you do with the actors up untill shooting begins theatre gurl is right there are too many variants including all that you mentioned in your question it's too much of a discussion the platonic version would be that the production company gives the casting director a breakdown for each character to be cast they send those descriptions out through breakdown services and agents receive those breakdowns they then look through them to see who amongst their client fit the bill they submit to the cd pic res for the clients that fir the general descriptions and wait to see if the cd thinks that they might work as well if they both agree then auditions are scheduled if the audition goes well callbacks are scheduled depending on how many the cd needs to narrow it down to there could be a couple of callbacks before the director and producers are called in to see the actors read at this point there may be say actors to see for each role or only it really varies here the actors read the scenes and make small talk with everyone up until this point those in charge need to see if the actor can not only play the role the way they want but see if this is a person they can work with for an extended amount of time they're also matching you up with costars and seeing who makes the best couple or family or what have you sometimes you don't get a part because the other guy looked more like the mom or something like that it's nothing personal your final audition if it's for a pilot usually includes network execs that's kind of scary a bunch of people in suits and the atmosphere can be kind of stiff but you have to work the room they want to like you so let them get the idea Sharon Tate Enterprise content management Filmmaking Friends Call centre Knots Landing Extras (sitcom) Scientology beliefs and practices Elijah Wood Little Britain The Inside Casting (performing arts) Financial audit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus John F.
