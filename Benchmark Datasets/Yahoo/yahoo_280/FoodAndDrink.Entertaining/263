i am planning a surprise party for my friend what should i do she's going to be and i want to do something special just because really i need to do something she'd really like but i have no ideas she will be having a party already so i need to do something different i don't know whether to do something really simple and just have a theme to it or what please help just be there for her you are a really good friend to think of her this way she must be really special don't let yourself be absent on her birthday unless you have a really good reason you are her friend and you know what she must really like try to remember all your memories with her and maybe you can find from it you an answer is she like a best friend of yours because during my sister's th birthday her best friend since they were at least yrs old came late at least minutes and when her best friend showed up my sister was really happy she almost ignored others whom she invited for at least minutes i'm not saying you must do the same way because people are different your friend may not like if you do the same Birthday Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show 50 First Dates Avenue Q Pok__mon Live!
