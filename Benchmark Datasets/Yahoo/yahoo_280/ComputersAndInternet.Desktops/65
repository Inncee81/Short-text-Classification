can you completely upgrade your computer while keeping your hard drives and os installed i have xp on my primary and other files on my slave drive i am installing a new motherboard cpu memory and video cards sli can i keep my current drives without having to start w a fresh os in theory you can and windows xp will update drivers however you would be better off backing up any important files or anything you want to keep and then wipe the hard drive or at least the partition with windows and install windows fresh because either way you still have to reactivate your copy of windows because of major hardware changes Windows 2000 Personal computer Microsoft Windows Linux Windows Vista AmigaOS Knoppix History of Microsoft Windows ATI Technologies IMac Apple IIGS Apple Macintosh Windows 3.x Booting Virtual memory IBM PC compatible Partition (computing) Hard disk BIOS Amiga IPod Commodore 64 Windows Me DOS File Allocation Table Disk cloning Computer Redundant array of independent disks Mac OS X Computer hardware Atari ST 64-bit Creative Zen System 7 (Macintosh) Modchip Object Desktop Xbox File system Floppy disk PlayStation 2 Scalable Link Interface Commodore PET IBM PC ZX Spectrum NTFS Btrieve 3dfx CPU cache Advanced Technology Attachment Computer forensics MS-DOS Apple II family Universal Serial Bus Windows Server 2003 NX bit USB flash drive Computer bus GeForce 6 Series Blue screen of death Mach kernel TRS-80 Color Computer DragonFly BSD Power Macintosh G3 Mandriva Linux QuickTime Commodore 128 PlayStation 3 DirectX Atari 8-bit family Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NForce4 OpenBSD ITunes Graphics processing unit History of operating systems Copy protection FreeDOS Spyware Flash memory Overclocking Macintosh Finder Computer storage MSN Messenger LiveCD DR-DOS PC motherboard BBC Micro PlayStation Portable Steam (content delivery) Fritz-chip MAME PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Sound card Windows 95 IBook USB mass storage device class
