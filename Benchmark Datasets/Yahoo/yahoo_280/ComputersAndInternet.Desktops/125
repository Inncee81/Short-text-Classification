wots apning all of a sudden out of the blue my pc keeps making a lot of noise ever heard a up real close preparing for take off wtf never did this before only if lots of progs running at the same time any tips really starting to bug me now p s i'm a real generous guy i'll give for remedy i suspect the noise is most likely coming from the fan on your cpu processor as it seems to happen when lots of programmes are running it means the cpu is working harder and generating more heat and so the fan spins faster to keep the cpu cool if you open up your computers case with the power cord unplugged at the mains you will probably find that the cpu fan is caked in dust if it is then you will probably have found the culprit i can't guarantee that the remedy will work as the fan may already be damaged in which case you will need a new fan however i've done this for friends with a similar problem many times with about a success rate very carefully remove as much of the dust as you can with a vacuum cleaner with the smallest nozzle you have preferably a plastic one and try not to touch anything on the motherboard next before closing up the case plug the mains back in and test the machine with luck the noise will have significantly reduced if not then on to stage unplug from the mains again and carefully unscrew the fan from the heatsink below it which itself will probably have dust clogged between its fins again use the vacuum cleaner and a new clean paintbrush to dislodge the stubborn stuff once you're happy you've removed all you can from from the heatsink use the brush on the fan to get even more muck off of it screw the fan back in place and test again if that doesn't do it then i'm afraid stage involves spending money unless you have installed a heatsink and fan before then you would be best to take your computer to a local computer shop not high street chains or pc world as a chimp at the zoo could do a better job and get them to fit a new heat sink and fan for you Overclocking Central processing unit CPU cooling Commodore 64 CPU design Computer cooling Heat sink Hard disk RISC Carburetor Drill bit CPU cache Vacuum cleaner Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jet engine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Cray-1 BS 1363 Bong IBM PC compatible Thermal power station Nintendo Entertainment System Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Computer bus Internal ballistics Personal computer Universal Serial Bus Dry cleaning Computer Sinclair ZX81 Electric motor Computer multitasking Circuit breaker Microprocessor IPod Northbridge (computing) Mouse (computing) Spark plug Embedded system Capacitor plague Cathode ray tube Vacuum tube Diesel engine Coffee CDC 6600 W.
