what is better amd or intel pentinum i have amd amd or intel pentinum what's better is open to interpretation since i'm writing to you on a notebook that has an amd processor and cost me less than it was selling for at walmart and even more savings over buying an equivelent intel system i feel that in my case amd was the better choice for me i've built many systems in the past and after discussing cost vs speed with the persons or businesses i was building for more often amd was chosen over intel just for it's lower cost even though it's minutely slower than intel intel chips are and have historically been more expensive and slightly faster even when compairing the top of the line chip to the top of the line amd chip the speed differences in chips are barely noticable however the two companies continue to wage war against one another for the top spot in pc chip manufacturer it seems that whenever amd bests intel intel responds with a faster cpu and amd follows it's an ever changing game years ago there was the rumor that amd cpu's were unstable compared to intel chips i've never seen any proof of this and i've built many amd systems what's better the one you have and works wether its' amd or intel i hope you found this usefull marcos CPU cache AMD Cyrix Central processing unit IBM PC compatible RISC Microprocessor Computer workstation CPU design Athlon Intel Overclocking AMD K6-2 VIA Technologies Opteron Apple Intel transition AMD 5x86 IA-32 NVIDIA Wintel AMD K6-III PR rating Am386 Sun Microsystems Apple Macintosh Transmeta MIPS architecture Moore's law Timeline of computing 1990-forward Clock rate Laptop Integrated circuit X86 Dual-core VIA C3 AMD64 NeXT Pentium III Intel 80386 AMD K6 MOS Technology 6502 64-bit Athlon 64 GeForce 6 Series Front side bus Computer Benchmark (computing) 3dfx MOS Technology X86 assembly language HyperTransport Pentium M AMD K5 Pentium History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Personal computer DDR2 SDRAM Symmetric multiprocessing Intel 80486 PlayStation 3 IBM PC Atari 8-bit family Embedded system Motorola 68000 AltiVec IA-64 NX bit Redundant array of independent disks Commodore 128 Northbridge (computing) Zilog Z80 Athlon 64 X2 Digital Equipment Corporation Windows XP Acorn Computers Radeon DEC Alpha Coprocessor Buffer overflow Nintendo Revolution Commodore 64 IMac Duron ATI Technologies Tandem Computers Intel iAPX 432 Microsoft Windows Microcontroller Linux
