what is the advantage of a pentium to a celeron processor with identical processing speed what is the difference between a pentium and a celeron the main difference is celeron are budget cheaper version of pentium chip i e cheaper but less performance compare to its pentium brother core the celeron chip is based on a pentium core cache celeron chips have less cache memory than pentium chips do a celeron might have kilobytes of l cache while a pentium can have four times that the amount of l cache memory can have a big effect on performance clock speed intel manufactures the pentium chips to run at a higher clock speed than celeron chips the fastest pentium might be percent faster than the fastest celeron bus speed there are differences in the maximum bus speeds that the processors allow pentium s tend to be about percent faster than celerons CPU cache AMD Pentium M RISC Athlon Pentium Microprocessor Xeon Pentium D CPU design Clock rate Cyrix Pentium Pro NVIDIA AMD K6-III Timeline of computing 1990-forward PowerPC NetBurst Front side bus Radeon PC motherboard PR rating Northbridge (computing) ATI Technologies 3dfx Itanium 2 MIPS architecture Apple Macintosh GeForce 6 Series Intel i860 IBM PC compatible 64-bit Overclocking GeForce 4 AMD K5 Athlon 64 DEC Alpha Hyper-threading Cell (microprocessor) Conroe Symmetric multiprocessing AMD 5x86 Duron NX bit Xbox AMD64 Dynamic random access memory Sequent Computer Systems Intel P8 MOS Technology 6502 Intel 80486 X86 assembly language X86 Apple Intel transition Moore's law Radeon X Series Microprogram VIA Technologies Super Nintendo Entertainment System Field-programmable gate array Opteron Motorola 68000 Stream processing PDP-11 Cisco PIX PowerPC G4 Laptop Novell NetWare Xbox 360 IBM PC Intel iAPX 432 Windows XP Compiler optimization CDC 6600 Cray-2 Zilog Z80 Montecito Supercomputer Sound Blaster Nintendo GameCube IA-32 Computer workstation Wintel Ripping Harvard architecture Computer IA-64 PlayStation 2
