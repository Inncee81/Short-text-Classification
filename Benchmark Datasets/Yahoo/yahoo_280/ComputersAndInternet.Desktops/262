a new motherboard with pci my cpu unit is not working at the moment i had a guy from pc world come round and he said that it needs a new motherboard with a pci graphics cos thats what it had before he had to change it anyway he brought the wrong componant round and he left a normal motherboard in it but the computer loops now if he puts in the new motherboard that hes talking about will it erase all my memory i havent backed things up smack on the hand and i cant back anything up cos the computer will not work properly what should i do and will it erase the computers stuff installed basically mate your motherboard has fryed and this is what is making your cpu unusable the cpu is working just not the motherboard as for erasing all your hard drive this is utter tripe simply take out your hard drive try to borrow a spare working p c add the hard drive as a slave drive and then use the borrowed p c to copy all your files from your slave drive then at least you will have them backed up just in case when you buy a new motherboard or get one its just a case of carefully taking out your processor from your broken motherboard and placing it in your new board then simply attaching all components power supply hard drive cd rom all case leads floppy ect then when you boot up you should just go into bios and set the time date and hard drive cd rom configurations then after you have checked everything is correctly connected just boot up the problem with these pc world guys is they are trying to sell as much to you as they can if you needed a ide hard drive lead lead they would say you need a complete new hard drive and if you needed a extra mb ram they would say you need gb its all about sales personally you would be safer to either do it yourself with online help from myself if you want or take it to a independent p c shop they arent as bad as places like pc world if you need assistance let me know the following make and model of p c motherboard model number c p u model plus socket type memory type hard drive type s a t a or p a t a any more help let me know good luck Personal computer Redundant array of independent disks Advanced Technology Attachment Atari ST Atari 8-bit family IBM PC Computer bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Hard disk AmigaOS ZX Spectrum Universal Serial Bus Windows XP Power Macintosh G3 Commodore 64 Apple IIGS Amstrad CPC Commodore 128 Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Commodore PET Overclocking Linux USB flash drive TRS-80 Color Computer Sound Blaster Motherboard Apple II family Computer virus Floppy disk Central processing unit BBC Micro Laptop MAME RISC PlayStation 3 Desktop computer Power Mac G4 Cyrix IMac Texas Instruments TI-99/4A AMD Cray-1 Acorn Electron SAM Coup__ Sinclair ZX81 Read-only memory Windows 2000 Data General Nova NForce4 IBM Personal System/2 PowerPC 3dfx MSX Modchip Nintendo Entertainment System NX bit IPod TRS-80 ATI Technologies CPU design Southbridge (computing) A600 Atari 2600 Altair 8800 Computer case System/34 Microprogram Graphics processing unit NeXT Mach kernel Northbridge (computing) Computer forensics File Allocation Table Computer Opteron Capacitor plague History of operating systems Old World ROM Acorn Computers GeForce 6 Series Peripheral Component Interconnect History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Wintel Apple Computer INMOS Transputer Virtual memory Microprocessor
