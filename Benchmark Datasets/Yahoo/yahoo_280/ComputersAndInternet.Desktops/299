i noticed my in my pc power settings that the time to standby is longer than the time to hard drive shut why i have wondered for some time why in the factory settings for power management of a pc the hard drive is always set to shut off after the system goes into standby mode please explain the logic here thanks it is probably because it is configured that way when the pc goes in standby the hard drive is still running in the beginning allowing you to quickly turn the pc on within seconds if the hard drive shuts down it takes a little bit longer for the pc to start up Apollo Guidance Computer Hard disk Windows XP Uninterruptible power supply Token ring Embedded system Universal Serial Bus Toyota Prius Windows 2000 Redundant array of independent disks Booting Golden Sun Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Btrieve Traffic light Hybrid Synergy Drive Partition (computing) Dynamic random access memory Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DOS Advance Wars: Dual Strike Ethernet Central processing unit AmigaOS System/34 Advanced Technology Attachment Motorcycle Atari 8-bit family Hybrid vehicle New York Giants Shadow the Hedgehog Control Data Corporation Computer forensics Digital circuit K' Dog agility Macintosh Finder Sinclair ZX81 Carburetor NeXT Diablo II RISC Reconfigurable computing CPU design Power Macintosh G3 Chernobyl accident Electrophysiology Xbox 360 Linux Natural Selection (computer game) Frank Whittle Spacecraft propulsion System/36 Floppy disk Escape from New York Volleyball Motorola 68000 Mazda RX-7 X86 assembly language Radiation hardening Expert system Diesel engine Saturn V NX bit Commodore 128 USB flash drive Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cleveland Browns Beatmania IIDX Personal computer Canon T90 Modem MAME Mach kernel IPod Apple IIGS Transistor RAM disk Original Amiga chipset Atari ST Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Video game music Computer architecture Variable Frequency Drive Quantum computer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wicked (musical) Team time trial Windows Server 2003 Logic Electricity generation Flash memory SCART The Ark in Space Protoss Windows 3.x Complexity classes P and NP Team Fortress Classic Cray-1
