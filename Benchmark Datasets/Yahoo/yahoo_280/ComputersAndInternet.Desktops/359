my computer makes this strange whoosing noise please help yesterday evening while i was at my computer i suddenly heard kind of a click and then my computer started making this bizarre whooshing noise it keeps doing that for a few minutes at a time and then stops for a while and then it starts with the whooshing noise again i have an hp pavilion that's about years old it still works though but i'm scared because i have no idea why it's doing that if you could help me find out what's wrong and how to possibly fix this i would so much appreciate it thanks so much in advance edit it only made that clicking noise once last night and then it started making the whooshing noise the clicking noise hasn't happened again but the whooshing noise starts up every few minutes stops and then starts all over again edit the whooshing noise sounds like the noise a vacuum cleaner would make but not quite as loud if you have an air duster try dusting the fan area if it's dirty that maybe the cause you don't have to open the cpu a little cleaning is a lot of help Douglas Adams Sound effect Prank flash Gramophone record Sound Vacuum cleaner Whale song Initiation (phonetics) Time Out of Mind Mouse (computing) Axial compressor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story CPU design Social rule Cyberspace CPU cooling Morse Code Little Britain The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe It's All Gone Pete Tong John Cage The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases 8 mm video format USS Tunny (SS-282) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Computer Milton H.
