on the dell page it says xps desktop run watts but it offers gtx mb graphics card will it be able to run a gts card then yea i looked on some pages and it said the gts n gts minimum req was watts but dell offers the gtx while it reportedly runs w update i've linked to a discussion forum at tom's hardware about this very issue some people are insisting that dell is understating the capacity of their power supplies others say they've been able to run cards like the gts and radeon x on the stock w well i've heard rumors that dell power supplies perform a little better than their wattage rating so this might be such a case for video cards the v rail is what matters so maybe the w dell psu performs closer to a w standard one i wouldn't count on that though i had to to upgrade my w dell power supply to run a gt it's also possible that dell automatically upgrades the psu when someone orders the gtx build and that's just not reflected on the page i'd ask them whether this is true then you could order the standard build and upgrade on your own certainly any psu that can handle a gtx mb can handle the less demanding gts here's a site that sells dell psu upgrades silencer series GeForce 2 Windows Vista NVIDIA Radeon ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Windows XP GeForce 7 Series Floppy disk IMac Atari ST Mac OS X Windows 2000 GeForce 3dfx GeForce 4 Apple Macintosh PlayStation 3 Laptop Nissan Skyline Graphics card Chevrolet Corvette Holden Monaro Apple IIGS Porsche 928 PowerBook GeForce 6 Series Redundant array of independent disks Apple Computer Ford Mustang SGI Octane Screenshot TRS-80 Color Computer Atari 8-bit family Microsoft Knoppix GeForce FX Amiga Doom 3 Pocket PC Athlon Commodore 64 Mac mini Visual Basic IBM PC Plymouth Road Runner Muscle car Wi-Fi PowerPC AmigaOS PlayStation Portable CPU cache Power Macintosh G3 Linux Nintendo Revolution Universal Serial Bus TGV WebObjects Mazda 323 Call centre Sega Saturn IBook Bicycle lighting Desktop computer Object Desktop Mainframe computer INMOS Transputer Dodge Viper Universal Mobile Telecommunications System X86 OpenGL Spyware Google 24 Hours of Le Mans Acorn Electron Microsoft Windows Dodge Dart History of Microsoft Windows PC Engine SGI Indy Mach kernel Porsche 911 Mazda Miata Game Boy Silicon Graphics Indian Railways ATX PlayStation 2 TiVo Xbox Counter-Strike Radeon X Series Internet fraud Pentium 4 Overclocking Computer workstation
