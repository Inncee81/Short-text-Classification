how to dismantle motherboard hi so i got to the point i need to exchange motherboard from my desktop i know good luck to me i had no idea where to start i saw it's attached to printer monitor usb ports and it seems i should remove it first any help thanks this process is very easy however certain cases have the motherboards that slide out the back and also pivot out on the side you'll need to study this to see if this is that type of case others require the power supply to be removed to get at the motherboard in any case you can remove the power supply to get to the screws that mount the board to the tower chassie first start with unplugging all items in the back of the tower and then remove all pci cards remove the power supply carefully unplug it from the motherboard next unplug the ide cables from the board and also the speaker on off ect wires if replacing with same board write down exactly where you unpluged them from this will make installing faster and easier now locate the screws that secure the board to the chassie usally of them once you have all the screws out the board will basically fall down be carefull the memory and processor is still on the board don't remove them until you are ready to put them in the new board they are very delicate study how they are held in so you don't pry them out and find that something is still holding them in the processor will come out with the fan as one piece don't take them apart there should be a small spring wire holding it in the memory removes by pushing the white tabs away from the memory with the memory poping out check to see where the slots on the memory go sdram has slots on it the second slot going in the down position ddr has one memory will only go in one way good luck and once you do this you'll be teaching yourself alot about how to build a computer Universal Serial Bus Personal computer PC motherboard Power Macintosh G3 Computer hardware Computer case Computer bus IMac Atari 8-bit family Commodore 64 Dynamic random access memory Drill bit Motherboard AmigaOS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PowerPC Windows XP RS-232 Laptop Apple IIGS Atari ST Sound Blaster Desktop computer NVIDIA USB flash drive Overclocking Xbox Apple Macintosh Bluetooth IPod Oscilloscope Peripheral Component Interconnect GeForce 6 Series TRS-80 Color Computer Ethernet Radeon Northbridge (computing) MicroATX Graphics processing unit Apple II family Modchip ATX Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Cray-1 Hard disk Advanced Technology Attachment IBook Screw CPU design PlayStation 3 Amstrad CPC Random access memory Mach kernel Texas Instruments TI-99/4A 3dfx Glossary of climbing terms Floppy disk Accelerated Graphics Port System/36 EMac Embedded system Central processing unit Computer forensics ZX Spectrum Opteron SGI Indy PCI Express Digital photography Redundant array of independent disks Capacitor plague Sega Saturn Hash table Serial ATA Power Mac G4 64-bit Nintendo Revolution CPU cache CDC 6600 Sharp Zaurus D-subminiature Modem Reconfigurable computing Celeron Sinclair ZX81 Acorn Electron Arcade cabinet Cell (microprocessor) OpenBSD Windows 2000 Earring IBM PC compatible Front side bus
