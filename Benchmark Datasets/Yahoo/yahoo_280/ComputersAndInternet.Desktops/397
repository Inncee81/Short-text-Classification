my computer becomes blurry and unclear ok so i would like to know what the problem with my computer is as soon as i open something like limewire it starts flashing and goes black then goes back to original again it keeps on doing this until finally you can't see anything on the monitor i have bought a new monitor a samsuns lcd and the problem is still not fixed i am wondering if the problem is the video card because it cannot be a virus since right after i reformatted the hdd the comp still did this i have a geforce on my parents comp the comp that this is happening and it's really all they need so i'm wondering if i should be buying a new video card it sure looks like a video card issue if it is still under warranty it might be worth returning it to the place you bought it and get a replacement if not they are reasonably priced now anyway i suggest you get a video card that has a minimum mb of memory on it anything less would give you the same problem IBM PC compatible Computer and video games Windows XP GeForce 4 Graphics card Digital photography PlayStation 3 TurboGrafx 16 Video poker Sharp Zaurus IMac GeForce 7 Series Xbox Commodore International Slot machine Overclocking ATI Technologies NVIDIA IBook PowerBook PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay 3dfx Atari 8-bit family Surveillance Commodore 64 Radeon Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IBM PC Color Graphics Adapter Timeline of computing 1990-forward IPod Amiga Computer display Computer Apple II family Linux kernel Western Digital GeForce 6 Series Sega Saturn ZX Spectrum Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Hard disk Screensaver Personal computer Orders of magnitude (numbers) Computer virus Nintendo Entertainment System Wheel of Fortune GeForce 3 Apple Macintosh GeForce FX Atari ST Computer hardware Warranty Betting (poker) Acorn Computers Canon T90 Spyware Stereoscopy Computer bus Digital camera Laptop Pixel Blackjack Digital Visual Interface Neopets Software bug PS2 Linux Windows Vista Doom 3 Commodore Plus/4 Poker jargon Skype Gambling Nintendo Revolution Pirate decryption Virtual memory Trusted computing Liquid crystal display GeForce 2 Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Memory card Counter-Strike PC card Steam (content delivery) Tungsten Handheld Apple IIGS Television GeForce 256 Motorola 68000 ITunes Music Store System/36 Microsoft Windows Secure Digital card Computer and video game industry Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth Prank flash Screenshot
