calling all computer geniuses i went to a website to find out if my system is compatiable for command and comquer tribum wars here is what is said i have cpu intel r celeron r cpu ghz cpu speed you have ghz ram mb operating system windows xp professional sp video card sis sis rev video card features video ram mb video card d acceleration yes vertex shader ver pixel shader ver directx version c sound card driver version number is free disk space gb dvd hl dt st dvd rom gdr b can someone advise my if i need to tweak the screen property or what i need to purchase in order to play the game because i really want to play it very very badly based on the specifications of the game listed above you would probably be better with an entire upgrade the celeron processor that you have is a reduced version of the full pentium processor intel did this to make the chip less expensive unfortunatly for you the parts that intel took out of the celeron are exactly the parts that most games like c c use to get the best play performance out of the graphics while a good graphics card can make up for some of this having the necessary math processors on the main chip with access to lots of memory will provide outstanding differences if you want to upgrade check to see if your motherboard will support a full pentium or pentium d then upgrade memory and video as well good luck Atari ST GeForce 6 Series Microprocessor PC motherboard Apple IIGS PowerPC Overclocking History of Microsoft Windows X86 Pentium M Apple Macintosh CPU cache Windows Vista Windows 2000 Amstrad CPC Timeline of computing 1990-forward AMD64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis CPU design Mac OS X Atari 8-bit family Cyrix Pentium III RISC IMac ZX Spectrum Personal computer Central processing unit Amiga Xeon Laptop PlayStation 2 PC Engine GeForce 4 Pentium D Nintendo Revolution Vertex and pixel shaders ThinkPad 64-bit Athlon Shader TRS-80 Color Computer PlayStation Portable Sound Blaster Computer workstation Pentium Northbridge (computing) AmigaOS Windows 3.x Pentium II Commodore 128 DirectX OpenGL Apple II family PowerBook Far Cry Nintendo Entertainment System Linux kernel MSX TRS-80 Cell (microprocessor) Virtual memory Intel i860 GeForce FX Microsoft Windows Nintendo 64 X86 assembly language Sequent Computer Systems Apple Intel transition MAME 3dfx SAM Coup__ NForce4 BBC Micro GeForce 7 Series Sega Dreamcast Atari 2600 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Original Amiga chipset IBM PC Dynamic random access memory
