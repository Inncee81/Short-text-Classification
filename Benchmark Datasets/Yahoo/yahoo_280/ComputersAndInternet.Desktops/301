whats the differance between the c d drive on computers i have an hp computer and i noticed i'm running out of room on my d drive my c drive is just fine space wise but i don't know what the differance is between these two or what they are called aside from c d drive is the d drive my hard drive c my memory please help so i know what i need to look for to upgrade my system when i take it in in order to improve the performance of the video editing software on the computer the hard disk drive on the computer has been formatted into two partitions c and d most video editing software saves files to the d partition this prevents large video captures from consuming the available space on the c partition and possibly affecting system performance digital video consumes gigabytes for every minutes of captured digital video and it is very possible that a you could fill the c partition to capacity very quickly due to the way the operating system dynamically manages and resizes virtual memory if the c partition was filled to capacity the operating system may lock up and not be able to restart to maintain optimum performance of video edition software the d partition should be defragmented or formatted regularly Windows 2000 Hard disk File system File Allocation Table Windows XP Partition (computing) Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Knoppix Apple II family Embedded system AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Floppy disk System/36 Computer virus DVD History of Microsoft Windows Mach kernel DragonFly BSD Computer Booting DOS Xbox 360 Digital photography PlayStation 3 ZX Spectrum OpenVMS MiniDisc Windows Vista Linux IBM PC compatible System 7 (Macintosh) Flash memory TiVo NTFS Nintendo GameCube Computer storage IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 8 mm video format Mac OS X Blu-ray Disc Disk cloning Modchip 64-bit Enterprise content management Trusted computing Kernel (computer science) ITunes Atari 8-bit family Amstrad CPC Apple IIGS PlayStation 2 MP3 Microsoft Amiga Warez CPU design Object Desktop Multics Xbox System/34 Gigabyte Library (computer science) Digital Equipment Corporation Microsoft Windows PlayStation Portable Creative Zen Sound recording Disk formatting DV Original Amiga chipset Btrieve Windows Server 2003 Commodore International Operating system Digital rights management Central processing unit ReiserFS Musical Instrument Digital Interface Memory Stick Binary prefix Ghost (software) Movie projector NeXT CD-ROM Compact disc FreeDOS TRS-80 Digital video recorder IBM PC
