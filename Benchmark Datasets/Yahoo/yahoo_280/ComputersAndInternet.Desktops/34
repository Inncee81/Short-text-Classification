how do you retire a dell service tag on a computer i bought a new dell and the old dell is no longer useable it's broke i do not want to show i have more 'useable' dells than i actually have that really sounds like a silly question the service tag appears on every model of dell computer if you have a paid contract with dell then contact dell but if this is a guarantee thing that you are worried about forget it the next owner of your old dell can use that tag to learn what software and drivers can be installed on it from the dell website so if you remove that tag you are degrading the value of that computer this is not a personal identity thing that will harm you or your credit good luck and happy computing Spyware IBM PC compatible Dell, Inc.
