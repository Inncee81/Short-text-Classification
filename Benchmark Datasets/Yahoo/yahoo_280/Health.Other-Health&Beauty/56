prozac problem i am a single mother and have been suffering with post natal depression since my daughter was bron months ago at first the doctor prescribed citalopram which i tried once but felt so spaced out i didn't take it again the doctor then changed me onto prozac and i took my first one this morning i was told it can stop you being able to sleep which is why i took it in the morning but it's had the opposite effect i feel so tired i can hardly keep my eyes open i'm on my own with baby which is why this worries me so much it also leaves me feeling spaced out like the citalopram for anyone who's taken prozac did you have any side effects and did they subside after a few days the leaflet says to continue taking them for at least a week as early side effects normally wear off i'm just wondering how long i will feel like this p s i am feeling high so if this doesn't make much sense i apologise anti depressants can give you all sorts of side effects such as yours when you first start taking them and you wont actually feel the benefit of them till youve been taking them for around to months and thats when the immediate side effects will start to vanish in most cases is there anyone you could call on for help with the baby even if its just to give you a couple of hours rest a day it will benefit both you and your baby you are not useless as my sister used to think she was you just need a little help to get you through this rough time everyone needs to recharge their batteries to be able to face the day ahead more so when you have post natal depression i hope you start to feel better soon i have an idea how you are feeling because my sister went through really bad post natal depression but it will pass i promise Antidepressant Paroxetine Fluoxetine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor The Contender (television series) Social rule Father's Day (Doctor Who) Avenue Q Clinical depression Friends EastEnders Childbirth Haven (TNG episode) Kurt Cobain Daylight saving time Knots Landing Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Kodocha Prostate cancer Phoebe Halliwell Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Days of our Lives Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Ashlee Simpson Show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
