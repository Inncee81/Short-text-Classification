a stitch ouch whilst walking my dog tonight i got the most painful stitch in my abdomin and i was a mile from the car as i walked back it got more more painful in fact i didn't think i would make it back after sticking my fingers in my belly and supporting it it did ease a bit i have a big male dalmatian and is quite demanding so there was no let up or sympathy from him the bugger any how the question is what is a stitch is it a weakness of some kind like ageing or not as fit as i should be perhaps enlightenment would ease the worry appreciated a stitch is a sharp prolonged contraction caused by a buildup of lactic acid in an area of muscle when it is vigorously stretched and used it's the equivalent of a cramp in your calf muscle don't know why a 'stitch' only refers to the abdomen though oxygen in the blood disperses this lactic acid and gently stretching or massaging of the tensed up muscle whilst taking long deep breaths inhaling large amounts of the much needed oxygen will ease the pain that is why it felt better when you pressed on the area Cramp First aid Weight training Lactic acid Massage Equine conformation Pneumonia Biochemistry Professional wrestling holds Breastfeeding Milton H.
