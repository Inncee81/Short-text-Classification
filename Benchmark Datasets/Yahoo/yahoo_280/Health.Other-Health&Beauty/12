twisted bowel had my first colonoscopy yesterday and it wasnt pleasant to say the least they didnt find anything apart that is ibs but apparantly i had i quote one of the worst twisted bowel they had ever seen i didnt think nothing of it until got home and reserched and found out it can be quite dangerous so how come they havent done anything about it or did they correct it when they did the colonoscopy they havent told me anything oh the medical profession whenever i have a medical problem i always ask a million questions even though they hate it it is dangerous yes and you will need surgery to correct it probably phone them back and ask you must take responsiblity for your own medical care just in terms of knowing exactly what's going on and bullying them this is your body and your life and the end of the day you're just another patient to them you can also ask for a copy of your own medical notes Ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease Colonoscopy Irritable bowel syndrome Colorectal cancer Medicine Inflammatory bowel disease Cancer Fecal incontinence Transsexuality Medical prescription Hemorrhoid Infantilism Coeliac disease Spina bifida Chiropractic Prostate cancer Multiple chemical sensitivity Diverticulitis Virtual colonoscopy Endometriosis Stomach cancer Intersex surgery Abortion Bowel obstruction Surgery Chronic fatigue syndrome Triage Non-invasive (medical) Urinary incontinence Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Organ transplant Hypnosis Radiation therapy Traditional Chinese medicine Oncology Alternative medicine Enema Sigmund Freud Medical record Hypoglycemia Endoscopy Dietary fiber Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Stroke Physician Tourniquet Palliative care Emergency Medical Services Laxative Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Mother Teresa Quackery Acting President of the United States Constipation Traumatic brain injury Jam (TV series) Phimosis First aid National Health Service Social rule AIDS Division of labour Syringomyelia National Kidney Foundation Singapore Shock Blood (computer game) Subluxation Abortion debate Andrew Wakefield Beaumont children disappearance Adenoma Osteopathy A Course In Miracles Clinical depression Antipsychotic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Physical examination Rosemary Kennedy Smallpox Reflexology Hirschsprung's disease Dentistry Physical therapy Multiple sclerosis Certified Nursing Assistant Epilepsy Myocardial infarction Insulin Familial adenomatous polyposis Anesthesia Sex reassignment surgery Dialysis About a Boy Reparative therapy Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Hip fracture The Ashlee Simpson Show MMR vaccine
