multiple sclerosis progressive is it true that the symptoms may table out at any time and not get worse can i just add i am not a sufferer i am researching the condition in an attempt to understand it and the way it affects a very dear friend of mine i not only feel useless at not being able to help much i also feel inept because i knew very little of ms before i was privileged enough to encounter such a wonderful and selfless person i wish i could help more significantly yes there can be a plateau but with secondary or primary progressive any disability accumulated between 'active ' episodes will remain permanently with relapsing remitting disability may be minimal and may with phsio etc clear up almost completely unfortunately for some of us the disabilty can remain yet still be classified as relapsing remitting all very confusing secondary progressive if the person becomes secondary is usually diagnosed years after an initial dx of rr ie they do not suffer relapses but a progressive course which can be very gradual and slow please don't be alarmed by the answer from 'a nurse' there is only one form of ms which is very very rare with a bleak outlook any neurologist or nurse that alks in terms of 'end stages' in relation to ppms or spms is talking nonsense it is generally accepted these days that ms may reduce average lifespan by years that's apossibility not a definite i am assuming that the nurse who answered is not and ms specialist nurse we still get answers like that from medical 'professionals' who if they don't have experience of shouldn't really state alarming things like that please look at www mssociety org uk you'll find lots of info and links there you can also access the carer's board and everyday living as can your friend and talk to people who live with this everday ask questions and just generally have a moan if so inclined it gets to all of us sometimes i hope your friend and yourself are well please remember that the course of this illness condition can vary enormously from individual to individual so all anyone can tell you is from their own experience even neuros can't give a definitive answer as to how an individual will be affected or for how long also have a look at www msnurses co uk there is a pretty good chart on there that will give you an idea of how ppms and spms courses tend to go thank you cj it's so complex an issue i have rr but am substantially more disabled than people i know with both sp and pp ms may be a life sentence but it's not a death sentence Clinical depression Infantilism Psychosis Autism Bipolar disorder Sexual orientation Schizophrenia Milton H.
