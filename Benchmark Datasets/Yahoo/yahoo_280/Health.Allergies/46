nasal polyps cause post nasal drainage i have very bad allergies and in preparation for my allergy appointment in a couple days i haven't had any allergy pills because they will be doing testing anyway since i haven't had any pills my post nasal drainage is out of control i've developed a nasty cough just trying to get everything out of my chest and throat normally i just hack some stuff up in the morning and thats all someone suggested that maybe i have nasal polyps i looked them up on the internet and they said that a constant runny nose is a symptom i wish i had a runny nose that's way better than it all going into my throat anyway anyone have nasal polyps with no runny nose but bad post nasal drainage i had nasal polyps many people do and don't know it however you may want to just call your doctor they don't want you taking anything that will affect your allergies but they may let you take some guaifenesin usually in mucinex which will thin those secretions and make it easier to breathe Hay fever Common cold Allergy Pneumonia Asthma Nasal congestion Pollen Immunoglobulin E Nasal irrigation Aspergillosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cancer of the larynx Urinary incontinence Jala neti Gastroesophageal reflux disease Medicine Eczema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pertussis Sleep apnea Sinusitis Chronic fatigue syndrome 2001 anthrax attacks Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ebola Nose Pseudoephedrine Cluster headache Familial adenomatous polyposis Breast Multiple chemical sensitivity Paget's disease of bone Fertility awareness Nasal spray Nasal bone Breastfeeding Myasthenia gravis Al-Razi Measles Psoriasis Ayurveda Napoleon B.
