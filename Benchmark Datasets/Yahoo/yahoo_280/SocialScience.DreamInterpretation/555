de ja vu with dreams sometimes i will have a dream but only remember bits and peices of it then about or months later things will happen that happened exactly in the dream and it will bring me back to that dream does anyone have an explaination for this the last one i had was about a week or two ago i got in touch with a friend that i hadn't hung out with for about four years we decided to go to his house and watch a movie and when we pulled up to his house i remembered a dream i had months earlier that involved me hanging out with him and we were at his house well the house that we pulled up to was the exact house that was in my dream yard and all it freaked me out the experience of d j vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity and also a sense of eeriness strangeness or weirdness the previous experience is most frequently attributed to a dream although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience genuinely happened in the past d j vu has been described as remembering the future the experience of d j vu seems to be very common in formal studies of people report having experienced it at least once references to the experience of d j vu are also found in literature of the past indicating it is not a new phenomenon it has been extremely difficult to invoke the d j vu experience in laboratory settings therefore making it a subject of few empirical studies recently researchers have found ways to recreate this sensation using hypnosis we have all some experience of a feeling that comes over us occasionally of what we are saying and doing having been said and done before in a remote time of our having been surrounded dim ages ago by the same faces objects and circumstances of our knowing perfectly what will be said next as if we suddenly remember it Out-of-body experience D__j__ vu Abduction Phenomenon Scenes from a Memory Lucid dreaming Milton H.
