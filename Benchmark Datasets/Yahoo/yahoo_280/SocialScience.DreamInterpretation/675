dream of the one i had a dream about a year ago it was a very abstract dream so it's hard to explain i was in bed or else surrounded by white fluffy clouds with the one and by that i mean of course my one true love who i obviously haven't met yet since i'm single but i'm not even sure he was really physically there as i couldn't actually touch him and couldn't see what he looked like it was more that it was his presence and that presence was engulfing me and it was sooooooo peaceful and even when i woke up it was like for a couple of minutes he was still there it was such a good feeling this sounds a bit silly but to me it was as if it was the unconcious mind of my true love coming to reasure me that he's out there and we'll be together one day what do you think thanks tah however i don't actually know this guy i could tell you about your sub concious mind seeking the qualities you need to look for in a partnership or hidden meanings etc but what i really think what you want to hear is my story a couple of years ago i was coming out of a long marriage and was as low as possible i wept with sorrow and from the bottom of my heart i cried out to have help to carry on i saw my future partner not clearly but generally height hair colour the way she walks and i felt she was far away but coming towards me i found the strength to carry on months later i met her and fell in love so my answer is maybe your soulmate is coming don't miss them when they arrive good luck Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Time Out of Mind The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The McGuire Sisters W.I.T.C.H.
