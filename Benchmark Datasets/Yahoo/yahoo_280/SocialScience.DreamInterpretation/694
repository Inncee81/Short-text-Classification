robert redford was my analyst what does that dream means the dream i had somewhere to go at midnight i remembered that i had an appointment with my analyst and i had to go to a place by the seaside and i was afraid but i took my car and did it the place looked like looked like a trendy mediterranean island my analyst's office was flooded with light and he had like assistants males one said 'he wants to talk to you on the phone' i start talking with him and it turns out my analyst is robert redford instead of talking therapy he's flirting with me and he does it in a way that's way surprising from such an old guy and he's so smooth about it he gets me sooo horny and i am in awe that such a cool man exists on earth i wake up in an euphoric state what do you think i don't have a thing for older men it was so weird and surprisingly fascinating there's something more there ok i know it sounds like a silly dream but don't you think that if someone is your 'analyst' in a dream that means something important you have a thing for hot older men just be glad you were able to have that dream because he may be like in his 's but he's still got it going on Shaggy dog story Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Grandview, U.S.A.
