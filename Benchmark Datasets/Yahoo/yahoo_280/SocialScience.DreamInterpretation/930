the same nightmare i keep ignoring these dreams and warnings i don't know i pray about them push them to the side of my head and attempt to let them go i keep seeing the same car he had i ignore it then for the the past week i dreamed of him everynight i wake up upset the more i ignore them the stronger they are are these just simple dreams warnings or my paranoia either way i'm sick of them i can't sleep you are not paranoid you will stop being sick of these horrible nightmares and you will actually start to enjoy them once you have fun seeing what they mean figuring them out like a puzzle once you start to see them on the screen of your mind like a movie you've written for you to watch and heal and grow and learn from by enjoy them i mean you will have the full catharsis of their pain not the pulling away which causes more pain and by understanding they will go away okay i know you're tired of being hurt so let's start on an adventure and keep that hurt away from you your dream one of the most important aspects of your description is that you avoid saying who he is what does this mean you are trying so hard to avoid him but this causes you deep deep conflict we cannot ever run from our fears or conflicts we must face them head on and deal with them and work to fix them your dreams are saying the same thing it is not paranoia they are not simple dreams or warnings they are very clear signs that you are in deep conflict with this person and that whether with friends or a therapist or someone else that you trust you need to resolve this conflict not pretend it doesn't exist not abandon it karen horney said and i love it that anxiety is to emotions what pain is to a wound it tells you that something is wrong needs healing or will get worse you say all this yourself the more i ignore them the stronger they get if you left a wound open without cleansing bandaging an antibiotic salve it would fester get pus and maybe even gangrene so too with an emotional wound it won't be ignored it is also of note that you refer to the car you give very few details so the ones you give are important clearly you want him to come back but in a way that he no longer hurts you or you want him to drive away and leave you alone forever you put the car in your nightmare so remember it is up to you to drive this person away by taking it into your hands and resolving this conflict facing how why you allowed him to have this power over you how why you continue to give him this power over you and your feelings i'm sure you don't want to hear this but what can i say do you remember as a child if you didn't make up with mommy or daddy the pain was excruciating that doesn't change with grown up relationships you don't have to literally make up with a person who has hurt you but you do have to heal to make peace with that person in your mind and heart you must forgive in order to forget you must find out exactly why this person has such a deep hold on your whole ego integrity and in that healing that forgiveness you will forget and move on your dreams are your best friends and they are trying to help you to see the truth after all they didn't come from the sky think of this you write your own dreams it is your unconscious trying to tell your conscious that you have hurts that won't be ignored that must be faced and taken care of all the best to you and know that sleep and peace will come to you when you've done the hard work of repairing your inner relationship to this person and letting him go not by denial not be avoidance but by genuine moving on and when you begin to see that it's fun to analyze and confront and feel the heaviness just flow off you just drift away with the realization that you've conquered what it was about and you've looked the enemy in the eye and it wasn't you lol Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Narcissism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.
