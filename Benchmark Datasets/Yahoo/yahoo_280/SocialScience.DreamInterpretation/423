i died in my dream my mother tells me when you have a dream and you die in it you die in real life so i'm like the living dead there was no heaven in it either i was lying on a cloud talking to myself for some time then i went up down where ever and i remember waking up and crying after i died because i regretted not doing so much it totally shook me up to dream that you die in your dream symbolizes inner changes transformation self discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you you are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind these changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events metaphorically dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits so dying does not always mean a physical death but an ending of something on a negative note to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful relationships or unhealthy destructive behaviors you may feeling depressed or feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life perhaps your mind is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying alternatively you may be trying to get out of some obligation responsibility or other situation to see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change loss is occurring in your relationship with that person alternatively you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person Clinical depression Out-of-body experience Milton H.
