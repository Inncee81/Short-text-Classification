do you believe that we live another life in our dreams and it is probably more realistic than this one i often have lucid dreams some say it is astral and for many years i have been watching how i there change progress i think i am not alone lucid dreams give us the ability to control our own dreams and steer them toward the direction we want in the lucid state we are more willing to confront threats and as a result become more self confident when we achieve lucidity we can use it as a tool to improve our sports game to rehearse a speech to fulfill our fantasies or to solve a problem in our waking life in fact some athletes utilize their lucid dreams to practice their tennis serve golf stroke or bat swing even in our day to day life we can use lucid dreams to ask the boss for a raise prepare for a first date overcome phobias get over writer's block etc the application of lucid dreams is limited only to your imagination lucid dreams can help us visualize and rehearse the event in our minds before it actually occurs because brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event what you learn or practice in your lucid dream state can be seen as training and preparation for the real thing in the waking world our neuronal patterns are already being conditioned at least half of all adults have had at least one lucid dream in their lifetime many have reported having lucid dreams without even trying often flying is associated with lucid dreams however with practice lucid dreaming can be learned and can be achieved at your will Lucid dreaming Dream Consciousness Out-of-body experience Alexander Technique Artificial consciousness Artificial neural network Neuro-linguistic programming Tennis Hypnosis Philosophy of mind Astral projection Neurofeedback Philosophy of perception Tiger Woods Electroencephalography Sigmund Freud Emanuel Swedenborg Meaning of life Urinary incontinence Autism Table tennis Brain-computer interface Cognitive science Paranoia Agent Dyslexia Stroke Golf Philosophy of language Volleyball Psychology Visual Basic Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Extreme Programming Multiple sclerosis Brain Narcolepsy Scientology beliefs and practices Jon Secada Stuttering Education in the People's Republic of China Ben Johnson (athlete) Ty Cobb Puberty Reality Avenue Q Car handling Social psychology Link (Legend of Zelda) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Direct realism Numerology Technology Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Aphasia James Hillman Baseball Adult attention-deficit disorder Human brain Quantum mind Connectionism Information warfare Parapsychology A Course In Miracles Progressive metal History of brain imaging 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Dualism (philosophy of mind) Unconscious mind Infantilism The Sims Victor Cousin The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bertrand Russell Microeconomics Martial art Theory of conduct Freddy Krueger Republic (dialogue) The Lovely Bones Hypnagogia Cephalic disorder Narcissism Lightsaber combat Randomness Simulated reality Kirby Computer and video game genres Blood (computer game) Sport Death Note Baseball Stars Doomsday argument Drama
