extremely creative dreams hi i'm a year old girl incase that is of any worth i have extremely vivid dreams and most of the time i have hardly any trouble remembering them i know alot of people do the first lucid dream i remember having was when i was about five or six years old and have had many since then but the concepts plots people scenery etc that i fabricate in my dreams blows me away i create people in my dreams that are like no one i know looks personality everything i even grow attached to those people and find myself sad when i wake that they don't exist out of my mind lol in a recent dream i actually played someone else another person nothing like anyone i know and some of my dreams actually have plots twists like a movie another example the other night in a dream i heard this song not one i've heard before it had a melody lyrics everything so what are your thought about all this am i insane or what lol hi michelle nope most of my dreams aren't very alike i don't remember ever having a recurring dream i'm not sure why and the scenery in my dreams are typically much different from each other besides they are all very strange actually now that i think about it i have had the same kind of idea in a dream before i e i've had quite a few dreams with my school as the setting it looks nothing like my real school but most of the time the school is different in every dream i think that is amazing i think you should write everything down that you dream and make a book or a movie about you're dreams when you're older amazing Lucid dreaming Dream Philosophical skepticism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Out-of-body experience Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde Bringing It All Back Home Year of the Spider Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 50 First Dates Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Frank Herbert Social rule Scenes from a Memory American Psycho Freddy Krueger Therion (band) House of M Avenue Q Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Animal Farm Psychosis Dream Theater Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Reality The Rutles Philip K.
