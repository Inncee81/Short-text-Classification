i have dreams from years ago and they are coming true is this normal people's names what people say events themes stick out which i remember and a few months or years later they come true i also pick up on what people say about me and find out it is the truth faces also stick out for me and feelings and places i see i have seen before in dreams in my dreams i also travel to places and meet people and have conversations and continue to visit the same people night after night is astro travel possible there are things in life that cannot be explained of course they are possible however most of the times dream come from experience and experience give us idea in the subconscious mind and that leads to another new experience for example if you dream of plane and the next day you found out the news a plane did crash you may think that comes true and you may have some sort of power but looking back plane crash was a fact and happens before that lurks into our mind and live in our subconscious mind so if that happens in your dream and the next day it happens again that may be called coincident in other words you already have an idea that plane would crash in the other example dream of zombie and if you dream of it and the next day someone you know die okay zombie will never in our mind if you don't have knowledge about it base on the knowledge you have first then you dream about if in the event that happens you can say they symbolize people will die in your case faces sticking out and come true in reality that is probably from your experience a quick flash from one's person nose the other person's eyes may lurk into your mind and the next day a look alike person may reveal in reality and you may make yourself believe that it comes true same goes with travel to places we dream because we base on our experience sometimes our experience may indicate it is from the dream it seems like the cycle but actually comes from our life time experience first of course i don't rule out exception but i do not think it happens to many people though Theory of conduct Social rule Lucid dreaming Unconscious mind Out-of-body experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Infantilism Carlos Castaneda The Mother Philosophical skepticism Epistemology Scenes from a Memory Derren Brown Jon Secada Michel Henry Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scientology beliefs and practices Tag The nature of God in Western theology StarCraft: Uprising The Amber Spyglass God Victor Cousin Jiddu Krishnamurti Cliff Richard American Pie (song) Free will God Emperor of Dune Time Out of Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat K' Consciousness Carl Jung Reality Rain Man Avenue Q Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sant Thakar Singh Discordianism The Invisibles Meaning of life Socrates Book of Mormon Gundam Phaedo Resident Evil: Apocalypse Slow Train Coming Miracle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 9/11 conspiracy theories Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Philosophy of language Spiritism Donald Davidson (philosopher) Numerology Augustus De Morgan EastEnders Apocalypse Mantra Scientific method One Tree Hill (TV series) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Miss Saigon Muraqaba Rudolf Hermann Lotze Objectivist philosophy Hypnosis Philosophy of mathematics Sabbath Critique of Pure Reason Myers-Briggs Type Indicator The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Aristotle Human Empathy Shen Gong Wu Paranoia Agent Friedrich Schleiermacher Astral projection W.I.T.C.H.
