can someone tell me what my dreams mean i have been having this same dream for a few months now heres how it goes i am riding my cousins horse that i love to ride i'm riding in the pasture behind the house toward a tree that i would climb when i was little i hear someone calling my name and its my family and friends all of them they keep saying things but i cant hear them i turn crossfire the horse around to go back to them but they keep saying hurtful words to me so i always turn him around and start to ride of again but then again they shout things at me and i turn around again and so on its back and forth until i wake up please tell me what this means wayasay misguided rose is actually the name of a cd that i like but it does explain alot about me i am the rose beautiful full of blooming petals but the misguided part just means to me that even though i am sometimes misguided and misunderstood i am beautiful like a rose in my own way i'm going to write in caps and put your words in lower case so i can write faster and include your stuff first of all i noticed your name is misguided rose and you sound misguided by someone you talk about your family what does rose mean to you to me it means love misguided love i am riding my cousins horse that i love to ride horses often represent long journeys they also represent strength so i would guess that you are turning to this horse to give you the power and help you move forward and away from the influences of your family but as we are all ambivalent about this because we crave love attention acceptance from our family and keep hoping to hear what we want to hear from them we keep turning back i'm riding in the pasture behind the house toward a tree that i would climb when i was little climbing a tree and being little you are seeking the feeling you had when you escaped and hide in that tree safe and out of reach i hear someone calling my name and its my family and friends all of them they keep saying things but i cant hear them i turn crossfire the horse wow crossfire perhaps crossfire is in the crossfire between you and your family someone the horse's name is significant around to go back to them but they keep saying hurtful words to me so i always turn him around and start to ride off again the cycle of abuse honeymoon phase is calling your name fear you will leave wanting you to stay and sending out signals to bring you back but then again they shout things at me and i turn around again and so on its back and forth until i wake up phase two of the cycle you come back they feel they got you hooked and they go at you again then comes phase one again please tell me what this means Jon Secada Battles of Lexington and Concord Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Dalek Invasion of Earth Vehicular cycling The Time Machine Bringing It All Back Home Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside The Shining (film) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Death Gate Cycle Muslim ibn Aqeel Equine conformation Horse gait The Emancipation of Mimi Milton H.
