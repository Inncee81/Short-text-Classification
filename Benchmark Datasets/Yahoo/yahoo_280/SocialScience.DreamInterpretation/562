what could it mean if i dream about math i had a dream last night where i was solving algebra problems it started out there was something i had to figure out and i used algebra to do so i don't remember what it was then it turned into a sheet of paper with all these algebra problems on it like i was taking a math test or something i graduated two years ago so its not like its fresh on my mind or anything ver random it means you have a problem you're trying to figure out probably has nothing to do with math at all math is just clean and predictable with a right anwer and you're hoping for the same in life Mathematics Education in Romania Algebraic geometry Algebra Theodore Kaczynski Arthur Cayley Polynomial Dream Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Augustus De Morgan Convergence of Fourier series Physics Jaime Escalante Exponentiation Pi Dither One-time pad The Princeton Review Supersymmetry NUMB3RS Elementary algebra Where Mathematics Comes From Ruler-and-compass construction Richard Feynman Randomness William Rowan Hamilton Complex number Linear algebra G__del's incompleteness theorem Mathematics education Digital circuit SAT Graduate Record Examination Henri Poincar__ Mnemonic Quadratic sieve Matrix (mathematics) Matroid Complexity classes P and NP Fermat's last theorem Ordinary differential equation Algebraic chess notation Kernel (algebra) Social rule Clements High School Computer numbering formats Sigmund Freud Curve Prime number John Forbes Nash Sheaf (mathematics) William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Math rock Archimedes GED Victoria University of Manchester Stuyvesant High School Claude Elwood Shannon Ronald Fisher Randomized algorithm Fischer Random Chess String theory Random Harvest Carmichael number Cognitive bias Evariste Galois Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Grothendieck's S__minaire de g__om__trie alg__brique Integral Aberration in optical systems Massachusetts Institute of Technology General relativity History of computing hardware Scientific method Specified complexity Jon Secada Chess Philosophy of mathematics Topology Immortality Adjoint functors Joseph Louis Lagrange Numerology North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Hardware random number generator Al-Khwarizmi Water Turing test Current teachings of Prem Rawat Manifold Newton's method TI-89 series Random walk History of mathematics Grand unification theory Orders of magnitude (numbers) Oliver Heaviside Probability theory
