shot in broad daylight by an old man what gives i had a nightmare that my mom and i were outside of a store in my car parked on the side of the street she was in the back seat and i in the driver's seat all of a sudden two males came running out of the store one with a small bag the other just running they ran past my car and behind it it seemed they were running to a pick up truck parked behind me there were alot of ppl on the street watching an older man which i'm guessing was the owner came out shooting at these two men one got away the other however whom i was watching in my rearview mirror was shot in the right arm and leg upon me screaming the old man turned to my car and stuck the gun in the back window where my mother was and i tried to start the car up and take of but he just started shooting and shooting and she was screaming then i tried to pull off and he shot me like times and then he turned to an elderly lady on the sidewalk and shot her i have no idea where this came from wowzers help dreams are just that dreams there is no reality in a dream because they are created from the subconscious mind and not the conscious mind the difference between the two parts of the mind is this conscious thoughts have validity and can be compartmentalized into catagories that you can control with your own will power while subconscious thoughts are all in a big vat and stirred up all together and pulled out at random with no ability to control them whatsoever your subconscious mind will take the person you saw this morning and put them in a box you used for storage yesterday and place them it in a dumpster you put the trash into last week and create a dream there is no reason for it and no valitity to it it is just a dream dreams come when we do not reach deep sleep and therefore hear sounds or noises that stir our subconscious into reasoning where those noises come from and what is creating them since the subconscious cannot find the answer it creates one thus you dream the best way to avoid dreaming is to do whatever you need to do to clear your conscious mind before you go to bed so that you can rest properly some ways to do that are to exercise in the evening take walks read for awhile avoid late eating avoid heavy action movies several hours before bedtime and watch something lighter or even take sleeping pills if all the rest fails to work you most likely watched some sort of war or espionage type movie recently and coupled it with some news about a hold up or something your subconscious just created the show for your benefit from all the stuff you put into its vat hope that helps Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Rose (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Sleep Dream Insomnia Daylight saving time James Hanratty Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Grandview, U.S.A.
