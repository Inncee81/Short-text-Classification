anyone else have a recurring cast of characters in their dreams because i do they are always different stories involving the same group of people and this has been ongoing for nearly years now it started out with only people but has now grown into a group of around i have actually 'been' one of the characters and this seems to happen when this particular person is in my dream what is odd is that recently i discovered in a funny way that he is gay and has been in a relationship with one of the other characters in my dream i'm almost positive my jaw dropped in my sleep because i had no idea that he or the other character for that matter were gay at all if any of you were wondering most all of the events in my dreams seem to be inspired by the online game 'city of heroes' and the role playing game 'vampire the masquerade' if you dream that you are gay but you are not in your waking life or hanging out with a group of gay people it is symbolic of self love and self acceptance you are becoming comfortable with your sexuality and masculine side if in your dream you hate the idea of homosexuality then it represents your fears and rejection of parts of your own sexuality if you are gay in real life then the dream is simply a reflection of your own self your subconscious mind might be telling you that your girlfriend or friend is keeping a secret from you in some way or you could just be feeling insecure about the strength and nature of a relationship communication is key to finding out what's really going on Avenue Q Gay Sexual orientation Friends Bisexuality Human sexual behavior Gender role Recurring South Park characters Ex-gay Dream Homosexuality Slash fiction W.I.T.C.H.
