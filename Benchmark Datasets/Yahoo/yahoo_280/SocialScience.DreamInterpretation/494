when i was young i had this dream once and it freaked me out my dad there was two of him it was strange they were both talking to me and it was obvious to me that they were trying to say which one was the real one but icouldn't hear no sound i took it that i had a fear of not hearing but i wouldn't care less to tell the truth so what did that dream mean my god i just remembered it i'd forgotten that for a while it always used to scare me thinking of it n i think i had it twice actually perhaps around that time you had heard someone you knew was adopted or told that his dad was really only a stepfather something seems to have given you doubts as to whether your father was really your true father or not and so he and the other father appeared you were deaf because you did not want to hear the truth if it was that your father wasn't your dad and that is a frightening thought for a small child Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Hey Jude Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Social rule Daredevil Salad Fingers Dream Father's Day (Doctor Who) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience 2004 Republican National Convention Father Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde About a Boy Grandview, U.S.A.
