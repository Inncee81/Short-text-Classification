dream meaning ok don't laugh this is a weird bit of the dream i had last night that i remember i had baked a pink cake and it was so good a huge chunk soared into the sky and god ate it i didn't see it happen but i knew he did it was nighttime and for a few minutes the sky lit up like day as if he was pleased lol okay what the heck does that mean i am religious but not fanatic by any means and have never dreamt about god literally before cake to see a cake in your dream indicates that you need to learn to share and allocate your workload instead of trying to do everything yourself cakes also symbolize selfishness or the feeling of not getting your fair share more positively the dream may represent your accomplishments and achievements consider also the metaphor a piece of cake or some situation that is easy to see a partially eaten cake in your dream signifies missed and lost opportunities pink pink represents love joy sweetness happiness affection kindness being in love or healing through love is also implied with this color the color fuchsia represents your connection to your spirituality and meditation you are letting go of old attitudes and ready for change this color is also associated with emotional stability the appearance of hot pink color in your dream represents sex and lust god to see god in your dream signifies your spirituality and expression of your feelings about divinity god also symbolizes an untouchable unreachable and unattainable notion of perfection thus such a dream may highlight your struggles and attempts with trying to be perfect sky to look up at the clear blue sky in your dream denotes peace and freedom of expression if the sky is cloudy and overcast then it foretells of sadness and trouble to have a dream that takes place at night represents some major setbacks and obstacles in achieving your goals there are some issues in your life that you are facing that are not too clear you should put the issues aside so you can clear your head before coming back to it alternatively night may be synonymous with death rebirth and new beginnings to dream of a sunny day symbolizes clarity and or pleasantness you are seeing things clearly to dream of a gloomy or cloudy day signifies sadness if you dream of a particular day then you may need to look closely at that day for any significance consider the number associated with that day a certain date could highlight a special anniversary appointment or occasion to dream of the passing of a day indicates that you need to manage your time better and plot out your goals in a more deliberate manner so i would say that you are trying to hard to change your fate that god has set for you and when you let god take control of your life you will see peace and freedom hope i helped if you dont think my calculations are correct try to put your thoughs together with the info on each subject i gave you Love Pysanka Scientology beliefs and practices Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happiness The Amber Spyglass A Course In Miracles Past teachings of Prem Rawat Simone Weil Cliff Richard Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sant Thakar Singh Philo New Age Numerology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Eastern Orthodox Church Idolatry Evil Meaning of life Royal Assent Jon Secada Immortality Religious Society of Friends Hinduism Mortification of the flesh Meditation Brahmanism Scenes from a Memory Time Out of Mind Bhajan Human Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Mercury Atlas 6 Trimurti Horus God Emperor of Dune Christian eschatology Evolutionary creationism Characters of The Sandman Shinto Theodicy Jiddu Krishnamurti Bhagavad Gita Alanis Morissette Baptism W.I.T.C.H.
