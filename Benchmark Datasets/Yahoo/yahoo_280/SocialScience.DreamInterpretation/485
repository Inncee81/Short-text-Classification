why do i keep having the same dream theme and what does it mean ever since i was younger i always had a common theme running in my dreams mostly it's that i am at home usually one that i don't recognize and the rest of my friends and family are there that's when i notice or sense a tornado and run all my friends and family out of my house make sure i have everyone then leave sometimes i run leading the tornado away from my family in an effort to help them get away after that in every dream i watch the tornado as it rips everything apart scared lifeless but interested amazed and almost feeling like i'm connected with the tornado each time i have this dream it's a new setting some different people but the basic story is the same i can't understand why i always wait at the end to watch because after that it always ends i should mention when i was a child i was interested in meteorology and i found tornadoes to be fascinating now my interest has lessened but this dream still persists any ideas thanks in advance d here are my thoughts the tornado represents chaos or a destructive powerful force which is threatening 'home' or your sense of identity sense of self you are protective of friends and family not wanting them to be hurt by your chaos or this change you're going through but ultimately you have to go through your own catharsis change or chaos to become a more mature 'improved version' of yourself if you will so of course you want to stay and see the final outcome because this is your own growth process happening before your eyes does any of that sound relevant to you Jon Secada Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Chaos theory Scenes from a Memory The Shining (film) Theory of conduct Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Social rule Incarnations of Immortality Sonic the Hedgehog DC Universe Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Sub-Zero Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Storytelling Cyberspace Karen Horney Shaggy dog story Death Comes to Time Tropical cyclone Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak Hurricane Rita Carl Jung Yoga Sutras of Patanjali About a Boy Pitaten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Infantilism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind American Idiot Jiddu Krishnamurti Philosophical skepticism Mathematics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Predestination W.
