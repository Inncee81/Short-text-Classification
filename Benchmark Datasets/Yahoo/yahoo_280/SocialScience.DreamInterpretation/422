in my dream a guy is cuddling up with me and flirting with me and the moment i react to it he is disgusted with me this has got to indicate something something about some insecurity i just don't get it dream we are in a movie theater and he puts his arm around me and is being all sweet and once i lean into his arms that he put around me he gets mad the guy is just a random guy i don't know him in real life maybe there is more to this dream you havent seen yet like maybe there is a second part because i had a dream and days later the same guy was in it but like part two so maybe there was like someting you did in the dream that you didnt see or there was something in your life that made u think of a guy and maybe you where think bad so the dream became bad but honey it was just a dream Lindy Basic The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Humphrey Bogart Swingout Mystery Science Theater 3000 Cliff Richard Teen Girl Squad The Regina Monologues Dream Bon Jovi Makaveli: The Don Killuminati: 7 Day Theory Journey (band) Homestar Runner Hip hop collaborations Family Guy Kim Possible Avenue Q The Shining (film) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Billboard Hot 100 Side pass (dance move) Social rule 50 First Dates American Beauty (1999 film) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Marilyn Monroe The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Taxi Driver American Idiot W.I.T.C.H.
