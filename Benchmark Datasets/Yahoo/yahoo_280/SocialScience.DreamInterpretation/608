bet you can't interpret this dream from the first point i can remember i was entering my friend's brother's dorm i wasn't supposed to be there as i really don't know him and i have no idea why i just up and walked in there he just stood there playing a gameboy and looked up at me briefly completely apathetic as i walked to the next room all four or so of his roommates were on four separate computers all lined up against the same wall i thought this was all very peculiar as he doesn't seem like the video game playing type i eventually left and was confronted by something very disturbing i can't recall it very well but i think it was like a enlarged model of a certain male organ but there was more to it that made it more disturbing i just can't remember what it was this is one of the weirdest dreams ever i'm interested to see if someone's creative enough to actually incite meaning into this good luck lonely girl lmao me too i would interpret the dream based on your feelings toward your brother and his roommates did you feel the video game culture is boy oriented or male dominated and women females are invading their sacred space believe it or not i have a friend who is female who goes to gaming conventions and totally smokes the other players usually guys who don't appreciate a girl doing that in general a lot of areas that become male dominated are not women friendly there is usually a challenge to break the glass ceiling and struggle before women are accepted and are no longer treated as an exception or anomaly or tested to see if they can hang with the boys no pun intended Friends The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct Undergrads Bubble Bobble Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sigmund Freud The Emancipation of Mimi Shaggy dog story Game Boy Advance Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Public domain Blood on the Tracks Sin City Little Britain Betting (poker) FoxTrot Sydney Riot of 1879 It's Walky!
