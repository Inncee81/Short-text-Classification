is it posible to dream what you want to dream is there any way to control what you dream at night i'm just curious what do you have to do to control it you can dream about what you want doing it takes some concentration but it's not as hard as you might think after your finally comfortable and as you try to sleep and your mind fills with thoughts imagine a scene and play it out in your head focusing on the scene as coherently as you can creating details dialogs and action but driving the scene forward while not playing to much with the overall story of the dream you want if you do this right the scene in your mind becomes the dream and moves on it's own from there this is also a great way to drop to rem sleep really fast which is good for power naps controlling dreams is the holy grail of dreaming keeping in your mind that you want to lucid dream when you go to sleep is a start but the trick is to figure out that your dreaming without waking up usually something non sensical that could only happen in a dream will be the trigger trying to forcefully control a dream usually ends up in waking up but nudging the dream and trying to only apply small changes and shifts can keep you in control but still dreaming lucid dreaming is hard don't be discourage if it takes a while to have a good experience with it Lucid dreaming Dream Narcolepsy Hypnosis Insomnia Parsifal Consciousness Sleep paralysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind W.
