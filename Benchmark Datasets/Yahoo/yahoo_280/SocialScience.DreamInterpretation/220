learning while lucid dreaming i was wondering if it is possible to learn to do things by practicing them in your lucid dreams for example one night while lucid dreaming i decided in my dream to practice screaming for heavy metal vocals i watched a dvd and soaked up alot of information and used the info i learned from the dvd in my lucid dream to practice it now before that day i couldnt even come close to screaming at all after that dream it was like i was able to i remembered right away how to position my head use my diaphram not my throat etc it was almost like it was second nature after just one night i have yet to be able to learn something new in my dreams again but does anyone know if there is a way to learn how to do this in your lucid dreams and how to have alot of lucid dreams whenever you want to also is there a way to have complete control over your lucid dreams like knowing that you want to drive a car really fast or jump off a building and being able to dream it thanks yes believe it or not thats one of the main reasons for lucid dreaming learing things practicing things in a safe and secure environment on a soul level other uses for the lucid dream are to work out issues in a safe environment or to explore the future past or current events thus presenting a prophetic dream what you did was get it exactly right in the dream then that boosted your confidence and gave you the feel for doing it in the waking state and yes you can control a dream completely it just takes a lot of practice and some people are better at it than others i for one an unable to do that completely but have consciously altered my dreams from time to time Dream Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Consciousness Dream Theater Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Carl Jung Sin City Milton H.
