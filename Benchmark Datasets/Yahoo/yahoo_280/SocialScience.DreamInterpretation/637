does any one have epic dreams so when i dream i often have a heroic saga alot like lord of the rings for some reason when i wake up from the dream usually rudly cut short in an interesting part it's like i pause the story then when i fall asleep next time i come to that exact part and continue somtimes it takes an entire week to complete the story does anyone else have dreams like that that happens to me at least once every few months i've had ones about being a student at hogwarts and once i had one that was this weeklong story about sonic the hedgehog actually it would make a pretty good fanfic what's weird to me is when i have one of those in progress i actually can't wait to go to bed at night and get back to the story i guess it's like reading a really good book Sonic the Hedgehog Canon (fiction) Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Dream Theater Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amber Spyglass Chaos Emerald Norse saga Amy Rose Beowulf Trilogy Fan fiction Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Philosophical skepticism Canonical hours J.
