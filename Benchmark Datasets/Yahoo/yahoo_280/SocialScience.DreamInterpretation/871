wierd dream with me going crazy and demons buried in a moon okay so this is how it goes at first im playing a game kind of like a mix of paintball and lasertag but it hasnt been invented yet and wer playing in a really huge building with like floors and there is this guy thats behind a desk and hes running the game and he keeps giving us little missions to get us ready to start playing and so i was doing them and then i saw this gatorade waterbottle i had and another empty waterbottle in my vest pocket and since the gatorade bottle wouldnt fit i emptied the gatorade into the waterbottle and then the guy that was running the game said that i was the best one and smiled and then i skipped over to being in this house alone and i was looking out this window and i saw this moon that was right outside the window and was so close i could touch it so i stuck a paperclip in and said that when i come back the moon would have rotated so the paperclip would be on the top and in the back of my mind i was thinking that it wasnt going to be there at all when i came back so i went to walk around the house and it turned into a party and i just stayed their talking to people for a while and then i came back to the window and there was no paperclip so i stuck another one in and started to dig a little hole and i saw a demon in it and it tried to pull me into it so i just burried it and left and i started going downstairs to the party and at the top of the stairs i got stuck and couldnt move any part of my body and i started thinking that maybe when people go crazy their spirits get stuck somewhere and their body runs around all crazy and no one knows that its not really you and that your spirits really stuck somewhere and then i got unstuck and went down the stairs and then i think my alarm woke me up you dream has two segments or major items to be considered to interpret this guy behind a desk that runs the game moon with a paper clip gatorade bottle vs empty water bottle need being praised by the guy about you are the best one seeking recognition stuck a paper clip in the moon leaving some mark make impression seeing a demon like regret guilt conscience let's conclude the dream you may have some need in your reality that you are seeking a heavy recognition projecting yourself being praised by the game who runs the game show symbols of looking for respect and attention this guy in some sense could symbolize anyone who is above you in reality it could be your boss teachers parents or any one who could grant your permission for things you want to do you may be getting acceptance in reality projecting yourself being the best by his approval shows some sign of accomplishment in life at the same time you clip the paper on the moon shows symbol of making an impression to others however may be due to guilt conscience or over confidence you may be feeling a little regret projecting demon in this case could mean that you are having some conflict in some way it could mean something you may be overdoing it and you regret about it basically you are venting out your accomplishment feeling in dream you may be trying to suppress it but can't do it in reality but do it in dream Columbine High School massacre Humphrey Bogart The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Out-of-body experience Milton H.
