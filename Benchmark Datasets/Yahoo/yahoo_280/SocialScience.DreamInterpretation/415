violent dreams for awhile now i've had dreams many where people are chasing after me and i have to escape them lately said people are catching me and really hurting or killing me wtf i'm being chased chase dreams often stem from feelings of anxiety in your walking life the way we respond to anxiety and pressure in real life is typically manifested as a chase dream running is an instinctive response to physical threats in our environment often in these dream scenarios you are being pursued by some attacker who wants to hurt or possibly kill you you are running away hiding or trying to outwit your pursuer chase dreams may represent your way of coping with fears stress or various situations in your waking life instead of confronting the situation you are running away and avoiding it ask yourself who is the one chasing you and you may gain some understanding and insight on the source of your fears and pressure the pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent a part of yourself your own feelings of anger jealousy fear and possibly love can assume the appearance of threatening figure you may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser next time you have a chase dream turn around and confront your pursuer ask them why they are chasing you one may be consumed by their own anger jealousy love or self destructive behavior for example you may be drinking too much or exhibiting open hostility toward others around you you may subconsciously be threatened by these actions which have been jeopardizing your relationships and or career your dreams are a way of calling attention to these self destructive actions a more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked such dreams are more common among women than men who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment these dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over exposed from the media the violence that the media portrays magnifies our fears and how at risk we all are hurt to dream that you are hurt signifies wounded emotions or feelings that you may have suppressed you need to address these feelings in order to properly heal killing to dream that you killed someone forewarns that heavy stress may cause you to lose your temper and self control identity the characteristics of the person that you have killed and ask yourself if you feel any rage towards this person in your waking life you may be expressing some rage or hatred toward this person to dream that you have been killed suggests that your actions are disconnected from your emotions this dream may also represent a part of you or your life that you wish would leave you alone and stop creating a nuisance killing may represent the killing off of old parts of yourself and old habits Domestic violence Anger management Borderline personality disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Narcissism Hulk (comics) Homophobia Rape Dog Fathers' rights God Emperor of Dune Transactional analysis Anxiety Obsessive-compulsive disorder Sigmund Freud EastEnders Gender role Psychoanalysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Daredevil Human Karen Horney Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Human sexual behavior Joker (comics) A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Anger Hikikomori Anorexia nervosa Columbine High School massacre The Shining (film) Transsexuality Second language acquisition Dissociative identity disorder Emotion Antisocial personality disorder Gestalt therapy Dead Like Me Motivation Paranoia Agent Media and ethnicity Alexander Technique Sadism and masochism Chapterhouse Dune Kain (Legacy of Kain) Macbeth Asperger syndrome Maison Ikkoku Self-harm The Brothers Karamazov Enneagram Reparative therapy Equilibrium (2002 film) Anarcho-primitivism Green Goblin Ex-gay Autism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Existentialism Hypoglycemia Thor (Marvel Comics) Vulcan (Star Trek) Sleep Zoophilia Sexual orientation Bully Hip hop rivalries Boston Public Hate group Charmed Internet troll Alcoholism Cordelia Chase Venom (comics) Pontiac's Rebellion W.I.T.C.H.
