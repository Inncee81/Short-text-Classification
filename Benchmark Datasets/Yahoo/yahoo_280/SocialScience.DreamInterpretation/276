how can i increase my chances of having a lucid dream i got told on a program i watched that there are many ways one of witch is hearing and knowing about it but that didnt work for me so any other ways and i was wondering is it kinda bad for you if you lucid dream every night since your kinda not really asleep if you want to have really lucid dreams put a nicotine patch on your arm before bedtime it's like watching a really weird movie Lucid dreaming The Shining (film) Sleep Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dream Avenue Q Out-of-body experience Witchcraft Therion (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters of The Sandman Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare K' Nicotine The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Hansel und Gretel Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Jazz Singer The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Amber Spyglass Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Conspiracy (TNG episode) Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Spidey Super Stories Escape from New York Journey (band) W.I.T.C.H.
