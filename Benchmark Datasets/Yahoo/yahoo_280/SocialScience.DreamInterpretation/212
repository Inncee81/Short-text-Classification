odd dream i had a really weird dream i'm married but i'm not preganat or anything but i dreamed that i went into the hospital to have a baby but i wasent fat or anything they all at once it felt like i woke up and they told me i had had twins but one of them died morbid i know then they my family parents etc told me i didnt have to name the one that died but i told them i wanted to name it any ideas hospital support help have a baby responsibilities having twins and one died burden no need to name that one that died giving up hope it seems to me that you are stressed about something in life it may be related to your family you may be feeling obligated into something however there is so much you can do projecting yourself in the hospital symbolize some sort of help you are seeking on the surface it seems like you are seeking help however this dream hints that you are trying to help someone from not name the one baby who died show signs of helpless conscience in reality perhaps in reality you are feeling helpless for someone or something and that caused you dream like that subconsciously Days of our Lives Infantilism Unconscious mind Knots Landing Dream Jean Grey Abortion debate Friends Transactional analysis Divorce Charmed Night (book) Carl Jung Simone Weil Mulholland Drive (film) Jon Secada S__ren Kierkegaard EastEnders Out-of-body experience Existentialism Baby Blues History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Narcissism Edgar Cayce The Endless Sigmund Freud Scenes from a Memory Miss Saigon One Tree Hill (TV series) Therion (band) Avenue Q Paranoia Agent Childbirth American Idiot Lucid dreaming Khan Noonien Singh Friedrich Schleiermacher Eyes Wide Shut Breastfeeding Random Harvest Scarlet Witch About a Boy Clinical depression Characters in the Smurfs Irna Phillips Self-harm Religion Rais massacre Kodocha Alois Hitler George Costanza Nancy Witcher Astor First Battle of the Atlantic The Shining (film) William Thetford Hunter S.
