a very violent dream had a dream where i was walking through my old neighborhood san bernardino california where i was born and raised by the th street park and got surrounded by members of a certain gang they were yelling asking me what set i claim which means what gang am i affiliated with they had automatic weapons and starting shooting from all directions even from half block away i was hit maybe times but i wasn't hurt but i laid down and pretended to be dead to keep from getting shot i waited until they all came closer to look at me i pulled out my knife and stabbed one person in the eye forcefully after that everyone stepped back and i just walked away looking for help went to a woman who couldn't take bullets out because the only tools she had was two sewing needles so she couldn't help think i was on the way to the hospital after that i ended up in some kind of an office where i had a pistol i was loading this was really a dream i had what do you think this could mean you are tired of pretending to fit into your environment by playing dead you seek help escaping your situation the woman but it seems that others are unable to help you only needles you have to do it on your own by loading a gun the fact you are loading it in an office shows that your subconscious has already figured out that the way out is education you must be a young person this escaping an environment is a common dream theme among youths follow your dream message and improve yourself through education the prophetic part of your dream is the number of bullets you took that means that you will have a hard journey out of your situation you will pretend to fit in to the environment playing dead until you are ready to rise up and do something good luck to you Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Sin City Reservoir Dogs Cartridge (firearms) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Escape from New York Columbine High School massacre EastEnders Donald Neilson RoboCop Tag Pistol Blood (computer game) Revolver Heckler & Koch MP5 Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Shotgun M16 (rifle) Kill Bill San Bernardino County, California Knife Internal ballistics Airsoft SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wyatt Earp Carbine Punisher Kammerlader Characters of Naruto Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Journey (band) Meat Loaf Social rule Naruto jutsu Knots Landing GLOCK Dutch Schultz B-47 Stratojet Heckler & Koch G3 Machine gun Marathon (computer game) Tenshinhan The Contender (television series) Gun politics Assault rifle Mumia Abu-Jamal Bullet Jonestown GunZ The Duel Worms weapons and tools Gun safety Doom enemies Terminal ballistics Manhunt (video game) Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening YuYu Hakusho Infinite Ryvius Good Times 1957 World Series The Amber Spyglass Natural Selection (computer game) The Suffering (game) The Covenant Second Battle of the Atlantic Crips Grand Theft Auto III GoldenEye The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Stopping power Handloading Srebrenica massacre Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Combine (Half-Life 2) StarCraft: Uprising Kung Fu Hustle W.I.T.C.H.
