reccuring dreams i have dreams all the time that i am being chased by some horrific monster that wants to eat me but i feel like im walking through cement i cant run and i cant make noise what could this mean i've had dreams like this since i was a little girl i believe this dream means that you have an amazing destiny and giftedness the enemy of your soul satan has been trying to stop this destiny since you were a child you feel hindered and incapable of stopping his attack which generates fear as you seek god as the prince of peace you will find peace in your life and the dream will stop it may also indicate that you have been running from god again as you seek more intimacy with god the dream should stop Incarnations of Immortality Meaning of life God Emperor of Dune Kain (Legacy of Kain) Mystique (comics) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Books of Blood The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe W.I.T.C.H.
