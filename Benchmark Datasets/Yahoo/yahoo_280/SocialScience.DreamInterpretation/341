dreams nightmares i dont usually remeber my dreams but lately i have been having many dreams or should i say nightmares in the last week i had my first dream about someone dying my mom now i keep having dreams about other family members dying usually my dreams are just a dream about a day like activities i do anyone know what these death dreams mean or what could cause it thanks maybe recent frustration with your mother doesnt mean you subconsciously want her dead though the brain works in complex ways so at any point in time even when you're awake its hard to really say what dreams or conscious actions represent i would need more information as to the specifics of the dreams and your recent feelings actions thoughts etc to give you a clearer answer your mom could also be in trouble Dream Unconscious mind Consciousness Sleep Scenes from a Memory Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Psychology of religion The Mother Wes Craven's New Nightmare Philosophy of mind Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Philosophy of perception Psychosis The Power of Nightmares Eric Cartman Existentialism Death Philosophical skepticism Sigmund Freud Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Oneiromancy Nightmares (Buffy episode) Artificial consciousness Green Goblin Electroencephalography Kurt Cobain Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Astral projection Treehouse of Horror V Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Jean Grey Narcolepsy Free will Brain Phantasms (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Doug The Catcher in the Rye Philip K.
