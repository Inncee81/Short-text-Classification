weird dream i had i had a dream about this guy that i knew from a few years ago i see him once a year hardly because he lives in new jersey and i live in connecticut we barely talked to each other but everytime i talked to him i felt so good and i just couldn't stop thinking about him for a long time we both were friends on myspaces but rarely talked and if we did it would be about a band that we both liked i don't know if he notices that and feels the same way as i do but my dream dealt with him living in my town and he's like talking to me and confessing to me his secrets i dont know if they're real or not but he's just talking to me and we're acting as if we're best friends that's basically what my dream was now my question is is this what i want either a friendship or a relationship with this guy do i want him to talk to me or make the first move because i know i want to but i don't and i don't know what's holding me back i'm usually not shy either please explain my dream well i'm not a dream expert but i would say you would like something more with this man than just seeing him usually if you dream about something it's because it's something that you are really thinking of alot and you can't get it out of your head kinda like if you see a scary movie and then you go to bed and have a nightmare it's cause you are still thinking of the scary movie and you have scary thoughts in your head i would say to be honest with yourself and with him think about it really hard and see the pros and cons how would it work out if you did get serious with him and if it does not work out how would you handle losing a friend dreams are dreams you are going to have to figure this out in real life a dream can just be something you want and not reality he might be giving the signs to you but thinking something else just talk to him if he is as good of a friend as you think he is he should not mind and he would appreciate your honesty hope this helps The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Jean Grey Lucid dreaming K' Cliff Richard Out-of-body experience Friends Dream The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Lovely Bones Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Scenes from a Memory Sigmund Freud Theory of conduct Doris Day Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Social rule God Emperor of Dune The Life and Times of Juniper Lee W.I.T.C.H.
