why can i feel pain in my dream its not that i fell off my bed or anything like that but in my dream i was kinda walking with a sword and these undead ppl got me to the ground and told me to drop my weapon while they pointed their weps at me i dropped it the stabbed me i felt all the pain like it was actually happening and when i woke up i was kinda in pain for minutes in the spot where i got stabbed which was the heart and all around from my neck down to my waist whats the cause of this im kinda freaked out this is a good one it is a false myth that u cant feel pain i a dream this is a case of mind over matter if the mind truely believes it is being harmed it can hurt example if u dream u are doing physical labor when u wake insted of feelin rested you will be tired and may have acheing muscles if you want this to stop you have to convince yourself that you are indeed dreaming this shouldnt be too hard for you because there are no undead but for my father it is more difficult because he dreams of everyday things like work and bills hope i helped Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pain Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind W.I.T.C.H.
