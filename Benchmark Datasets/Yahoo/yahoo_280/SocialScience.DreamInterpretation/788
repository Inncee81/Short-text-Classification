weird dream before dream details i drive an ugly honda civic brown basically a pile of poo i have been with my jeep obsessed boyfriend for almost months k so this is how the dream ended i don't remember most of the beginning i was at my ex boyfriends house with my brown civic all of a sudden i realized what time it was and had to leave so i hopped into my gorgeous red jeep which i don't own in real life and left the pile of poo car there then i woke up could this mean something like i should did leave the dead beat behind and finally found someone i really like or could it be more symbolic than that maybe i'm just dumb but that dream stuck out for a reason i think about changing my boyfriend that is ridiculous he is the only thing right now that is pushing me to do what i want to do not what everyone else wants me to do the house i left was my ex boyfriends house whom probably tmfi but i lost it to he is the only other guy i've slept with besides the current guy could that be significant i think its more prophetic than weird looks like you and jeepman may be driving off into the sunset leaving the 'poo' where it lies Memento (film) Sin City Knots Landing Scenes from a Memory Shaggy dog story Megan Griffin Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare EastEnders Characters of The Sandman Friends Lucid dreaming Salad Fingers Ron and Fez Dream Teen Girl Squad Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Conker's Bad Fur Day Smallville (Season 4) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sex and the City Mulholland Drive (film) Nightmares (Buffy episode) Hip hop collaborations Kodocha Jean Grey Aerosmith Out-of-body experience 50 First Dates George Costanza Sliders Recurring South Park characters Ford Motor Company Everwood The Amber Spyglass Honda Civic Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Neighbours Daredevil Eddie Guerrero W.I.T.C.H.
