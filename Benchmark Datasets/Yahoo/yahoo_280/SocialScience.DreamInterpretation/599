i keep dreaming about goldfish anyone know why last night was the third time in a month that i have had a goldfish dream and in every one of them at least one fish has died anyone got any ideas what this might mean possibly you have suffered a loss and you are processing the grief in your dream in a way that is managable for you the word gold in goldfish may mean you have lost something that was golden to you often dream images are a play on words gold is something precious and valuable the word fish could represent a pet or for some it is a christian symbol or it could just be metaphor for swimming in something etc water often represents feelings or emotions water in a fish bowl could mean you are keeping your emotions tightly contained Goldfish Aquarium American Dad!
