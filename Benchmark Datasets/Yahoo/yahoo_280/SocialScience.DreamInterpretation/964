nightmares of my ex serious this is really scary i was at my school early in the morning wayyyy before the sun was u with a girl that i used to be best friends with my father whom i havent talked to in over monthes anyways as me the girl were in the back of the car waiting to get out then we pulled up my dad starts looking out the dash window like he is looking for someone then i said bye dad love you he just starts nodding then we hop out the car i said comon we have to go to school she wouldent come i said w e then i kept walking then some one in all black jumped out of the bushes shot me in my dream i opened eyes saw my ex's face what does that mean dreams about being at school often mean you are feeling inescure about your social status your abilities or your performance in a situation a dream that takes place in school may also be a metaphor for the lessons you are learning in your life im not so sure about your friendship with that girl but if this is the case then to see a friend in your dream who you no longer see in real life the friendship is over or they moved away means you wish for a time in your past when you had no responsibilities and things were much simpler and more carefree you may be wanting to escape the the pressures and stresses of growing up or it could be a signal that it's time to start acting more mature to see your father in your dream symbolizes authority and protection it suggests that you need to be more self reliant if you are in the backseat of a car your dream indicates that you let others tell you what to do possibly due to low self confidence im not sure this helps but black symbolizes the unknown the unconscious danger mystery and malice to see bushes in your dream symbolizes obstacles that are blocking your progress if you get shot you will be annoyed by a nasty person if you hear the sound of shooting in your dream this means that selfishness will be the cause of unhappiness between you and someone you love i think this dream symbol is the one you need to pay close attention to because of its significance to dream about your ex boyfriend suggests that something or someone in your current life is bringing out similar feelings to the ones you felt in the relationship with your ex the dream may be a way of alerting you to the same or similar behavior in a current relationship what you learned from that previous relationship may need to be applied to the present one so that you do not repeat the same mistake that's all i could find good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Scenes from a Memory Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
