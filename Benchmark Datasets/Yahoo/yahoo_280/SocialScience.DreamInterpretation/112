i had a freaky dream can anyone tell me what it means i had a dream about this girl from my school who was killed in a drunk driving accident a drunk driver hit her car i dreamt that she came with me to church and the priest broke down crying when he saw her he was like we got so worried we couldn't find you we thought you were gone she was pretending like nothing ever happened she looked like how i usually saw her not like her in the casket please if anyone can tell me what it means i will be happy to listen it sounds like your dream is saying that people were concerned where this young lady went at the passing of her death either heaven or hell that's why the priest was so worried and said we couldn't not find you not that they did not know where she was physically but spiritually by the young lady showing up to church with you it validates she is alive spiritually and still part of the church only in heaven Knots Landing Heaven The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an What Dreams May Come Jon Secada Immortality Dead Like Me Pitaten EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) John F.
