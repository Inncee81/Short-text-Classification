dreaming about exorcism i have this recurring dream more like a nightmare really i've been dreaming about it for years it started four or five years ago i don't dream about it every night just every now and then and it's different everytime except for these elements it's an exorcism sometimes i'd be the exorcist sometimes i'd be the assisting priest i'm not a priest in real life sometimes i'd be a person witnessing the exorcism it's always the catholic kind of exorcism i'm catholic by the way if that matters any it's always in my house sometimes i'd dream about my actual house sometimes the place would look different but for some reason i know it's my house sometimes i know the person who is possessed a friend or a relative sometimes an object is possessed sometimes a room in the house is possessed there's always a struggle between me and the spirit devil whatever you want to call it nope i don't watch a lot of horror movies because i really don't get scared they're nothing compared to these nightmares thank you very much for your responses i don't think i have a spirit in my house lol i've done a lot of research about exorcism facts and fiction and i've learn that bad spirits tend to inhabit places that are charged with ill feelings and negative energies i really don't put much stock in these things and the nightmare i've been having really doesn't bother me i guess i just want to figure out if this dream means anything or not exorcism to dream that you or others are being exorcised symbolizes your initiative to regain control and take steps toward the direction of your goals alternatively you may not be taking responsibility for your actions and are looking for a scapegoat Exorcism The Exorcist III The Exorcist The Exorcism of Emily Rose Ghost Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Horror film Characters of The Sandman Animism Holy water Opus Dei Devil Slayers Nine Inch Nails Lucid dreaming God Emperor of Dune Eucharist Demon Witchcraft The Nightmare Before Christmas Cyberspace Artificial consciousness Fictional character Baptism Evil Reiki Demonic possession K' Fatal Frame AFI 100 Years series Video nasty Philosophy of language Scapegoat Roman Catholic Church Clergy Pitaten Religion Holy Spirit Eastern Orthodox Church Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Alcoholics Anonymous Social psychology Shaggy dog story Electrophysiology The Shining (film) Post-traumatic stress disorder Daredevil Bad Wolf Exorcist II: The Heretic Anointing Miss Saigon Philosophical skepticism Baroque chess Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Traumatic incident reduction History of the English Bible Oh My Goddess!
