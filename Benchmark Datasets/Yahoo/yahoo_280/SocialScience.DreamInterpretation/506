ok don't laugh but i have this recurring dream about bathtubs in my dream i always walk into this room this huge room that is filled with these really big bathtubs all over on all different levels or sometimes i walk into the bathroom and there will be like or really big bathtubs whenever i watch tv when i'm awake i look for shows about remodeling bathrooms and have always wanted a really big spa bathtub but have never had one what is this with the bathtubs and why do i dream about them you're probably right about the need to be near water i am a pisces a water sign never thought about that before my name also means mermaid in spanish yes you are wanting and probably deserving a spa tub i think the tubs being on different levels might indicate that you will be able to purchase one when you reach a different level of income maybe that is one of the first things you are thinking of buying after you get your job when you finish school lol Hot tub Customs and etiquette of Japan Sento Bathing The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bathroom Shake It Off The Inside The Shining (film) Jayne Mansfield Shaggy dog story Lucid dreaming The Brady Bunch The Cure Bath The Catcher in the Rye Coriolis effect Plumbing fixture Friends Beavis and Butt-head Have I Got News For You Saw (film) Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sauna Euphemism Big Brother (USA TV series) Dream Theater Scenes from a Memory Philosophical skepticism Hogwarts Floor Directory Fancy Crane 10cc Brett Whiteley The Ersatz Elevator Grover Norquist Dymaxion house The Adventures of Pete & Pete Garfield Vladimir Peter Tytla Jacques-Louis David Queensbridge Twin Peaks Humphrey Bogart Marina District Spidey Super Stories Khatushyamji Milton H.
