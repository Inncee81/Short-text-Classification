what do your dreams mean does anyone know how to figure out what dreams mean my dad blocked new age things on my computer and i cant look at the websites i usualy do but ive been having this dream about this guy and i would listen to his heartbeat stroke his arm kiss him does this mean i love him or he loves me i know its a stupid question cause i should know but i went threw a horiable experance latly and i cant trust love so if there is anyone that can help me please help me thank you well i don't really know how to interpret those things i remember dreaming being a bird in a game world and then i became human again and found my best friend around a doraemon neighborhood and while i walked to him i was trampelled by a bunch of girls interpret that usually those are just random though unless they happen in a regular basis which could mean something dreams might just be random thoughts a wish you want fulfilled badly a past memory you recalled suddenly or premonitions unfortunately the latter is quite rare if that dream happens again and you really want to find out what it means maybe you should meet a psychologist they should know what that means hope it helps best of luck Meaning of life Dream Consciousness Philosophical skepticism The Lovely Bones Humphrey Bogart Garfield The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Little Britain Transactional analysis Past teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Social rule Lucid dreaming Milton H.
