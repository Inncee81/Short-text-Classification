what do my dreams mean i keep having dreams where i'm blush kissing guys that i'm friends with and don't like in that way in front a guy that i'm pretty certain has liked me for a while but has done nothing about it and i like him as well its always seems to be guys that we both know and i don't know what to think of these dreams since i seem to have them every once and a while i'm wondering if it's not a bit of foot stamping in your dream state if you know what i mean your subconscious is saying hey now to the guy that you like and think has liked you but hasn't done anything about it by showing off with guys you know are safe this is behavior some girls enact in their waking state trying to make guys jealous by flirting with safe guys in front of the guys they really want personally i think it's a nudge from your subconscious clearly these guys aren't going to make a move they probably like you but you know some guys are too shy to do anything if you're also shy you don't have to start kissing your male friends to get their attention try smiling and making eye contact with the guys you're interested in to encourage them to come over and say hi if you can get them to start talking you could probably encourage them to move a little faster Milton H.
