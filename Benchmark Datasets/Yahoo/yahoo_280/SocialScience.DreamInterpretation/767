wierd dreams lately in the first dream my friends are my enemies and i cut class in a parking lot w some random kids ive known for like years and i have a class schedule thats on a tennis ball but keeps bouncing away then my grandma and dog keep randomly showing up this happened in another dream where my grandma stowed away on my bus w my dog the second dream im at the same school but this time my friends are still my friends only theyve gotten made over theyre really trendy and peppy and were in gym and me and my best friend are just talking and for some reason all the girls have pink sweatsuits and the guys have tye dye shirts and im telling her about this guy whos apparently my boyfriend but in real life he's just this guy ive know for the past few years but dont really think of in that way and were being all giggly it probably doesnt have meaning but id like to know why im having them any thoughts the first dream could represent your desire for rebellion and non conformity you hang out with different people and since the ball with the schedule bounces away it means you don't want to live your life by a schedule but spontaneously and the second dream also proves that you dislike conformity or are against it were you trendy and preppy too or just your friends maybe your dream is telling you to get to know that guy that was your bf in your dream a little more if he's in your dream he was in your thoughts because your dreams are your thoughts being filed one by one dreams don't have to be about one thing it can be a mixture like conformity and getting to know people more The Fairly OddParents The Lovely Bones Teen Girl Squad Napoleon Dynamite About a Boy Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Saved by the Bell Philosophical skepticism Recurring South Park characters Little Britain Avenue Q Tennis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kodocha Neighbours Code: Lyoko Scenes from a Memory Good Morning, Vietnam The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bonus Stage Jennifer Lopez Kyle Broflovski Dream Shaggy dog story Friends Dead Like Me Social rule Fiddler on the Roof Hey Arnold!
