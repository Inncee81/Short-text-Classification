dream about dead person i had this dream about a girl i knew who is now dead but she appeared in my dream i was just walking with my friends this is in my dream and she was just walking right there next to us so i turned to my friends and said omg its kate and they got mad at me and said why are you talking about her don't talk about her and i asked them if they could see her but they couldn't i was the only one who could see her but then i took my friend's hand and brought it closer to kate's and my friend could feel her hand but she couldn't see her what does this mean well i have had those similar dreams but they were about my pets anyway i think that that means that your friends have forgotten about her and remember her just barely beccause they could feel her hands and to you it might mean that you should keep her close because she will keep you close always Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Amber Spyglass Cliff Richard EastEnders Avenue Q Friends The Shining (film) W.I.T.C.H.
