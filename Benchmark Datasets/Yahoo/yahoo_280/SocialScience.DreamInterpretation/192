i need serious help nothing seems to be working for me no good job havnt dated anyone for about years must have applied for over jobs within the past years no response from any of them i'm not ugly irresponsible people ask me out i've been stagnant wish someone could just tell me wat d problem is you don't know what your purpose in life is or you reject the one that god has for you purpose is what drives everybody and motivates them to find their destiny in life if you were like me at one time i was very gifted and could have done just about anything i wanted but it seemed like i could never get the right relationship or excel high enough to get to the next level in life i asked myself what was wrong with me then the lord showed me clearly that those doors were not open to me there was only one door that i could go through and that was the one the lord jesus christ had for me so the problem is god has your destiny and life but you have to make a decision to accept when god shuts the door the door is shut and when he opens it it's open take care and god bless you Sola fide Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Original sin Christian eschatology Trinity Chosen people Baptism Salvation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Repentance Virgin Mary in Islam John Howard Yoder S__ren Kierkegaard Evil Free will Jesus Religious conversion Roman Catholic Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eusebius of Caesarea Theodicy Justification (theology) Priesthood (Mormonism) Jewish Messiah Past teachings of Prem Rawat Meaning of life Sant Thakar Singh Saint John the Baptist Book of Mormon Eucharist Merit A Course In Miracles Biblical inerrancy Karma Kain (Legacy of Kain) Prophet Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Eastern Orthodox Church Holy Spirit One Tree Hill (TV series) Book of Isaiah Mass (liturgy) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Minister of religion Catholicism Restorationism Godspell Nontrinitarianism Jewish views of religious pluralism Christian views of Jesus Articles of Religion (Methodist) Summa Theologiae Community of Christ Moral objectivism Mary, the mother of Jesus Liturgical year Urantia Mother Teresa Herbert W.
