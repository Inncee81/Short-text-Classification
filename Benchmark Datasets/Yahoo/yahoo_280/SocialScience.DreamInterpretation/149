interesting dream i had a dream that i knew john stewart from the daily show he invited me over to his house to look at some stuff he went up to his room to do something while i waited downstairs his house was clean with new carpet but he had some financial printouts he left on the carpet i tried to turn them face down so i wouldn't see them but i accidentally glanced that he had million dollars he then asked for me to come upstairs he had one big stairs start to go up which split into several different carpeted stairs the one to his place had one huge gigantic step he said it was good because it kept the children out of his room i thought good idea but i struggled to climb the step i thought oh man i can't be this fat i finally got up the step after a couple of tries we then went to his room where he showed me something he wanted fixed it was some type of wooden and metal trinket his grandma had given him i said i could fix it and would replace it if something if something happened during the repair i told him i would take photos of it just in case i then told him i thought it was interesting that he was jewish i knew some reformed jewish people but had never met any conservative jewish people i said i'd always wanted to visit a conservative jewish church so later on i went to his church and sat in the row it looked like all men were divided from the women on each row it was theater like seating the guy at the front was talking but i wasn't paying too much attention another part of my dream involved fixing a broken female wrist watch with shiny pieces of metal for the hour markers and black background can't remember much else i think i know what it means any other guesses thanks for the answers i can top that the other night i stayed up till about four in the morning watching scrubs and playing ninja gaiden i had the strangest dream to start it sacred heart was a real hospital and all the cast members of scrubs were actual doctors the hospital was my old elementary school i started treating a friend of my brothers and he gave me a bag of weed for no reason because i didn't know what to do with it i went and talked to j d and doctor cox they told me to throw it down the sewer i went out by the sewer and found a dead guy when i looked in a long sewer pipe there was a wierd hologram of wonder woman flying from side to side i went back inside and j d told me it was a prank he was pulling on a patient i told them that there was a dead guy by it and cox yelled at j d and made me go investigate the cause of the man's death i go back out and the body is gone so i jump in the sewer when i reached the bottom i was equipped with a legendary ninja sword but still had on my scrubs i ventured through the sewers fighting off sewer zombie things i walked into a small cave where i was encountered by a giant electric worm i struggled but defeated the worm i go through a small passage way where the worm was and it takes me to a strange church like room with little light flames shot up in the back revealing doctor cox floating over the dead guy from before he told me that once he absorbed the body he would be the most powerful being in the world he put his hands on the dead guys chest and a bright light flashed when it faded there was cox with huge muscles purple skin and red eyes he let out a loud roar thinking quickly i ran along the side of the walls avoiding his lasers shooting from his eyes leaped toward him and decaptated him then i got out of the sewer went home and ate a calzone then i woke up i didnt know what the hell just happend EastEnders The Dalek Invasion of Earth Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside The Shining (film) Scenes from a Memory The Time Machine Vegeta One Piece minor characters Friends Professional wrestling throws Milton H.
