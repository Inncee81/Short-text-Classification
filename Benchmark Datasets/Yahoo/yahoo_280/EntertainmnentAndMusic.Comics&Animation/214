what naruto pairing do you like better naruto and sakura or sasuke and sasuke naruto and sakura me and my sister are always argueing about which pairing will end up in the end she always says sasuke and sakura because they're the most popular pairing even though i agree with that sometimes i still like naruto and sakura together better which pairing do you like better i can't see sakura ever seeing naruto in that way she always saw him as a nuisance but over time has come to tolerate and respect him sakura is head over heels about sasuke unfortunately until sasuke gets revenge on his brother i don't think he will be able to find love and happiness as he is always striving to surpass his brother and that mean every spare minute is devoted to that purpose if he can get passed that then maybe he will find the ability to love and commit to someone hopefully sakura will still be there waiting for him naruto i think will end up with hinata hinata is madly in love with naruto and he likes her not in the same way right now but he does like her as a person he's shown that by defending her sticking up for her after neji kept putting her down and saying that he liked her despite having a crush on sakura naruto genuinely like hinata and i think that will just get stronger until she is the only one he sees Naruto (manga) Uchiha Sasuke Uzumaki Naruto Characters of Naruto Hyuga Hinata Hatake Kakashi Naruto jutsu Hyuga Neji Haruno Sakura Naruto kekkei genkai Rock Lee Akatsuki (Naruto) Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Cardcaptor Sakura Nara Shikamaru Inuzuka Kiba Love Hina main characters Naruto: Narutimate Hero 2 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Samurai Deeper Kyo Naruto: Narutimate Hero Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Gaara Naruto geography GetBackers Naruto ninja ranks Naruto the Movie Death Note Seiy__ Ninpu Sentai Hurricanger Please Save My Earth Side Characters (Xenosaga) Ninja Sentai Kaku Ranger Masanori Murakawa One Piece minor characters Kitsune Cosmic Era list of characters Pok__mon Chronicles Love Hina minor characters Revenge My-HiME Ramen Maison Ikkoku Pitaten Ed, Edd n Eddy Love Sgt.
