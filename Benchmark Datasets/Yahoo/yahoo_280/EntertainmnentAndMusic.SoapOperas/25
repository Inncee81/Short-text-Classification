if given the opportunity how would you write a script for elizabeth's character on general hospital i personally can't stand elizabeth and think sam jason should be back together however if i was given the chance to write the script for elizabeth's character i would have so much fun first at this point since she perjured herself on the stand i would have ric call her to the stand again and have him trip her up admitting jake was her and jason's son with lucky hearing the whole thing she and lucky would divorce elizabeth would go to jail for perjury jason would be convicted for killing alcazar the baby would end up going into foster care and then sam would file to be a foster parent and take care of jake as a foster parent that's just for starters i just can't stand weepy little poor elizabeth it would be cool to have carly hook up with jerry too have jax w arina what a twist what would you do this is such a fun question because like you i cannot stand elizabeth either as jason's trial continues ric realizes that his case is not turning out as he has hoped and needs to resort to drastic measures knowing that elizabeth would not be pleased with his decision ric orders a paternity test to determine who the father of baby jake is in hopes that it is indeed jason proving this would show that elizabeth not only perjured herself but even lied about the phone call jason received in her presence the day alcazar vanished the twist would be that baby jake is really lucky's son and fake elizabeth has been lying to jason the whole time can you imagine how jason would feel knowing elizabeth led him to believe jake was his son not to mention all the pain she had caused between him and sam who he truly loved and cared deeply for in the meantime sam and lucky's relationship is turning into more than just friends the pain that both of them have experienced has left them hurt and seeking comfort in oneanother as the passion begins to develop they become romantically invovled unknown to anyone but amelia amelia confronts sam about the affair and threatens to tell elizabeth and jason while carly and jerry have planted a sufficient amount of evidence to make it look as if alcazar is alive which allows jason to be released however elizabeth is fighting to stay out of prison for perjury claiming that her children need their mother jason is trying to cope with losing sam and the love they shared and confides in spinelli determined to rekindle the romance spinelli tries very hard to reunite them together until sam realizes that she is pregnant with lucky's baby what a shock sam was told she could never carry to full term how could this happen although sam is very happy how will jason feel he could never give her a child and that is what she has always wanted doesn't that sound great EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Luke and Laura Spencer History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Another World (TV series) Hollyoaks General Hospital Knots Landing Charmed 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sex and the City Kodocha One Life to Live Everwood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Appeal Jean Grey Boston Public Humphrey Bogart Sunset Beach (soap opera) Smallville (Season 4) Taken Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dawson's Creek Plame affair Guiding Light Blood on the Tracks Sharon Tate Past characters (Neighbours) Marilyn Monroe Fred Phelps Friends Sin City Little Britain Series finale Fancy Crane Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada The Untouchables Hip hop rivalries Melanie Wilkes Phoebe Halliwell Vernon Schillinger Abortion debate Neighbours Big Brother (USA TV series) Daredevil Darth Vader The Fairly OddParents The Lovely Bones Glen Jacobs Harry Potter (character) The Ashlee Simpson Show Alois Hitler Seinfeld Leo Wyatt George Costanza Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Terri Schiavo Mystique (comics) Social rule Transsexuality Adoption All My Children Narcissism Great Teacher Onizuka Professional wrestling holds Big Brother UK series 6 About a Boy Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Death Gate Cycle Characters of Smallville T'Pol It's Walky!
