go sam go i know we have alot of sam kelly haters here but i for will not jump on that bandwagon y should we all forget that liz and jason have been lying for almost a yr liz is not a saint or an innocent she wants jason she has him pretty much so my question is why shouldn't sam go after lucky he's a good guy who made a few bad choices and he would treat sam better than jason did if jason and liz want each other so be it they deserve each other why shouldn't sam and lucky make each other happy i think sam should go for it lucky is a hottie and he's going to need someone to help him get over the broken heart liz is eventually going to give him even if it doesn't last it's still a couple i would like to see Samuel Goldwyn Little Britain Avenue Q Kylie Minogue Dawson's Creek It's Walky!
