do i need to replace my heating element i have a dryer used only times but over a year old nd home at first dryer wouldn't heat up i replaced resettable switches limit switch i think and then electric dryer heated up but now it gets so hot you can't touch the dryer and blows the thermal fuse within minutes if i bypass thermal fuse not safe i know it will run but the heat will burn you the heating element ohms out but could it still be bad what am i missing here there is not but so many parts and i have replaced thermal fuse times and the two other switches once whirlpool according to best buy won't do anything because it is over months old can i fix it or am i better off with a new dryer i have check vents they are clear and plumbed with hard metal not flex duct sounds like the cycling switch thermostat is bad or is the wrong one should be two thermostats high limit degrees or higher cycling switch usually to degrees and one thermal fuse if the thermal fuse is blowing this indicates either one of the limits is bad or to high a temp the cycling switch should be mounted where the air exists the dryer so it can sense the dryer temp the high limit is usually mounted at the bottom of the element and the thermal fuse should be mounted close to the cycling limit if the dryer is getting hot the element is not bad i would check the cycling switch as it is obviously not working or to high a temp whirlpool sells a kit that has all three items in one bag to replace your existing ones the cycling limit switch controls the drum temperature the high limit protects the element in case the cycling switch goes bad and the thermal fuse protects the dryer if it stays to hot Dishwasher Thermal power station Thermostat Fuse (electrical) Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Steam engine Explosive material Pebble bed reactor Fire fighting Circuit breaker Gas turbine Incandescent light bulb Plastic Heat Stirling engine Residual-current device Furnace STS-61 Welding Aluminium Vacuum tube Fossil fuel power plant Fusion power Hot air balloon Turbofan Titanium Carbon Casting Diving suit Nuclear thermal rocket Nuclear reactor Electrical wiring Paragliding Space shuttle main engine Circuit design Tire Sulfur BS 1363 Apollo 13 Water (molecule) Items in the Metroid series Renewable energy Ocean thermal energy conversion Motor oil Gas tungsten arc welding Transistor Ohm's law Firearm Ceramics Seismic retrofit Air conditioning Ironing Hand grenade Combined cycle Electronic amplifier Engine cooling Dodge Neon STS-114 Computer cooling Dialysis Two-stroke cycle Carbon dioxide Washing machine Polyethylene terephthalate Entropy Stellar evolution E85 K__ppen climate classification Powder metallurgy Space disaster Inkjet printer Hard disk Spacecraft propulsion Monsoon Rocket fuel Bi-metal Internal combustion engine M60 machine gun Turbojet Resistor Lithium Beryllium Relay Electric motor Spark plug Glossary of firefighting equipment
