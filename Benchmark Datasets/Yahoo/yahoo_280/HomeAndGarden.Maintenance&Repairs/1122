can burning natural gas create a cooling effect i have turned off the pilot light to my central air unit in my home i reason since the weather is so hot i'd try to ave some money without running that pilot light i know it is not much but still it is ome today after turning off the heating source i feel that the central air unit is using more effort to cool down the house is this true or is my central air unit showing a case of co dependency on the gas today it is almost degrees o what you are experiencing is completely coincidental the very best cadillac of all heating and cooling systems can only provide about a twenty degree split between outdoor temperature so when you say that it has topped today your system and every system in your area is struggling to maintain temperature by turning off the pilot yes you know the fuel savings is minimal at best but in no way is it affecting the cooling in your home in most homes the furnace is located in a basement or garage maybe the attic these unconditioned areas are not being affected by the ac system so the amount of heat that the pilot emits is not being pulled back into the system for more information you can go to http www howellsac com and get routine tips on how to save money increase efficiency and reduce headaches good luck Furnace Spark plug Temperature Solar power Thermostat Energy development Jet engine Explosive material Spacecraft propulsion Thermal power station Turbocharger Motor oil Autonomous building Hot air balloon Fire fighting Fossil fuel power plant HVAC Heat Diesel engine Air conditioning Hydrogen economy Vacuum tube Pebble bed reactor E85 Gas metal arc welding Wind power Internal combustion engine Renewable energy Nuclear weapon design Natural gas Wood fuel Stirling engine Space shuttle main engine Fire Transformer Turbojet Nuclear power Ozone depletion Axial compressor STS-62 Carbon dioxide Urban heat island Climate change Nuclear reactor Bong Incandescent light bulb Global warming Nuclear meltdown Portable stove Environmental concerns with electricity generation Nuclear fusion Power station Fuel injection Ozone hole Ocean thermal energy conversion Town gas Vacuum Severe weather terminology (United States) Future energy development Spectroscopy Laser Engine cooling Thermoregulation Water (molecule) Fluorescent lamp Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Gas turbine Steam engine Four-stroke cycle Basement Iron Steel Casting Climate of the United Kingdom Torpedo Hybrid vehicle Glossary of firefighting equipment Turbofan Glossary of firefighting terms Tank Stove Fuel cell Passive solar Stellar evolution Refrigerator Radon Combustion Helium
