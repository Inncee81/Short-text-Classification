for a window air conditioning do you recirculate air or draw fresh air from outside there's a switch that lets me either recirculate the air or draw air in from outside now recirculating may save energy but lead to 'stale' air drawing from the outside warmer air would use more energy but the air in the room would not be 'stale' any informed thoughts about this thanks yes it's a bit of an inane question hey it doesn't really matter the small amount of outside air drawn in is negligible mostly it is for people who have a window unit serving a closed room say an office or bedroom and due to the closed environment it is nice to have some sort of air replenishment otherwise i wouldn't have it open at all the loss of cooling capacity is the main issue most a c's struggle in summer to maintain a comfortable level and i wouldn't add to the internal load by having that vent open just my years a c experience talking there HVAC Carburetor Solar power Autonomous building CPU cache Turbocharger Energy development Fume hood Wind power Nuclear power Thermal power station Automobile emissions control Loudspeaker Explosive material Hydropower Hydroponics Windows 2000 Air conditioning Theory of conduct Brewery Cold fusion Global warming Jet engine Battery (electricity) Ocean thermal energy conversion Ecology Glass Carbon dioxide Passenger car Thermostat Urban heat island E85 Fuel injection Transformer Heinkel He 100 Severe weather terminology (United States) Diving suit Electrophysiology Heat capacity Four-stroke cycle Ventilation Domain Name System Scramjet Water (molecule) M16 (rifle) Pebble bed reactor Hydroelectricity Heat Friends Circuit breaker Nuclear reactor Deep lake water cooling Energy economics X Window System Extreme Programming Thermoregulation Tidal power Ozone depletion Dry cleaning Climate of the United Kingdom Person Superconductivity Rebreather Mass Future energy development Humidity Coffee OpenOffice.org Equine conformation Daylight saving time Japanese tea ceremony Datalore (TNG episode) Environmental concerns with electricity generation Gas core reactor rocket Build engine Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Swimming pool Alcohol fuel Fixed-wing aircraft B-47 Stratojet Fuel efficiency Natural Selection (computer game) Solar cell Wilton House Futurama (TV series - season 5) Marathon (computer game) Cell (biology) Nutrition Ozone hole GunZ The Duel Big Brother (USA TV series) Blood on the Tracks Corrosion Scuba set Jumping the shark Hot air balloon Energy
