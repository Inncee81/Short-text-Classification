if i have a hp v motor how many ac amps is that trying to figure out how much current my attic fan draws and the label is scratched off how many amps it pulls will ultimately depend on whether it is shaded pole permanent split capacitor or split phase a hp motor will be about watts if one horsepower is watts then divide by and that gives you the wattage of the motor or about watts divide watts by volts divided by volts is amps a psc motor will be little less than a shaded pole and a split phase will be more than a shaded pole consdiering this is an attic vent direct drive fan motor not belt driven it is probably a shaded pole motor Electric motor Circuit design Loudspeaker Capacitor Operational amplifier Volt Electrical generator Magnetic field Transformer Three-phase electric power Bicycle lighting Solar power Variable Frequency Drive Incandescent light bulb Vacuum cleaner Magnet Power (physics) Phase-locked loop Traffic light Resistor Diode Moon X10 (industry standard) Electricity meter Battery (electricity) Mike Watt Headlight Bass guitar Light-emitting diode Transistor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Mitosis Sun Super Nintendo Entertainment System Microphone History of perpetual motion machines Bristol Motor Speedway Welding power supply Solar panel Electrical element Phonograph Electronic amplifier Torque Lineman (occupation) Split phase Meiosis Oscilloscope Circuit breaker Permittivity Automobile self starter Ampere Steam engine Electric locomotive Ford Ranger EV Power factor Electricity EMD F40PH De Lorean DMC-12 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fluorescent lamp Capacitor plague Membrane potential George Westinghouse Series and parallel circuits Orders of magnitude (power) Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Formula One High-voltage direct current Particle accelerator Tesla coil Bicycle Solar car Pole vault Power factor correction Piezoelectricity Automobile Ford Thunderbird Tractor Gas compressor Alternating current Anchor Stepper motor AC power Electrical resistance Electromagnet Linear particle accelerator Economy of Japan Lac operon Airsoft Hybrid vehicle Internal combustion engine Decibel Car audio Ford Motor Company Indy Racing League USCGC Conifer (WLB-301) RLC circuit
