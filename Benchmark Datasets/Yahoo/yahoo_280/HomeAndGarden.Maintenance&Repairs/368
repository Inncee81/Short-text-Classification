what causes condensation on the outside of the ac pvc pipe and evaporator coil housing we recently had a clog in our air conditioner drain pipe and had someone clean it out since they came out though we checked it and now we have condensation forming on the outside of the drain pipe inside the closet where the ac sits and on the outside of the evaporator coil housing it's getting enough condensation to make a pretty good puddle on the floor under it and it did not do that before they came out any ideas what could cause that it is not sitting in any kind of pan the condensation is forming on the outside of the evaporator coil unit and mostly on the outside of the pvc pipe that is supposed to direct it to the outside the water from it just drips down onto the floor of the closet the house is years old and it has not done this until now how long have you lived in the house have you gone through all the seasons yet condesation is normal especially in the summertime when the air is very humid when the warm air contacts the cold air or coils the humidity forms into water dropplets if i understand correctly your unit is in a ac water pan that is one of the reasons they use these pans to catch the condensation and direct it to the outside Air conditioning Thermal power station Solar power Water vapor Carburetor Fog HVAC Heat exchanger Bong Domestic water system Furnace Soldering Swamp cooler Plumbing fixture Cloud Phase change heat pump Phase (matter) Dehumidifier Humidity Plastic Relative humidity Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Climate of the United Kingdom Flush toilet Diving suit Coffee Water Rain Mattress Insulation Brewery Weather lore Heat Refrigerator Microphone Cyclone Hard disk Caving Dairy Japanese toilet Evaporation Basement Houseplant Thermostat Hydropower Fossil fuel power plant Water (molecule) Cannabis cultivation Motor oil Watercooling Glossary of firefighting equipment Origin of life Thunderstorm Drainage Frost Polyvinyl chloride STS-87 Paint Precipitation (meteorology) Desert Steam engine Automobile emissions control Bathroom Poker jargon Smoking pipe Hard water Dundas Square Condensed milk Nuclear fallout Dialysis Hydrogen chloride Town gas Rice Adiabatic lapse rate Big Bang Kitchen Snake Sauna Vulcan (Star Trek) Irrigation Micro-encapsulation Global climate model Volleyball Apollo 13 Tornado Water resources Dry cleaning Hyperthermia Superconductivity Magnet Fast bowling Alternating current Meteorology Electric motor Lake Geography of Spain Dymaxion house Contrail
