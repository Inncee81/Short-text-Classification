electrical socket came out of wall my son tripped over a fan cord that was attached to the wall socket the socket came out of the wall about inch plate and all i tried to push it back in but it seems stuck there are some type of metal clamps on each side of the socket it just won't budge i tried pulling it out a little more to see if something was stuck but i can't move it is it safe to force the socket back into the wall we currently live in germany so not sure if sockets here are different i know it's v i know nothing about electricity or anything like that how can i get the socket back into the wall first turn the breaker off which is the first rule to any electrical repairs the metal clamps on each side are there to pinch the drywall against the flange on the top and bottom of the box there should be a tightening screw on each side of the box loosen these screws and push the box into the wall then re tighen the screws switch the breaker back on then your done if there isn't enough drywall or wall material to clamp onto you'll need to get the wall repaired and if your going to get the wall repaired have an electritian move the outlet to the nearest stud Screw Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Distribution board Fuse (electrical) Drywall Wire wrap Seismic retrofit Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Floyd Rose Professional wrestling throws Chuck (engineering) Violin D-subminiature Circuit breaker Residual-current device Elevator Glossary of climbing terms Power strip Lawn mower Wrench Bolted joint Violet wand National Electrical Code (US) Earring Screwdriver Rail terminology Welding Electric guitar Guitar Wall Light switch Electrical wiring Racquetball Glossary of firefighting equipment Lathe STS-61 Electrical wiring (UK) Table saw Textile manufacturing Fan (implement) Vacuum Switch Punt (boat) Knife Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Mattress Hydraulic machinery Mouse (computing) Rail tracks Radio controlled airplane Poker jargon Thermal power station Pinball Timpani Fluorescent lamp Battlebots Baseball Universal Serial Bus Door Casting Stage lighting Snooker Professional wrestling holds Disc brake Saw Softball Incandescent light bulb Glacier Aerial (dance move) Anchor Sail-plan Springfield 1903 rifle Screw thread Drill Hall effect Spark plug Billiards Equine conformation Furnace Double bass Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Harp Jack plug Injection moulding Diving regulator Iowa class battleship Extension Cord Diode Mandrel Aluminium Carburetor The Time Machine Robot Wars
