question about water damage in my apartment i live in a townhome i was changing the water in my aquarium i had a bucket of water sitting on a chair my cat came along jumped onto the bucket and knocked it over i noticed a few hours later that there was water spots on my ceiling down in the living room i put a fan on the water spot upstairs and it dryed pretty fast can i just pain over those spots with a special kind of paint this didn't cause any severe damage under the carpet did it just wondering what the best way was to take care of this situation without owing my apartment complex add info this happened about months ago it's completely dry its a light tan color on the ceiling there isn't a moldy mildew smell in the room upstairs the carpet looks normal maybe a taaad discolored but we plan on having the carpet replaced before our lease is up anyway this will cause a water spot on your ceiling if you want to fix it you will need to paint kilz a stain blocker let it dry then you'll need to paint it you'll probably have to paint the whole ceiling because the fresh paint will show they make kilz in a spray can and you might try just touching up the stain area so it's not noticeable or just take the chance the apt mgr won't notice it when you move out just be certain the carpet dries keep the fan on it until it's completly dry Paint Sento Volleyball Fire fighting Upholstery The Inside Milton H.
