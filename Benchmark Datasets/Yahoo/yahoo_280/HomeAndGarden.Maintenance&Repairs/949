i replaced a ceiling fan light with a pendant light the dimmer switch doesn't work now is it broken i replaced a ceiling fan light which was attached to a wall mounted dimmer switch with a pendant light the dimmer has an on off switch as well as a slide bar to control the brightness of the light the dimmer did not control the fan before and only controlled the fan's light the circuit breaker was triggered during installation and had to be reset i used one of the bulbs from the fan for the new pendant light while the new light turns on off with the switch it does not dim the light stays at its brightest regardless of where the slide bar is moved did the dimmer switch get damaged should i replace it if not why does the dimmer not work on my new pendant light when it worked minutes before with the fan light and same bulb unfortunately the dimmer it's gone the resistor that is inside got short out then is nothing you can do unless you know electronics's usually the dimmer's for fan light they came with the set but if for some reason they get short out they only work on one mode and some people try another kind of dimmer but unfortunately the also serve on one mode buy your self a new dimmer only that this time you know before installation turn the proper breaker off then install it because they are so sensitive X10 (industry standard) Headlight Relay Stage lighting Switch Dimmer Light-emitting diode Light switch Circuit breaker Oscilloscope Lighting Fluorescent lamp Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device Seismic retrofit Vacuum tube Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Elevator Ethernet Bicycle lighting Mercury-vapor lamp STS-61 Distribution board GunZ The Duel Fan (implement) Thermal power station Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Airbus A380 Apparent magnitude Street light Transformer Thermostat Potentiometer Resistor Transistor Eye High-voltage direct current Mercury Atlas 6 Drill bit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Compact fluorescent lamp Electric motor Radiation hardening Transducer Embedded system Capacitor Thyristor Alpha Centauri Dim sum Super Nintendo Entertainment System Screensaver Carburetor Electrophysiology Booting Fume hood Electronic amplifier Christmas lights Combine (Half-Life 2) Bubble Bobble Spark gap Floppy disk Digital circuit Window Light gun Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Time Out of Mind Windows 2000 Railway signalling Surveillance Mouse (computing) Sundial Firearm Color temperature Danger Hiptop Pinball Spark plug Yohoho!
