my gas clothes dryer won't heat up it just blows the fan air i didn't check anything yet like supply of gas or i guess anything at all i was told there's a shutter adjustment on the burner if it gets to much air or not enough it won't heat up correctly i'ts probably not like a furnace with a thermocouple i've replaced those it might be cheaper to buy a new one about years old also the temp setting switch if it goes bad will it kill all the heat all together it's about to become a boat anchor if it's four years old it will have a igniter rather than the old thermocouple and pilot light my gas oven conked out after five years and i had to get a part not too hard to replace but you will need the parts place to show you how to get to it most dryers you can just pull the back panel and see where the burner is the igniter looks like a carbon pretzel or maze and glows red to fire off the gas it's wired in series with the gas valve so when it fails the gas does not flow you can test it with a ohmmeter i recall something like ohms on the new one when i bought it and we tested it at the store if you haven't messed with the air flow to the burner don't Thermostat Thermocouple Furnace Thermal power station Portable stove Bunsen burner Transformer Vacuum tube Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Carburetor Internal combustion engine Solar power Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Incandescent light bulb Fan (implement) Spark plug Glossary of firefighting equipment Tire Scuba set Diving cylinder Bi-metal Kerosene lamp Kitchen Fire Two-stroke cycle Carbon dioxide Stove Torpedo Renewable energy Town gas Diesel engine Ohm's law Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Gas tungsten arc welding Jet engine Oxyacetylene Combustion Potentiometer Explosive material Motor oil Seismic retrofit Circuit breaker Tap (valve) Fire fighting Apollo 13 Three Mile Island Turbocharger Spectroscopy Fluorescent lamp Electrophysiology Diving regulator E85 Balloon (aircraft) Space shuttle main engine Electrical wiring Bong Gas absorption refrigerator Game show Circuit design Steam engine Residual-current device Oscilloscope Wok Electric motor Glossary of firefighting terms Fuel injection Lightning Fossil fuel power plant Gas turbine Dodge Neon Welding Pulse jet engine Dishwasher Burglar alarm Energy development Ceramics Mercury Atlas 6 Soldering Magnesium Space disaster Glass Nuclear power Aircraft engine controls Air gun Spark gap Ignition system Spacecraft propulsion STS-62 Supercharger Treblinka extermination camp Resistor Internal ballistics Wheel of Fortune Relay Brewery
