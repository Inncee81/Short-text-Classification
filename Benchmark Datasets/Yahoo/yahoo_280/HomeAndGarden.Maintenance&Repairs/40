how do you motivate yourself at the minute i carnt seem to motivate myself to do anything theres so much needs doing in my home from decorating cleaning clearing stuff out cleaning gardening etc i just dont know where to start help yes i agree with mark r lower your horizons only think of the one job you're actually doing now if you clutter your mind with grand plans and lists of all the things you'll have to do it will sap all your energy and depress you stress is the difference between what you perceive you have to do and what you think you can do if you think of all the work that needs doing you will not be able to imagine how you can do it all that causes stress followed by depression if you think about and do only one small thing at a time then you gain satisfaction as each one is completed you need those satisfaction bonuses to keep going if you think of doing everything then you will only get satisfaction at the end and you will starve yourself of satisfaction until then you cannot survive that way you must positively avoid thinking and talking about all the other things which you have to do like athletes when they clear their mind of everything else in preparation for the attempt at the high jump (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Motivation Happiness Social psychology Merit Summa Theologiae Microeconomics Anorexia nervosa Radar Altruism Francis Crick Murder Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sadism and masochism Capitalism Pole vault In Cold Blood W.
