dirt road living sandy garage floor ideas needed i live on a dirt road therefore i bring a lot of sand in my garage from my tires needless to say the sand builds up fast does anyone have any tips or tricks that i can do in my garage to minimize the sandy floors i know i could simply sweep every day but what do others do who live on a dirt road maybe there is something that i can park on but i haven't seen anything yet ideas are appreciated thank if your drive is not paved i would recommend thinking about that especially if you have a 'long' drive like most rural homes would as opposed to a 'city' home with just a small front yard by paving either concrete ashphalt or brick pavers the driveway you give your tires more room to drop the sand dirt before you pull into the garage for a concrete floor i recommend a medium bristle push broom don't settle for one of the real coarse ones that are so common in the stores get a good one horsehair bristles are a good choice for a smooth concrete floor at a janitorial supply you will find that it moves more sand outside where you want it rather than leaving tracks of it between the bristles im afraid that anything you might put down would only trap the dirt making it more difficult to remove but there are some garage floor coatings that will 'hide' the dirt better than others you can find these at most building supply stores good luck Road McMansion Aerial (dance move) Anchor Ridge Route Pavement (material) Tractor Road transport History of the Panama Canal Drill bit Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Radio controlled car Christmas tree Vacuum cleaner Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fast bowling Gravel Fallout shelter Violin Casting Kitchen Motorcycle Street Combine (Half-Life 2) Drifting (motorsport) Volleyball Lincoln Highway Carl G.
