can you safely connect aluminum and copper wire my brother just bought a house that has aluminum wiring he was told that to pass inspection the wiring in the receptacle boxes must be copper again he was told that there is a special connector that will allow you to connect aluminum and copper wiring safely together to me this sounds like a fire waiting to happen what you need to do is use noalox or a similar compound on the connections this will stop electrolysis in which dissimilar metals degrade the connector you need is called a copalum wire connector go to your local electrical supplier and ask them about it aluminum residential wiring in dangerous and a fire hazard Electrical wiring Welding Naval mine Ethernet RS-232 Copper Printed circuit board Ground and neutral Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets SCART Spark plug Gas metal arc welding Titanium Fuse (electrical) Universal Serial Bus Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solar cell Oscilloscope Cookware and bakeware Electric motor DVD BS 1363 Transformer D-subminiature Coaxial cable Seismic retrofit Peltier-Seebeck effect Wire Jack plug Conductor (material) Vacuum tube Residual-current device National Electrical Code (US) Screw Ground (electricity) Integrated circuit Thermocouple Overhead powerline Electroplating Digital Subscriber Line Tantalum Gender of connectors and fasteners Copper-based chips Plastic Elevator Solar power Mercury (element) Blasting cap Rail transport modelling Overhead lines Terminal ballistics Three-phase electric power PCB layout guidelines Registered jack Battery (electricity) Digital Visual Interface Antenna (radio) Railgun Split phase Amstrad CPC Explosive material Hydrogen peroxide High-voltage hazards Telephone Rail terminology Inductor Lightning rod Bay Area Rapid Transit Current (electricity) Handloading Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer bus DIN connector Switch Category 5 cable Uranium Commodore 64 Sewage treatment Electrolysis Hydrogen vehicle Incandescent light bulb Circuit design Cruising (maritime) Lineman (occupation) IPod Bullet Northeast Corridor Semiconductor fabrication Fire extinguisher Hydrogen economy Arc welding Seismometer Soldering Electrical wiring (UK) Cable television Optical fiber Timpani Coulometry
