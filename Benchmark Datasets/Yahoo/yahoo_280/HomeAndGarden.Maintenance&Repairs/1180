draining a hot water heater looks like my dinosaur of a hot water heater has finally gone to appliance heaven how do i drain the thing so i don't end up with even more water on the floor yes definitely turn off the cold water going into the hot water heater usually a garden faucet type handle or a degree lever called a 'ball valve' above the water heater and turn off the gas or electricity to it as well hook up a garden hose make sure it drains out a driveway not onto a lawn turn on slowly the spigot at the bottom of the hot water heater watch what comes out if you haven't ever drained it you'll probably see rust tiny stones calcified deposits etc be careful though one water heater i drained wouldn't drain at all so i closed the drain spigot and took the hose off then i slowly opened the spigot more and more nothing so i poked a small screwdriver into the open spigot and wiggled it around some flakes and a few drops of water came out then all of a sudden the spigot shot across the room and water shot out like a water cannon until the tank was drained fortunately it was an empty basement below ground laundry room with a floor drain the landlord confessed that he had never drained the hot water in the or so years since he'd had it installed so drain a few gallons of water out of your new hot water heater every year and it'll last longer Tap (valve) Domestic water system Water heater Glossary of firefighting equipment Basement Thermal power station Thermostat Furnace Siphon Irrigation Kitchen Sento HVAC Samovar Flush toilet Apollo 13 Glossary of wildland fire terms Plumbing fixture Fossil fuel power plant Electrophysiology Vacuum tube Refrigerator Internal ballistics Bong Solar power Hydraulic machinery Home repair Customs and etiquette of Japan Textile manufacturing GunBound Glossary of firefighting terms Pinball Diesel engine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dialysis Marine aquarium Hot air balloon Cruising (maritime) Water supply Carburetor Bathroom Canal lock USS S-5 (SS-110) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fire hydrant Screwdriver Seismic retrofit Aquarium Rebreather Spark plug Borehole Rail terminology Space shuttle main engine Elevator Steam engine Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Scuba set Brewery Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Drainage Steam locomotive nomenclature Transistor Professional wrestling throws Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster National Electrical Code (US) Shaggy dog story Reef tank Sewage treatment Washing machine Central heating Mortar (weapon) Team Fortress Classic Oxyacetylene Circuit breaker Process control Hard water Fire extinguisher Panama Canal Locks Dishwasher E85 P-38 Lightning Wrench BS 1363 Battery (electricity) Thermocouple AT-4 Spigot Flamethrower Air conditioning Sauna Cannabis cultivation
