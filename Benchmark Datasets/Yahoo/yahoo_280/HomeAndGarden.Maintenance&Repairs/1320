while cleaning my airconditioner i accidentally closed off most of the inner metal vents will this ruin it if you are talking about fins on the evaporator coil the air handling unit inside you are going to have to open them back up it must have air flow to work operation could cause liquid freon to return to the compressor slugging the compressor that's when the compressor trys to compress liquid freon which does not compress the compressor locks up and you might get to buy a new one if your talking the condenser coil the coil outside where the compressor is no air flow would cause high head pressures and a safety would shut down the compressor fins would have to be opened up both coils must have good air flow for heat exchange Air conditioning Ocean thermal energy conversion Gas compressor Heat exchanger Axial compressor Turbocharger Refrigerator Carburetor Thermal power station Turbojet Jet engine Gas absorption refrigerator Turbofan Tesla coil Solar power Furnace Thermostat Pebble bed reactor Gas turbine Mattress Haloalkane Evaporation Supercharger Pneumatics Diving cylinder Transformer Space Shuttle external tank Centrifugal compressor Ammonia Bleed air Glossary of firefighting equipment Relay Internal combustion engine Phase (matter) Pratt & Whitney J58 HVAC Geothermal exchange heat pump Vacuum Two-stroke cycle Refrigerant Turbine Circuit breaker Space shuttle main engine Microphone Motor oil Brayton cycle SABRE Fossil fuel power plant Carbon dioxide Four-stroke cycle Mars Exploration Rover Breathing gas Hydrochloric acid Magnet Apollo 13 Solenoid Stirling engine Cray-1 Air gun Hydrogen economy Diesel engine Three Mile Island Superconductivity Explosive material Helium Dodge Neon Fluid pressure Casting Spark plug Computer cooling Swamp cooler Pulse jet engine Nuclear reactor Natural gas Heinkel He 100 Mercury arc valve Bong High-voltage hazards Diving air compressor Water (molecule) Glossary of firefighting terms Boiling water reactor Air pollution Hydrogen vehicle Cabin pressurization Steam engine Water vapor Nuclear power Diving suit Liquid breathing Internal ballistics Fire fighting Aerosol spray Volcano Powder metallurgy Brewery Soldering Oxyacetylene
