i recently had a flood in my house and i used a wet vac to get all the water but the floor is still moist how do i get rid of the rest that i can't pick up the wet vac its starting to smell really bad too when our basement flooded we went to a local construction company and rented one of their very large fan blowers after opening all the windows and running that it dried out and the smell decreased as well with the extra air flow you should certainly get it dried as soon as possible before it warps also check with a local contractor or a home improvement store to see how long your floor has to be dry prior to laying new flooring just because your floor appears to be dry doesn't mean it is totally dry in the middle once you lay new flooring it loses its air circulation so whatever is not dry will mold later down the road Basement HVAC El Ni__o Vacuum cleaner Diving suit Kitchen Cannabis cultivation Carbon dioxide Solar power Climate of the United Kingdom Wood Wildfire Glossary of firefighting equipment Concrete Hamster Amazon River Grand Forks, North Dakota Thermal power station Air conditioning The Pentagon Casting Textile manufacturing Mattress Relay Battery (electricity) Water Fan (implement) Zambezi Japanese toilet Death Valley National Park Campfire Electrical wiring Desert Furnace Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Las Vegas metropolitan area Swamp cooler Brisbane Intermontane Plateaus Vermicompost Upholstery Geography of Bolivia Wind Aerial (dance move) Stairway Drowning Glossary of firefighting terms Florida Keys Oscilloscope Fire fighting Bon Jovi Panama Canal Tire Wall Street Great Lakes Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Doom engine Air-raid shelter Alsace Weather lore Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Dry cleaning Fossil fuel power plant Centre Province, Cameroon Adamawa Province Supercharger Bristol Grammar School San Fernando Valley RuneScape locations Xanadu House Zuiderzee Works Polyethylene terephthalate Climate of Salt Lake City Tropical cyclone Dam Carburetor Hebden Bridge Rice Straw-bale construction Lighting Portsmouth Coconut crab Philadelphia Mint Pump It Up Deforestation Drainage Tofu Bath Bungalow Cheating in Counter-Strike Suburbs of Johannesburg Valles Marineris Home improvement General Protection Fault (comic) Home repair Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
