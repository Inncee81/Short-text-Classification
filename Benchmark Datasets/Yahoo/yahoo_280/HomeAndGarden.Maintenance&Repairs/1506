is it normal for ac vents to have mildew inside of them i moved into a house months ago and from the time i moved in i could see black mildew and wetness inside of the vents when i look into them i told my landlord about it and she didn't have much to say about it trying to save money i think is this normal i don't think it is i need to know because my mos old son is always fighting respiratory infections and i'm thinking this might be why your ac system is supposed to remove moisture from the air in cooling mode so no it would not be normal cool dry air usually prevents mold there is something definately wrong and as stated above many types of mold are bad Casting Diving suit Polyethylene terephthalate Toxic mold Air conditioning Thermal power station Wheat Upholstery Swamp cooler Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sand casting Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Carbon dioxide Precipitation (meteorology) Psoriasis The Inside Biblical scientific foresight Legionellosis Weather lore Crucible Comfrey Autonomous building Rebreather Air pollution Fancy rat Thermostat K__ppen climate classification Three Mile Island El Ni__o Hamster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dymaxion house Chocolate Climate of the United Kingdom Computer virus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Theory of conduct Transformer Solar power Sulfur M16 (rifle) Hard disk Fire fighting Mount Pinatubo Sake Internal combustion engine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Otitis externa Heinkel He 100 Typewriter Monsoon Tire Ammonia Domestic rabbit Plant breeding Ozone depletion HVAC Botulism Electrical wiring Armored Core Atari 8-bit family Asbestos Blood transfusion Liquid breathing Xanadu House Straw-bale construction MOS Technology 6502 Carburetor One Piece minor characters Volcanic ash Thunderstorm Fast bowling The Apprentice 2 Density Estoppel Ozone hole Anticyclone Hypothermia Breath of Fire III Pneumonia Eczema Dry cleaning Pulmonary alveolus Cruising (maritime) Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Hip hop collaborations Advance Wars: Dual Strike Mummy Bullet Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fire extinguisher The Long Game Refrigerator Desert Social rule Hemp Garden Strawberry Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Nuclear reactor
