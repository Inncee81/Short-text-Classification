central air conditioner not cooling house we live in the country in ks we have no shade trees our home is a double wide manufactured home on a permanent foundation it doesn't have high ceilings and only floor the problem is the house gets hot during the day even though the ac is running at p m it is still about degrees in here i just think the ac isn't working quite right any suggestions i appreciate all the advise i thought i'd add some additional details because we are out in the country we have taken in a number of stray dogs and cats they are indoor and outdoor animals so lots of shedding so we change the air filter very frequently great info on the freon lines husband went out small line was warm not hot and large line has small amount of frost on it we are planting trees this fall we will go get lattice to make a shelter for the unit house is about sq ft have to search for info on size of ac put thermometers against vents after min temps are and digital says but may take longer to register it doesn't go down into the vent any other recommendations will be appreciated thanks if you believe that the air is moving sufficiently inside let's check the outside unit first feel the air coming out of the unit you should feel heat being removed from the house next look at the freon lines there will be a big one and a little one the little one may be very hot so be careful the big one is the low pressure side and on normal conditions where the pipe is exposed should be cold a sweaty from this big line you can tell alot you will have to find a place where the insulation is off or right where it goes into the outside unit if it is frosted up then go to if not go to this could be due to either insufficient air flow across the coils of the inside unit or low freon which will cause the coil to start freezing if there is frost cut the unit off at the thermostat by switching the heat cool switch to off and turn the fan switch from auto to on this will cause the fan to continue running and turn off the compressor outside leave it this way for a minimum of minutes see if you notice the air flow to improve coming out of the vents while it is off you can check your air filters and make sure they are clean replace if necessary later turn the a c thermostat back to cool notice if it cools better and monitor the big line if after about five minutes the line is cool to cold then the freon level may be ok and you should feel hot air coming out of the unit if it is only barely cool or not cool the unit is probably low on freon if the big line is not cool and the little line is not warm then either you are very low on freon or your compressor isn't running either way you will need to get an ac repairman for repairs Air conditioning Refrigerator Thermal power station Carburetor HVAC Solar power Jet engine Axial compressor Brewery Thermoregulation Haloalkane Transformer Carbon dioxide Turbocharger Fire fighting Spark plug Stirling engine Mattress E85 Seismic retrofit Heinkel He 100 Dairy Cray-1 Water (molecule) Furnace Mercury Atlas 6 Climate of the United Kingdom Severe weather terminology (United States) Loudspeaker Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Supercharger Wind power Lighting Dialysis Bong Phase change heat pump Drill bit Fan (implement) Welding Gas compressor Electric motor Poker jargon Nuclear power Hamster Equine conformation Pebble bed reactor Sun Energy development Basement Cannabis cultivation Dog Ocean thermal energy conversion Space Shuttle external tank Circuit breaker Diesel engine Turbojet Passive solar Coffee Central processing unit Temperature Sento Internal combustion engine First aid Tesla coil Volleyball Gas metal arc welding Avalanche Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gas turbine Superconductivity Engine cooling Hydrogen economy Hypothermia Turbofan Explosive material Eldfell Hard disk Hyperthermia Fluorescent lamp Heat exchanger Rebreather 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Frost Dodge Neon Fossil fuel power plant Swimming pool Dundas Square The Midnight Sun Ice Gramophone record Wind
