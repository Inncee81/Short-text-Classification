can i run a reverse cycle air con off my w generator depends on the total amps pulled by the unit it cannot exceed of the watts of the generator or the voltage regulator on the generator will go out so you can pull amps at volts or amps at volts Transformer Thermostat Operational amplifier Volt Circuit design Ampere Bicycle lighting Power (physics) Electric motor Transistor Resistor Diode Zener diode Electrical generator Welding power supply High-voltage hazards Electricity meter Electrophysiology Vacuum cleaner Electrical resistance Capacitor Voltage drop Decibel Voltage regulator Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Electrical wiring X10 (industry standard) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Alternating current Action potential Electronic amplifier RS-232 Advanced Mobile Phone System Adenosine monophosphate Fossil fuel power plant Super Nintendo Entertainment System Switched-mode power supply Particle accelerator Power supply Ohm Three-phase electric power Piezoelectricity Energy development Electric potential Spark plug Electricity distribution SCSI BS 1363 Electricity Spark gap Acorn Atom Solar panel Negligible Battery (electricity) Solar cell Electric chair Car audio Thyristor George Westinghouse Fluorescent lamp Lighter Circuit breaker Jet engine Series and parallel circuits Transmitter Linear particle accelerator Semiconductor Analog-to-digital converter AC power Wind power Membrane potential Airsoft Voltage source Hybrid Synergy Drive Nickel-cadmium battery Fan (implement) Capacitor plague Tesla coil CMOS Toyota Prius Mike Watt Nickel metal hydride Potentiometer Oscilloscope Lightning Uninterruptible power supply Scientific units named after people Eddie Van Halen Hybrid vehicle Lithium Digital circuit Plasma (physics) Fuse (electrical) Cybernetics Kenwood Electronics Microphone Current (electricity) Internal combustion engine Internal ballistics
