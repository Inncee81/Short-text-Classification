light turns off while switch in on position when i turn a light switch on the light will sometimes not always turn off and occasionally back on by itself is this caused by a short please reply with more than call an electrician or if you have electrical experience knowledge thanks in advance there isn't just one bulb it's a chandelier with five or six bulbs so i doubt its a loose bulb good thinking though mostly likely problem is the switch either bad contacts in the switch itself or my bet it was wired backstab fashion the wires are inserted into holes in the back of the switch receptacle and the spring is failing making for an intermittent connection next most likely problem is a loose wirenutted connection at the fixture either where the fixture connects to the in wall wiring most likely or in the fixture itself switches are cheap under a dollar the first thing i'd do is replace the switch if that doesn't fix it it check the connections where the fixture connects to the house wiring and finally check the connections in the fixture itself as others have said turn off the breaker before attempting any service you've got a bit of an akward situation because you can't really on the light going out show whether the breaker is on or off pick up proximity voltage detector at the hardware store about this is a plastic device about the size of marker and it flashes and buzzes when held near an energized wire this will allow you to confirm that the power is truely off to the circuit before working on it Switch Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fluorescent lamp Stage lighting Incandescent light bulb Diode Relay Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Vacuum tube Electric motor BS 1363 Light-emitting diode Residual-current device Light switch Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Transformer Distribution board Electrical wiring (UK) Poker jargon Thermostat X10 (industry standard) Overhead lines Transistor Circuit design Lighting Universal Serial Bus Central processing unit Battery (electricity) Apollo Guidance Computer Gas metal arc welding National Electrical Code (US) Digital circuit Ethernet Enigma machine Solar cell Logic gate Telephone tapping Spark gap Dimmer Printed circuit board Street light Capacitor Electrical wiring Electrician X-ray Bicycle lighting Lineman (occupation) Three-phase electric power Screw Ultraviolet Electrophysiology Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Hall effect George Westinghouse Loudspeaker MOSFET Potentiometer Welding Burglar alarm Tesla coil Drill bit Modem Electronic amplifier Fire alarm control panel High-voltage hazards Traffic light Embedded system Electrical element Causality Strap-on dildo Computer Resistor Compact fluorescent lamp IPod Digital Seismic retrofit Jack plug Rotor machine 2003 North America blackout Electricity Programmable logic controller High-voltage direct current Railway signal Windows XP Programmable logic device Pinball Ring circuit Alternating current Crossbar switch
