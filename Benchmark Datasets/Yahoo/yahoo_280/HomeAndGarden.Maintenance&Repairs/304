my smoke alarm goes off in the middle of the night for no apparent reason what may cause this at first i thought it was the battery so i replaced it with a new one that did not solve the problem so i bought a new smoke detector the same kind but that did not work either i'm wondering if there is something wrong with the wiring now the detector works on clip in wiring is there a way to check to see what is causing these incessant false alarms in the middle of the night you may be experiencing power bumps if it's connected to your house wiring whenever there is a big enough fluctuation in voltage my detector will sound off and also my house alarm system drives my dogs nuts voltage fluctuations are most common in hot weather when everyone's running their a c other than that don't know what to tell ya k o Vacuum tube Smoke detector Fire alarm control panel Welding Oscilloscope Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Diode Three-phase electric power Volt Voltmeter Thermal power station Thermostat Gravitational radiation 2003 North America blackout Impedance matching Tesla coil Transformer Gas metal arc welding Circuit design Langmuir probe Electric motor Relay Semiconductor device Daylight saving time Electricity meter X-ray Central processing unit TGV Decibel Switch Spark plug Incandescent light bulb Radio IPod Capacitor Battery (electricity) Urinary incontinence Arc welding Causality X10 (industry standard) Resistor Tire Cruising (maritime) RS-232 Railway electrification system Loudspeaker Mercury Atlas 6 Overhead lines Track circuits Geomagnetic storm Bicycle lighting Phase-locked loop Fire alarm Dimmer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis War of Currents Federal Standard 1037C Alarm Poker jargon Universal Serial Bus Electrical element Welding power supply Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Operational amplifier Lineman (occupation) Ionization chamber Electrical generator Billboard Hot 100 Electrophysiology Toyota Prius Capacitor plague Directed-energy weapon Neutrino Electricity distribution Computer STS-61 Magnetic core memory Ground (electricity) Piezoelectricity Homer's Enemy Split phase Circuit breaker A Day in the Life Light-emitting diode Second Battle of the Atlantic Saruman MOSFET Second law of thermodynamics Expert system The Smoking Room AIM-9 Sidewinder High-voltage direct current Digital circuit Residual-current device Logic Transmission line Audiophile
