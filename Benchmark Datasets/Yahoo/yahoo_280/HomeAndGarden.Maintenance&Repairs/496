can a little bend in copper tubeing cause low pressure i installed a faucet and it had copper tubeing i bent the copper tubeing a little bit not much the thing is i dont have alot of presure but the water source is a water well and it gives sand how thick is the copper tubing regardless if you have good pressure from the supply if you reduce it to lets say in to copper tubing it will restrict the flow also on another note if you installed a new faucet take the aerator off the faucet the aerator is the cap located where the water comes out of the faucet just turn counterclockwise run the water then is is still slow most times it can be the aerator caused by particles flowing through the old pipe to the new faucet rinse off the aerator and replace Tap (valve) Siphon Sewage treatment Rebreather Irrigation Carburetor Welding Vacuum tube Diving regulator Furnace Carbon dioxide Brewery Plumbing fixture Tire Solar power Seismic retrofit Samovar Copper extraction Hard water Thermal power station Boiler Water purification Acute respiratory distress syndrome Optical fiber Soldering Sento Cartridge (firearms) Terminal ballistics Coppersmith Drill bit Aquifer Heat Hydraulic machinery Water tower Fossil fuel power plant Glass Naval mine Propeller Flush toilet Bong Turbulence Oscilloscope Coaxial cable Dialysis Corrosion Gas metal arc welding Kidney Cookware and bakeware Light-emitting diode Turbocharger Pulse jet engine Aluminium Hydroponics Fish farming Root Steam engine Fluorescent lamp Jet engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electric motor Coriolis effect Casting Pebble bed reactor Internal ballistics Water turbine M16 (rifle) Tide Linear particle accelerator Thermostat Whitewater Diode Fire extinguisher Transformer Lake Urinal Hydrogen economy Novelty (locomotive) Printed circuit board Bullet Trombone Trumpet Heinkel He 100 Domestic water system Tobacco Knife Equine conformation Oceanic trench Soil pH Hydropower Water supply Carbon nanotube Incandescent light bulb Tap water Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear power Electrophysiology Dam Galileo spacecraft Compost Dairy
