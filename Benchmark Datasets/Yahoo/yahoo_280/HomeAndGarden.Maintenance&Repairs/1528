whats wrong with my electrical when you turn the oven on the bathroom lights turn on but only when the light switch is turned on ive checked the breakers sounds bad do the bathroom lights not work without the oven sounds like a ground fault or loose neutral wire but for the life of me i would think the two should be on different circuits call an electrician or if you rent make a big deal about this to the manager and if that gets nowhere call the city county building department in any case do not use either light or oven till you get it looked at Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ground and neutral Switch Circuit breaker Distribution board National Electrical Code (US) Electrical wiring (UK) Ground (electricity) BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Three-phase electric power Vacuum tube Relay Alternating current Kitchen Digital circuit Ring circuit Short circuit Oscilloscope Seismometer 2003 North America blackout Telephone exchange Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Charles Wheatstone Electrical wiring Earthing system The Shining (film) Printed circuit board Poker jargon Solar cell Overhead lines Professional wrestling throws Embedded system Tesla coil Electrical engineering Power strip Ives Manufacturing Company Microwave oven Lightning rod Incandescent light bulb Circuit design Split phase Lineman (occupation) Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Fire alarm control panel Permittivity Wok Transformer Bathroom Harp Seismic retrofit Solar power Digital Thyristor Dimmer Fire fighting Airport Programmable logic controller Thermal power station Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Thermostat Hebburn High-voltage direct current William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Impedance matching Ignition system Terri Schiavo Fluorescent lamp Light switch Circuit switching Keyboard technology Electrical generator Enigma machine Reliability engineering Major appliance X10 (industry standard) Electromagnetic radiation World Trade Center Cavity magnetron Sin City Euphemism Spark plug Toaster Logic gate Musical Instrument Digital Interface Bread Electrical network Huygens probe GunBound Douglas Adams Charles Ives Single-phase electric power Battery (electricity) Sealab 2021 Burglar alarm The Brady Bunch Green Line "D" Branch Glass
