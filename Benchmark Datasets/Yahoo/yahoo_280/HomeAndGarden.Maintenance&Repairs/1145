any concrete experts out there i have a crack in one of my sidewalk sections that runs the full width it s thin and not particularly deteriorated but of course that will change with time i need to know the best way to fix patch it that provides a good seal but doesn t stand out like a sore thumb is it possible to do something decorative that looks as if it was intended instead of the eyesore that i'm afraid is going to be the end result because this piece is near the front door so is very noticeable any suggestions would be appreciated if you live in an area of the country that experiences freeze thaw cycles there is nothing you can do to stabilize the crack it will continue to crack each year even if you put crack filler in you can buy crack filler at the home depot it's liquid in a bottle that you squirt into the crack since you say the crack is thin you might as well try that first and just live with it for a while what a professional or a home owner who wanted it done right would do is to bust up that section and replace it Welding Poker jargon Mattress Brazing Windows XP Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Reinforced concrete Donald Neilson Cocaine Bicycle frame Weathering Keynesian economics Breastfeeding Equine conformation Motorcycle Plastic Combine (Half-Life 2) Glacier Electrophysiology Textile manufacturing Terminal ballistics M60 machine gun Paul Is Dead Ice core Concrete Wayne Corporation Wood carving R46 (New York City Subway car) Vehicular cycling Wood Bus models used in New York City Transit Japanese tea ceremony Bob and George Ceramics Casting Pavement (material) MAME Stairway Euro Alkane Upholstery Dundas Square Urinary incontinence B-47 Stratojet Seismic retrofit Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Cracking (chemistry) Brewery Sculpture Explosive material Tire Hand grenade Sea ice Diving suit Fast bowling STS-114 Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Pottery Refrigerator BMW E34 Woodworking Guqin Drill bit Undergarment Squatting Porsche 911 Rail tracks De Lorean DMC-12 Software cracking Glossary of climbing terms Tris Speaker Sidewalk Extreme Programming Computer virus Road Property tax Bassoon Babe Ruth Eczema Coffee Illegal drug trade Fist of the North Star Milk Minnesota Transportation Museum Atlanta Braves RMS Titanic Water Carbon nanotube Characters of Naruto British Rail Class 42 Rail terminology Glass Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bicycle lighting BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Carbon dioxide T-1000 St Albans Cathedral Monetary policy
