why does the thermal fuse on my new dryer continue to short out i have a dryer used times that keeps blowing the termal fuse i am getting at the outlet i have hard pipe for the exhaust through the floor i bend it under the house with flex duct and then attach it to feet of inch pvc to get it out from under the house at the outlet there is a grid to keep critters out you didnt offer much information some dryers have two thermo fuses and some only one however you dont have to guess go to http appliancequickfix com and see if you can spot what is going on you are preoccupied with the ducting so remove it from the dryer and see if it still blows and if not the problem is with the duct but if it does then your problem is internal in the dryer dont worry its so easy a caveman could do it by the way the others dont have a nice blue hat Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Penis Fan (implement) Pump It Up Vacuum cleaner Temporal bone Japanese toilet Residual-current device Fuse (electrical) Diving suit Electrical wiring BS 1363 Space Shuttle external tank Tank Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Domestic water system Seismic retrofit Plastic Basement Fancy rat Vacuum tube Glass Jet engine Knife Snowboard Fossil fuel power plant Pebble bed reactor Solar power Androgen insensitivity syndrome P-47 Thunderbolt U.S. customary units Air conditioning Fume hood Furnace Crop circle Breastfeeding Laundry Oscilloscope National Electrical Code (US) Bong HVAC OV-10 Bronco Drill bit Polyvinyl chloride Hamster Model aircraft Dodge Neon Chevrolet Corvette Turbofan Straw-bale construction Wind turbine Strap-on dildo Drainage Katana Pottery Combine (Half-Life 2) Textile manufacturing Circuit breaker Radio controlled airplane Passive solar Asbestos Washing machine Two-stroke cycle Motorcycle Hand grenade Diamond simulant Mercury 4 Naval mine Reinforced concrete Rocket fuel Marching band Conductor (material) Golf club (equipment) Blue Man Group Irrigation Terry Bogard Skateboarding trick Cruising (maritime) Roof and tunnel hacking Toledo Strip Hard disk Tetrapod Dowsing Ammunition Gas turbine Engine cooling Glossary of climbing terms Gmail Renewable energy Dundas Square Brewery Aerial (dance move) Perl Carbon dioxide Oplan Bojinka Punt (boat) Mattress
