ruud a c unit outside fan issue won't start on it's own i'll spare the troubleshooting details but will post if you need them basically when it is time for the outside unit to turn on it just hums for about seconds and will turn off if you take a flat screwdriver and kind of help the fan blades along then they run fine through a whole cycle and cool down the house but then it won't start again for the next cycle any ideas thanks which one is the capacitor is it the thing that hums or the big thing next to it the capacitor is a small metal can it may look like a tomato can or sardine can to find it follow the purple wires coming from your outdoor fan they clip right onto the capacitor turn off the power to the outdoor unit prior to looking for the capacitor as they store a tremendous amount of energy it will bleed off by the time you find it and should not pose a threat to you once you've found the capacitor call an appliance parts or hvac company and ask if they sell over the counter to individuals Capacitor Circuit design Electric motor Transformer Thermostat Battery (electricity) Electrophysiology Action potential Spacecraft propulsion Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Knife Capacitor plague Tesla coil Impedance CPU cache Screw Computer Microphone Energy development Series and parallel circuits Armored Core AC power Central processing unit X10 (industry standard) Solar power Turbocharger MRAM Ford Ranger EV Universal Century Technology Axial compressor Charge-coupled device Jet engine Electronic amplifier Internal combustion engine Oscilloscope Nuclear power Air conditioning Dynamic random access memory HVAC BS 1363 RISC Furnace Alternating current Colors of noise Hydrogen economy Low-pass filter Thermal power station Electrical element Gas metal arc welding Fuse (electrical) Pebble bed reactor Inductor Read-only memory Refrigerator Combine (Half-Life 2) Apollo Guidance Computer Embedded system Vacuum tube Propeller Fluorescent lamp Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Poker jargon Autonomous building Transistor Energy storage Gundam Development Project Power factor Electronics Service life Welding Toyota Prius Phase-locked loop Lionel Corporation Power station Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bicycle lighting Computer forensics Triathlon Lightsaber Lighting Spark plug Wind power Loudspeaker Big Bang Battery electric vehicle Audiophile Cable television Seismic retrofit Ceramics Drill bit Antenna (radio) Special relativity The Incredibles Cocaine The Inside Exponential growth Leaf CPU design Rose (Doctor Who)
