outlet upgrade i need to get a amp electrical outlet installed in the garage for a pottery kiln in addition i need to get the breaker upgraded i believe to amps to handle this increased energy flow i plan on hiring a professional to do this for safety concerns to all you electricians out there about how much am i looking at spending on this in the oklahoma city market in mass its its not just an outlet a disconnect is involved also it depends on how far from your electrical panel you are going the wire they will use is expensive so the further away you go the more the stock cost also too there is a voltage dropping you go too far and need even thicker wire make sure they use copper define that in your specs when dealing with a contractor dont let them use aluminum another factor is s there space in your electrical panel do you have any blanks or are they going to have to do a sub panel i had enough space another factor is how many amps is your main panel if you olnyhave a amp service and is going to be used for the pottery kiln then you might have to upgrade your main panel to a amp in this case they will have to run a new line from the pole or under ground to accommodate you its hard to give you a quote when i dont know what you have a new service would depend on how far you are from the pole etc if its underground can you use the same conduit or do you have to trench it hopefully its just a matter running a amp drop and you wont have to get into anything else good luck Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical wiring Three-phase electric power Gas metal arc welding Pottery Solar cell Electric motor Circuit breaker Residual-current device Solar power Circuit design Transformer Rapid transit Welding Electric power transmission BS 1363 Elevator Electrician High-voltage direct current Ampere Solar panel Seismic retrofit Electricity meter National Electrical Code (US) Distribution board TGV Light rail Irrigation Light-emitting diode Space Shuttle external tank Relay Spark plug Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ring circuit Electricity Tram Overhead powerline Switch Ground and neutral Electrophysiology Lineman (occupation) Ceramics Capacitor Magnetic field Voltage drop Hydrogen economy Apollo Command/Service Module F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Lightning rod Incandescent light bulb Resistor Thermal power station Electrical wiring (UK) Wind power Split phase Light switch Aluminium Incineration Inductor Operational amplifier General Dynamics F-111 High-speed rail Battery electric vehicle Bicycle lighting Space Shuttle program Tesla coil Earthing system Floppy disk Battery (electricity) Alternating current Hubble Space Telescope Chevrolet Corvair MTR Renewable energy MOSFET Electrical resistance Enigma machine Gas tungsten arc welding Nuclear power Energy development STS-61 Space manufacturing Lighting Special relativity Electrical generator Solar power satellite Manitoba Hydro Cruising (maritime) Magnetism Lac operon Sewage treatment
