will i need to replace the radiator if i cannot find a replacement bleed value when trying to drain the central heating i accidentally broke off half a bleed value off the radiator one half is still in the radiator but i cannot remove it using the bleeding key i have looked for replacement bleed values at b n q but the nearest i can find is the radiator air vents are they the same thing however i think the radiator was of an old design years old and i think a cheap one judging by the previous owner's attitude to the house and don't think the bleed value can be replaced that way so does that mean i will need a new radiator and should i get an anti corrosion kit for the new water to fill the system or is it unnecessary these days as told to me by a plumber the other day hope you can help cheers it depends most radiator bleed nipples don't screw directly into the radiator the bleed valve is usually a thread and is available from any plumber's merchant there are some with a thread too but they are a little harder to find if the nipple screws directly into the radiator you should replace the radiator and add an inhibitor such as fernox mb or sentinel x as the radiators will be old and the system probably prone to corrosion Thermostat Radiator Motor oil Furnace Thermal power station Screw Nuclear power Armored Core Corrosion Tire Incandescent light bulb Diving cylinder Baby bottle Glossary of firefighting equipment Drill bit Seismic retrofit Radiation poisoning Rebreather Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hydraulic machinery Heinkel He 100 Propeller M16 (rifle) Domestic water system Autonomous building Pebble bed reactor Three Mile Island HVAC Nuclear fallout Stirling engine Diving suit Cancer Solar variation Bong Stomach cancer Heat Solar power MS-06 Zaku II Watercooling Mercury 4 Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Flush toilet Dialysis Sewage treatment Fountain pen E85 Nuclear reactor Spark plug Antenna (radio) Space Shuttle program Pump Home repair SL-1 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dishwasher Poker jargon Radiation therapy Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Star Trek planet classifications Traumatic brain injury Internal combustion engine Malignant melanoma Breast cancer Atari 8-bit family Movie projector Ammonia Apollo 8 Passive solar Motorcycle M60 machine gun Intravenous therapy Terraforming Diode First aid Explosive material Space habitat Messerschmitt Bf 109 Breastfeeding Ionizing radiation Upholstery Avalanche Textile manufacturing Inkjet printer Heinkel He 112 Radiation hardening Temperature Professional wrestling slang Transistor Nintendo Entertainment System Gas compressor Western concert flute Computer 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Luminoth Steam (content delivery) Air conditioning Nuclear weapon design Hydrochloric acid Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster
