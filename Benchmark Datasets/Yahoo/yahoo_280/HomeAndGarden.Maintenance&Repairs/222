wich is better in the long run standard a c furnace or hybrid a c heat pump furnace either way natural gas the later type of system you're talking about is called dual fuel what that means is there isn't a difference in the summer because most a c or heat pump systems in the us anyway run only on electricity a heat pump works like a standard ac in the summer the difference is in the winter in heating mode in winter the unit runs as a heat pump until the temperature outside drops to the point where the continuing to operate in heat pump is no longer economically advantageous the system then switches to the gas furnace operation because below a certain temperature it varies based on location and this temperature point called an economic balance point can be set for each individual system when it is installed at the home it is no longer economically feasible to run in heat pump mode if by better you mean more economical to operate generally dual fuel systems are better but they are also more costly in the beginning by the way the first poster doesn't have a clue what he's talking about heat pumps definitely do have freon freon is a trade name for dupont refrigerants there are other names that is how they transfer heat from a warm location to a cooler location in the winter they pick up heat from the outside and transfer it into the house in the summer it works in the opposite if you're interested in more details look up refrigerant cycle on the internet Air conditioning Solar power Refrigerator Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Haloalkane Thermal power station Furnace E85 Thermostat Carburetor Autonomous building Hydrogen economy Heat Temperature Renewable energy Power station Phase change heat pump Steam engine Natural gas Internal combustion engine Hybrid vehicle Energy development Nuclear power Cray-1 Gas absorption refrigerator Kitchen Jet engine Nuclear reactor Mitigation of global warming Carbon dioxide Spacecraft propulsion Transformer Alcohol fuel Explosive material Gas compressor HVAC Electrical wiring Petroleum Ceramics Three-phase electric power Alternative fuel Hydropower Gas turbine Electric arc furnace Central processing unit Central heating Incineration Turbojet Wind turbine Coal Entropy RuneScape Mini-Games Turbocharger Biodiesel Oxygen sensor Heinkel He 100 Water (molecule) Geothermal exchange heat pump STS-62 Basement Locomotive Heat engine Gas metal arc welding Vacuum Wind power Helium Deep lake water cooling Hydraulic machinery Two-stroke cycle Phase (matter) Toyota Prius Global climate model Adiabatic process Cogeneration Diesel engine Heat pump Gasoline Town gas Fuel cell Future energy development Ammonia Brewery Diode Thermocouple Pebble bed reactor Fusion power Peltier-Seebeck effect Global warming Nuclear thermal rocket
