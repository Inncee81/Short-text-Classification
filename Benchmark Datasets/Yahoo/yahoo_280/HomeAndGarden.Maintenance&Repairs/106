electricians please help we have no power in our basement what should we check the breaker hopefully this is the correct name the big switch that will flip if there is a problem is fine the switch breaker that the basement is on also does the washer and the washer is working fine i've checked everything else in the house and all is well in the basement there are some lights and a few outlets and none of them work nothing unusual has happened in the last few days and now nothing works down there the only thing my husband told me about was that there is a burned out lightbulb that the glass broke on when he tried to get it out and he left it in there he says it's the second to the last thing on the electric line down there and if it were that it would likely just effect it and the light after it what could i check what are the possibilities of problems any insight would be great if washer and lights are on the same breaker and the washer works and the lights don't you have a loose wire make sure the washer is on the same circuit by starting the washer and then flipping the basement breaker off if the washer quits your right it is on the basement circuit i would suggest you call an electrician to find your problem if your not sure what your doing if you want to try yourself the loose wire might be in the main power box or in the outlet box for the washer or in the next box in line you would have to look at each one and see if a wire is loose do it with the power off while your at it fix or change out the light fixture with the broken light Residual-current device Switch Fuse (electrical) Incandescent light bulb Distribution board Electrician National Electrical Code (US) Circuit breaker Electrical wiring (UK) Basement Three-phase electric power Ring circuit BS 1363 Relay Stage lighting Thermostat Overhead lines Debugging Digital circuit Light switch Cruising (maritime) Circuit design Oscilloscope X10 (industry standard) Tesla coil Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Fluorescent lamp Burglar alarm Poker jargon Hydraulic machinery Enigma machine Power strip Ground and neutral Electric motor Alternating current Professional wrestling throws Dimmer Vacuum tube Ignition system Transformer Lighting Maxwell's equations Liquid crystal display Central processing unit 2003 North America blackout STS-61 Carburetor Electrical wiring Toronto Subway and RT Solar power Cliff Richard Thermal power station Apollo Guidance Computer Semiconductor device High-voltage direct current Printed circuit board CPU cache Professional wrestling match types Electronic amplifier Directed-energy weapon Transistor Antenna (radio) Shen Gong Wu Ethernet Ocean's Twelve Robot Wars Solar cell Mattress The Basement Tapes Mercury-vapor lamp Hall effect Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Impedance matching Resistor Railway signal Magnetic core memory Lightning Capacitor Lineman (occupation) Knife Diode Electrophysiology Cryptanalysis Bombe Electrical breakdown GunZ The Duel Rose (Doctor Who) Logic gate Electrical generator Electrical resistance Gas metal arc welding Jumpstart 3rd Grade E85 Home repair Daylight saving time Screw Armored Core
