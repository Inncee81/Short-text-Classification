ice machine broken please help i'm having problems getting ice to come down through the hatch the ice machine is making ice but it won't rotate so the ice will fall down the hatch my water button is fine and dispense the water perfectly i change the fuse like thing on the back of the refigator not long ago i'm thinking the problem is the motor that rotate the ice is broken or mess up that's why it won't rotate the ice when i press either the crushed or cube ice nothing happen no sounds at all any recommendation is greatly appreciated thanks sounds like you are on the right track it's hard to say if the motor is bad there could be a switch or something bad as well you have to turn it on and check for voltage at the motor terminal if no voltage is present then it probably is not a bad motor if voltage is present when you try to dispense ice then the motor is probably shot if you changed the fuse and it worked before then maybe something is hindering the rotation and that causes the motor to draw high amperage and eventually blows the fuse again sounds like everything else is in good shape some of those things are electronic and could be hard to troubleshoot without more information that the owners manual will provide it could be that the whole electronic board is bad a lot of times that is what they replace and a lot of times that is the first thing they try of course they have one on their truck and don't have to take a chance on buying one just to take a shot in the dark or they may replace the board first if that doesn't fix it they will change the motor and tell you that they were both bad and you pay for both plus labor that's typical those things are a pain in the ass to work on and are usually repaired by people who specialize in household appliances or they are the authorized service professionals for that particular brand Pinball Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bulk vending Mouse (computing) Wind turbine Tank Transformer Floppy disk Thermal power station Circuit design Welding Embedded system Babe Ruth Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Toyota Prius Gramophone record Fuse (electrical) Resistor Drill bit Windows XP E85 STS-61 High-voltage direct current Cruising (maritime) Electrical generator Fan (implement) Pump It Up Debugging Electronic amplifier Mattress Sampling (music) George Westinghouse Carburetor Time Out of Mind Battery electric vehicle Digital circuit Alternating current Shit Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Firearm Tire Theory of conduct Equine conformation Transistor Magnet Motor oil Electrophysiology Piezoelectricity Slot machine Refrigerator Diode True Crime: Streets of LA Electricity meter Circuit breaker Mountaineering Chris Amon American Motors Computer Blackjack Manual transmission Shaggy dog story Internal ballistics Shen Gong Wu Blood on the Tracks USS Tunny (SS-282) Coffee Stage lighting Ecco the Dolphin Internal combustion engine Phonograph Microeconomics Wheel of Fortune Supply and demand Humphrey Bogart Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Lathe IBM PC compatible Skateboarding trick Potentiometer General Motors Alternator Violin Switch Current (electricity) Drag racing Relay
