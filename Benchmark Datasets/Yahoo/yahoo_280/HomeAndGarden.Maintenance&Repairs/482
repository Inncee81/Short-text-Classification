pedestal sink plumbing problem first off i'd like to say that i am not a plumber so i don't really know anything about it other than common sense anyways i have just installed a pedestal sink after first removing the past vanity sink so i hooked the flexible cords from the hot and cold faucet to the shut off valves on the wall and where the cords meet the shut off valve they are leaking water a little bit i tried using caulk but it won't stick since the tube or nuts are wet is there anything maybe like a spray foam or something that i can put on them to dry fast and adhere to a wet surface to keep it from leaking thanks to any answers that come my way i need them there are several types of supply tube flexible cord connections available solution depends upon which type you have braided type have a wire mesh covering the full length of the tube and nuts permanently attached to the end if you have these you need to remove any remaining caulk or other goop that you may have put on them dry the threads on the valve and wrap a few layers of teflon plumbing tape around the threads instead of teflon tape you can use pipe joint compound but it is messier reconnect the fitting and you should be good to go the pipe threads must be dry for either of these to work plastic or copper tubes with a ferrule these usually do not have a covering there is a nut that slides up and down on the pipe with a brass or plastic ring ferrule at the end of the pipe that connects to the valve if you are reusing an old supply tube you need to cut the tube just above the ferrule and install a new one of the same type then reconnect the fitting tighten just a bit more if you have a minor drip plastic tube with a molded flange at the end again no covering these also have a nut that will slide up and down on the tube but a flange is molded on the end instead of using a ferrule you may need to tighten this one just a bit more if this doesn't work it is likely that the flange has been deformed and you will need to replace the tube you can usually cut of the end and install a ferrule on these instead of replacing but make sure you buy a new nut and ferrule and replace both the nuts for use with ferrules are shaped just a bit different on the inside than the nut for a flange Screw Casting Trombone Irrigation Tire Plastic Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Glossary of firefighting equipment Electrical wiring Spark plug Domestic water system Wrench Thermal power station Drill bit Dialysis Guitar Violin Welding Soldering Diving regulator Tap (valve) Rail terminology Geodesic dome Textile manufacturing Mattress Carburetor Bullet Flush toilet Bong Climbing equipment Radio controlled airplane Siphon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Printed circuit board Ethernet Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Steam engine Coaxial cable Brewery Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Textile manufacturing terminology Wire BS 1363 Brush Glossary of climbing terms Amateur telescope making Transistor Novelty (locomotive) Boat building Fuse (electrical) Fire extinguisher Bassoon Solar power Vacuum tube Equine conformation Diving suit Japanese toilet Furnace Cookware and bakeware Dental brace Urinal Menstrual cup Dishwasher Motorcycle Intravenous therapy Universal Serial Bus Carbon dioxide Carbon fiber Floppy disk Transformer Polystyrene Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bolted joint Christmas tree Residual-current device Earring Submarine Roof Samovar Snorkel Cartridge (firearms) Hamster Haloalkane Glossary of nautical terms Manicure Bass guitar Apollo 13 Coppersmith Plaster Comanche
