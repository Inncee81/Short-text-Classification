how do i determine if i need a new furnace i know it's a little early in the year for this question but how do i determine if i need a new furnance my furnance is only years old i have had some issues with it in the past but they have been fixed by the furnance contrator i use anyway the contractor says there is a chance my heat exchanger could crack at some point he told me this during a normal annual cleaning etc the furnance works fine anyway how do i know this isn't just a sales pitch i was thinking of having a second new contractor come out this fall during the annual cleaning to give me a second opinion if i do this should i mention what the other contactor said or should i just let them do the annual cleaning and see if they bring the issue up independantly thanks for any help i would get another contractor in like you said ask them to do a full inspection on your furnace not mentioning what the other contractor said wait and see if the second contractor brings up the same issue good luck Thermal power station The Apprentice 2 Brazing Poker jargon Furnace Casting Piccolo Junior Saga Table saw Keynesian economics Knife Fiberglass Steel HVAC Fred A.
