hvac problem living room stays cool bedrooms don't for some reason my living room and kitchen stays cool but the three bedrooms seem much warmer the thermostat is in the living room so i have to turn it down to or so to keep the bedrooms comfortable i've even tried to close some the of the vents in the living room so maybe i could get more to the bedrooms without wasting the air in the living room any help with my problem the windows aren't producing a draft and seemed to be sealed just fine do not listen to the chief ducts do not get loose on theri own however spence is on the right track depending on the age of the home and ductwork it sounds as if you have a balancing issue when we design a heating cooling system for a home we have to perform an engineering load to determine how many btuh's that the house and individual rooms have then we can design the ductwork to be able to handle the individual room loads this information should be passed to the installation crew the proper way to install ductwork today is with dampered collars and flexible ductwork pulled taught with no turns now where most companies fail is in the follow up where you go back in with a draft hood that will measure how much airflow is coming out of each vent we take the numbers off of the design criteria and balance each damper to adjust the volume of air in each room to the design criteria now you the homeowner know that each room is getting the appropriate amount of airflow to each room despite where the thermostat is located to see how balancing works you can go to http www nationalcomfortinstitute com or you can see how we performed an air balancing for a local radio host in our market and how it made a difference in her home go to http www howellsac com and look for lori kelly if you require more information you can contact me through our website at http www howellsac com Carburetor Furnace Thermostat Fume hood Thermal power station P-47 Thunderbolt Equine conformation Jet engine Fuel injection Autonomous building Loudspeaker Air conditioning Kitchen Car handling Helicopter Transformer Windows 2000 Renewable energy Dairy Solar power B-47 Stratojet Explosive material Uniform Resource Locator Tire Spark plug Tank M16 (rifle) Nuclear power Supercharger Propeller Domain Name System Web crawler Passenger car HyperText Transfer Protocol Bong Internal combustion engine Dodge Neon Japanese tea ceremony World Wide Web Pebble bed reactor Parachute Diving suit Heat Two-stroke cycle Messerschmitt Bf 109 Central processing unit Chevrolet Corvair engine Transmission Control Protocol Turbocharger Turbofan Japanese toilet Network address translation Solar cell Manifold vacuum Ocean thermal energy conversion Embedded system Electrophysiology Glider Mercury Atlas 6 Surveillance Fan (implement) Radio controlled airplane Audiophile Hydrogen economy Mutual fund Drag racing Computer cooling Wind power Drill bit Carbon dioxide Electrical wiring Aerodynamics Fire fighting Supercomputer Website Axial compressor Swamp cooler Windows XP Nuclear reactor RISC Glass Hard disk Single Transferable Vote Web server Timpani Home improvement Elevator Weighing scale Internal ballistics
