is there a way to remove scratches from a pane of glass maybe some glass experts can post some suggestions but the only thing i can think of and it's a long shot but i think your best and only shot is depending on how many and how severe the scratches are to try heating the area with an open flame like a propane torch you may be able to soften the scratches a little with this if the pane is in place and the glass melts too much you will probably ruin it ideally you'd want the glass out and resting flat if you feel this is worth while i think there are places that make such repairs but i suspect they are horrendously expensive best of luck Glass Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diamond simulant Fiberglass Soldering Incandescent light bulb Hot air balloon Float glass Bong Lathe Image scanner Welding John Hancock Tower Glassblowing Solar cell Window Gas metal arc welding Material properties of diamond Diamond enhancement Billiards Sunglasses Solar power Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Dundas Square The Big Break Disc brake Seismic retrofit Brazing Mercury 4 Internal ballistics Glasses Steel Winning Streak Spark plug Champagne (beverage) Polyethylene terephthalate Columbine High School massacre Pottery Insulation Plastic Repouss__ and chasing Olympic Flame Seismometer Cremation Mattress Aluminium Door Opportunity rover Trailer Park Boys Casting Menstrual cup Printed circuit board Optical fiber Flamethrower Snowball Earth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neon sign Fuel injection Cryonics Bullet catch Forge View camera Slide rule Cube (film) Airsoft Printmaking Bunsen burner Parable of the broken window Kerosene lamp Rei Ayanami Abiogenic petroleum origin Compact disc Iron Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Fire Gothic Revival architecture Glossary of climbing terms Shoe Cross-country skiing Propane Ceramics Cookware and bakeware B3ta Human Torch Piccolo Junior Saga Flat tax Flame Stroke Thief (computer game) Robot Master Manganese Donald Neilson 9/11 conspiracy theories Blood (computer game) Torch Alkane Alabaster Volkert van der Graaf Textile manufacturing
