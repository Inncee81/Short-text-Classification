septic tank leach line how to tell which part has the pipes i need to install a fence and my septic lines reach almost to the back of the woods where i want to install my fence how do i avoid hitting the trench part of the leach line where the pipes are is it where the grass is green or is it the part that has kind of sunk down and doesn t have any color due to the drought in the area ok let me start with i have worked for a plumbing company for over yrs i have ran two of them and still run another one for my best friend with that said your septic tank should be buried no more then inches below your yard your header coming off of the tank is about inches below the top of the tank now if your tank is less than inches below the ground than your header to your field lines will be closer to the top of the ground your header should be a in or in schedule or depends on how old the tank is and if it is home made the difference is the thickness of the pipe is thin is thicker the header comes out so far and then it drains into pipes depends on what was put in or what your county health dept allowed those pipes could be as small as inches and as large as inches it could have gravel under it and black pipe with holes facing down called sock pipe if it is the inch pipe than your field lines could be alot closer than you think so if the top of the tank is say inches under the dirt and your header is inches that makes inches total but if you have a inch sock pipe then your field lines are inches below the dirt if the ground is sunken in that could be your tank or field lines i would be very careful in your going to put a fence there you may want to have a plumber come out and find the end of your field lines if down the road you have problems you can not take them out and put them back where they were you have to move them so with that said you don't want to mess them up by putting the fence on top of them causing them not to work cause you crushed them on the end or close to it and it can cost any where between to grand depends on what your laws are there regarding and how many feet etc the laws here change every year or two hope this helps Septic tank Autonomous building Domestic water system Thermal power station Drill bit Laws of cricket Textile manufacturing Baseball Equine conformation Toilet paper Barbed wire Tank M16 (rifle) Tag Drainage Marching band Snooker Kitchen Bong Airport Boston Red Sox Seismic retrofit Brewery Billiards Mattress Wood Baseball field Glossary of American football Ethernet Siphon Objective-C Dairy Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Drag racing Battle of Tarawa Dog agility 1957 World Series Mark VIII (tank) 2004 American League Championship Series Fast bowling Stairway Shaggy dog story Home run Japanese toilet Apollo Command/Service Module Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Hastings United FC Transformer Combine (Half-Life 2) Lechaina Second Battle of El Alamein Electrical wiring Cleveland Browns Glennallen, Alaska Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Hamster View camera Basement Archery Diamond Nine Inch Nails Caliche Tobacco Glossary of firefighting equipment Indianapolis 500 Home repair A151 road Motorcycle The Manchester Regiment 2004 World Series Israeli West Bank barrier Dodge Charger Hard disk T-34 Shotgun Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Battle of the Somme (1916) Hydraulic machinery Comparison of Canadian and American football Fancy rat Violin Table tennis Trench warfare Wario Lawn mower Turbocharger Derbyshire lead mining history Rail terminology 2000 Australian Grand Prix
