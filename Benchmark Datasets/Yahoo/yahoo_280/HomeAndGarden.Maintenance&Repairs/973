a c not working well right now can you add freon i have a window a c in which the compressor keeps cutting off and on can you add freon like you do to cars or is there something else wrong if the compressor keeps coming off and on there is a few possible reasons bad thermostat this control is mounted inside the front of your ac where the knob is that sets the temp you want the unit to cool to or the part that senses how cold it is getting is touching the front of the ac coil bad capacitor allowing unit to still start but allowing it to pull to many amps causing it to kick it overload bad overload most of these are internal and cannot be repaired if it was low on freon it would still run but it would either freeze up or not cool at all Refrigerator Thermostat Air conditioning Phase change heat pump Cray-1 Dodge Neon Jet engine Bass guitar Supercharger Axial compressor Manual transmission Electric motor Mars Exploration Rover Electrophysiology Thermal power station Carburetor Fluorescent lamp Gas compressor Transformer Microphone Solar power HVAC Turbocharger Haloalkane Temperature Oscilloscope Turbojet Fan (implement) Volleyball Circuit breaker Honda Prelude Loudspeaker Audio level compression Glossary of American football Drifting (motorsport) Relay Heinkel He 100 SR-71 Blackbird Bi-metal Toyota Prius CDC 6600 Football (soccer) Guitar Heat Lincoln LS Tire Cooler Tesla coil CDC 7600 Turbofan Spacecraft propulsion Windows 2000 Equine conformation Marathon (computer game) Cryogenics Capacitor plague Battery (electricity) Volkswagen Passat Swimming Weather lore Chevrolet Corvair engine Internal ballistics Lighting Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Apollo 13 De Lorean DMC-12 Effects unit Dodge Charger Motor oil Inertial guidance system Ford Thunderbird Subaru Loyale M16 (rifle) Autonomous building Bicycle lighting Butterfly stroke Diving regulator Soldering Heinkel He 112 Vinyl roof Residual-current device Hydrogen economy Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Valve sound Action potential Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rugby union Chaos Emerald Poker jargon Fire fighting Mercury Atlas 6 Drill bit Dynamic random access memory Diode Cryonics Refrigeration Hurricane Katrina effects by region Circuit design Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Filling station
