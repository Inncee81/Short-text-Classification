self priming pump koi pond i have a large pond with a self priming pump to pump from the skimmer box up to the top bio falls the pump recently has been putting out a very choked down flow a fraction of what it normal does first i thought there was an obstruction up at the bio falls and there was a lot of goop that the filter had cleaned out i cleaned that all out thinking the pump couldnt overcome the pressure but it didnt make any difference i also turned off the waterfall and let the water run back down in hopes of dislodging something that might be clogging the pipe but i didnt see much come out water flowed great though my question is what would cause the pump to pump so much less than normal am i on the right track i should say that the pump is very very hard to get to so it would be a last resort to pull the pump itself please help check your suction side of the pump you may have picked up some debris that is blocking the suction line to the pump it may have a prefilter that needs to be cleaned or replaced Carburetor Siphon Bong Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station Cavitation Borehole Suction Brewery Vacuum Motor oil Dredge Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Whitewater Dialysis Pump Dairy Energy development Wave power E85 Water supply Fossil fuel power plant Newcomen steam engine Hydraulic ram Irrigation Diesel engine Two-stroke cycle Electrophysiology Ocean thermal energy conversion Aquarium Professional wrestling holds Loudspeaker Hydraulic machinery Chernobyl accident Fountain Dam Novelty (locomotive) Manifold vacuum Thermostat Pulmonary alveolus Solar power Heart Glossary of wildland fire terms Hard disk Marine aquarium Water turbine Fire engine Portable stove Sewage treatment Shotgun Water purification Professional wrestling throws Jet engine Anchor Steam engine Reef tank Refrigerator Diving Hydrogeology Koi Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Renewable energy Heat Water organ Niagara Falls Carbon dioxide Timeline of steam power Steam locomotive nomenclature Tap (valve) Combine harvester Fast bowling Glossary of firefighting terms Three Mile Island Watercooling Fuel pump Handloading Sewer Water tower Power station Golf Redundant array of independent disks Gas compressor Electronic organ Bladderwort Hydrogen economy Great Salt Lake Submersible pump Dundas Square Equine conformation Rocket fuel Aquifer Supercharger Infusion pump Aerial (dance move) Windmill Collapse of the World Trade Center Expansion chamber Diode
