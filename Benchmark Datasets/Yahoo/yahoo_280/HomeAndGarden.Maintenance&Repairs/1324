where is my shower leak coming from my shower is leaking into the basement when i run the bathtub there is no leak at all whatsoever only when i have the shower running for about minutes does it leak into the basement it does not happen right away i have cut a small hole around where the shower comes out of the dry wall and don't see a leak up top my main problem is it's a tiled shower so i don't want to rip those apart unless it's a last resort are there other things i can check that would cause the shower to leak without ripping down the wall although i agree with tazz for the most he said before you cut any walls there should be an access panel close to the floor behind the tub remove the panel and shine a flashlight while someone turns the shower on you should be able to determine what is leaking and where it is located if you have to cut the wall try and make a neat hole then remove the sheetrock and fix the problem and install a piece of paneling with screws in order to make an access panel that can be used in the future good luck Basement Sento Drill bit Fecal incontinence Asbestos Customs and etiquette of Japan Bathing Elevator Lighting Residual-current device Door Wood carving Toilet paper The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence Cruising (maritime) Woodworking Dymaxion house Table saw Have I Got News For You Electrical wiring STS-61 World Trade Center Carburetor Menstrual cup Seismic retrofit USS Tunny (SS-282) Air-raid shelter Lathe Windows Vista Roof Spark plug Second Battle of the Atlantic Passive solar Kitchen Wood Solar cell Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bristol Grammar School Floppy disk CPU cache Betting (poker) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Social rule Japanese toilet Tire The Basement Tapes Dishwasher The Sims 2 Bassoon Windows XP Plame affair timeline The Amber Spyglass Screw The Suffering (game) King Khalid International Airport Oxyacetylene Poker jargon Combine (Half-Life 2) Bong Space Shuttle program De Lorean DMC-12 Tag Toilet PaX Parachute Central heating Robot Wars Mercury 4 Teen Girl Squad Blood Simple Valles Marineris Top-bar hive Glossary of firefighting equipment Ultima Online Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Textile manufacturing USS S-37 (SS-142) Super Mario 64 Bathroom Hamster Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Plame affair Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Basement Jaxx Battlebots Collision detection Solar power Timber framing Naval mine True Crime: Streets of LA Atari 8-bit family Jean Charles de Menezes Bulk vending Washroom Tessellation Zippo 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines
