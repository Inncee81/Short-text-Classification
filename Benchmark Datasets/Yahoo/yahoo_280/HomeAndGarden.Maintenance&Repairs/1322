hot water heater i am building a story home the builders want to place the hot water heater up in the attic i have had discussions with other builders and homeowners and they advise me to place the hot water heater in the garage where should a hot water heater be placed jnet since houses have become more energy efficient and sealed to prevent heat loss or entry plumbing codes have had to be adopted to protect the public there are locations that most codes now approve in the attic and in the garage if it is located in the garage the unit must be elevated above the floor whether it is gas or electric combustible fumes can build up in a sealed garage that could be ignited by an open flame or a spark from an electric model the attic is ok as long as there is ample combustion air available some of these newer houses have such tight construction that the new water heaters are having the pilot lights go out because of lack of air either location is good but as a service plumber i prefer a garage location for ease of removal when the unit needs to be replaced attic locations require me to take a helper along to aid in the removal thus raising the installation costs i hope this sheds some light so you can make a educated decision good luck Thermostat Spark plug Furnace Water heater Autonomous building Fire fighting Thermal power station Internal combustion engine Solar power HVAC Diesel engine Fossil fuel power plant Glossary of firefighting terms Torpedo Hydrogen economy Wood fuel Model aircraft Natural gas Straw-bale construction Energy Domestic water system Energy development Jet engine Tesla coil Wankel engine Bungalow Bong E85 Kitchen Incandescent light bulb Renewable energy Chevrolet Corvair Wind power Refrigerator Electrical wiring Nuclear power Fuel injection Pebble bed reactor Radio controlled airplane Turbojet Hybrid vehicle Combustion Hot air balloon Diving suit Stirling engine Gas turbine Manitoba Hydro Air conditioning Carburetor Alcohol fuel Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Solar panel Steam engine Fire Glossary of firefighting equipment Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Lighting Biodiesel Firefighter Thermocouple Rocket fuel Toyota Prius Automobile Tire Environmental concerns with electricity generation Gas metal arc welding Samovar Spacecraft propulsion Town gas Gasoline Geodesic dome Space shuttle main engine Power station Glossary of wildland fire terms Stairway Apollo 13 Turbocharger Passive solar Arc welding Hydroelectricity McMansion The Brady Bunch Fan (implement) Dodge Neon Automobile emissions control
