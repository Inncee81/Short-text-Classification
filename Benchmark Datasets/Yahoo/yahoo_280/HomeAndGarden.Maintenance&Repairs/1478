could romex electricl wiring be buried i a small pool and have found that the filter system gets over heated when run off an extension cord and burns out could romex electricl wiring be buried so that i cou ld an outlet by the pool or should the wiring be encased inside pvc tubing soas to keep water tight depends on the electric code where you are i had to bury mine inside pvc conduit and could not use jacketed wire like that at all so i was told by the local home depot if i remember correctly i had to run three separate guage wires out to the pool outlet in the conduit hot neutral and ground and have nothing else on the circuit if you have a long run use a larger guage wire smaller number i could not use the underground romex for the pool by code here or so they told me research your local requirements first Electrical wiring Gas metal arc welding National Electrical Code (US) Residual-current device Swimming pool Ground and neutral Glossary of firefighting equipment Welding Brewery Power cable Solar power Tesla coil Three-phase electric power Spark plug Circuit design Rapid transit Thermal power station Fuse (electrical) BS 1363 Tank Vacuum tube Printed circuit board Pebble bed reactor Incandescent light bulb Electric motor Single-phase electric power Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Burglar alarm Hydraulic machinery Transformer Plastic Alternating current X10 (industry standard) Internal combustion engine Ring circuit Transmitter Metroid Prime Electrical wiring (UK) Computer Distribution board Overhead lines Carburetor Thermostat Elevator Electrophysiology Liquid crystal display Central processing unit Spacecraft propulsion Torpedo Conductor (material) Action potential Seismic retrofit Resistor Energy development CPU design Digital circuit Optical fiber Antenna (radio) Swimming TGV Lightning Current (electricity) Telephone exchange Integrated circuit Cray-1 Internal ballistics Autonomous building Aluminium Switch Seismometer Split phase Geodesic dome Synthesizer Sewage treatment Digital Subscriber Line High-voltage direct current Soldering Magnet Loudspeaker Tram Radio controlled airplane Diving suit Wire Circuit breaker Fluorescent lamp Tire Fire fighting Trombone Siphon RISC Hydrogen economy Nuclear reactor Electric power transmission Glossary of firefighting terms Conduit car High-voltage hazards
