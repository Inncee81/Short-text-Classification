need to replace central h a ductwork in the attic with a product critters can't tear into any suggestions i live in louisiana where it is always hot and humid raccoons tore into the attic and destroyed the soft flexible ducting would like to replace it with insulated material that i can flex to some degree but that will not allow claws to tear please advise of course i would like to keep costs as low as possible over the last years in an effort to make installing ductwork cheaper and easier alot of alternative materials have been used from fiberboard to flex duct but no ductwork lasts like good old fashioned metal ductwork its not as difficult to work with as it may seem and most of the tools and materials sell at local home centers there are three basic joints you need to learn to bang together metal duct slip and drive connection dovetail joint flange joint everything else is about securing sealing and insulating the duct properly HVAC Plastic Electrical wiring Drill bit Space shuttle main engine Radio controlled airplane Spark plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Printed circuit board Violin Seismic retrofit Coaxial cable Aluminium Solar power BS 1363 Vacuum tube Welding Free trade Fume hood Epoxy Hydrogen economy Mattress Steel Pebble bed reactor Golf club (equipment) Asbestos Genericized trademark High-voltage direct current Air conditioning Screw Commodore 64 Floppy disk Knife Bong Equine conformation Guitar Turbofan Eye Transistor Soldering Glass Roof Autonomous building Menstrual cup Corrosion MOSFET Thermal power station Vacuum Snowboard Diving suit Rail tracks Gas metal arc welding Weight training Dog Poodle Gramophone record Circuit design Hard disk Laser engraving Electric power transmission Saxophone Gross domestic product Solar cell IPod Power cable Propeller Linux Nickel-cadmium battery Alcohol fuel Transformer Glossary of firefighting equipment Building material Energy development Tank Fishbone Game programmer Professional wrestling holds Suspension bridge Fuel cell Leather Trombone Jet engine M60 machine gun Tesla coil Computer Mars Exploration Rover Tent Pottery Nunchaku Common cold Pavement (material) Industrial engineering Mitsubishi 3000GT Bicycle frame Condom Insurance
