what is the meaning of k polyurethane paints what does komponent mean what is k komponent is what is k then this means it is an epoxy type paint consisting of the base plus a catalyst to start the chemical reaction that the paint needs to cure this is unlike regular paints that air dry and require no catalyst Epoxy Paint Varnish Chemical reaction Polyurethane Catalyst Polymerization Formaldehyde Plastic Organic peroxide Fuel injection Enzyme Sulfuric acid Catalytic converter Alcohol Ammonia Cracking (chemistry) Catalysis Petrochemical Technetium Graphite-reinforced plastic Base (chemistry) Polyethylene Polymer Methanol Hydrochloric acid Energy development Fuel cell Acetic acid Air conditioning Raney nickel Phosgene Homebuilt aircraft Chemical kinetics Redox Casting Activation energy Alcohol fuel Mattress Chemical reactor Gasoline Air pollution Toluene Nuclear thermal rocket Fire extinguisher Gasification Raw food diet Oil painting Trichloroethylene Polypropylene Alkene Carbon dioxide Methane Royal Dutch Shell Fume hood Manganese Wallpaper group Explosive material Polychlorinated biphenyl Grubbs' Catalyst Chemistry Hydrogen economy Edwards Air Force Base Dodge Charger Hydrogen chloride Electric motor Adsorption Battery (electricity) Tempera Adhesive Benzene Olefin metathesis Paintball marker Hydrogen peroxide Primer (paint) Ether Reaction rate Chemoluminescence Cobalt(II) chloride Acetone Friction Phenol formaldehyde resin Micro-encapsulation Light-emitting diode Monopropellant rocket Aluminium chloride Softball Paintball Nuclear reaction Ethylene oxide Alkane Cyanocobalamin Ozone depletion Chloroform Living polymerization Airbag Vanadium(V) oxide Painting Polydimethylsiloxane Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster
