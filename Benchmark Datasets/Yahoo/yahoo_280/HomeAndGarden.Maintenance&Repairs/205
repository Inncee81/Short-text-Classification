what would cause the concrete floor in yr old house to suddenly crack and drop my house is years old and has never had any structural problems the basement is concrete with vinyl tile covering it about months ago the flooring cracked and dropped about to inch in a circle around the i beam about feet away from the beam i noticed today that other areas in the floor are starting to lift and floor has multiple areas of slight elevations beginning the only thing we've changed is cut down a huge tree that was in the backyard way back in april i'm planning to get a structural engineer in but wondered should i get a plumber to look for broken pipes under the house what could cause this to occur any insight would be greatly appreciated well i work in the contruction industry so maybe i can shed a little light here no way it's been caused by settling the house finished settling years ago you didn't tell me how far away that huge tree was away from your foundation but if it was within feet and you remeoved the stump and roots which seems unlikley you have definitley removed mass from underneath your concrete slab i think however more than likely an abundance of moisture has finally accumulated and worked on the basement slab enough to the point where parts of it affected mostly have finally shifted you need to consult a very qualified structural contractor immediatley good luck it's going to be expensive Basement Seismic retrofit Wood Straw-bale construction Reinforced concrete Air-raid shelter Gramophone record Light-frame construction Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dundas Square Panama Canal Equine conformation Yosemite National Park Plate tectonics Combine (Half-Life 2) Wood carving Mount St. Helens Stairway Mattress Drag racing Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Leon White Hoover Dam 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens St Albans Cathedral Roof Home repair Casting Anchor Welding Big Dig Xanadu House Elevator Carlsbad Caverns National Park Corrosion Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Masonry The Basement Tapes Kitchen Foundation (architecture) Collapse of the World Trade Center Geodesic dome Aerial (dance move) Pottery Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Space Shuttle program Second Battle of the Atlantic Opportunity rover Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Pachypodium Glossary of wildland fire terms Arlington House Erosion Rathfarnham Colorado Plateau Great Pyramid of Giza Diamond Deforestation Chatsworth House Harley-Davidson McMansion Passive solar Grand Teton National Park Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix Death Valley National Park Baseball Le Corbusier Vegetation Textile manufacturing Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve John Hancock Tower King Khalid International Airport Tenshinhan Climate of the United Kingdom Milton H.
