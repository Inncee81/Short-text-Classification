how long does it take to charge a psp when it has no battery left it takes a couple hours to charge a completely empty battery the power indicator light remains orange when the battery is charging and it turns back to green when it is full please note that lithium ion batteries prefer to be charged when they are partially depleted do not always fully deplete them like you would with a nickel cadmium battery only do it about once a month for example if there is of battery life left charge it back to when possible instead of waiting until it reaches to charge it if you only charge the battery when it reaches it won't damage your psp but the battery will go bad a little more quickly even rechargable batteries don't last forever Battery (electricity) Lithium ion battery Nickel metal hydride Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle PlayStation Portable Lithium ion polymer battery Hybrid vehicle Game Boy Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Action potential Galileo spacecraft USS S-38 (SS-143) Diode IPod Items in the Metroid series Protoss Second Battle of the Atlantic Ozone depletion Handheld game console Lead-acid battery Radio controlled car USS Waters (DD-115) USS S-37 (SS-142) Armored Core Nuclear fusion Xbox 360 Green Lantern Corps Solar cell Guardians of the Universe USS Thresher (SS-200) Ozone hole Vacuum tube Nickel Game Boy Advance SP Membrane potential Memory effect Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Torpedo Lithium USS Alfred A.
