is remeron usually prescribed first line for anxiety i believe i have gad but my doctors dx was a depressive episode i told him i dont feel depressed and he wrote me low dose script i dont like nassas because it can cause hallucinations and vivid dreaming and i dont sleep well anyways what should i do of course medications can originally be made for something else and discovered to work for other things i understand your fear of the side effects you either need to trust your dr enough to follow his orders and take the medication or if you do not feel comfortable you can always go get a second opinion i have never heard of this type of medication being prescribed for strictly anxiety but i am by no means a dr follow your gut and do what feels comfortable and safe to you you ultimately have to feel comfortable not only with your dr but what you are putting in your body and if you are leery from the get go about the medication that is probably not going to help your anxiety i had fears at first too extreme fears about taking meds but finally found a dr that listened to my concerns and worked with me also realise that every medication is going to have possible serious side effects i often found it best just to find out the most common to watch out for and not read the scare sheets as they are often called sometimes people with gad have been known to go inpatient so they are in an environment where they feel safe enough to get stabilised on meds i wish you the best on whatever you decide and hope your anxiety is better soon Bipolar disorder Anxiety Chronic fatigue syndrome Prostate cancer Milton H.
