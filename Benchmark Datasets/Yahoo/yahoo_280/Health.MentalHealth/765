i think i'm insane about two years ago for an acting audition i started playing music while i practiced my lines it helped me get into the mood of my character so i did it again when i read lines for the next audition with the music i could imagine that the other actors were in the room with me even when i was practicing alone since doing it helped me so much i eventually just got into the habit of playing music constantly however in the past year i've started imagining that people who started out as fellow actors but have now morphed into imaginary friends if you will who don't exist are in the room with me i can be having a conversation with my brother when out of nowhere i'll see one of them standing on the other side of the room my mind is playing tricks on me and i'm halfway living in a dream world i don't enjoy talking to anyone now or being around my friends i prefer the company of the imaginary people i honestly think something is wrong with me am i going insane no brett i've never done drugs of any kind before but thanks for the answer anyway smell the sarcasm boy just blow shit up with your mind Goldstein's book Great Teacher Onizuka Friends Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Shit Theory of conduct Drama The Cure Milton H.
