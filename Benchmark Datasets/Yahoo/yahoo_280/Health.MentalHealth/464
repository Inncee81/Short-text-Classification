diazepam abuse help needed i am not asked this for myself but i am very worried about a family member she has been taking diazepam for a very long time now about years from what i have been told and what worries me more is that she hasn t spoken directly to her doctor about this for a very long time as all she has to do is go across the road to the local clinic and speak to the receptionist and order a repeat prescription which is available the next day surely the doctor is wrong to keep issuing this drug to her without speaking to her first and also when i have spoken to my own gp about my concerns he say s this is not a good drug to be issuing without examining the patient first and also that it is only meant to be used in a short term capacity and not the answer i know that if i was to question her about this all i will get is mind my own business i have spoken to her partner and he is at a loss about what to do for the best as he can t talk to her properly because it ends in an arguement thanks so far all routine is that she will take the drug when getting up and will also take more during the day if needed not everyday she is also drinking whilst on this drug not much really about litres of cider normal from pm that is when it is impossible to talk to her as she is right and you are wrong i said abuse in question header as i think that after over a decade of taking the drug you are now dependent on it and when you are refusing to even get a part time hrs job to help out your family as they are struggling then it is affecting your life as a person and as a mum she has never done a bad thing to anyone but her kids need more as they are getting older and seeing other kids enjoying time with there parents but as she do sent drive or work they never have enough money to go anywhere or do anything your doctor is right valium diazepam is only meant for short term use however i'm not sure that she is abusing or addicted to the drug the first thing you need to find out is if she is taking her medication as prescribed so if it's mg a day is she only taking mg if she is taking the prescribed amount she's not addicted if she's taking more than the prescribed amount she's addicted valium is a sedative and it can be dangerous coming off of it especially after a long period of time you are right her doctor should not be prescribing her medication without examining her first and i honestly don't know what to tell you about that why does she need the valium before you jump to conclusions about abuse or addiction find out if she's taking it as prescribed if she's not talk to her about it and tell her even though you really should mind your business you're concerned about her Diazepam Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Drug addiction Medical prescription Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Controlled Substances Act Benzodiazepine Drug abuse Arguments for and against drug prohibition Addiction Epilepsy Theory of conduct Social rule Bipolar disorder Sedative Insomnia Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Sant Thakar Singh Clinical depression LSD The nature of God in Western theology Physician Rush Limbaugh Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drug test Alcoholism Infantilism Abortion Adverse effect (medicine) Medicine Milton H.
