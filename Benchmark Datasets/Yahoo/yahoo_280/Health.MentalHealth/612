childhood abuse and dealing with it when i was years old i was abused and raped by a priest this went on for years because as the priest told me no one would believe me he was right for two years i begged and pleaded with my parents to no avail i finally convinced my grandfather who took me to a doctor and he verified the abuse this was in the 's and the laws were not the same as now my doctor and my parents decieded the best thing would be for me to just forget about it my grandfather died a week later of a heart attack and my parents then decieded it would be a good idea to beat the living crap out of me on a daily basis all of this i found out about months ago i went into therapy for depression and remembered this i have since verified the incident with the only two family members still alive and they both confirm it happened i'm now very upset and mad and all the people invoolved are dead the priest my parents the doctor any ideas on how to move on i am now and confused i had recovered memories of sexual abuse too at age to me it was like getting my life turned upside down and a whole new history shaken out of my pockets unsettling to say the least all my relationships were called into question how could so much horrible abuse have happened to me and i didn't remember it why didn't anybody recognize what trouble i was in and help me so questioning strong emotions and confusion are all pretty common after remembering something like this i'm glad you got confirmation at least you don't have to question that are you still seeing your therapist if you have a good relationship with them and they seem to be helpful i'd stick with them if not i'd seek out somebody who has experience working with trauma and sexual abuse there's a lot of good information out there doing some research is probably a good idea to help you get a better understanding of trauma and its effects you might want to look for a support group for survivors of sexual abuse possibly even for survivors of clergy abuse lastly i think people recover memories because on some deep level they feel ready to deal with them now your mind has its own healing process pay attention to it and treat yourself kindly this is tough stuff to deal with i'm wishing you good luck False memory Milton H.
