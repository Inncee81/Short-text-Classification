how do i get my mom to the doctors to treat her severe ocd i unforunately live with women my grandma my aunty and my mom who all have severe cases of ocd they are one of those ocd people labled under cleaning dirty and if they dont clean themselves or the house they will lose their minds and go absolutely crazy so in order of fix it they scream shout and pout until they have the whole household cleaning hours a day my mom see's one dust and starts to cry my whole house is filled with mat's rugs plastic mats and newspaper on the floor and is dusted out daily if i don't clean my spot less room daily she screams and yells and says pretty degrading stuff about me so because of it i went through depression and sucide attempts about how unhappy they make me and how they never talk normally but constantly yell and scream and tell me how disgusting i am now my question how do i get them to see a doctor to get treatment everytime i ask them to see a doctor they are in denial of course and my mom ends up in tears my mom also has an eating disorder she will chew on flavorful foods then spit them out in a napkin the only foods she manages to eat are vegetables i need any advice or anything on how to get them to a doctor or some kind of therapy session they also have the ocd where they must check the stove times before they leave the kitchen the must check if the door is locked times they re open evelopes about times to check if they put the letter in the envelope it's all very time consuming and irritating they have many many other characteristics of severe ocd this is such a complex problem to treat is it too late to fix are they in too deep i have one year left in highschool i also live in hawaii rent is too expensive here to live on my own my friends are all still young to move out of their houses well its hard to get them to go to the doctor if they are not commited talk to your mom about how much this is affecting you and explain to them that this behavior is not normal and reasure them that if they get the help they need they can feel what normal feels like its ok to go to the doctor for something like this its a chemical imbalance and its just like going to the doctor for anyother type of illness you should not be ashamed at all take it from me i had ocd and it drove me nutz since i have been on medication i am so much happier and feel so much better i hope everything works out good luck Obsessive-compulsive disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psychiatric hospital Mental illness Bipolar disorder Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stomach cancer The Inside Terri Schiavo The Shining (film) Binge eating disorder Anorexia nervosa Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Shaggy dog story Clinical depression Stuttering Pitaten Sigmund Freud Stroke Kodocha Fancy rat Prostate cancer Transsexuality Social rule Clomipramine Hypoglycemia Garfield Ron and Fez Acne Milton H.
