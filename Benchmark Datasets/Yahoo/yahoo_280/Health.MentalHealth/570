how do i raise my self esteem up i have very low self esteem because im overweight and i like this boy who like me but i don't want to talk to him because i don't like the way i look and i wish he could wait for me but i know that won't happen so how do increase it p s do u think he will wait know that you are beautiful and totally awesome no matter how much you weight physical beauty fades for most of us so focus more on strengthening and beautifying the person within because boys may come and go standards of beauty may change but you are stuck with yourself until the day you die and if you validate your self worth through others or society in general you will never be happy i've been there and done that never let others have that much control over you attraction and love is always greater and more pure when the opposite sex is able to love more about you than your attractiveness if you are to loose weight and boast your self esteem do it for yourself and your health not some boy or man once you develop a strong self esteem and are comfortable in your own skin men who are actually worth a damn will naturally come to you take a look at yourself in the mirror and or write down qualities that you like about yourself and what you wish to change develop a plan to change or work on those things but realize that change does not happen over night best of luck sweetie Obesity Jon Secada Puberty Social rule Transsexuality Sexual attraction Love Gay slang Sexual orientation Anne Rice Inflation Human sexual behavior Urinary incontinence Self-esteem Human Objectivist philosophy Simone Weil Gay Summa Theologiae Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Microeconomics The Inside Pitaten Phaedo Paradox Ex-gay The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex George Abbott AFI 100 Years series Theory of conduct Milton H.
