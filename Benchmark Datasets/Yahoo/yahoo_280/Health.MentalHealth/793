is this self harm i use to cut myself quit badly when i was and i was silly doing it and looking back i realize it only made evey thing worse i know this is a weird thing to ask but lately i've been chewing the inside of my mouth well not really lately but i kind of just noticed and thought something of it i seem to do it when i'm sad or nervous so is this self harm similar to cutting fu ck you i'm not emo i hate emos they make me sick there is a difference between being depressed and being an attention seeking emo ignore the idiot who said emo i don't think it's a real problem chewing the inside of your mouth unless you are biting down on the flesh till the bleeds don't let that be a habit it's not healthy focus on what is going to happen and try to think positive if your nervous just try and think about the good things in life you can always improvise by chewing gum instead and try to be more confident in yourself there are people out there who expect you to do well and being nervous only brings you down just get out there and do it that's how i get over being nervous whenever your sad just think about the good things in life your family and friends if they ever see you sad you wouldn't want them to worry cause it'll make them sad at the fact that they don't know how to help you Shaggy dog story Mojave people Theory of conduct Tobacco smoking Tobacco Piccolo Junior Saga Anxiety Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophical skepticism Kim Possible Time Out of Mind Tooth One Piece minor characters Jon Secada Theodicy Cocaine Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Utilitarianism Charles Goodyear Babe Ruth Nicomachean Ethics Dead Like Me Vernon Schillinger Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
