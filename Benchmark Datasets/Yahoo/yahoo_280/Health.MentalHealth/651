what can i do for this young women literally just a few minutes ago from writing this question a young women walked through the door of my apartment building hysterical and crying and told me she was raped she came to me for comfort and asked that i not leave her so i held her until some people got the police over the cops said that i should return to my room while they speak to her when they came to my room they told me that they believe that she had not been raped recently but this was a sudden 'triggered' response which was probably the result of post tramatic stress disorder i know her first name but can't seem to find her university profile on facebook we are both students or at least i think she is a student i have no idea if she has any family support or anyone to get through this it is clear that her roommate is mentally ill and can't provide much solice for her i want to walk back up to her room later and ask her how she is doing any reason why i shouldn't or is this a bad idea i don't know there is no way she can accuse me of raping her the cops saw her coming to me for comfort they would never believe such an accusation that's assuming she would do such a thing which i know is not the case this is the real thing i can just tell how sacry triggers can be very disturbing and hard for both the survivor and who witnesses it i would go up especially if she really doesnt have a room mate that isnt there i wouldnt worry about getting too forward just letting her know that you were concerned for her and if she is ok and if your comfortable with it leave the door open to further friendship let her bring it up dont press it being there is worth a million times more than you could ever know to a survivor going through the healing processes check out rainn see what they have for rape crisis ctrs in your area rape sexual abuse is painful and many many survivors dont start doing healing work or even remembering that they were assaulted until they are triggered i would be ready with a list of resources rainn is a good place to start theres also several other really good web based survivor sites that you can pass onto her when shes ready read that as when she asks welcome to barbados after silence and surviving to thriving are all amazing empowering sites most have parts to them for supporters of survivors thank you for being with her Rape Sin City The Inside Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Post-traumatic stress disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Friends Katelyn Faber Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Silent Night, Deadly Night 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Traumatic incident reduction The Invisibles Milton H.
