how do you improve your attention span thanks healthy breakfast i read somewhere that the most brain damaging habit is not to have a breakfast after the overnight fast and lack of glucose in the body it is imperative to consume some protein and fiber rich food products when i used to stay with my parents there was not a single day that i missed my breakfast and all credit goes to my mother but since i have been staying on my own i have become more and more negligent running our body on low fuel till noon is not good so start having a healthy breakfast and get a good start for the day limit tv control your tv watching if you observe your tv watching habits you will realize that mostly it is waste of time but that is not the only problem all the programmes on tv show ads in every minutes so it breaks the continuity also most likely you have a tv with a remote controller and your fingers are always playing with it skipping channels and surfing back n forth this increases fidgetiness in your behaviour and it affects other aspects of your life too i have reduced tv watching by restricting myself to hours of tv per week and when i want to watch more i just rent a movie and watch it without a break limit internet use this is easy to say but difficult to do it depends on how much necessary it is for you to be online to get your work done most of the time either i am searching for articles for my research or looking for some solution to software bugs but now i have made it a habit to print the article of my interest leave my cubicle and read it somewhere where i don t have access to net but still many times i see myself using refresh button unnecessarily in the middle of some task i am still looking for efficient ways to reduce the effect of this distraction take time outs not just simple breaks but rewarding breaks i reward myself with sunshine by going out for a walk after getting a task done in the lab breaks are generally distracting unless they are for a purpose so give a purpose to every break even if it is just talking to a colleague or checking your emails you need to figure out what you need to do in your time out to get a fulfilling break read books reading definitely increases your attention span read what interests you but try to avoid short stories if i find some interesting novel book to read i find myself sitting for hours straight without any breaks even if the tv is on get close to nature this i accomplish by taking walks during my breaks or taking a weekend off for some outdoor activity like camping attention span is mostly affected by stress most of which comes from external sources when you are with nature you tend to go back into your natural state which is free from any kind of stress worries or and anxiety because that s the way you were born obviously you can see how the same activities can help in other aspects of your life we all already know these things but still don t follow them why because we don t assign a goal to them without a goal we cannot measure our development here i am targeting to increase the attention span you will notice the difference if you follow even some of the steps and it will motivate you further moreover you will observe positive effects in other aspects of your personal development Surveillance Hypoglycemia Dieting Insulin Second language acquisition Compiler optimization Extreme Programming Prostate cancer Procrastination Alexander Technique Capitalism Light pollution Atkins Nutritional Approach Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Breastfeeding Energy development Social psychology CPU design Poker jargon Milton H.
