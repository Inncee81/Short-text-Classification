why do i like watching women get abused hi all i have a really sad confession to make ive always watched porn i think alot of young men do and i never really saw anything wrong with it it started a few years ago with pictures then it moved up to videos to the point that i was spending a fair amount of cash on adult dvds but more recently ive been introduced to extreme sorts of porn where the woman would get savagely abused maybe till the point where she would start crying and i enjoy it i get off on it but i know its totally wrong my mind is corrupt i just don't know what to do anymore i know some of you are going to flame me or tell me to get help but how exactly can i just walk into a shrink and tell him about this what can he do for me apart from giving me a weird look i hate being like this its totally disgusting and foul please help me i want to change yes actually that is precisely what you do i e present yourself for therapy tell your therapist what your goals are for treatment there are professionals who specialize in the area of sexual addictions it is important that you get yourself into therapy you sound like the kind of person who would be horrified were his obsession with fictional abuse moved into the realm of reality it is a dangerous line that you are walking it has already progressed do not let it progress any more flip your insurance card over to the back there will be a phone number listed for behavioral health and substance abuse services or similar call the number and get the contact info for at least psychiatrists and psychologists in your area do not delay in the meantime and i am deadly serious about this destroy any currently owned porn videos if you are a member at any porn type sites go to the change your password part close your eyes put your hands on the keyboard and type in something completely random in otherwords make it impossible to continue using the site best of luck m Transsexuality Pornography Clinical depression Psychiatry Psychotherapy Borderline personality disorder Ex-gay Shaggy dog story Dissociative identity disorder Pornographic actor Autism Pornographic movie Drug abuse Traumatic incident reduction Child pornography Password Medicine Psychoanalysis Sexual dysfunction Milton H.
