any advice one helping my husband deal with my mood swings i have been diagnosed with bi polar disorder and my husband is a mental health nurse but constantly escalates rows this was years ago but my husband is becomming worse and worse at dealing with this i feel he mentally bullies me and mocks my illness aswell as threatening and being intimidating towords me just yesterday he has threatened to beat me up when he gets pissed he promptly went to the pub and came back with his friends and acted as if nothing has happened meanwhile he has reduced me to a state of extreme anxiety i am trying to protect my children ans he knows i wont call the police as we have had social service involvement in the past he jokes about it like 'see you at the conference' and becomes really spiteful don't get me wrong i argue right back but it is usually like a nervous energy as deep down i am petrified of this man but don't know if i can cope on my own any advice please i don't have family up here so it is not an option i had to reluctantly move up here as he ran away with one of the children as i could not bear for them to be parted and i have a frosty relationship with the in laws who think it's all my fault when i know it's only partly me the first sentence of your question is very revealing you ask how you can help your husband deal with your mood swings you then describe his casual cruelty towards you and by definition to his children who presumably witness the hostility between the two of you i hate to make judgements but this sounds like a destructive relationship and you sound understandably very unhappy and frightened my own view is that if life has become intolerable you need to change it change can be very frightening but you have only one life and you deserve some peace and happiness obviously women's aid are a very good organisation also your local council should be able to advise you about alternative housing the other big idea would be to ask your husband to leave surely to be on your own is preferable to this living hell all this conflict with your husband is almost certainly not your fault hold on to that belief good luck and i wish you well x Rape Transsexuality EastEnders Divorce Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Homophobia Asperger syndrome Recurring South Park characters Domestic violence Clinical depression Abortion debate Borderline personality disorder Meme Discordianism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Social rule Karen Horney Franz Boas Appeal Reparative therapy Stuttering Polyamory Pedophilia Sin City Torture Psychiatric hospital Narcissism Hikikomori Pitaten Adult attention-deficit disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Free will Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Schizophrenia Medicine Cult Ethics Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Boston Public Capital punishment 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Hip hop rivalries Dissociative identity disorder Daredevil Humphrey Bogart Combat stress reaction Marriage Friends Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Philosophy of language Moral Politics Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Knots Landing Shaggy dog story National Institutes of Health Psychotherapy Dead Like Me Alcoholics Anonymous Theodicy Russian joke Evil Psychosis Autism Insanity defense Babe Ruth Satanic ritual abuse Political correctness Transactional analysis Mark Latham Scientology beliefs and practices Post-traumatic stress disorder Traumatic incident reduction Germaine Greer Vernon Schillinger Traumatic brain injury Human David Hume Spanking Internet troll Hypoglycemia
