everyday anxiety intensified during exams there have been many changes for me in the last few years and the importance of doing well in school has increased i have been a constant worrier since i was very young i have talked to a couple of different therapists but they never seem to understand exactly how stressed i get during exams and conclude that deep breathing will solve it or they pass it off as a result of being over tired well i've tried the breathing exervises and it hasn't helped it gets so bad that once i panic i am incapable of thinking and even moving and i know this isn't good it doesn't seem to affect any other aspects of my life except my education at the moment but i fear it will spread i don't know what my next steps in conquering my anxiety should be because it is a serious problem that i want to gain control over i am not a huge advocate of medication for this does anyone have any suggestions or advice for me it is all welcomed greatly appreciated it's hard to believe a physician would blow you off like you describe you could use an anti anxiety agent such as xanax speak to your personal physician about it only an m d can prescribe that medication Anxiety Panic attack Prostate cancer Clinical depression Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Alexander Technique Traumatic brain injury Charles Darwin's illness Reparative therapy Asthma Psychotherapy Transsexuality Theory of conduct Procrastination Stuttering Borderline personality disorder Multiple sclerosis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Physician Psychiatry Medicine Psychoanalysis Drug addiction Alprazolam Post-traumatic stress disorder Cancer Fecal incontinence Stroke Physical therapy Goodness and value theory Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.
