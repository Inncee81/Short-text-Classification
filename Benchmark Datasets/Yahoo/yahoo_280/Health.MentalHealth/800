how to explain to my years old son divorce his father does not come at all to see the littel boy and he is always asking where is dad i answer he is travelling abroad his father was always spoilling him and giving him gifts and toys for no reason even if my son misbehave i really want to bring up a polit child and desipline my boy but i think he understands everything as now he refuses to sleep in his bed and became more attached to me and just frighten of me leaving him like his father did divorce is so hard on children but with the right supportive care he will get through it i wouldn't tell him his father is traveling abroad because at some point he will figure out that this isn't the truth you have to tell kids the truth but in the right way if he thinks his father is forever travelling abroad eventually he will figure out this isn't true and he'll resent you for having lied so i would sit him down and say something such as honey mommy loves you so much and all i want to do is protect you i haven't told you the truth about something only because i don't want to see you sad but now i think it's best that i tell you your dad is not really travelling he is around but for some reason we don't know about he won't come to see you i hope this changes soon and that he will come see you but for now he's staying away you have to assure him that you will never leave or abandon him he's got to feel secure with you and to really know your love and commitment he needs to start sleeping in his own bed but don't push it right away he will need a little time to adjust each day just assure him that he is safe with you and that you'll never leave tell him he can safely sleep in his own bed but that you'll always be close by if after a few weeks you think he's still insecure and frightened consider taking him to a child psychologist or therapist they can help you both cope with this stressful situation good luck to you About a Boy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Social rule The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Knots Landing Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Friends Attachment theory Fathers' rights Theory of conduct Theodicy Haven (TNG episode) Ben Johnson (athlete) Avenue Q Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Ex-gay Jon Secada Infantilism Narcissism Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Transactional analysis Clinical depression The Jeffersons (South Park) Kurt Cobain Kibbutz Plame affair Phaedo Angel One (TNG episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Justice (TNG episode) Grief The Jazz Singer Divorce Silent Night, Deadly Night One Tree Hill (TV series) Mystique (comics) Game show Incarnations of Immortality The Time Machine Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy 2004 Republican National Convention The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shawn Michaels Hikikomori John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Miss Saigon College Roomies from Hell!!!
