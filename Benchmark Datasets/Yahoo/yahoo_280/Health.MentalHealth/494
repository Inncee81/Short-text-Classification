how do you treat cure agoraphobia i have agoraphobia and it has really been rough for me i can't ever leave my house without having panic attacks sometimes i even get them while i am at my house it makes my life so miserable i can't even get a job or go out anywhere with my girlfriend because of my agoraphobia i am on prozac and lithium for it but it doesn't seem to help please give me some advise first let me say you are not alone i am a fellow sufferer and on the outside i look perfectly normal i go to work every day and have a full social life but my agoraphobia has eroded my life because i have so many restrictions i am afraid of highways busses subways elevators and going far from home at work i am afraid they will want me to travel and i don't know what to tell them that i'm afraid it sounds ridiculous to refuse to go a measly one exit on the highway i am coming to accept that my disorder is serious and while simple to treat the recovery is far from easy let me share some of my experiences with you maybe some of what i will help and maybe not i am no expert on agoraphobia and i am still suffering from it things that have helped me cognitive behavioral therapy cbt helps you look at your limiting thoughts and practice exposure to things you are afraid it helps having a calm and caring professional by my side online support at www panicsurvivor com these people have a fighters attitude when it comes to dealing with anxiety it is by far my favorite community that deals with anxiety turning to friends and loved ones my friends and family have been supportive although i let them enable me sometimes my friends have gone on exposures with me and told me to do it have a good cry when i cry and get the feelings out my anxiety lessens i used to cry before exposures which helped me release all the negative feelings working with a psychiatrist i admit medications have not worked for me yet but i keep trying research has found that a combination of medication and cbt works best however cbt alone is pretty effective too reading books by people who understand bourne's anxiety and phobia workbook is a classic also wish i were there is a memoir about agoraphobia what i liked about the memoir by allen shawn is that is realistic the man still has agoraphobia but he is coping with it better spirituality i am not religious but i have come to believe in a higher power to make sense of my senseless condition i don't think you have to be spiritual but it helps me to rely on something greater than myself self care i am working to eat right and exercise and get plenty of rest agoraphobia is stressful and takes its toll on my nerves when i take care of myself i send the message that i am important and worthy of love love tends to displace panic there is a lot more that i do but i don't want to bore you with all the details google agoraphobia panic attacks and anxiety there is a lot of good information out there good luck Borderline personality disorder Panic attack Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Bipolar disorder Stuttering Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychoanalysis Transsexuality Psychiatry Psychotherapy Autism Antidepressant Behavioral therapy Prostate cancer Sigmund Freud Traumatic incident reduction Social anxiety EastEnders Procrastination Mental illness Drug addiction Reparative therapy Dissociative identity disorder Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Monk (TV series) Schizophrenia Homophobia Traumatic brain injury Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Combat stress reaction Urinary incontinence Controversies in autism Alcoholics Anonymous DSM-IV Codes Hypoglycemia Stroke Asperger syndrome Ex-gay Narcissism Avoidant personality disorder Hikikomori Cult Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daredevil Diabetes mellitus Meditation Psychopharmacology Medicine Hearing impairment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Eating disorder Social rule Hypnosis Neuro-linguistic programming -phobia Adult attention-deficit disorder Alternative medicine Second language acquisition Tobacco smoking Empathy Psychiatric hospital Hypertension Stress (medicine) Narcolepsy Ethics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
