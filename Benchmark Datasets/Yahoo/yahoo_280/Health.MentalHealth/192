can someone give me a little info about endorphins i want to know how to make my body create them how hard do i have to work out i wrestle and do mma ufc fighting and the training is really hard how do i know if i ever experienced them before i also workout times a week and try to run thank you doctors are not sure if endorphin rush and strenuous activity are directly related they may be because endorphins are your body's natural painkillers when released into the bloodstream they have an opiate like effect the other leading theory for second wind during strenuous activity is that the body fluctuates with the amount of lactic acid to oxygen production that occurs during a workout many believe the second wind occurs when the body figures out the correct ratio that allows the body to work at maximum efficiency once it has done so you feel a shot of energy if you were to quickly burn off this extra energy you will be tired again leading many to believe that lactic acid production outran oxygen production once again in any case all of us have felt it when we workout for an extended period of time and suddenly feel refreshed Endorphin Exercise Cellular respiration Energy development Blood Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Wound healing phases Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Addiction Withdrawal Drug addiction Stomach cancer Nutrition Lactic acid Martial art Aluminium LSD Drowning Welding Clinical depression Explosive material Urinary incontinence Hydrogen Biochemistry Rocket fuel Hydrogen economy Solar variation Fuel injection Water (molecule) Enzyme Sulfuric acid Self-harm Hypoglycemia Ecology E85 Sadism and masochism Bodybuilding Tire Battery (electricity) Ionosphere Titanium Photosynthesis Opioid Antiretroviral drug Hydrogen sulfide Muscle Nuclear fusion Ozone depletion Chronic fatigue syndrome Milk Carburetor Skeletal muscle Circuit design Coal Gasoline Nuclear magnetic resonance Labour economics Diabetic ketoacidosis Helium Acne Alcohol fuel Prostate cancer Opium Ozone hole Iron Fermentation Red blood cell Aurora (astronomy) Renewable energy Causality Psoriasis Suicide methods Yawn Temperature Ozone layer Law of value Miller-Urey experiment Insulin Solar system Carbon dioxide sink Natural Selection (computer game) Productive and unproductive labour Wind turbine Post Polio syndrome Foodborne illness DNA repair Babe Ruth Tooth Atkins Nutritional Approach Folic acid Transformer Hydrogen vehicle Turbocharger Cocaine Eutrophication
