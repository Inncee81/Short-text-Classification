is having an anxiety attack n mania the same thing really dontcha think answers r fair enough yes i agree but i get them gether at the same time i guess there is some similarity because the person is kind of wired or hyperactive with either one i never really thought of it but i guess it's possible to have a panic attack during a manic episode people can have panic attacks as part of other mental disorders so it seems reasonable i can't remember reading anything that said it wasn't possible i know for certain it's possible to have panic during an anxious or depressed episode because i have experienced both i have had a few episodes where i was kind of giddy or euphoric and it seemed like mania but this never lasted more than a few hours so i don't think that qualifies as a true manic episode the dsm iv does indicate that either depression or mania can include psychotic features psychotic features can either be mood congruent or mood incongruent for example if someone was manic and the psychosis included themes of being god that would be mood congruent while themes of persecution would be mood incongruent because it's not consistent with the euphoric mood of mania i am not trying to say you have psychotic features but it just seems reasonable that someone could have mania with a panic attack if it's possible to have mania with mood incongruent psychotic features Psychosis Clinical depression Mania DSM-IV Codes Schizophrenia Mixed state (psychology) Haloperidol Panic attack Electroconvulsive therapy Transsexuality Borderline personality disorder Depression (mood) Antipsychotic Adult attention-deficit disorder Schizotypy Meditation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Anxiety Charles Darwin's illness Psychopharmacology Psychiatry Mood stabilizer Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Schizoaffective disorder Anorexia nervosa Controversies in autism Clomipramine Personality disorder Chlorpromazine Asperger syndrome Obsessive-compulsive disorder Dissociative identity disorder Agoraphobia Delusion Narcissism Hypomania Fluoxetine Paranoia Psychotherapy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Homophobia Autism Hyperactivity LSD Schizotypal personality disorder Mental illness John Cade Scientology beliefs and practices Insomnia Folie __ deux Amphetamine psychosis Joker (comics) Lorazepam Maprotiline Stroke Post-traumatic stress disorder Involuntary commitment Theory of conduct Postpartum depression Methamphetamine Venlafaxine Cocaine Diazepam Procrastination Cult Phobia Psychoanalysis Manic Street Preachers Sleep Project MKULTRA 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Cannabis (drug) Cognitive therapy Sleep disorder The Ashlee Simpson Show Affective spectrum Psychedelic mushroom Theodicy Paranoid personality disorder Avoidant personality disorder Alignment (role-playing games) Vigabatrin Anger management Therianthropy Social anxiety Telepathy Fluvoxamine Alcoholism Augustus De Morgan Wheel of Fortune Traumatic incident reduction Grammatical mood Summa Theologiae R.
