how can i become more outgoing i just started college this week and the first day was cool then after that i started to withdraw just like in hs i want to be more sociable and make more friends but i think i might be a little shy any tips on being more friendly and approachable yes joining clubs are good ways to meet friends also working at local clubs coffee shops bookstores places where college kids hang out at you will meet many people there and when you are around people that are having a good time don't be shy to tell a joke or try to act a little sillly even if you look like a nerd it's fine because in two seconds they will laugh at something else goodluck miss molly Social rule Friends George Burns The Ashlee Simpson Show Saved by the Bell Good Morning, Vietnam Undergrads Church and Wellesley FoxTrot Recess (TV series) Ocean's Twelve The Adventures of Pete & Pete Care Bears High school subcultures The Catcher in the Rye The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Nico Robin Garfield Witches (Discworld) Revenge of the Nerds The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Eric Bischoff Singlish Napoleon Dynamite Sharon Tate Okashina Okashi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Teen Girl Squad Humphrey Bogart Coffeehouse The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pontianak, Indonesia The Descendents Cleveland Browns Sid Vicious When Harry Met Sally...
