i been taking wellbutrin xl for months now when i first took it helped me stop binge eating and i was feeling good and energetic however for the past month i been eating like crazy like before im also takin lamictal for bipolar and add so i been feeling down and kinda depressed too could that mean i need to up my wellbutrin dose my doc mentioned to me last month that she will put me on a wellbutrin a day if i still feel depressed sp would that help because i heard from a friend who is on wellbutrin and bipolar aswell that it made her manic on a high dose i dont know what to do i dont trust my doc she just wants to keep highering my doses changin my meds and its all confusing to me and i feel like she just wants to drug me and not treat me are you seeing a therapist in addition to the psychiatrist if you are not that may be why you don't understand the way you are feeling perhaps there are things going on in your life causing you to be more depressed again perhaps it's the medication if you are not seeing a therapist ask your psychiatrist to refer you to someone this will help you greatly i know you say you don't trust your psychiatrist but continue to use the medication she is giving you and don't stop taking them express your concerns to her and see what she tells you if you still do not feel at ease with her ask her to refer you to someone else but again don't stop taking your meds and take steps towards seeing a therapist good luck with everything Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Lamotrigine Bupropion Psychotherapy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Maprotiline Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diazepam Folic acid Drug addiction Medicine Psychosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Reparative therapy Fluoxetine Transsexuality Doxepin Chlorpromazine Anorexia nervosa Multiple sclerosis Milton H.
