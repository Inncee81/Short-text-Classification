help for a burned out shy stay at home mom i am a mom that has three young children and i stay at home with my children i have always wanted to be at home with them i love and adore my children the problem is i am also very shy in that i have a really hard time initiating friendships have a phobia of calling people on the phone and it has become even harder to get out with my young children my spouse because of work is not available for extended periods of time i just feel like i am dragging all the time like i am trying to get my motors started everyday to get through one long stressful yet boring unexciting day i think i am just really really burned out i feel moody and irritable much of the day sometimes i feel like i am in a depression sometimes i just feel like i have no desire to do this i feel like i am doing the same thing over and over i have no contact with the adult world my kids of course are being kids but it would feel nice for someone to realize i am a person with needs too it sounds like you've lost yourself in motherhood don't worry it happens to all of us they don't call it the hardest job in the world for nothing you've already conquered the hard part which is realizing it you need to find ways to make your day less boring and more exciting you really have to force yourself to get out of the house with the kids start off with at least times a week take them to the park take them to play at mcdonald's take them to visit an old friend or a relative this will start to rid the groundhog day feelings mix it up a little go different places just make sure you are getting out while you are out strike up conversations with other mothers that you see open up tell them how you're feeling and i promise you will meet others that are either feeling the same way or used to feel the same way this will give you some much needed adult contact you'll be floored with how many mothers are going through the same exact thing as you don't be afraid to tell them how much you enjoy talking to them and give out your phone number also let them know how you are about calling you'll find someone who will call you once you make some friends with kids your outings will include meeting up with others having them over to your house or going to their house kids are a great way to make friends another thing you need to do is find some way to get some time alone no kids no husband hire a sitter or take the kids to a relatives house while your husband is at work even if it's just a few hours a week time alone will really help get rid of some stress and you'll be a better mother and wife for it don't use the time to be productive just veg out a little take a hike in the woods read a book stare off into space just be you also need to let your husband know how you are feeling you need his help it sounds like he's off working much of the time and i know exactly how that is let him know that when he is home you need family time with him and couple time too make dates go to places where you guys can reconnect as a couple find ways to look forward to the time you can spend together also when he is home let him have alone time with the kids as well so that you can escape a little remember that he needs down time too and arrange for him to have his alone time as well he will really appreciate it my last bit of advice is for you to rediscover your passion what is it that you loved doing before the kids came along are you doing it now do you have a hobby or interest that gets you going if you do start doing it again if you didn't have something before it's time to find out what that is now having something that you love doing is a great way to get you through the day you need something to look forward to kids go to bed at night don't spend that time cleaning or zoning out at the tv use that time to do your hobby that few hours of time before bed while kids are sleeping is like gold to me my passion is music after i put the kids to bed i light some candles pour a glass of wine sit at my piano with headphones on and write songs i love it i look forward to it and i can really tune into the kids knowing that i have this time after they get to sleep if you can do these things i promise you can turn around how you feel in a very short period of time if i had your number i'd call you and check in and make sure you were making changes hang in there and know that you can turn it around and be the most positive influence in your kids life you will also spark some lost passion in your marriage most of all you will start building your sense of self worth again you can do this good luck The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Avenue Q EastEnders Shaggy dog story Knots Landing About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind W.I.T.C.H.
