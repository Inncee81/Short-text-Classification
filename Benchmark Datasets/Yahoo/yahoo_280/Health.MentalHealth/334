how do anti psychotic meds cause weight gain i take wellbutrin i lose weight i take seroquel i gain weight do they affect metabolism or is it something else i just don't understand how a pill can affect body weight thanks for responding actually the truth is no one knows this is a very conterversial issue because none of the drug companies want to come out and say that the medications affect the metabolism but we also know that seroquel causes an increase in blood sugar even in skinny people this would imply that it is affecting the metabolism or the way that the body processes foods i take seroquel for mania and i try and keep up to date on these issues but if you ask all the psychiatrists they will tell you that it affects metabolism if you ask the drug companies they will tell you it doesn't Antipsychotic Clinical depression Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Nutrition Psychosis Atypical antipsychotic Dieting Obesity Chronic fatigue syndrome Chlorpromazine Folic acid Alzheimer's disease Binge eating disorder Schizophrenia Diabetes mellitus Sugar substitute Hypoglycemia Stroke Alcoholism Cannabis (drug) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Pharmaceutical company Glucokinase Methamphetamine Creatine Food and Drug Administration Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sleep Diabetic neuropathy Metabolic syndrome Gout Bupropion Post-traumatic stress disorder Aspirin Olanzapine Quetiapine Vomiting Prostate cancer Lamotrigine Clozapine Aspartame Blood alcohol content Insulin Doxepin Metabolism Osteoarthritis Multiple sclerosis Bodybuilding Medicine Anorexia nervosa Health issues and the effects of cannabis Weight training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Insulin resistance Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Drug overdose Low-carbohydrate diet Primidone Meditation Psoriasis Texas Medication Algorithm Project Lactose intolerance LSD Haloperidol Paracetamol Hyperglycemia Maprotiline Ayurveda Hypertension Tocopherol Urinary incontinence Antiretroviral drug Functional magnetic resonance imaging Migraine Alcoholic beverage Pharmacology First aid Hepatitis Growth hormone treatment Methylsulfonylmethane Fluoxetine Epilepsy Cancer Venlafaxine Eczema Addiction Protein Diarrhea Acne Senescence Traumatic brain injury Positron emission tomography Medical prescription Coma Mesothelioma
