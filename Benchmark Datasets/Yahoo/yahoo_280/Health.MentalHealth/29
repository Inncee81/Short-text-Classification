please help i tend to be over analytical about things but i've always been this way since i was little it just seems i do it more lately for instance on occasion someone might make a remark that on the surface seems pretty normal but i will later replay the situation in my head over and over until i find fault like hidden sarcasm or condescendence in what someone said i don't do this every day but i notice i do it usually around people that i don't trust sometimes i will over analyze something my boyfriend said and turn on him until it becomes a 'witch hunt' like he calls it i usually feel horrible afterward i know i could let these things go but i usually wind up obsessing over them why do i do this is there a bigger issue here should i seek help are these the symptoms of some psychological disorder like ocd after reading your question i realized i could've written it myself about my husband he is in retail and if someone says something like i want plastic not paper in a tone that isn't friendly to his ears he will obsess and replay over and over we also get in torrential fights sometimes he went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ocd they put him on lexapro and he is a new man you should try and make an appointment with a psychiatrist and see if you can get a diagnosis if you are ocd this could be a pivotal point in your life that could make your world easier and your relationships stronger good luck Obsessive-compulsive disorder Autism Asperger syndrome Anxiety Narcissism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Procrastination Bipolar disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Milton H.
