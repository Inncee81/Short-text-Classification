my therapist told me today that she invests more time in me than most of her clients then she was telling me about how typically they cant take my insurance be she decided to take me on as a client anyway thats when i said thats what i dont get then she said in the most roundabout way that it must have been fate this kinda all confuses me does anyone know what this all means and why she would bring that up i actually find this positive your therapist must really care about you and believe that she can help you perhaps she invests more time in you because her feelings for you want you to be well and succeed so what if something about you triggered her to be more personal and caring as long as she does not harm you there is no problem there are many styles of therapy she sounds very humanistic i had a therapist like this and i did the best work with her she cared incredibly about me and i knew it sometimes therapists find people they are more attracted to and it makes therapy more personal it's not a bad thing unless you feel it is harming you Psychotherapy Transsexuality Reparative therapy Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Psychoanalysis Dissociative identity disorder Gestalt therapy Massage Clinical depression Physical therapy Borderline personality disorder Ex-gay Medicine Traumatic incident reduction Avenue Q Psychiatry Milton H.
