i am afraid to go to sleep here i am resisting the urge to go to sleep why i don't know why i do this i'm serious and fyi i don't take medication a few years back and then farther back then that i'd have this dream where someone breaks in the house with a knife and me and my parents hide in this closet then the guy runs down the hall and i lock the door and we're all up on each other and when the guy is in the process of sticking the knife in the door i wake up i've had that dream a lot but nothing has ever gone that wrong to where i should be dreaming about someone trying to kill me when i was younger for me to be able to go to sleep my mom or dad would have to act like they were going to sleep in my room until i fell asleep and then they'd go to their room and sleep i'm oh and i've never watched a horror scary movie i've never done drugs alcohol ok no more youtube videos i have conflicting feelings towards one ex girlfriend and one girl i like who found out in the worst possible way i also have a lot of stress im and i'm absolutely terrified of the dark and going to sleep and someone trying to kill me in my sleep perhaps it's just an age thing but i also have a lot going on emotionally and i had a traumatic childhood so maybe that has something to do with my anxiety of sleeping if you don't leave a light on at night try it it's helped to make things better with me other than that there's this excercise you can do where you think of the colours of the rainbow and everything that is that colour for example you start with red and then think of everything possible that's red and then you go on to orange most of the time i drop off to sleep before i've got to blue so it must work sounds crazy lol but try it The Shining (film) The Amber Spyglass Sin City Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Out-of-body experience EastEnders Sleep Urinary incontinence Miss Saigon Friends Phoebe Buffay's songs Anxiety RuneScape quests Treehouse of Horror V Scream (film) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Cure The Subtle Knife The Ashlee Simpson Show Oh My Goddess!
