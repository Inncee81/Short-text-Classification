from which of his or her many investments should a retiree take distributions each month are there any rules of thumb criteria or mathematical approaches for determining from which of a number of investments in a retirement fund should monthly distributions be taken to optimize long term returns in general the portfolio could contain several investments in each of several investment types such as equities bonds and real estate if a distribution is taken from only one investment from which of the investments should the distribution be withdrawn in any given month you have two things to consider your investment balance and your taxes the older you get the more conservative you want your investments to be so it's a good idea to sell stocks rather than bonds once you're in retirement in particular sell stocks that have done well recently one idea perhaps you retired at with a split between stocks and bonds you could determine at the end of each year what you need to do to lower your stock percentage by that is after one year of retirement you'd sell stocks and buy bonds so that you're at a ratio and you'd sell the stock fund that did the best that year since your income is much reduced your tax bill for drawing interest from bonds is going to be low as well if you have enough to live on bonds are the way to go in retirement you might as well have your home paid off too since the tax break you get from your mortgage interest deduction isn't nearly as valuable when you are working full time since your tax rate is so low and you might not be itemizing your deductions anyway one last thing to consider if you plan to pass on wealth to your survivors stocks are nice to leave behind because your survivors don't have to pay taxes on the gains you made so if you bought a share at and it reaches by the time you die then your children can sell it at later in life and pay taxes on only of gain not on the full good luck doug Life insurance Annuity Social Security (United States) Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Mortgage Insurance 401(k) Taxation in the United States Flat tax Social Security debate (United States) Income trust Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Tax Keynesian economics Security (finance) Gross domestic product Finance PE ratio Personal finance Debt Economy of Russia Corporate finance Surplus value Warren Buffett Capital accumulation Property tax Stock Investment bank Municipal bond Islamic banking Primerica Financial Services Progressive tax Real estate bubble Capitalism Monopoly (game) Short selling Pension Cost of capital History of the United States (1918-1945) Reaganomics Hyperinflation Inflation Capital asset pricing model Tax cut Interest Intellectual property Economy of India Ra (board game) Student loan Stock market Derivative (finance) Financial services Collateralized debt obligation Institutional fund management Arbitrage Economy of Chile Income statement Eugene Fama Credit card Citigroup Productive and unproductive labour Individual Savings Account Variable universal life insurance Government debt Political economy Retirement plan Supply and demand Capital gains tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 MMORPG Berkshire Hathaway Financial markets Arthur Laffer Government National Mortgage Association Registered Retirement Savings Plan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Treasury security Modern portfolio theory Venture capital Economic rent Advertising Economics Subsidy Unemployment Food Stamp Program Black-Scholes Monetary policy Health insurance
