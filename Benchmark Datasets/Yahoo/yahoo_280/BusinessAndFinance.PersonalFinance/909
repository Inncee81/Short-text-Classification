what questions should i ask a financial planner to make sure he has my best interest in mind in the name of full disclosure i am a certified financial planner here is my input i agree that you should discuss how your planner will be compensated if you are paying for the planning service you should have the agreement in writing before the process begins if the planner is earning commissions it does not mean he can't put your interest first i always put my clients interest first because i want them to be delighted with how i help them then they keep coming back and they bring their freinds frequently in a formal planning arrangement you will pay a fee for the analysis of your situation and recommendations to help you achieve your goals the recommendations should not specifically recommend the planner's product the recommendation should say buy term insurance or invest in an international mutual fund they should not be buy my product the planner should have two roles one of the planner who you are paying to plan for you then it should be very clear when he switches roles to be a registered representative offering the specific products if he earns a commission on the sale it should be clearly understood you should have the freedom to buy anywhere if you pay for the planning if he is offering the planning service for free you should not balk at letting him earn some commissions if he is offering to split commissions as suggested by miss v run the other way fast this is called rebating is strictly prohibited and will cost him his licence and his cfp designation if he is caught if he will break the rules to make a sale what will he do to you when you are not in his office good luck i hope this helps Mutual fund Microeconomics Insurance Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Investment bank Corporate governance SCO-Linux controversies Contract Stock broker Gross domestic product Life insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Bretton Woods system Capitalism Cyprus dispute Bank Financial services Poker jargon Security (finance) Intellectual property Mediation Social Security debate (United States) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Hedge fund Derivative (finance) Mortgage Public transport Japan-United States relations Euro Short selling Airline Privatization Stock Air New Zealand Financial analyst Student loan Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Capital accumulation Publicly funded medicine Bond Economy of Russia First-sale doctrine Patent Economy of the Soviet Union Software engineering Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Social Security (United States) GNU General Public License Value added tax East Germany Certified Financial Planner Marshall Plan Information Services Procurement Library Leasing Strategic planning Common Fisheries Policy Toronto-Dominion Bank Advertising Pharmaceutical company Supply and demand Education in the People's Republic of China Tax Economy of India Enron Corporation Theory of the firm Bay Area Rapid Transit Electronic commerce Anarchism and capitalism Patent application Price discrimination United Airlines Externality 401(k) Law of value Lawyer ISO 9000 Economic relations of Japan Coalition Provisional Authority Windows XP Strategic management Eliot Spitzer Economic rent FairTax Government of India Act 1935 Divorce
