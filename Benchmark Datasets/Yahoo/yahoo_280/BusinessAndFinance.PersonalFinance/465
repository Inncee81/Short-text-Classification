k vs b i'm hopefully going to be working at a university within a couple of years can i roll over my k into a b or should i just roll it over into an ira account some companies allow you to rollover old k's into your new b i'd check the employee handbook or the plan document for your new b if that is something you would want to do personally i would look into rolling the k into an outside ira if you use the b through work at the university you will have limited fund choices to use if you were to roll it to an ira you could pick any fund family or use a fee based account and select the best funds that are out there in each asset class to maximize portfolio performance especially if your university uses tiaa cref as the only option they have good funds but only have funds in bonds large cap and international classes you will be missing out on the opportunities in mid and small cap good luck and i hope this was helpful enoriverbend those funds you directed us to were the no load funds you can purchase at tiaa cref directly not in a b plan with a university i personally don't have a tiaa cref account but deal with clients who do you are correct about the real estate option but i have yet to see a university plan that offered a mid or small cap option in a tiaa cref account i didn't mention the real estate due to the fact that you really don't want too much real estate in a portfolio at this point as it is currently down this year and still going down Mutual fund Individual Retirement Account Institutional fund management 401(k) Variable universal life insurance Trust (Law) USA Tax Financial services Annuity Microeconomics Bank fraud Wells Fargo Corporate finance Life insurance Bank Mortgage Retirement plan Hedge fund Stock market Money supply Stock Corporate governance Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Citigroup Taxation in the United States Primerica Financial Services Fuzion Food Stamp Program Lawyer Internet fraud Poker jargon Temasek Holdings Eugene Fama Credit card Federal National Mortgage Association Finance Productive and unproductive labour Bond Mergers and acquisitions Toronto-Dominion Bank Microcredit Notary public Economy of Kuwait Modern portfolio theory Venture capital Open access Advance fee fraud Real estate Student loan Google Pension Mac OS X National Kidney Foundation Singapore FairTax Surveillance Capital accumulation Morgan Stanley Mediation Derivative (finance) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wal-Mart Closed-end fund Health insurance Ford Explorer Florida Lottery Michael Milken Active management LiveJournal Scholarship Short selling Warren Buffett No Child Left Behind Act Financial audit Call option Option Economy of Chile Software testing Graduate school TIAA-CREF Administration Enron Corporation AmigaOS Real estate developer Privatization Arbitrage BlackRock Valuation (finance) Normal distribution Plame affair Portfolio Public transport Trust company Contract Economic inequality Monetary policy Craps Property tax
