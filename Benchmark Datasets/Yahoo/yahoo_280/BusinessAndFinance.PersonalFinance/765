how can i recover excessive fees charged by my bank i recently was charged a very excessive fee from wells fargo for transferring money from my savings to my checking account equaling when i asked the banker in the branch they stated that every transfer from my savings to my checking account after the first times every month will cost me each they also stated that this was a law i find it hard to believe that they are using my money to make more money for themselves via investments and then when i go to use my free online banking they rape me on fees i tried to look up the law with no luck how can i present my case to the bank so i can get these b s fee's refunded to me i am currently a college student and don't have he time or money to waste on this kind of b s from my bank i believe the law allows you six pre authorized transfers per statement period after that the bank is allowed to charge and if one persists in making excessive withdrawals they can and probably will close the account the three withdrawal rule applies to checks from a money market account if you have a money market account and have written three checks from your money market account during the statement period and transferred money more than three times from there the bank would be within its rights to do what it has done it seems to me that you need to ask more questions of the bank get them to explain the law to you and don't stop until they give you a satisfactory explanation Bank Credit card Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Advance fee fraud Annuity Life insurance Bank fraud Hyperinflation Certificate of deposit Inflation Octopus card Student loan Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Automatic teller machine Corporation Financial services SCO-Linux controversies Short selling Tax Yield curve Usury Primerica Financial Services CPU cache Poker jargon Citigroup Money supply Say's law National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bank of America Enron Corporation Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Publicly funded medicine Privatization Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Security (finance) Theory of conduct America Online EFTPOS Stock Democracy Microeconomics Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Debit card Social Security (United States) Wells Fargo Federal Reserve Economy of Russia Gold standard Copyleft Euro MMORPG Model (economics) Social Security debate (United States) Child support FairTax Financial audit Trust (Law) USA PE ratio RuneScape cheats SmartRider Contract Appeal Money Labor theory of value Public good United States Postal Service Credit card fraud Paintball Food and Drug Administration American Express United States dollar Law of value PayPal Islamic banking Economy of Pakistan Education in the People's Republic of China Monopoly (game) Annexation Monarchy in Canada Bond Article One of the United States Constitution Identity theft Variable universal life insurance American individualist anarchism Corporate finance James Hanratty Leasing Economics Miranda warning Capital accumulation
