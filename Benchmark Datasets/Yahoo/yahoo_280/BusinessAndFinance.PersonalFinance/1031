when you see money on the cash dispenser on an atm machine is it illegal to take it esp when you haven't even inserted your card if the money has been left there by mistake and the atm is in a store then give that money to the clerk and tell him her what happened that you found it if the atm is in the back or side of a bank then give that money to the manager or receptionist and tell them what happened always remember that there are cameras around and if you take the money you will be seen on camera and there's a strong chance you could be charged with theft so you need to get that somebody elses money out of your hands asap if you take it to the cashier or teller then that is shown on camera as well and you are in essence protecting that person's money by doing the right thing Automatic teller machine EFTPOS Password Postage stamp Bank fraud Bank Surveillance Wal-Mart Debit card Ocean's Twelve Slot machine MetroCard Smart card Credit card fraud Cheque Bank of China (Hong Kong) Filling station Vending machine Magic (illusion) Blackjack Identity theft Money laundering Electronic money Credit card Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Aldi Money Privacy 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bulk vending Ulster Bank Floppy disk Octopus card Windows XP Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Popular, Inc Grand Theft Auto III Expressnet Wheel of Fortune Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Citigroup Poker jargon Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Euro Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Gambling Interac Security guard Cybercrime Automatic number plate recognition Division of labour Tax MTR Charles Ponzi EastEnders Internet fraud Bank of the Philippine Islands Money supply American individualist anarchism South Korean won Mail fraud Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Winning Streak Oral sex Clerks.
