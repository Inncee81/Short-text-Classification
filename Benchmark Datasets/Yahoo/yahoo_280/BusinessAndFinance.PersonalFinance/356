can anyone suggest a good reputable debt consolidation company my fiance and i live in ohio and i'm trying to help him find a good debt consolidation company he's gotten some suggestions from a person he works with but the place he talked about sounded a little less then acceptable cccs was awesome my wife used them before we were married they will deal with the credit card companies and other debtors if someone is bugging you about late payments or anything call them and they will take care of them it is a non profit organization also there is a monthly fee that does towards their operating fees and other things to keep them running but they were very helpful hope this helps Credit card Debt consolidation Donald Trump Mortgage Islamic banking Bank Credit repair Henry H.
