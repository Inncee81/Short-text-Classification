i have received at least a dozen or more emails from different countries stating that i won money in their lotteries i won't hold my breath waiting to receive any of this money but is there some way of finding out if any of them are for real or not at this point in time i'm supposed to be worth between three to four billion dollars whether it is american dollars or australian dollars i'm not sure of it would be oh so nice if even some small portion was for real but like i said i'm not holding my breath waiting it just seems like such a cruel trick to play on people they are not i don't know the exact angle of the scam besides obtaining all your personal id infor that can be sold and used to flood you with even more scam junk and just spam but the ones that really scare me are the ones that state that you cannot accept any other prizes while claiming theirs legally what does that mean you win the million lotto and they can legally take it because your in the process of pursuing a prize from them who knows if they have some xxx million email addresses like telemarketer scams and some fool bites and then legally wins money there are others even more illegal sounding and much more emotionally morally dead sounding they claim they have some dead persons money and you have the same surname and they want you to claim it and split it with them jail time i was first flooded with the lottery scams then the inheritance scams and now its back to lotteries i believe it all started when i answered an add for completing surveys on line and getting paid for it if it sounds too good to be true then it probably isn't set up your spam program yahoo will automatically send them all to your bulk folder and empty it every month if your really bored read them sometime just don't answer them Advance fee fraud Confidence trick Internet fraud Make money fast E-mail spam Lottery Phishing Gmail E-mail Stopping e-mail abuse Microeconomics Wheel of Fortune RuneScape cheats National Lottery Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
