should i max out my k and decrease payments my line of credit last year i only put into my k what my employer would match the rest went to debt but if my retirement funds are tax free i'm putting in pre tax money more than i can put into debt which is post tax dollars at year's end is the the savings greater than the on my line of credit i can put away k into my retirment plan i have k in debt is there a ratio of how much should go into each area i'm sorry but the information you have gotten so far here is really innacurate i can break down the numbers for you and make it very simple numbers are simple and they don't lie couple of things first of all i am a mortgage planner with chase though i am well trained i am not a financial planner or a cpa so please double check with a licensed expert to verify what i say here feel free to call me at so i can get more information and deliver an actual proposal to you or visit caseycasperson com or email me at casey x casperson chase com based off of what you have given here you have in debt at you mentioned that it's a line of credit so i'm going to assume that it's a home equity line of credit if this is the case you more than likely get a tax benefit from the interest you pay on it the interest payments on this line come out to be a year but if you're in a tax bracket based off of what you mentioned above you'll actuall get of that back which means your effective rate of interest is though the real estate market has been a roller coaster recently the average home increases by in value every year which means that your home is outracing the effective interest rate that you are paying on your house if you live in a house it should grow on average by by next year and the following while you only paid on that line of credit these facts alone are a good reason not to payoff your line of credit but let's play with some numbers here so we can see if the previous answers are right when it comes to paying debt before saving money you said that you have a year to put into retirement as you mentioned this is higher than what you could use to pay down debt if it's okay with you most people see about taken out of their checks so i'm going to use a more conservative number if you use the to pay down debt it has to be taxed first you now have a year to pay down your credit line assuming that you are making your minimum payment already we'll apply the full toward principal it would take years to pay the account in full you would pay in interest but would get back on taxes unfortunately you will have paid in income taxes on the money you used to payoff your loan so your total out of pocket expense would be about you would free up about a month that you were paying over the year period to begin applying towards your k now what if you took that a year before you taxing it and invested in your k and continued to make the minimum payment on your line of credit over the year period first of all you'd have invested in your k in years the average k creates annually so in five years your with interest would be you would have paid in interest on your heloc but after taxes it would have been your total cost would be here's what we have so far at the end of five years you have in a k growing at but still owe at on the other hand you could have in your k but owe in debt let's look at what happens five years after this in your first scenario you just freed up a month since you don't have to pay on that loan anymore let's say you apply all of that to your k that's you can begin to contribute to your k in years that balance with interest would be total cost would be the you paid to get there the second scenario still requires for you to make your minimum payment on your credit line so you can only apply a year for the next years to your k in years you'd pay out and your balance in your k would grow from to your net worth would be once you subtract the you still owe on the credit line compare this scenario with the scenario where you payoff your debt years from now if you paid off your loan you'd have a net worth of vs keeping the loan outstanding and be worth that's a difference why is this possible because you have been reinvesting tax free money for years longer than the other scenario and that prexisting balance of was able to grow at for another years i hope this makes sense you
