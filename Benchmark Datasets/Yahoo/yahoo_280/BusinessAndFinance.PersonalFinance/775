debt settlement my spouse is being held liable for my debt since i filed bankruptcy and he was a card holder they won't accept payments and want the full balance we do not have this i know they will get a small selling to a credit collector etc what is a reasonable discount to ask in a debt settlement they've already wrote this off as a bad debt due to my bankruptcy and it was not my spouses account is asking for off discount acceptable we could probably get a loan for but there is no way we could get one for the full balance the debt doesn't show up on his credit report it shows up only on mine as an individual account as he only joined my card years after i had it they are requesting full balance and won't take payments if they have written off as bad debt already then it is almost useless to try to settle but if you do start at if the ask for settle at i would not settle for more than and keep in mind that a settlement is not a good reflection on your credit report Credit card Deflation (economics) Debt Mortgage Fiat money Student loan Gold standard Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit score Bank Social Security (United States) Money Futures contract Economy of Russia Annuity Mutual fund Financial services Bank fraud Debt consolidation Octopus card Interest Finance Personal finance Government debt U.S. public debt Monetary policy Credit repair Credit history Corporate finance The South Sea Company Small business Fractional-reserve banking Bretton Woods system Article One of the United States Constitution Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Mergers and acquisitions Bankruptcy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus MCI Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Filling station Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Security (finance) Islamic banking Treasury security Economy of the United States Collateralized debt obligation Stock Primerica Financial Services Auto insurance Debt levels and flows Schabir Shaik Trial Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Marriage Microeconomics EFTPOS Economy of Pakistan Euro Derivative (finance) Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy TLC Credit card fraud Intellectual property Citigroup Credit risk Federal National Mortgage Association Identity theft Money supply Divorce Tax 401(k) Credit derivative Credit default swap Frequent flyer program Digital rights management Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Bankruptcy in the United States Double-entry book-keeping Deficit spending Scrip MetroCard Tom DeLay Unit of account Wells Fargo Municipal bond Child support Law of value Refinancing Ames Department Stores Cheque Pension America West Airlines Great Depression Internet fraud Wal-Mart
