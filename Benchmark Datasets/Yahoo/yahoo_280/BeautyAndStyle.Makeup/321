i'm a big supporter of girls and women feeling confident in themselves on the inside and outside however i've worn makeup since i was my mom bought me clear mascara and lip gloss because she didn't want me to be overly made up but she knew i really wanted to wear makeup i'm and still have breakouts which leave red marks and i'm very ashamed of my appearance without makeup i'll be going to a dermatologist finally at the end of this month i never leave the house without at least cover up and mascara i have blonde eyelashes and feel that i look plain without mascara when i have a daughter i would like to convey the message to her that she should be confident in her looks and intelligence but how can i do that when i'm not even confident in my own looks aside from that i like wearing makeup i just like playing with different colors and mixing things up i like enhancing my blue eyes i always look natural and it always just enhances my features but do you think it's hypocritical to wear makeup a lot except at home and try to get my daughter to be confident in herself will she learn to be natural and feel beautiful with a mother like me who hates being seen without doing her makeup i don't think it's hypocritical all moms want the best for their daughters but just be aware that if she watches you put makeup on as all little girls do she is going to want to experiment with it too i think that just because you want to put your best face forward does not mean you are going out with cake makeup on your face you sound like you cover up the little flaws we all have yet still manage to look natural when your daughter is young teach her that less is more clear or soft black or brown mascara is great for tweens add a little pop of color with the fun lip gloss i am and still love the bonnie bell lip smakers line of lip glosses what ever you do don't start your daughter out on foundation their young skin does not need to be smothered in goop a light face powder compact will be just fine it helps keep the oily skin of teen age years at bay but still lets her youthful glow shine through confidence in yourself is much more than skin deep i think you sound confidant and should worry about wearing makeup i am a girly girl to my very core and i love to wear make up daily its just a litte powder eye liner and mascara but when i can glam it up i do with or without make up i know i am the best me i can be thats all you need to instil in your daughter and regardless or not if you wear makeup or she wears makeup things we be a ok best of luck to you ps i hope the deramtoligist helps you i have had friends who have had amazing luck with theirs so keep the faith Cosmetics Marilyn Monroe The Emancipation of Mimi Blood on the Tracks Dragon Booster Hilary Duff Pitaten Kodocha Humphrey Bogart The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Garfield The Ashlee Simpson Show Sharon Tate The Fairly OddParents Friends AFI 100 Years series Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Side Characters (Xenosaga) Social rule EastEnders Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blonde on Blonde Book of Isaiah Milton H.
