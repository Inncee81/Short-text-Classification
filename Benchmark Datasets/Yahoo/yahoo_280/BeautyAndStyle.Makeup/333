when should u use powder is powder like foundation i only have like blemishes one on each cheek and i was wondering would i use concealer to smooth it out or powder oh do u think i can use like blush in my skin tone to cover up the blemish concealer is best but sometimes it cakes and makes the blemish look even more obvious powder is used to set your makeup or to soak up oil i would try just putting concealer on my finger and tapping it into the blemish lightly Cosmetics 613 mitzvot Tofu David Sylvian Handloading Blushing Cake Physical characteristics of the Buddha Dairy Leather Internal ballistics Physical attractiveness Plastic Shotgun Bread Violin Diamond clarity Dim sum Dosa Cantonese cuisine Fire extinguisher Tattoo Guqin Date Palm Coin magic Idli Cookie Timpani Hand grenade Embalming Bass guitar Leaf Elephant The Price Is Right Transformer Drill bit Beer English longbow Korban Knife Flour Bassoon Rosin Massage Krag-J__rgensen Gunpowder Baking powder Potato pancakes Political decoy Mango Tillandsia Manicure Combine (Half-Life 2) Curry Mattress Brewery Chocolate Risotto Plaster Ammunition Elizabeth Arden Western concert flute Softball Jewish cuisine Teapot Goblet drum Cartridge (firearms) Feather Cocaine The Haunted Mansion Doughnut Intersex surgery Coffee South Park Mooncake Psoriasis Rose Agar plate Fruitcake Smokeless powder Roswell UFO incident Hemp Characters of Naruto Tactile signing Caffeine Cinnamon Rice Methamphetamine Bengali cuisine Mochi Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Euphemism Women in Islam Tobacco Hyuga Hinata Maple syrup Black Sabbath Erogenous zone Cover girl Tanning
