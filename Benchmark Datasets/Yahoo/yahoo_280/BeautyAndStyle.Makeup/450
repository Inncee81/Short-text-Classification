make up question what should i do i have a lot of questions should black people where bronzers or blushes if i wear studio fix liquid and studio fix powder will it be too heavy yeah if you wear both studio fix liquid and powder it'll be way too much the liquid already has a high coverage and the fix powder has foundation built into it it's better to pick one or the other if you pick the foundation just use a nice translucent powder to set it and yeah black people can totally pull off blush and bronzers in fact black people are the only people who can litterally pull of any colour of the spectrum depending on your skintone i'd prolly just go with the blush because you have a better chance of it standing out more against your skin colour if you're more on the lighter side you can use both blush for colour and bronzer for contouring or creating a sunkissed look Cosmetics Pottery Smokeless powder Pigment Titanium Color Handloading Nail (anatomy) Japanese tea ceremony Brewery Equine conformation Casting Transformer Infrared spectroscopy Technetium Human skin color Magical objects in Harry Potter Uranium Monetary policy Extreme Programming Fecal incontinence Diatomaceous earth Bulk vending Gramophone record Discworld Textile manufacturing Firearm Plastic bag Sulfur Tofu Sewage treatment Drill bit Mattress Vitreous enamel Internal ballistics She Loves You Geology of the Moon Diving suit Mass spectrometry Sailing Gunpowder Dragon Booster Social rule Supernova Skin Powder metallurgy Phase (matter) Hydrogen Methamphetamine Explosive material Rifle Def Leppard Kimono Magnesium Tattoo Plastic Little Britain Eye Physical attractiveness Cracking (chemistry) Milk The Legend of Zelda series enemies Quark-gluon plasma Tone (linguistics) Dairy Ren and Stimpy Taxicab Rocket fuel Temperature Winning Streak Nuclear magnetic resonance Blushing Knife Bass guitar Ammonia Snooker Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Arado Ar 80 Lebesgue integration White (people) John Lennon Color theory Colours, standards and guidons Horse Sodium Wine Circuit design Stereoscopy Ceramics Carbine Cartridge (firearms) View camera Kool-Aid All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku Mandelbrot set Tea Species Order of the Garter Lighting
