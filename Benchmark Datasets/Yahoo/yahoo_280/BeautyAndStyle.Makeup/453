revlon lips stain i have three of the revlon lips stains everytime i put them on the color is great everywhere except the inner part of my mouth it's like it gathers more color and ultimately its darker then anywhere else extremly more colored then the other parts of my lip as if it just all bled all to the inner part so i was wondering if anyone else had this problem with the lip stain and if you did please tell me how to fix it i love these lips stains but they just look terrible because of this also on an extra note i have tryed putting lip balm on before and after i used the lip stain thanks where your lips are wet the stain won't stay it's only like that near your mouth probably because of your tongue so wipe your lips with a papertowel before you put it on and make sure you get your inner lip as well Upholstery Oral sex Lip balm Bong Book of Isaiah Tooth enamel Cosmetics Mouthpiece Saxophone Embouchure Oral cancer Cleft Fugu Staining (biology) Bassoon Place of articulation Stained glass Harmonica Eastern Orthodox Church 1957 World Series The 64,000 Dollar Question Vowel Lipstick Voiceless palatal-velar fricative The Human Stain Trumpet Pyramus and Thisbe Stuttering Histology Sakura Wars Clarinet Hangul KaBlam!
