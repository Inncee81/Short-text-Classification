does anyone know what is up with teenage girls using a black sharpie marker for eyeliner i found out that my teenage daughter was using a sharpie marker instead of eyeliner i was like what the hell isn't that dangerous i was wondering what the blackish purple marks were on all the wash clothes that wouldn't come out then i noticed a black sharpie in the bath room with her make up needless to say she doesn't use the marker any more anyone else heard of this or any other bizarre things that teenagers are doing for all the teenage girls please don't use a sharpie for eye liner it could be very dangerous to your eyes check out ingredient make sure inks in those markers don't have bad stuff like lead or something like that because markers aren't meant to be applied to people's skin manufacturers probably aren't required to make it safe for that kind of use just make sure there isn't anything in that marker that can hurt them or it's not such bad idea to have them stop doing that pretty strange thing to do anyways Paintball Public Eye Sharpie (marker) Milton H.
