can i wear makeup within hrs of eye perm hi i was wondering if its possible where i eyemakeup such as eyeliner and mascara after my eye perm the eyelashes weren't as long and dark as i hoped i want to avoid anything like an allergic reaction thankyou if eyelash perms are anything like real perms i would avoid wearing eye makeup for hours especially mascara i would mostly avoid getting the eyelashes wet so if you cleanse be careful to avoid getting the eye area wet just wipe the area with a face towel taking care about the lashes i don't know if you'll get an allergic reaction but if you get them wet or put anything on them the perm may fall out and your lashes might go back to how they were if you really must wear eye makeup just stick to a bit of eye shadow which is easier to remove like i said i don't really know for sure that putting makeup on the eye area will affect you or the perm but it'd probably be best to take precautions if you're not sure hope this helps Tattoo Mascara Allergy Social rule Empire Burlesque Urinary incontinence Sauna Professional wrestling match types Eye contact Hay fever Diving Menstrual cup Diaper Common cold The Amber Spyglass Campfire Body piercing Drawing Fancy rat Upholstery Eczema Psoriasis Blepharitis Boom Town (Doctor Who) Eye Haircut Japanese tea ceremony Peter Gabriel Textile manufacturing Scabies Insulin Dialysis Surveillance Bat Lash Physical characteristics of the Buddha Conjunctivitis Hamster The Legend of Zelda series races Salad Fingers The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sento Japanese toilet Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Internal ballistics Crohn's disease Tire Ravenloft domains Luke Skywalker A Clockwork Orange Archery Customs and etiquette of Japan Pitaten Breastfeeding Shampoo Organic peroxide Manicure Conspiracy (TNG episode) Characters in the Smurfs Hyperthermia Mattress Sanitary towel Herpes simplex virus Tooth Fecal incontinence Drowning M16 (rifle) Waking the Dragons 2000 Australian Grand Prix Toilet paper Jackass: The Movie Gay bathhouse Aerial (dance move) Acne Blood transfusion Ayrton Senna Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Anal sex Delta Goodrem John F.
