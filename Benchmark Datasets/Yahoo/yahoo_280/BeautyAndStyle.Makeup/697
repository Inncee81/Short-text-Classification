how do i make my eyebrows look better my friend tweezed my eyebrows and she did it way too much now i have to color in my eyebrows but i have no clue how to do that help your brows shape your face and add a lot of drama to your eyes they can either make you look old and harsh or soft and young since they frame your shape and type of eyes they can also make your eyes look smaller or larger today instead of thickening them with eyebrow pencil you can fill them with color subtly and attractively here are various beautiful tips to make your eye brows look more beautiful that you can't even imagine first select brow filler that's a couple of shades lighter than your hair if your brows are freshly plucked so much the better here the trick is to apply a natural eyebrow shape with the help of a hard stiff short brush and colorations instead of pencils though pencils are good to use they aren't good for novices since they require a lot of practice however use colorations to make a few light feathery strokes on the thicker part of your brows with a sharp eyebrow pencil and then add color to the thinner parts of your brows next if you have thin brows use a brow powder with the help of a flat angled brow brush color over the length of the brow taking in its natural shape first apply color to the outer edges of the brow and move in closer to the nose once you have finished pencilling your brows powder them very lightly against the direction of the hair for a softer more natural look then brush upwards in the direction of the forehead with two fingers to take off any excess powder and keep the hair in its natural position for this you can use an eyebrow brush too use a clean mascara brush to neaten up your brows if loose hairs are out of place set them in place and blend color for a more natural look use wax based brow powder brow gel or alcohol free hair gel to keep your brows in place all day if you want to make your eyes appear larger and more open don't let your brows appear too low near your eyes instead maintain enough space between your eyes and eyebrows by plucking clean from below the brows pluck just enough so that they don't end up looking too thin and if you have bushy eyebrows trim the tops to keep them short and of medium thickness do you have small eyes if yes do not wear your eyebrows thick or they will make your eyes look smaller on the other hand if your brows are thinner they will make your eyes look larger and it your eyes are close set you can create an illusion of space between your brows to give your eyes an open look for a natural look and color choose a color that is closest to that of your eyebrow and fill in the gaps this will give you a well groomed brow if you can't decide on the right shade go in for a shade lighter than your brow so with the right method that suits your eyebrows you can give yourself a natural look to such an extent that no one will know you've touched up your brows Violin Knife Leaf Gas metal arc welding Drill bit Cosmetics Upholstery Mattress Brush Harp Paint Wood Hair Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Physical attractiveness Equine conformation Snowboard Glass Terminal ballistics Tofu Eye Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Gesture Cross-country skiing Stereoscopy Skateboarding trick Brewery Physical characteristics of the Buddha Double bass Casting Typewriter Dog Pencil Tank Salute Mouse (computing) Solar cell Bass guitar Diamond Traditional animation Welding Pottery Guinea pig Dragon Booster Electrophysiology Three Stooges Textile manufacturing terminology Stairway Wood carving Stage lighting Leather Shaving Ski Hangul Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Manicure Rayleigh scattering Impressionism Sundial Brazing Piano Saw Keeshond Dairy Seismic retrofit Clarinet Shell (projectile) Baldness Diamond cut Handloading View camera Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Glossary of climbing terms Gramophone record Autostereogram Social rule Anchor Floppy disk Pastel Soldering Aluminium Tobacco Katana Billiards Cubic zirconia The Legend of Zelda series enemies Piet Mondrian Professional wrestling throws Badminton Guitar
