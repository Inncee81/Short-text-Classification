where do you apply blush i was watching the tyra banks show and they said it goes in the apples of your cheeks not the hollows but if you put it in the apple of your cheek it doesn't look right and makes it look like you put too much make up and if you put it on the hollows it kinda creates the shape of your cheek bones and it looks more right so what is it supposed to be i use a gel blush that i blend onto the apples of my cheeks it sinks into my skin and stains my cheeks slightly then fades nicely to a natural blushy glow so i dont have to worry about those harsh lines of blush you get when you use a powder blush or the meltyness of a cream blush Cosmetics Gelatin Upholstery Wine Scar Blushing Staining (biology) Physical attractiveness Characters of Naruto Pottery Terminal ballistics Fluorescent lamp Elizabeth Arden Mango Psoriasis Bong Body piercing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyuga Hinata Rosacea Little Britain Tyra Banks Minor Discworld concepts Stage lighting Strap-on dildo Tea Discworld gods Head Plastic Firefighter Father's Day (Doctor Who) Olduwan German grammar Breastfeeding Hand grenade Cuisine of the Philippines Mammee apple Shaggy dog story Just Shoot Me!
