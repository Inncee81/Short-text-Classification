demonoid invite code could some one please send me one at scubasteveg comcast net invitations are hard to come by because demonoid holds its members responsible for those they invite if you download a bunch of stuff without seeding not only would you lose your membership but the person who invited you would lose theirs so people are very wary about those they give an invitation code too certainly isn't very likely to happen to a complete stranger who asks for one on some group or forum it does seem like registrations are never open but keep going there you might get lucky or have a little patience because the torrents first posted on demonoid start showing up on the other torrent sites just a few days later Internet forum World Economic Forum Something Awful Fark.com Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bj__rk Social rule B3ta Jeopardy!
