how do you upload on deviantart i wantt to upload a blinking eye i made onto deviantart but whenever i try it says a preview image is required then i get all confused after that please help u just need a smaller size gif which u can use as the preview it will be smaller in size but animated alternately u can use a jpg still image it can be of same resolution but it will not be animated so make ur choice if u created the animated eye then in most cases the software u used will have an option to resize the whole animated image or u can use a software to take a screenshot of the image which u can use as the preview when sum clicks on download on ur deviation the full size gif will be downloaded on their pc hope this helps GIF Web page QuickTime PNG Xbox Image file formats Wallpaper group DeviantART Windows Vista PlayStation Portable Stereoscopy Macromedia Flash Opera (web browser) Warez Screenshot Uploading and downloading HTML element Mozilla Firefox BitTorrent Digital photography Minesweeper (computer game) Goatse.cx Pixel art IPod File sharing WindowBlinds Debian Machinima Furcadia Xbox 360 Pixel Mouse (computing) ASCII art Atari 8-bit family Bally Astrocade Mind transfer Compunet Kazaa Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Amstrad CPC Ebook File format Wikimedia Commons IPhoto Halo: Combat Evolved Nintendo GameCube PC Engine MAME Comparison of web browsers PlayStation 2 JPEG 2000 Bad Religion Lemmings (computer game) Computer animation Vectrex Personal computer game Prank flash Commodore 64 Hash table Aberration in optical systems Apostrophe (mark) Automator (software) Eye Blue screen of death Sega Saturn President of the United States OpenBSD Windows XP Download.com AmigaOS Object Desktop USB flash drive Microsoft Paint Short-time Fourier transform Bulletin board system Mac OS X v10.4 Online music store Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms GameSpot Lossless data compression Sega Dreamcast ITunes CPU cache David Firth Nintendo Revolution Demoscene Digital single-lens reflex cameras System 7 (Macintosh) Nintendo Entertainment System Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Film Portable Document Format Thumbnail gallery post Grokster PlayStation 3 SuperGrafx Redundant array of independent disks Game demo Development stage
