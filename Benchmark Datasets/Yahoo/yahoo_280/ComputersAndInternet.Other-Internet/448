is it possible for porn sites to show up on a browser history without going to them at all there a ton of porn sites listed on my computer's internet history the last time i checked my husband denies visiting any i believe he didn't seek out each and every one of them but is it really possible that they all showed up without any of them being visited the browser history is a list of http requests made by the browser it doesn't record whether the page actually loaded why the request was made by typing in a url clicking on a link or by some automated mechanism within another webpage or whether the site was actually viewed there are a lot of schemes out there that will send a request to a url which will send back a redirect to another page or which will pull content from some other url into a frame somebody gets a nickel for each page that gets a hit and there are some nefarious websites that will attempt to open a new window anytime you try to close the window or leave the website pop up blockers and content monitors filters will stop most of this but the request may still get made and recorded there could also be spyware on the machine that is sending information to these sites rather than retrieving information from them finally it is possible that your computer has been infected with malware that runs in the background sending requests for these pages to inflate the website's hit count which enables the website to charge more for advertising i'd run a throurough virus scan and a throurough adware scan i think i'd also clear the history and watch what goes into it over a couple of days you may also want to check any browser add ons that you've installed many of them are infamous for doing things like this in the background Windows XP Uniform Resource Locator Kazaa Malware HTTP cookie Stopping e-mail abuse Proxy server E-mail spam Website Web browser Computer virus Pop-up ad Cross site scripting Search engine optimization Internet Explorer Comparison of web browsers Common Unix Printing System Web page Thumbnail gallery post Internet fraud Web crawler Mozilla Firefox Prank flash Peer-to-peer Domain Name System World Wide Web Macromedia Flash Gmail AOL Instant Messenger Typosquatting Web traffic Phishing User agent Denial-of-service attack Google search Opera (web browser) NPAPI Rootkit Trojan horse (computing) Blue screen of death Google HTML element Computer Wget Windows 2000 MDAC Mozilla Application Suite Online advertising Web design Netscape Navigator File Transfer Protocol Browser wars Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spamdexing Link spam Favicon Wiki Internet security Cache XHTML BitTorrent Wireless Application Protocol HTML HyperCard Konqueror SAML Microsoft Windows Aggregator Mac OS X Trusted computing GameFAQs Anti-virus software Host file Filename extension Computer forensics Network address translation Enterprise content management Slashdot trolling phenomena Federal Standard 1037C Apple Computer Ethernet Fritz-chip X Window System Ad filtering Uniform Resource Identifier The Internet Movie Database Portable Document Format
