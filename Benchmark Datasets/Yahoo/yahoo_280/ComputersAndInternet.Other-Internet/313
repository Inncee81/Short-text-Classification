when creating a website why does it appear different in ie than firefox so i created a pretty basic website for my company for a new add campaign html host ftp publish and you're done i've got one mp and pdfs linked on the site but here is my curiosity i created with nvu and published all while creating editing in mozilla firefox the site looks crisp and perfect in mozilla but when somebody opens the url in internet explorer the link sizes are all different the fonts are different sizes etc can somebody with experience shed some light on this for me i'm stumped thanks it is because forefox and ie are different programs and use different interpreters to read the web pages they treat some of the html commands differently when developing a page you always have to check it in both browsers and on multiple computers if you use a non standard font for example on you page and someone opens it on a computer that does not have the font ie will suptitute either arial or new times romans for the missing font changing the page there are simple javascript programs that you can download that will detect what browser a person is using then you can set your page so that if someone is using ie they are redirected to version of you web page designed to work best with ie if they are using firefox they are directed to a different version of the page oh and don't forget about opera or safari both which display pages differently also Mozilla Firefox Cascading Style Sheets User agent Opera (web browser) Mozilla Application Suite Web page Gmail Comparison of web browsers Gecko (layout engine) JavaScript Browser wars HTTP cookie Ajax (programming) International Phonetic Alphabet Portable Document Format Typeface HTML editor Unicode and HTML Ebook Web design Favicon XForms HTML Netscape Communications Corporation Mozilla Thunderbird NPAPI Mozilla Uniform Resource Locator Unicode Netscape Navigator Hyperlink World Wide Web Netscape Browser Website Internet Explorer for Mac Spyware Ruby character Stopping e-mail abuse Netscape Emacs Konqueror Scalable Vector Graphics Wiki Java programming language Domain Name System Forth programming language The Book of Mozilla Safari (web browser) Pop-up ad Neopets About: PostScript Web application OpenOffice.org Google search Tabbed document interface File Transfer Protocol Greasemonkey Windows XP HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP KHTML OmniWeb Wget GIF Konfabulator Arabic alphabet WYSIWYG Internationalized domain name Linspire Spamdexing XMLHTTP Link spam XSL Transformations Computer Apple typography TeX Common Unix Printing System Hexadecimal JADE programming language USB flash drive XHTML Markup language Blogger Web analytics Thumbnail gallery post Mouse (computing) Microsoft Office Rich Internet Application
