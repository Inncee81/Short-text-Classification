can you get scammed on ebay what if you pay with your credit card but they take more money than there suppose to i never used ebay and i was deciding to give ebay a try to look for affordable stuffs please and thanks it's definitely possible to get scammed on ebay never pay a seller by wire transfer my cousin was gonna buy a tractor trailer from a seller on ebay for the seller wanted him to transfer money to a swedish bank account using western union and my cousin did it and didn't consult me about it until after he sent the money i told him that sending a wire transfer to sweden was already suspicious enough and how scammers usually give fake addresses and phone numbers when making such transfers meaning they usually just take the money and run he freaked out and called western union to see if the transaction had gone through and miraculously enough he wrote his account number on the form wrong by one digit so he immediately canceled the transaction it's also preferrable you don't pay by check the safest way to pay for stuff on ebay is through paypal if you want your purchase delivered faster or by money order if you have the patience to wait an extra couple of weeks also beware of any e mails from ebay telling you that you violated their terms of service and that your account will be deleted they provide a link to a page that looks just like the ebay login page but it's meant to steal your information this happened to me once and i logged in only to be directed to another page that asked for my first last name credit card number and pin when i saw that they were asking for my pin i immediately put up a red flag reported this to ebay and was forced to change my password both on ebay and paypal it's also helpful to look at the seller's feedback score and read the feedback from buyers Advance fee fraud PayPal Confidence trick RuneScape cheats Neopets Bank fraud Surveillance Password Online shop MapleStory Credit card Short selling Mail fraud Live 8 Something Awful Forums Stopping e-mail abuse Electronic commerce Credit card fraud EFTPOS Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Electronic money Stock MMORPG Contract Mail-order bride Bulk vending Something Awful Identity theft E-mail spam Two-factor authentication Western Union Wheel of Fortune Gmail ITunes Music Store Enterprise content management E-mail Spam (electronic) Skype Auction The Star Wars Holiday Special Money United States Postal Service Debit card CPU cache Automatic teller machine GSM services Real estate broker Bank Poker jargon Microeconomics Make money fast Telephone numbering plan Fraud Modem Islamic banking Derivative (finance) Arbitrage Wal-Mart Supply and demand Business-to-consumer electronic commerce The Amazing Race E-gold Craps Telegraphy Schabir Shaik Trial Spyware Universal Serial Bus Direct marketing Neighbours Plame affair Capitalism Futures contract Autograph Knots Landing Annuity Buffer overflow Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind British national identity card Domain Name System Alfie Moon The Inside Driver's license Mail Amazon.com Insurance Data retention Security (finance) Mortgage Teletext
