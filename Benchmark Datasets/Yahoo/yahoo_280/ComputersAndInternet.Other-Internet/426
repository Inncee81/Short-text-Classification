what is going on with our bt broadband connection the internet light on our router keeps going out sometimes when the dsl light is flashing but also sometimes when the dsl light is on normally at these times the internet won't work and the only way to solve the problem is by switching the router off to reset it we have also noticed that our broadband connection is running slower we think it may be something to do with our phone line as there is sometimes interference on the line but have no idea what might be causing this as we pretty much eliminated everything that was connected is it just a coincidence that a bt engineer was working in the box up the road from us just before the problems began and if the problem is down to bt themselves and their equipment how do we prove it last time we had problems bt would not accept it could be their fault and instead preferred to try and blame our equipment and yet that problem suddenly righted itself without us doing anything would we be better off having cable broadband i have the exact same problem when the interference on my bt line is really bad i cannot connect to the internet we believe the problem is with the line not any of our equipment we have called bt and an engineer is booked to come out you should definitely phone bt and report this problem although if the engineer finds that the problem is with the equipment inside your house you will be charged about for the call out so check and double check all your filters etc before you call them Digital Subscriber Line Broadband Internet access Router Modem Embedded system Internet Cable television Voice over IP Telephone Telephone exchange Mach kernel Eircom Cisco Systems Power line communication Floppy disk Ethernet Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cable modem Oscilloscope Denial-of-service attack Integrated Services Digital Network Wi-Fi Satellite internet AT&T Broadband Skype Wireless LAN Public Switched Telephone Network Coaxial cable Phreaking Password HomePNA Global System for Mobile Communications IEEE 802.11 9-1-1 Residual-current device Alcatel Network address translation Universal Serial Bus Car handling High-voltage direct current Low-pass filter TGV Domain-specific programming language Nintendo DS Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor GSM services Fire alarm control panel MDAC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet censorship in mainland China New York City Subway nomenclature Federal Communications Commission WiMAX Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PowerPC Frame relay Bluetooth Private branch exchange Ground (electricity) Road-rule enforcement camera Safety engineering E85 IiNet Dialer Personal rapid transit Drag racing Nintendo Revolution Transformer Quality of service Syphon Filter Federal Standard 1037C USB flash drive Static inverter plant The Amazing Race Poker jargon Communications satellite M16 (rifle) Streaming media Computer and video games Uninterruptible power supply IP Multimedia Subsystem Jet engine Welding Routing Lag Border Gateway Protocol 2003 North America blackout Speed of light Dimmer Mobile phone Communications protocol Laserdisc Xbox Super Nintendo Entertainment System 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blue box
