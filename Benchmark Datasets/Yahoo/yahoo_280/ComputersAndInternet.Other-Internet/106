internet browser issues can anyone help alright at this point it seems i should just give up on the internet all together i've currently used internet explorer for the longest time now and i love firefox but recently both have been giving me nothing but trouble you can look at my previous browser related questions for more but basically firefox 's safe mode is giving me hell and it won't show on screen when i start it up but it still shows in the processes tab of task manager oh reinstalling doesn't do squat trust me and now internet explorer keeps freezing after a certain period of time and can't seem to handle more than one window for too long now maybe it's my pc maybe it's memory space issues i don't know what i want to know is what can i possibly do to clear some of these issues up without potentially destroying my computer i'm looking for any suggestions from people experienced with compters but anyone's free to answer thanks sorry that this is long and lengthy but i would suggest to print these out of save to a file copy and paste in notepad first and foremost these are my opinions and have experience several machines that had these on them as well as users using these product not to mention that i have ran each and every one of these myself so as to not confuse those that think that i have not my findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user also these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the manuals docs for what they download and or buy they just want to install and use stop using the following software avg avg has been known to report false positives also reports tracking cookies as trojan downloaders this is bad practice to me scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news anymore is about trojans worms and virus' maybe free but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this alone avoid it like the plaque ad aware se ad aware is a dangerous program if you do not know how to set it up although it comes with the basic 'normal' user settings those that go messing about will find after changing the settings will remove things from the windows system and then be stuck in a bad situation spybot search and destroy same as ad aware se ewido made by avg now although avg grisoft bought them out or merged which ever you avgt fanatics prefer this product does the same as their software av and scares the user see above avg mcafee system hog although

hog although this product is and has been around for decades it still isn't that great of a product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog also this product has to use it's own uninstaller to get
