is it legal for online store not allowing u to cancel your order ok i bought a arcade stick from estarland com and its the th week since i placed my order and they still havent shipped it yesterday i called them to cancel my order but they told me it can not be cancelled because it was custom made no where on the site has the policy saying you can not cancel orders on custom made items and then they changed their story also first saying they were behind then when i said i want to cancel they said it was already shipped out which i believe they still havent shipped out so is this legal if they gave you a number to call them i would call the police and ask them about the topic and give the police hteir number hey worst case you can't cancel it so you get the arcade stick but if they dont ever plan on shipping it the police can get involved America Online Something Awful Nintendo MAME Retailer Sega Electronic commerce Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Surveillance Whose Line Is It Anyway?
