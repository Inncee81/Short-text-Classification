wearing contacts i just got contacts and i'm wondering how long it really takes to get used to them and if anyone has tricks on getting them in and out it doesn't take but a few days to get used to them in your ye t takes a little longer to get better at putting them in i just got them weeks ago and i love them when you put them in i use my middle finger but u can use your pointer finger whatever make sure your eye is really open use your fingers to keep it open on both the top and the bottom make sure your contact is wet and make sure the finger tip of the finger that u put the contact on is wet kind of dip it in the solution that will help it not stay on your finger put it in then keep your eye open and look down and all around then blink a few times and if it still kind of blurry close you eye and kind of pat and rub your eyelid don't worry it takes a few days to get used to putting them in the first day it took me minutes to put them in i think taking them out is easier just look up put your finger on the contact move it down and use your thumb to kind of pick it up that takes practice but i find it easier make sure you have some rewetting eye drops with you all the time for the first week or so your eyes might get dry and thats not comfortable good luck and just keep trying it takes practice Aerial (dance move) Social rule Violin Knife Gesture Equine conformation Stereoscopy Volleyball Archery Diving suit Time Out of Mind Tenshinhan Textile manufacturing Chopsticks Salad Fingers Double bass Piccolo Junior Saga Contact lens Manicure Puppet The Shining (film) Mattress Milton H.
