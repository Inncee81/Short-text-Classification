question regarding contacts there are different kinds of it daily ones weekly ones weeks n so on lets say hypothetically that i have been using the weekly ones n i only put it in for a few hours everyday the week timeline is up but i don't throw them away n continue using them for a few more days or something what's going to happen in short my question is what's the reason for the timeline i do clean them before i put them in n after taking them off i also leave them in the solution which i change almost everyday i've got ocd so i kinda am really really clean when it comes to these kinda stuff am cautious the timeline is not for the company to get u to buy new contancts it's for ur protection the worst thing u could get is an eye infection it's painful and horrible to deal with it's ok to go over the timeline as long as u don't sleep in them or ignore the cleaning process proteins build up on the contacts like crazy and sometimes just soaking them in solution doesn't get everything out beside cleaning the contacts and changing the solution make sure that u wash the case while u are changing the solution and also change the case every once in a while Contact lens Social rule Theory of conduct Psoriasis Obsessive-compulsive disorder Milton H.
