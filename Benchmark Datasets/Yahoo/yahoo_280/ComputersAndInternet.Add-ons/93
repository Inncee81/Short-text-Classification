floppy disks they are all games and i would like to see if i want to play them they ask if i want to format the dick your operating system is prompting you to format the disk because it cannot detect any existing format one of a few things have happened either the disks have gone bad or the drive is not recognizing the correct disk type to read i am going to assume you are looking at disks first of all make sure that they are disks for a windows dos pc if the disks are for an apple macintosh you will not be able to read them properly in a pc if the disks have gone bad you may be able to try a disk recovery program like norton utilities to try to recover them the other thing that might happen is that your drive is not recognizing the disk size correctly depending on how old the disk are they may be one of three sizes k m or m most modern drives will recognize k and m the m format was used for a short period of time and then fell out of favor also if the disks are old and are k format sometimes the tracking gets off and the drive heads are no longer able to find the data there is a program available called spinright by steve gibson at www grc com that can also analyze most disk media and find out what is wrong hope this helps Floppy disk File Allocation Table Apple II family Redundant array of independent disks DOS File system Computer virus Disk formatting IBM PC compatible Data recovery MS-DOS Backup Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Disk image NeXT Commodore 64 Disk storage Disk magazine Atari 8-bit family USB flash drive Commodore DOS Commodore 1541 CP/M Embedded system File format Atari ST Data remanence Commodore International TRS-80 System 7 (Macintosh) Computer forensics Debugging Booting AmigaOS Partition (computing) Macintosh Finder Apple Computer Compact disc Pretty Good Privacy Virtual memory BIOS Disk operating system Norton Utilities Forth programming language Apple IIGS Library (computer science) Microsoft Early IBM disk storage Mac OS Punch card Hierarchical File System Blue screen of death Read-only memory IBM PC Timeline of computing 1990-forward History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Atari DOS Copy protection IPod Btrieve System/34 Newline Disk cloning Mouse (computing) MAME Personal computer Linux Macromedia Flash Windows XP System/36 Original Amiga chipset C programming language Cache Computer file System 6 Amiga ZX Spectrum Files-11 X86 DOS Comparison Master Control Program LiveCD ZIP (file format) IBM 1130 Zip drive Famicom Disk System Optimized Systems Software Quizbowl DBASE Timeline of computing Digital photography OS/2 DVD History of operating systems
