switching from normal to wireless router i was wondering if i have computers on one normal router would my internet be faster if i got a wireless router with the same speed mbps wireless connection is a good solution for laptops and where it is difficult to get a wire through wireless is slower less secure and less reliable if it is an option you are definitely better off with the wire Wireless LAN Router Wi-Fi Wireless access point Telegraphy Internet Voice over IP Modem Universal Serial Bus Ethernet Serial communications Wireless mesh network IEEE 802.11 Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Transmission Control Protocol AirPort PowerPC Nintendo Revolution Mobile ad-hoc network General Packet Radio Service Internet Group Management Protocol Floppy disk PlayStation 3 Routing Wardriving USB flash drive Local area network Juniper Networks Verizon Wireless Computer Windows XP Central processing unit Computer bus Communications protocol Telephone Network address translation Internet protocol suite Quality of service IPv4 Digital circuit Federal Standard 1037C Laptop 3Com Corporation HomePNA Covert listening device AppleTalk HyperTransport 9-1-1 Wireless Xbox Secure Digital card Denial-of-service attack Logic gate Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Internet security Streaming media Morse Code Lag MAC address Computer network Enhanced 911 Broadband Internet access Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Differentiated services Border Gateway Protocol Personal area network OpenBSD Embedded system U.S. Robotics Password Mobile phone Wireless Application Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode TGV IEEE 802.11i MIPS architecture Data General Nova Power line communication CPU design Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter Loudspeaker Global Positioning System Extensible Authentication Protocol PowerBook Apple Macintosh Wood router PCI Express WiMAX Microprocessor Radio Bell Labs LAN party Hewlett-Packard Redundant array of independent disks RC4 Open Shortest Path First
