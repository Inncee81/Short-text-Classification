why do married men live longer than single men and married women die sooner than single women hi jennyann that was a myth that began circulating back in the late ' s it comes around again from time to time there is a bit of truth to it though back in the s married men did live longer but there was a reason back then the men that didn't marry were usually handicapped somehow and even institutionalized and were not candidates for a full length life to begin with leave that portion of the study out and it gives the impression that 'you'd better get married' which was the mindset back then however with normal healthy males there is no difference with life span between married or not good question and i've waited for years to be able to explain this myth thx Prostate cancer Incarnations of Immortality Life expectancy Human penis size Abortion debate Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Divorce Michael Garibaldi Baldness Mental illness Joseph Campbell Gold standard Resurrection of Jesus Aida (musical) Puberty Bernard Williams Human height Arthur Schopenhauer Sexual intercourse Ethernet Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Alois Hitler Theory of conduct Claude L__vi-Strauss Abortion Rain Man Freeters Origin belief Graduate school Manx (cat) Normal distribution Dragons (Pern) Sex and intelligence Bigfoot Mythology Scientific method Beetle in an Anthill Lottie Dod Phaedo Opus Dei Bob and George CPU cache Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Clergy Pope Joan Theology Growth hormone treatment Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Ramakrishna Demographics of Japan One Tree Hill (TV series) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Discordianism Left-handed Breastfeeding Soul Menstrual cycle Mahjong Piccolo Junior Saga Spider Incest Joke Burkhard Heim Historicity of Jesus Haircut Human Central processing unit Quotation mark Golf Biology and sexual orientation Sleeping Murder 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Jennifer Lopez Inuit Creationism Go ranks and ratings Lex Luthor Nutrition History of science fiction Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Religious Society of Friends Mortimer Adler Infantilism Tropical year The Impressions (American band) Shogi Eastern Orthodox Church Computus Vlad III Dracula The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Meme Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Heir Apparent Redundant array of independent disks Jean-Jacques Rousseau EastEnders Rape
