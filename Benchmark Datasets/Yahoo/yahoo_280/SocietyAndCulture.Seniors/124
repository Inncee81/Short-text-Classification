senior parent wants to drive my son my mother is and lives with us she has her own car and drives to walmart to church and to get her hair done once a week honestly i don't feel safe with her driving but i don't want to humiliate her or take away her independence she is starting to make dangerous careless mistakes at home that just come with age it makes me very sad for her problem she wants to drive with my year old son my husband and i are both opposed but i do not want to hurt her feelings i need to clarify he is not allowed to ride with my mom we have worked around it and even said it isn't a good idea our whole point is everyone's safety is more important than her hurt feelings however she is my mom she has delicate feelings and i don't want to hurt them i am seeking advice on how to explain this in a way that she will get this is tough last year my aunt and my mother were in my aunt's car together my aunt was driving she was she made a careless mistake drifted off the road and plowed through the desert at mph according to my mother my aunt didn't seem to even realize she was off the road and had to be told repeatedly to stop the car they could've easily been killed had the car rolled two of my aunt's sons made the tough decision to take her license away my aunt did not like it but she eventually saw that it was the right thing to do my cousins made up for it by offering to drive her whenever she needed to go anyplace an inconvenience for them to be sure but it beats the hell out of getting a call from the police telling them their mother was killed in a car wreck my mother is and drives a lot she's still very active i worry about her behind the wheel especially when she has the grandkids with her so far she's still okay to be driving but i do sorta keep an eye on her time comes when she starts being a danger behind the wheel my brother and i will have to deal with it as my cousins did with their mother your son is your first and primary concern you don't say where you live but if there are taxis and or buses available your mother can still get around without having to drive herself if you don't feel comfortable letting your son ride with your mother while she's driving just explain it to her she won't like it and might even deny there's a reason for your concern but be firm and protect your son EastEnders Cindy Sheehan Shaggy dog story Melanie Wilkes Pitaten Sin City Knots Landing Bike lane debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Indianapolis 500 Wang Mang The Apprentice 2 Jam (TV series) Theory of conduct Road traffic accident Kodocha A Canticle for Leibowitz Mothers Against Drunk Driving Fathers' rights The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Driver's license Children of Dune Motorcycle W.I.T.C.H.
