how should the perfect headshot be i am clueless s o can anybody describe the perfect headshot as int pose size etc a standard headshot is x traditionally they are in black and white but the trend is now leaning heavily towards color your headshot should look like you not some glamazoned out airbrushed version if you get called in for an audition based on your headshot you need to be able to go in looking exactly like to you do in the photo therefore if you cut color your hair new headshots gain lose significant weight new headshots etc most actors have headshots a theatrical and a commerical a theatrical headshot is usually more serious with a closed mouth expression a commerical headshot is with an open mouthed smile and much more friendly the point of having different looks is to be able to submit to different projects that may require different types you don't really pose for headshots the way models pose for shoots you have a general position and usually change your expression more than anything else you want to convey personality and have that alive look in your eyes you don't have to be the most beautiful person to have a great headshot that makes an agent pause to look at it and think wow it is definiately not easy to get that perfect shot so it's important to find a good photographer that you feel comfortable with so that you don't look posed and aritficial and ideally you should get at least shots or rolls of film out of the session to choose from check out some of these well known photographers all in ny webites to get an idea of what a good headshot should look like http www kriscarrphotography com http robertkim com http ronrinaldi com http www starkstudio com http www jordanmatter com Sly & the Family Stone The Ashlee Simpson Show Music genre Bohemian Rhapsody The Velvet Underground Louie, Louie Rhythm and blues Pop music The Doors Hip hop music Rush (band) Rock (music) Rock and roll Love and Theft Heavy metal music Steely Dan The Kinks Rod Stewart Gary Glitter The Strokes Karaoke The Supremes Journey (band) Blues Empire Burlesque Robert Palmer (British singer) Joni Mitchell Noel Gallagher Funk Music history of the United States Southern rock Please Please Me R.E.M.
