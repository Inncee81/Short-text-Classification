anyone please anyone that became an actress or model please tell me how u broke into the business and tell me what agency u chose thankss any auditions u know of here's my advice no matter your age you need support from your family and friends if you're under age you absolutely need to have the full support of your family because they not only need to sign off on your contracts and be your advocate be fully aware of all child labor laws and help uphold them while you're on set but they need to drive you to all your auditions and stay on set with you at all times or hire someone to be there with you the next thing you need is training if you're not already you need to get into classes asap acting classes voice lessons and dance classes then you need to get involved in theatre get a few roles on your resume then start trying for some student films and independents info to follow most agents will not consider you unless you have training and credits when you've accomplished the above and you want to find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film go to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages as for which afgent when you're new you don't usually get to be picky you do the mailing and see who's even interested if you get more than one bite from your mailing meet with them and see who you have the best rapport with once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying fyi in my opinion for tv film acting the place to go is la and for modeling it's ny all the way for modeling info start here http www fordmodels com main cfm click on global scouting http www elitemodel com
