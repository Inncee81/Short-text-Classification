feminism in hamlet i'm doing a seminar on feminism within hamlet i'm about to start reading all the parts where gertrude and ophelia are in the scene but does anyone know any starters e g basic ideas about feminism within the play i've googled but it only brings up pay to view essays which aren't much help atm i must qualify everything i am about to say by admitting that i am no great student of hamlet or shakespeare college course performance which is nothing but here are some ideas focus on how polonius interacts with laertes as compared to ophelia she is reified by polonius her chastity a commodity to be bartered hamlet's love for her a bargaining chip meanwhile polonius's p level of discourse with laertes l is heightened in specific the advice scene to thine own self be true advice is a huge theme in general follow the advice p and l give to ophelia o p manipulates his son too but in a way that allows l more dignity than o i think you'd want to focus on the scene where hamlet and ophelia meet after the to be soliloquy the one were claudius and polonius are secretly watching and hamlet does his whole to a nunnery with you spiel certainly the theme of sexual mores and the nature of gender its performance are an important part of the scene and shakespeare's work at large i may be totally off but i found the scene to be about the objectification of women at least in part if thou dost marry says hamlet to o i'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell women stir passions in men that make them do evil things probably over simplification i am trying to figure out the most important feminist aspect of gertrude it's one of the things that doesn't come right off the page and is left to interpretation in the performance i saw she is played as an over sexed ninny but i really thought that was crappy this is again an oversimplification but i'd look at the double standard without getting into the whole oedipal thing hamlet resents his mother's practicality doing something so politically comfortable something so potentially sexually gratifying i found gert to be doing what she had to in order to survive but just as easily one can interpret her sexual desire for claudius and for this hamlet finds her a traitorous whore i am probably missing something huge but that's what came to mind at first i hope it helps here is a good website there are plenty like it http www shakespeare online com Shakespeare on screen Ten Commandments Sexual abstinence Macbeth David and Jonathan Mary, the mother of Jesus William Shakespeare Feminism Matthew 5 Medea (play) Sexual orientation Laertes (character) Iago Virgin Mary in Islam Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Merit King Claudius Shakespeare's reputation Gender role The Lion King Shakespeare's sonnets Tragic hero Economics Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead Objectivist philosophy Homosexuality Reduced Shakespeare Company Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Dunciad Tales from the Public Domain Homosexuality and Islam Gender-neutral language Misogyny Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Sexual revolution A Course In Miracles Amidah The Merchant of Venice Jewish ethics Original sin Sola fide The Sound and the Fury Blackadder Profanity Hamlet (1996 film) Shakespearean authorship Israel ben Eliezer Pornography Marriage In Memoriam A.H.H.
