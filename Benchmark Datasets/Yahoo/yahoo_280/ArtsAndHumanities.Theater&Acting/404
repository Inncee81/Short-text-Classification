broadway style birthday party ideas do you have any you've gotten some great ideas choose broadway in general a specific show a time period or even a specific composer sondheim anyone whatever floats your boat i think a fun game to play would be to stick names of characters from one show or many depending on your eventual theme on each person's back and they have to go around and ask each other yes or no questions about who they are if not all of your guests are into musical theatre put out some in your face clues to help them out like maybe headshots with character facts on the back karaoke of course you could hire a dj or rent a machine with music to go with it maybe you could also play name that tune with show tunes try to choose some in advance that the guests will know you can also do 'best impersonation or interpretation of a character' and those brave enough will have to perform for the group the cake can be done to look like a record or themed like a scene from her favorite musical or like curtains on stage with spotlights etc use your imagination i drew up what i wanted on my daughter's cake and the bakery at the grocery store copied it if you want writing that may infringe on copyright do it yourself after you pick it up but leave the airbrushing of tiny hairpsray cans to the pros if you get my drift your daughter's thank you can be a bit elaborate and you can make a mini scrapbook 'program' with bios and 'cast photos' which would be their keepsake she could also include a handwritten thank you for thei attendance and gift of course ala when an understudy is replacing a main performer you would use photos from the dress up props you had for the party including a tracy turnblad wig or whatever you chose to have that went with your theme kids will do anything when hamming it up for pictures we had straight boys putting on feather boas no lie have fun William Wordsworth William Shakespeare British literature Samuel Taylor Coleridge Shakespearean authorship Playwright Sonnet Irish theatre Romanticism Ben Jonson John Dryden Shakespeare in Love Shakespeare's reputation English poetry William Hazlitt Culture of the United Kingdom Elizabethan theatre William Butler Yeats Irish literature Sanskrit literature English literature English drama History of literature Dorothy Wordsworth Poet Laureate Lake District Poets' Corner Thomas Middleton Kannada literature Samuel Beckett Thomas de Quincey Poetry of the United States English Renaissance Tom Stoppard Writer King James Version of the Bible Ghostwriter Play William Davenant Poetry Robertson Davies Shakespeare's sonnets Samuil Marshak Augustan drama Colley Cibber Hans Christian Andersen Henry Purcell Oscar Wilde Literature Literature of the United States Michael Drayton Stratford-upon-Avon Newcastle upon Tyne Wallace Stevens Lyric poetry London Borough of Southwark Louis Zukofsky Julius Caesar (play) John Fletcher (playwright) Augustan poetry Shakespeare on screen Shakespeare Apocrypha Robert Browning The Golden Ass Adam Mickiewicz Writers' Guild of Great Britain Blank verse Langston Hughes African American literature Yiddish theatre Stratford Festival of Canada Walter de la Mare William Congreve (playwright) Du Fu Wole Soyinka Modernist poetry in English 19th century W.
