i'm in great need of advice please help hi im and i am not happy with my life rite now i have dreams to become an actor but the problem is i live in newbedford ma wich is a pretty small place not known at all and a bad place to get started in the business theres no acting schools near and no agencies also my parents dont support me at all im at the point where i just want to runaway and just go somewehre else so i was thinkin of asking them to let me move to california for about a year or so cuz i have family ova thea and california would be a great opportunity i doubt they'll let me becuz of school but school is rly holdin me back i just want to get started already im jus hopin that if i do my family over there will support me so any advice on what to do how to approach them about this i am willing to do anything it takes even if i have to go live with a random family that will support me well im not actually going to run away i jus get that feeling at time ya know first of all do not even think of running away to california to try and become an actor theres a reason why there are slums in hollywood where people end up after being too poor trying to fufill their fantasy to becoming an actor it takes an incredible amount of talent and luck to become one you are still young at you probably think from watching movies and stuff that if you go to acting school and get an agent you can land a gig easily but its not that simple i'm not trying to discourage you to become an actor but maybe right now try and finish school and maybe after high school you could convince your parents to enroll you into an arts college and pursue acting start out small to show that you are really commited and want to be an actor i highly doubt that even in a small town like newbedford there aren't any acting schools or even clubs you can join to starts acting develop your skills right now and maybe after you finish high school you could travel out to california and get your big break Shakespeare on screen William Shakespeare Macbeth of Scotland Macbeth (opera) Tragedy Macbeth Mark Rylance Orson Welles William Davenant Shakespeare's reputation BBC Television Shakespeare British monarchy Thomas Middleton Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford English poetry Tragic hero Royal Shakespeare Company English literature Ian McKellen Tom Stoppard Macbeth (1971 film) Giuseppe Verdi Familiar spirit Elizabethan theatre Something Wicked this Way Comes Drama Richard III (play) The Super Dimension Fortress Macross Judi Dench William Topaz McGonagall Eug__ne Ionesco History of Scotland 17th century in literature English drama Restoration spectacular As You Like It Crime fiction Romeo and Juliet Harvard Classics Henry V (play) Norns Troilus and Cressida Sonnet Hallmark Hall of Fame Ben Jonson The Tempest (play) Shakespeare in Love Throne of Blood Shakespearean tragedy Thomas de Quincey John Fletcher (playwright) English Renaissance Henry VI, part 1 Theatre technique Dramaturgy Edmund Kean Ghost Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera) William Lilye Jean-Fran__ois Ducis Education in Taiwan Revenge play Julius Caesar (play) High school Judith Anderson Juliet Sarah Bernhardt Over the Edge (Zimbabwe) Graduate school Globe Theatre Anatomy of Criticism House of Alpin John Steinbeck William Empson Scotch Rugby School References in Star Trek Royal Opera House Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in South Korea Parody Henry Neville John Webster Philosophy of history The Lion King Hunter College High School William Charles Macready Roman Polanski Thain Coriolanus (play) Boris Godunov (opera) Story within a story Duncan I of Scotland Inverness Hector Boece Thegn 10 Things I Hate About You Early Modern English John Philip Kemble Stewarton
