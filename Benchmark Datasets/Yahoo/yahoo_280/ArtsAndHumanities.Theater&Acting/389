this isnt a scam because i have a friend in it who is doing well they do not ask for upfront money and its a agent search i am confident it is not a scam so can you please just tell me audition tips not lectures thank you i am very knowledgeable about scams and about this business just not auditions meeting with a talent agent by tony martinez talent agent congratulations you did it you managed to get my attention and i've agreed to take a meeting that means you get one shot to convince me that my career as an agent cannot continue unless your name is on my list the process is simple first i always meet one on one with potential clients this gives me a chance to really get to know the person if that goes well i ask the actor to come back and meet the other agents it's essential that everyone be in agreement one agent should never try to convince the others to sign someone and that's basically it the only problem is actors tend to be their own worst enemy believe it or not actors seeking representation are always convincing me not to sign them pretty depressing right i'm always amazed by how much effort actors put into getting a meeting with me but none of you ever know how to behave once you're actually in my office before we tackle this subject let's make something clear i want to like you it's my job to sign actors and if you're sitting in my office that means you did something right maybe i noticed your submission maybe someone referred you or maybe i saw your work in a showcase whatever it was something positive happened to get your butt into that chair so don't turn a positive into a negative you've got minutes to make an impression that's seconds you have to use that time wisely so how should you behave in my office well think of it this way meeting with an agent is like a first date you've got two people in a room they're sizing each other up and they're both wondering if it's going to go any further now ask yourself this what's the worst thing you can do on a first date answer talk about yourself there's nothing worse than being stuck on a date with someone who spends the whole night going on and on about themselves it's the same thing in a meeting i tend to tune out actors who waste their time by doing a non stop monologue about who they are and what they want so don't play into the stereotype of the narcissistic self involved actor it's dull it's boring and worst of all it doesn't give me a chance to really get to know you instead walk into that office and create an atmosphere where you can both get to know each other as people i have to forget that you're an actor seeking representation that's boring instead i need to see you as an individual i have to get a sense of who you really are outside the world of show business how do you do this easy try to have a normal conversation maybe there's something in my office that catches your eye or maybe you just saw a great movie whatever the idea is to get into a give and take situation where you're talking about anything but acting this will give me a chance to get to know the real you i once met with a young lady who had tarot card reader listed on her resume under special skills it just so happens that i love anything having to do with the occult so we started talking about it and the next thing you know we're both sitting on the floor and she's giving me a reading as a result we really got to know each other and i ended up representing her for many years now that's what i call a good meeting remember it's easy for an agent to pass on an actor seeking representation we do it every day but saying no becomes just a little bit harder when we've spent minutes getting to know you as a human being and that might just be enough to get you signed as a client Anne Murray
