is there anyway to get into acting proffesionally im almost and was wondering if it is possible to make it into movie acting an still study my years in university you can but it's a hard balance to maintain at this piont i would highly recommend checking into your university's and neighboring u's film schools to see if students can make use of your talents for their films you'll gain lots of good experence working in vastly differing environments good and bad and you may get good stuff for your reel your education is important so i wouldn't bail on that you do have summer though and if you're lucky you could find an agent who would respect that and keep you on hold while you are in school the problem would be if you booked a series or something anyway cross that bridge if when you come to it if you have the training and credits to back yourself up and you want to pursue getting an agent you can find a legitimate agent to represent you for commercials tv film by going to sag org use the dropdown menu on the right labeled 'resources' and choose 'agent information' on the next screen on the left choose 'find a sag franchised agent' and follow the directions you can look up agents all over the us but there are higher concentrations where the work is los angeles ny il fl ga etc another great resource is ross reports especially because they update their info so often but not all of the agents they list are sag and you have to pay for the list that doesn t mean they re not legit but that s why i always tell people to start with the sag list it s free and those agents have signed an agreement to put the actor first www rossreports com if you subscribe to backstage com you can get a combo subscription which can come in handy but can also get quite expensive then you can send the agencies your headshot resume and a cover letter stating that you are seeking representation and wait to see if they call you in for an interview you never call the agencies directly that is a big no no at least it is in la please remember that reputable agents take exactly of your pay after they help you get a job not one cent more and not one cent before anything else is a scam this is strictly for talent agents not modeling agents or talent managers who take different percentages once you have an agent they will get you the auditions but until then you can check out actorsaccess com you can also see if your state has a film alliance commission society or whatever your state calls theirs some have more than one sometimes they post audition information for projects filming locally for theatre and other auditions on backstage you can go to backstage com or www actorsequity com click on casting call if you find the audition on the equity site you still may be able to go as long as their not taking appointments from equity actor's only on backstage com you have to pay to get all of the info but the initial search is free and you may be able to see enough info to find out the rest on your own without paying these websites also have listings for student films and going without an agent means choosing your own schedule which may be more ideal for a student good luck Internet fraud Slot machine Modelling agency Unemployment Economics Advance fee fraud Education in the People's Republic of China MMORPG Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Financial audit Plame affair Professional wrestling slang Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Divorce Scientology beliefs and practices National Football League Web crawler Search engine optimization Domain Name System Cable television Enterprise content management Microeconomics Advertising Principal-agent problem The Jackson 5 Film Graduate school World Wide Web Student loan Theory of conduct United States Postal Service Credit card Tax X Window System Screenwriting Call centre Education in the United States E-mail spam Nuclear power Education Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Karl Rove Child support Publicly funded medicine Secretar__a de Inteligencia Education in Germany Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Legal research Digital rights management American Football League Free trade Charmed Mutual fund Lloyd's of London Airline AmigaOS The Standard Mattress MapleStory Meat Loaf Teletext Primerica Financial Services Education in Portugal Pump It Up Capitalism Israeli Arab RuneScape Voice actor Annuity Betting (poker) Notary public A Course In Miracles Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Charter school Social Security (United States) Password Windows XP Database management system Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Movie projector Salary cap Finance 2005 Kashmir earthquake
