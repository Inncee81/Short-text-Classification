anyone have any thoughts on this i think it's perfectly normal for a young kid to think they can grow up to be famous but most of the kids who post questions here want to be famous now imo that's another matter altogether that's seems a bit sick to me especially when a kid gets lots of answers explaining why it's not realistic and then asks the same question over and over the first time it can be chalked up to naivette after that there's no excuse dumb adults invariably started out as dumb kids i know plenty of adults who try and fail time and time again to get rich it never occurs to them they don't have what it takes and they never will they live in a state of perpetual disappointment it's normal and healthy to fantasize and lots of the kids who post here will get over the idea fast but i think there are plenty of kids on here who are flat out delusional and will grow up to be the same way any thoughts ok well st i understand that you are directing the question to me who always asks so what if you think im dumb and ill never be what i want to i dont care because its my life and i know i have what it takes that sir is my thought towards your question Photography Screen Actors Guild Digital photography Cheating in Counter-Strike Modelling agency Mutual fund MMORPG Child pornography Final Fantasy XI All My Children Mattress MapleStory Craps Copyright law of the United Kingdom Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Film Money supply Computer Stereoscopy Voice actor Real estate broker Capital accumulation Geographic information system Traditional animation Nintendo GameCube Copyleft Inflation Neopets Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Annuity Roman currency Screenplay Paintball Nude celebrities on the Internet Poker jargon Brassiere Screenwriting United States Postal Service Social rule Unemployment Public transport Marilyn Monroe Contract GunBound Monopoly (game) Karen McDougal Marlon Brando Drawing Academic publishing Hitman (computer game) Personality psychology Labour economics Labor theory of value Prostate cancer Cinematography Grade (education) Electronic commerce Diablo II Cancer Independent Media Center Upholstery Economy of the United States Motion picture rating system Ragnarok Online Open access Counter-Strike Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alexander Technique Common Lisp Volkswagen Type 2 Public policy Casting Deus Ex: Invisible War National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Publishing Advance fee fraud Pyramid scheme Expert system Slot machine Asperger syndrome Archery Call centre John Lott Minor league baseball Economics Software engineering Outsourcing Trailer Park Boys
