pro choice or pro life and why and stem cell research i don't want religious answers that don't provide a valid back up argument other than god says you shouldn't not a valid argument an early blastocyst fetus stage does not feel any pain as it does not have a nervous system hence you are not causing it any physical pain also it only has the beginning of a brain hence will not show any neurological activity making it for all sense and purpose brain dead its not thinking yet questions to think about what if the woman had been raped against her will what if carrying the child to term will have long lasting negative physical and mental effects on the 'mother' etc stem cells want a valid reason if you are against or for facts to think about again the phase that the embryo is in does not have any neural cells hence no brain and no pain over aborted fetuses blastocysts are flushed down the toilet they could be put to better use if you're gonna kill them any way some of the points i have stated in the details refer to only my personal opinions on these issues i posted the questions in order to get a greater understanding of what the general public thinks i will not be attacking peoples answers i will read them and form my own private opinion as to whether they coincide with my own beliefs if a point is made against my views but with such conviction and 'valid' argument then i will be forced to question my own opinions and possibly change them as well please do not take this as me speaking for all those in any group i think that you are missing the point that most pro life and pro choice are looking at the question from completely different life perspectives for a person who is pro life for religous reasons it is not as simple as god says it is wrong for them they have a relationship with god that is as real to them as any relationship you have with someone to them god is not some abstraction in addition they view life as beginning at conception regardless of any court ruling they view that child potential child if you prefer as a gift of god even if the event that created it was as awful as abuse or rape since they view it as a life they view abortion as a murder you can discuss from a strictly scientific and detached view forever and it will not change their views because it is based strictly on their moral code since you cannot agree on that beginning there is no way to come to a concensus at the end since i am not pro choice i am not much good at arguing their perspective one thing i have never understood was the argument that it is her body and therefore her choice good analogies are hard to come by but this is as close as i can come if an unmarried couple buys a car from funds that they both contributed but they can only title it in one name does that give the person on the title the right to destroy it because they decide they don't want it does the individual not on the title have a right to have a voice in the decision moving on to the point that the fetus is not a person at conception who has determined when that fetus has developed to the point of personhood it has to be prior to birth using your pain measurement there has to be a point at which it experiences pain and other sensations how do we scientifically determine when that point is rather than use something arbitrary like nd trimester is ok but rd trimester is not even if we could determine when would it not be a range with some earlier and some later on the subject of rape and abuse is the wrong for some of us anyway of killing a fetus justified by the wrong of the abuse can wrongs make a right as for stem cells i guess that those who believe that abortion is wrong don't want stem cell research used as a reason to encourage abortions one thing i will say to those who are pro life on religious or moral grounds you cannot be anti abortion on the grounds that it is murder and commit or endorse violence or murder towards abortion providers Goodness and value theory Birth control Evil Partial-birth abortion Determinism Religion Human nature Peter Singer Death Scientology beliefs and practices Pro-choice Utilitarianism Intelligent design Predestination Morality God Ten Commandments Appeal Hypnosis Capital punishment Objectivist philosophy Atheism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Coercion Homophobia Human cloning Domestic violence Reparative therapy Ontological argument Meaning of life Democracy Zoophilia Simone Weil Falsifiability The nature of God in Western theology Lawrence v.
