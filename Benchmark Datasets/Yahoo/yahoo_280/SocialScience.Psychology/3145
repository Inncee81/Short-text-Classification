why do 'variables' exist and are they not mans worst enemies when it comes to progress why can't we as humans be able to work out all the angles or possibilities of a problem and then come up with the answer why do we mostly always fail to consider some variables which allow or ensure failure is this due to our juvenile thinking as humans meaning we still have not operating anywhere close to our comlete potentials or is it quite simply that as humans we are prone to external influences which we quite simply could not comprehend due to the sheer extreme possibilties that can exist at any one time or for any one situation 'variables' should be considered 'mans' worst enemies when it comes to progress don't you think will man ever work out a system where problem solving will become easier since we will be in a position in our time when we will be able to work with all the possible facts until we can monitor every particule and every wave around us there will still be variables one man's control is another man's lack of freedom Psychology Quantum mechanics Theodicy Expert system Fermi paradox Determinism Planetary orbit Keynesian economics Year 2000 problem Economics Human Randomness Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Entropy Free will Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Second language acquisition Ethernet Democracy Extreme Programming Capitalism The Book of Five Rings Microeconomics Derivative Abortion debate Normal distribution Polynomial Complexity classes P and NP General relativity Infinity Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Radical behaviorism IBM PC compatible Lisp programming language Artificial neural network Technology Historical materialism Quantum computer Evil Boolean satisfiability problem Quicksort Seismic retrofit Leadership Epistemology Dog Color Bell test experiments David Bohm Ontological argument Air safety Debugging Loudspeaker Halting problem Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) The nature of God in Western theology Torture IP (complexity) Linear programming The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Gravity NP-complete Supersonic transport Galactic Civilizations Variable C programming language Theory of conduct Cheating in Counter-Strike Welding Tank Dyslexia Many-worlds interpretation Objective-C Luminiferous aether Speed of light Insulin Carburetor Landing at Anzac Cove Risk Mach kernel Surplus product Mathematics Linked list Axiom Simone Weil Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Bell's theorem Proportional representation Karl Marx Hubble Space Telescope Sexual orientation Chess strategy and tactics Uncertainty principle Control theory Ontology (computer science) Parallax Intelligent design Exact solutions in general relativity Collision detection Reverse mathematics
