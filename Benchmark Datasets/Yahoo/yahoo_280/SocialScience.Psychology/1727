would smart people realize their own intelligence would dumb people realize their own stupidity if you believe you were dumb or if you believe you were smart how does that reflect on your intelligence why or is it just a reflection of personality i think a truly smart person realizes that there is always more to learn so smart is a relative term that can only be truly understood on a personal level for instance centuries ago a person who was literate was considered smart now someone who can't read is considered dumb intelligence also has a lot to do with how and where one was raised as well it is more difficult for an ethiopian to become a doctor than it is for a filthy ass rich boy to become a doctor based on the monetary obstacles let me also add that i am a senior studying mechanical engineering and i do not consider myself to be smart nor do i consider myself to be dumb i do have a friend who got hit by a truck went through a windshield and started doing hardcore drugs at the age of eleven and i am sorry to say it but he is dumb and he considers himself to be dumb however he is a golf prodigy anyone who believes they are smart but are not will be in for a rude awakening as the years pass most people who believe they are dumb are actually just humble and may be the smartest and wisest people so in conclusion i believe the true dumb people are those who have natural gifts but are too lazy or afraid to use them the true smart people are those who use what they have been given to the fullest extent Kim Possible Erwin Rommel Link (Legend of Zelda) A Course In Miracles Expert system Economic inequality Recurring South Park characters Gifted Plame affair Socrates Korean language Motivation One Tree Hill (TV series) Lee Harvey Oswald Creationism Married... with Children Dumb & Dumber Knight Rider Ludwig Wittgenstein Surveillance Amharic language African American Vernacular English The Fairly OddParents Sin City The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sydney Riot of 1879 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theodicy Alcoholics Anonymous Meaning of life Out-of-body experience Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Victor Cousin Scientific method Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Graduate school Annuity Shaggy dog story Robot Gender role Aikido Characters in the Smurfs Logic Care Bears Creatures in Bionicle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hatake Kakashi Intelligence (trait) Computer vision Child prodigy The Catcher in the Rye Chinese language Simone Weil Eddie Guerrero Wario Shit Nature versus nurture Human Dilbert Lou Gehrig Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Occam's Razor Groupthink Bah__'__ Faith and Science Milton H.
