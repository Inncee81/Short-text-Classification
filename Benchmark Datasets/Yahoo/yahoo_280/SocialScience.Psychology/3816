help any experts or psychics pls read our lecturer mind the sake of the entire class a libra guy lecturer in s enjoys tapping girls on their head shoulder when he feels she is good at the sametime he used to knock on girls head poke their shoulders he said that is make sure she is listening to him he could praise a girl so well suddenly give some sarcartics remarks her he often treats girls better than boys like as thought he is flirting with them but he says he is just being nice he is always showing exaggerate body language even when he smile talk like he is trying to get attention he tend to stare at us with a very cold expression less look when he is waiting an ans from his students we all know that he is absolute normal in his mentality but what is this guy lecturer thinking why is he behaving like this from the view of a psychologist what is his motive we believe there must be a reason why he did all this anyone pls help this male lecturer will sometimes pops out love question during class lessons he did ask one of a girl in class about what is love sometimes he likes to say something disgusting to the class and makes our day wanting to puke yes we will send a complain letter to the lecturer deparment later but first we just need to know what he is thinking what's his motive before we really send him away pls ans the question ok thanks for your answers i felt that i had describe him in a very negative way that's why u mis understands him came to think of it he is not that bad actually sorry to say that i have read at internet before that if someone taps your head gently it means that they like you from the bottom of their heart we all don't feel that he is that scary and domineering because he still do care for us and he did help us quite a lot in our projects sometimes tells jokes during lessons too we think probably he is just being unable to control his emotions sometimes thats why he tend to split out those sarcartics words that he shuldn't most probably that's his strategy of teaching because he often says that students from other classes is trying to challenge him and we can see that he is tired to teach sometimes i dunno if he has any unhappy memories from his past relationships i only know that he talks to us almost everything in class himself his home his pets his family even the worst unnesessary things but the only thing he has never mention to us was his woman can't understand if you loves someone you will want to talk about her all the time right complain about him to the head of the department i think he is on a big power trip edit i think he's just a manipulative b stard who is getting off on his control of all these young girls and boys not saying you are young just thinking how he sees it i also think that he is probably thinking you are all in awe of him and find him impressive it's not unusual for a lecturer to be idolised by his students and i think he is thinking he has the makings of a very influential mentor it's all about control he thinks he can and is controlling you all he's manipulative and also a fantasist but please keep in mind i can only go by your description of him you might be missing out vital information that you haven't noticed possibly try to see him on his own ask a question after class or watch him when he's alone if he drops the act then it might just be a teaching strategy he has picked up to give himself confidence if he doesn't drop the act then i think he has an exaggerated sense of self importance if you do complain then make sure you are only mentioning the things he does and don't say nasty things about him if you make your statements in a calm rational way they are more likely to be respected and dealt with good luck Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
