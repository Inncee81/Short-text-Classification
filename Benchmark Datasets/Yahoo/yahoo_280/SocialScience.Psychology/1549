help i want to make like peter pan and run back to neverland lately the imminent entrace into adulthood and the real world is really scaring me i'm avoiding getting my license and doing other adult things that i should be doing at my age b c it makes the idea of becoming an adult that much more real and i am just so afraid of growing up i'm not fully embracing what it is to be an adult it's so simple when you're a child the blacks and whites people to care for you no pressures etc this is probably really unhealthy and i know i should stop taking steps back but i'm so afraid of failure and not being able to assimilate that i'm trying to recoil back into childhood blankets and all and yes especially failure that's my biggest fear of all what should i do thanks i have a job and i'm in university and all that but i haven't been pulling my weight b c i don't feel like i can keep it up and succeed so i kind of just hide in a tiny corner sometimes and think about what a failure i'll become in the future i've spent a lot of time watching a mudnest full of barn swallows out my den window they have a couple of batches of chicks each spring and early summer you know there are always some eager beavers who sit on the edge of the nest too early before they are ready to fly these brave hearts often fall out that's when i get my extension ladder and stick them back in the nest eventually they either fall out again or fly there is always one or two of the batch who lag back these are the shy ones they never sit on the edge of the nest in fact rarely even look over the edge the mom and pop barn swallows contiue to feed these laggers even though they are fully feathered and capable of flying and hunting bugs on their own but they don't they just sit there enjoying all the comforts of childhood letting mom and dad work their tail feathers off catching food for this now monstrous baby you may not know but barn swallows don't foul their nest when they have to go they hang their back side over the edge and let it fly this suits the recalcitrant laggers very much because they don't have to look at the wider world out there but mom and pop though patient are pretty smart too they make repeated trips all day long bringing food to this big baby pooper on one of these trips when the lagger has it all hanging out over the edge either mom or pop returns from a bug hunting trip and accidently bumps the preoccupied baby a little oops over the side he she goes mom or pop sits on the edge of the mud nest and watches it seems to me they have a grin on their beak but i can't be sure of this suddenly baby lagger finds out it can fly and it does so brilliantly barn swallows are extremely fast flyers and very agile and very community oriented it is difficult to try to track one when they swarm in endless circles which seem to me to be no more than 'catch me if you can' barn swallow games the laggers find out they are just as capable of surviving and overcoming their fears as any of the other barn swallows i've never seen a bumped baby return to the nest after it has gotten the old parent heave ho the moral i don't guess there is one i just like to watch barn swallows i guess if there's any moral it's be careful when you go to the bathroom there may be another moral here but i can't quite put my finger on it Shaggy dog story Milton H.
