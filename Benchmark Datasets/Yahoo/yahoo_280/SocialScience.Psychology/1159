why do we still cling to our authorative and morbid ways we have emotions we have the ability to love feel sad for one another and take care of one another but why do they always clash with our old and morbid ways that were used often way back during the stone age why do we still cling to them humanity is trying so hard to escape the bloody horrific years of the distant past but we are doing it all wrong its all because our emotions conflict with our old ways of resolution and thinking if we could have abandon our competetive pridefull un caring and destructive ways long ago then mabye we would be living in a much much more peacefull world tell me why can't people just abandon the old ways some of us have why can't the rest of humanity do the same and i'm years old this is an excellent question a couple factors are at play even though we have advanced brains most humans don't use it very well we have the language based logic side of our brain but many people don't develop their language and logic skills to a very high degree instead they allow emotional and instinctive reactions rule their decision making much to their later regret this failure to achieve balanced thinking applies to religion too because of the need to believe there is life after death billions of people devote themselves emotionally to a particular religion which often embraces polarization from other people who don't believe the same way and justifying violence and war to promote the faith it's crazy but a huge portion of the population is caught up in this it turns out that in spite of our technological advances we still live in primitive times but take heart even so these may be the good old days we haven't completely destroyed the climate air oceans water and food chain yet you can still enjoy birds and sunsets Human Emotion Ethics Abortion debate Theodicy Anarcho-primitivism Religion Force (Star Wars) Evil Simone Weil Stroke Love War Happiness Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John Howard Yoder Sigmund Freud Consensus decision-making Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Asperger syndrome Speciesism Theory of conduct Social psychology Urantia Darth Vader Epistemology Meaning of life Pacifism Narcissism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Neuro-linguistic programming Cognitive science Homophobia Soul Meme Mind control Arab-Israeli conflict Time Out of Mind Altruism Liberalism Nicomachean Ethics Six-Day War T'Pol Mahatma Gandhi Religious pluralism Scientology Deluge (mythology) God Emperor of Dune Motivation Divorce Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Death Decision making Stone Age Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Second language acquisition Human nature Theory of multiple intelligences Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Civilization W.
